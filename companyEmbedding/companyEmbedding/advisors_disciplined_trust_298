Unit Investment Trusts (UITs) are sold only by prospectus. Investors should read the prospectus carefully before investing which contains a detailed explanation of the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Investors should consult their accounting, legal, or tax advisor.


* Information labeled “Fee-Based Account” provides information pertaining to units purchased through registered investment advisers, certified financial planners or registered broker-dealers who in each case either charge investor accounts periodic fees for brokerage services, financial planning, investment advisory or asset management services, or provide such services in connection with an investment account for which a comprehensive “wrap fee” charge is imposed. You should consult your financial advisor to determine whether you can benefit from these accounts and whether your unit purchases are eligible for this discount. To purchase units in these accounts, your financial advisor must purchase units designated with one of the Fee Account CUSIP numbers, if available. The amounts shown are different from what would be applicable for units purchased in other accounts (i.e. “Commission-Based Accounts”) not eligible for this discount.  See your prospectus and consult your financial advisor for more information about eligibility and applicability of the Fee-Based Account discount.

We will be distinguishable by the personal relationships we build with our clients, truly listening to and understanding their financial goals and objectives.


Right around the midpoint in life, humans tend to learn that if you make a decision in an emotional state of mind, you have a great chance of making the wrong choice.  Among the most damaging emotions of all are greed and fear.


Fortunately, life experience serves you well and success is achieved in family and in business.  This wisdom brings financial rewards.  Sound decision making allows you to achieve substantial life goals and to surround yourself with friends and colleagues who have the same long-range vision.  


Yet when it comes to investing in the market, seasoned life veterans inadvertently join hands with an entire population that never learned the same lessons.  Unknowingly, their investments are commingled with approximately 85% of the marketplace who make investment decisions based on greed and fear.  This herd mentality drives the market impacting your holdings at this very moment…

     The attached final Prospectus for a prior series of the fund is hereby used
as a preliminary Prospectus for the above stated series.  The narrative         
information and structure of the attached final Prospectus will be substantially
the same as that of the final Prospectus for this series.  Information with     
respect to pricing, the number of units, dates and summary information regarding
the characteristics of securities to be deposited in this series is not now

Accordingly the information contained herein with regard to the previous series 
should be considered as being included for informational purposes only.

with the Securities and Exchange Commission but has not yet become effective.   
Information contained herein is subject to completion or amendment.  Such units 
may not be sold nor may an offer to buy be accepted prior to the time the       
registration statement becomes effective.  This Prospectus shall not constitute 
an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any  
sale of the units in any state in which such offer, solicitation or sale would  
be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of 
any such state.

INSURED TAX EXEMPT MUNICIPAL PORTFOLIO, SERIES 1                                
(ADVISORS DISCIPLINED TRUST 288)                                                

 A portfolio of long-intermediate-term
 municipal bonds seeking federally
tax exempt interest income and
capital preservation

PROSPECTUS
 APRIL 9, 2010

      [LOGO]                          As with any investment, the Securities
                                        and Exchange Commission has not approved
      AAM                            or disapproved of these securities or
                                       passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of
ADVISORS                         this prospectus.  Any contrary   
ASSET MANAGEMENT                     representation is a criminal offense.

The portfolio holds only bonds for which Berkshire Hathaway Assurance           
Corporation ("BHAC") has agreed to insure the timely payment of interest and    
principal pursuant to terms of BHAC's financial guaranty insurance policy.

INVESTMENT SUMMARY                                                              
------------------                                                              

INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE

The trust seeks to provide interest income exempt from federal personal     
income tax and to provide capital preservation.                                 

 PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGY

The trust seeks to provide interest income exempt from federal personal     
income tax and to provide capital preservation by investing in a portfolio      
primarily consisting of long-intermediate-term municipal bonds that are covered 
by insurance issued by Berkshire Hathaway Assurance Corp. ("BHAC").  The        
portfolio was selected by SMC Fixed Income Management, LP, the portfolio        
consultant to the trust (the "Portfolio Consultant"), based on criteria provided
by AAM<F1>*.  In selecting bonds, the Portfolio Consultant considered the       
following factors, among others:                                                

*  the Standard & Poor's rating of the bonds with insurance was not less than   
AAA or the Moody's Investor Service rating of the bonds with insurance was
not less than Aaa at trust inception;                                     

*  the bonds were individually covered by insurance issued by BHAC;             

*  the prices of the bonds relative to other bonds of comparable quality and    
maturity; and                                                             

*  diversification of bonds as to purpose of issue and location of issuer.      

Of course, no one can guarantee the trust will achieve its objective.       

The portfolio consists of debt obligations issued by or on behalf of states 
and territories of the United States, and political subdivisions and authorities
thereof, the interest on which is excludable from gross income for United States
federal personal income tax purposes under existing law in the opinion of       
recognized bond counsel to the issuer of the bonds.  The trust portfolio is     
structured to have a dollar-weighted average maturity between 10 and 15 years as
of the inception of the trust.  The trust does not include bonds subject to the 
federal alternative minimum tax for individuals.  Interest may be subject to    
state and local tax.                                                            

It should be understood that BHAC does not guarantee the market price or    
investment value of any bond in the portfolio, whether or not insured by BHAC,  
nor does it guarantee that the ratings on any bonds will not be revised or      
withdrawn.  Neither BHAC, the Portfolio Consultant nor any of their affiliates  
accepts any responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of this prospectus  
or any information or disclosure that is provided to potential purchasers of    
interests in the portfolio, or omitted from disclosure, other than with respect 
to statements it has approved relating solely to BHAC or the Portfolio          
Consultant, as applicable.  In addition, neither BHAC nor the Portfolio         
Consultant makes any representation regarding the portfolio or the advisability 
of investing in the portfolio.                                                  

 In the event of any acceleration of the due date of principal or interest due
under any bond due to mandatory or optional redemption or acceleration resulting
from default or otherwise, the payments guaranteed under the BHAC insurance     
shall be made in such amounts and at such times as such payments of principal   
and interest would have been due had there not been any such acceleration.      

 PRINCIPAL RISKS

As with all investments, you can lose money by investing in this trust.  The
trust also might not perform as well as you expect.  This can happen for reasons
such as these:                                                                  

*  BOND PRICES WILL FLUCTUATE.  The value of your investment may fall over time.

*  THE VALUE OF THE BONDS WILL GENERALLY FALL IF INTEREST RATES, IN GENERAL,    
RISE.  No one can predict whether interest rates will rise or fall in the 
future.                                                                   

--------------------                                                            
<F1>*  "AAM," "we" and related terms mean Advisors Asset Management, Inc.,      
the trust sponsor, unless the context clearly suggests otherwise. 

2     Investment Summary                                                        

P-->485BPOS4th�Page�of�86TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�4th
*  A BOND ISSUER OR INSURER MAY BE UNABLE TO MAKE INTEREST AND/OR PRINCIPAL     
PAYMENT IN THE FUTURE.                                                    
*  THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF AN ISSUER MAY WORSEN OR ITS CREDIT RATINGS MAY    
DROP, RESULTING IN A REDUCTION IN THE VALUE OF YOUR UNITS.  This may occur
at any point in time, including during the primary offering period.       

*  A BOND ISSUER MIGHT PREPAY OR "CALL" A BOND BEFORE ITS STATED MATURITY.  If  
this happens, the trust will distribute the principal to you but future   
interest distributions will fall.  A bond's call price could be less than 
the price the trust paid for the bond.  If enough bonds are called, the   
trust could terminate earlier than expected.                              

*  THE TRUST INVESTS EXCLUSIVELY IN BONDS COVERED BY INSURANCE ISSUED BY BHAC.  
Negative developments affecting BHAC may affect the value of your         
 investment more than would be the case in a portfolio of bonds insured by a
number of insurers.  The bond insurance covers interest and principal     
 payments when due and does not insure or guarantee the value of any bond or
 the trust units in any way.  Moreover, BHAC will only agree to insure bonds
consistent with its underwriting criteria, as it develops from time to    
time.  To the extent that market conditions or certain types of bonds are 
unattractive to BHAC, it will not insure such bonds.                      

*  THE TRUST MAY CONCENTRATE IN BONDS OF A PARTICULAR TYPE OF ISSUER.  This     
makes the trust less diversified and subject to greater risk than a more  
 diversified portfolio.  The types of bond in the portfolio are listed under
"Types of Bonds" on page 5.                                               

*  WE DO NOT ACTIVELY MANAGE THE PORTFOLIO.  Except in limited circumstances,   
the trust will hold, and may continue to buy, the same bonds even if the  
market value declines.

 EXAMPLE

This example helps you compare the cost of this trust with other unit trusts
and mutual funds.  In the example we assume that the expenses do not change and 
that the trust's annual return is 5%.  Your actual returns and expenses will    
vary.  Based on these assumptions, you would pay these expenses for every       
$10,000 you invest in the trust:                                                

1 year            $263                                      
3 year            $288                                      
5 year            $313                                      
10 years          $376                                      

These amounts are the same regardless of whether you sell your investment at
the end of a period or continue to hold your investment.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Unitholders

Insured Tax Exempt Municipal Portfolio, Series 1                                

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of Advisors
Disciplined Trust 288, Insured Tax Exempt Municipal Portfolio, Series 1,        
including the schedule of investments, as of November 30, 2009, and the related 
statements of operations and changes in net assets for the period from December
12, 2008 (initial date of deposit) through November 30, 2009.  These financial  
statements are the responsibility of the trust's sponsor.  Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.         

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company   
Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we    
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the     
financial statements are free of material misstatement.  The trust is not       
required to have, nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its internal       
control over financial reporting.  Our audit included consideration of internal 
control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that 
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an  
opinion on the effectiveness of the trust's internal control over financial     
reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion.  An audit also includes    
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in  
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and          
significant estimates made by the sponsor, as well as evaluating the overall    
financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation of       
investments owned as of November 30, 2009, by correspondence with the custodial 
bank.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.   

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in   
all material respects, the financial position of Advisors Disciplined Trust 288,
Insured Tax Exempt Municipal Portfolio, Series 1 at November 30, 2009, and the  
results of its operations and changes in its net assets for the period indicated
above in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United 
States of America.

Advisors Asset Management, Inc. is the trust's sponsor and evaluator.           

BASIS OF ACCOUNTING                                                             

The financial statements are presented on the accrual basis of accounting.      

VALUATION OF SECURITIES                                                         

The evaluator generally determines the value of securities on the aggregate bid 
side evaluations of the securities determined (a) on the basis of current bid   
prices of the securities, (b) if bid prices are not available for any particular
security, on the basis of current bid prices for comparable securities, (c) by  
determining the value of securities on the bid side of the market by appraisal, 
or (d) by any combination of the above.  Accounting Standards Codification 820, 
"Fair Value Measurements" establishes a framework for measuring fair value and  
expands disclosure about fair value measurements in financial statements for the
trust.  The framework under the standard is comprised of a fair value hierarchy,
which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize  
the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.  The standard         
describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:        

     Level 1:  Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in
active markets that the trust has the ability to access as of the     
measurement date.                                                     

    Level 2:  Significant observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as
   quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets
that are not active, and other inputs that are observable or can be   
corroborated by observable market data.                               

Level 3:  Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a trust's own  
 assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in
pricing an asset or liability.                                        

The inputs or methodologies used for valuing securities are not necessarily an  
indication of the risk associated with investing those securities.              

Changes in valuation techniques may result in transfers in or out of an         
investment's assigned level as described above.                                 

The following table summarizes the trust's investments as of November 30, 2009, 
based on inputs used to value them:

INVESTMENT INCOME                                                               

Interest income consists of amortization of premiums, accretion of discounts and
interest accrued as earned on the fixed rate obligations.  As required, the     
trust has adopted the provisions of the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide for    
Investment Companies and is amortizing premiums or accreting discounts on debt  
securities.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States requires the trust's sponsor to make    
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial     
statements and accompanying notes.  Actual results could differ from such       
estimates.

The trust is organized as a regulated investment company under Subchapter M of  
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").  It is the trust's  
policy to comply with the special provisions of the Code available to regulated 
investment companies.  Such provisions were complied with and, therefore, no    
federal income tax provision is required.                                       

As of December 31, 2008, the components of accumulated earnings on a tax basis

              ============

* On December 31, 2008, the trust had no net capital loss carryforwards. To the 
extent future capital gains are offset by capital loss carryforward, such gains 
will not be distributed.  The aggregate cost, for federal income tax purposes,  
of the portfolio of investments is $112,728,620 and the gross unrealized        
appreciation for the investments on a tax basis is $5,781,610.                  

4.  OTHER INFORMATION

The cost to original investors of units of the trust was based on the net asset 
value per unit on the date of an investor's purchase plus organization costs,   
plus a sales fee of 2.50% of the public offering price.

HOW TO BUY UNITS

You can buy units of the trust on any business day the New York Stock       
Exchange is open by contacting your financial professional.  Unit prices are    
available daily on the Internet at WWW.AAMPORTFOLIOS.COM.  The public offering  
price of units includes:                                                        

*  the net asset value per unit plus                                        

*  the sales fee plus                                                       

*  accrued interest, if any.                                                

 The "net asset value per unit" is the value of the securities, cash and other
assets in the trust reduced by the liabilities of the trust divided by the total
units outstanding.  We often refer to the public offering price of units as the 
"offer price" or "purchase price."  The offer price will be effective for all   
orders received prior to the close of regular trading on the New York Stock     
Exchange (normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time).  If we receive your order prior to  
the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange or authorized       
financial professionals receive your order prior to that time and properly      
transmit the order to us by the time that we designate, then you will receive   
the price computed on the date of receipt.  If we receive your order after the  
close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange, if authorized financial
professionals receive your order after that time or if orders are received by   
such persons and are not transmitted to us by the time that we designate, then  
you will receive the price computed on the date of the next determined offer    
price provided that your order is received in a timely manner on that date.  It 
is the responsibility of the authorized financial professional to transmit the  
orders that they receive to us in a timely manner.  Certain broker-dealers may  
charge a transaction or other fee for processing unit purchase orders.          

ACCRUED INTEREST.  Accrued interest represents unpaid interest on a security
from the last day it paid interest.  Accrued interest on the trust units        
consists of two elements.  The first element arises as a result of accrued      
interest which is the accumulation of unpaid interest on bonds in the trust from
the last day on which interest was paid on the bonds.  Interest on the bonds is 
generally paid semi-annually, although the trust accrues such interest daily.   
Because your trust always has an amount of interest earned but not yet          
collected, the public offering price of units will have added to it the         
proportionate share of accrued interest to the date of settlement.  The second  
element of accrued interest arises because of the structure of the trust's      
interest account.  The trustee has no cash for distribution to unitholders until
it receives interest payments on the bonds in the trust and may be required to  
advance its own funds to make trust interest distributions.  As a result,       
interest account balances are established to limit the need for the trustee to  
advance funds in connection with such interest distributions.  If you sell or   
redeem your units you will be entitled to receive your proportionate share of   
the accrued interest from the purchaser of your units.                          

VALUE OF THE SECURITIES.  We determine the value of the securities as of the
close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange on each day that        
exchange is open.  We generally determine the value of securities based on the  
aggregate bid side evaluations of the securities determined (a) on the basis of 
current bid prices of the securities, (b) if bid prices are not available for   
any particular security, on the basis of current bid prices for comparable

market by appraisal, or (d) by any combination of the above.  The offering side 
price generally represents the price at which investors in the market are       
willing to sell a security and the bid side evaluation generally represents the 
price that investors in the market are willing to pay to buy a security.  The   
bid side evaluation is lower than the offering side evaluation.                 

SALES FEE.  You pay a fee in connection with purchasing units.  We refer to 
this fee as the "sales fee."  The maximum sales fee equals 2.50% of the public  
offering price per unit at the time of purchase.  You pay the sales fee at the  
time you buy units.                                                             

REDUCING YOUR SALES FEE.  We offer a variety of ways for you to reduce the  
fee you pay.  It is your financial professional's responsibility to alert us of 
any discount when you order units.                                              

Employees.  We waive a portion of the sales fee for purchases made by       
officers, directors and employees of the sponsor and its affiliates and their   
family members (spouses, children and parents).  We also waive a portion of the 
sales fee for purchases made by registered representatives of selling firms and 
their family members (spouses, children and parents).  These purchases may be   
made at the public offering price per unit less the applicable regular dealer   
concession.                                                                     

HOW TO SELL YOUR UNITS

You can sell or redeem your units on any business day the New York Stock    
Exchange is open by contacting your financial professional.  Unit prices are    
available daily on the Internet at WWW.AAMPORTFOLIOS.COM or through your        
financial professional.  The sale and redemption price of units is equal to the 
net asset value per unit.  The sale and redemption price is sometimes referred  
to as the "liquidation price".  Certain broker-dealers may charge a transaction 
or other fee for processing unit redemption or sale requests.                   

SELLING UNITS.  We may maintain a secondary market for units.  This means   
that if you want to sell your units, we may buy them at the current net asset   
value.  We may then resell the units to other investors at the public offering  
price or redeem them for the redemption price.  Our secondary market repurchase 
price is the same as the redemption price.  Certain broker-dealers might also   
maintain a secondary market in units.  You should contact your financial        
professional for current repurchase prices to determine the best price          
available.  We may discontinue our secondary market at any time without notice. 
Even if we do not make a market, you will be able to redeem your units with the 
trustee on any business day for the current redemption price.                   

REDEEMING UNITS.  You may also redeem your units directly with the trustee, 
The Bank of New York Mellon, on any day the New York Stock Exchange is open.    
The redemption price that you will receive for units is equal to the net asset  
value per unit.  You will receive the net asset value for a particular day if   
the trustee receives your completed redemption request prior to the close of    
regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange.  Redemption requests received by
authorized financial professionals prior to the close of regular trading on the 
New York Stock Exchange that are properly transmitted to the trustee by the time
designated by the trustee, are priced based on the date of receipt.  Redemption 
requests received by the trustee after the close of regular trading on the New  
York Stock Exchange, redemption requests received by authorized financial       
professionals after that time or redemption requests received by such persons   
that are                                                                        

                                            Understanding Your Investment     17

not transmitted to the trustee until after the time designated by the trustee,  
are priced based on the date of the next determined redemption price provided   
they are received in a timely manner by the trustee on such date.  It is the    
responsibility of authorized financial professionals to transmit redemption     
requests received by them to the trustee so they will be received in a timely   
manner.  If your request is received after that time or is incomplete in any    
way, you will receive the next net asset value computed after the trustee       
receives your completed request.                                                

If you redeem your units, the trustee will generally send you a payment for 
your units no later than seven days after it receives all necessary             
documentation (this will usually only take three business days).  The only time 
the trustee can delay your payment is if the New York Stock Exchange is closed  
(other than weekends or holidays), the Securities and Exchange Commission       
determines that trading on that exchange is restricted or an emergency exists   
making sale or evaluation of the securities not reasonably practicable, and for 
any other period that the Securities and Exchange Commission permits.           

To redeem your units, you must send the trustee any certificates for your   
units.  You must properly endorse your certificates or sign a written transfer  
instrument with a signature guarantee.  The trustee may require additional      
documents such as a certificate of corporate authority, trust documents, a death
certificate, or an appointment as executor, administrator or guardian.  The     
trustee cannot complete your redemption or send your payment to you until it    
receives all of these documents in complete form.                               

EXCHANGE OPTION.  You may be able to exchange your units for units of our   
other unit trusts at a reduced sales fee.  You can contact your financial       
professional for more information about trusts currently available for          
exchanges.  Before you exchange units, you should read the prospectus carefully 
and understand the risks and fees.  You should then discuss this option with    
your financial professional to determine whether your investment goals have     
changed, whether current trusts suit you and to discuss tax consequences.  We   
may discontinue this option upon sixty days notice.                             

 DISTRIBUTIONS

MONTHLY DISTRIBUTIONS.  Your trust generally pays interest from its net     
investment income (pro-rated on an annual basis) along with any available       
principal paid on the securities on each monthly distribution date to           
unitholders of record on the preceding record date.  The record and distribution
dates are shown under "Essential Information" in the "Investment Summary"       
section of this prospectus.  In some cases, your trust might pay a special      
distribution if it holds an excessive amount of cash pending distribution.  The 
amount of your distributions will vary from time to time as interest and        
principal payments change or trust expenses change.                             

Interest received by the trust, including that part of the proceeds of any  
disposition of bonds which represents accrued interest, is credited by the      
trustee to the trust's "interest account".  Other receipts are credited to the  
"principal account".  After deduction of amounts sufficient to reimburse the    
trustee, without interest, for any amounts advanced and paid to the sponsor as  
the unitholder of record as of the first settlement date, interest received will
be distributed on each distribution date to unitholders of record as of the     
preceding record date.  All distributions will be net of estimated expenses.    
Funds in the principal account will be distributed on each distribution         

18     Understanding Your Investment                                            

P-->485BPOS20th�Page�of�86TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�20th
date to unitholders of record as of the preceding record date provided that the 
amount available for distribution therein shall equal at least $1.00 per unit.  

Because interest payments are not received by the trust at a constant rate  
throughout the year, interest distributions may be more or less than the amount 
credited to the interest account as of the record date.  For the purpose of     
minimizing fluctuations in interest distributions, the trustee is authorized to 
advance amounts necessary to provide interest distributions of approximately    
equal amounts.  The trustee is reimbursed for these advances from funds in the  
interest account on the next record date.  Investors who purchase units between 
a record date and a distribution date will receive their first distribution on  
the second distribution date after the purchase.                                

ESTIMATED DISTRIBUTIONS.  The estimated net annual interest income per unit 
and estimated normal monthly distribution per unit are shown under "Essential
Information" in the "Investment Summary" section of this prospectus as of the   
date set forth herein.  We base these amounts on the estimated cash flows of the
bonds per unit.  The actual distributions that you receive will vary from these 
estimates with changes in expenses, interest rates and maturity, call, default  
or sale of bonds.  You may request the estimated cash flows from the sponsor.   
The estimated cash flows are computed based on factors described under          
"Understanding Your Investment--How the Trust Works--Estimated Current and Long-
Term Returns".                                                                  

REPORTS.  The trustee or your financial professional will make available to 
you a statement showing income and other receipts of your trust for each        
distribution.  Each year the trustee or your financial professional will also   
provide an annual report on your trust's activity and certain tax information.  
You can request copies of security evaluations to enable you to complete your   
tax forms and audited financial statements for your trust, if available.        

INVESTMENT RISKS

 All investments involve risk.  This section describes the main risks that can
impact the value of the securities in your portfolio.  You should understand    
these risks before you invest.  If the value of the securities falls, the value 
of your units will also fall.  We cannot guarantee that your trust will achieve 
its objective or that your investment return will be positive over any period.  

MARKET RISK is the risk that the value of the securities in your trust will 
fluctuate.  This could cause the value of your units to fall below your original
purchase price or below the principal value.  Market value fluctuates in        
response to various factors.  These can include changes in interest rates,      
inflation, the financial condition of a security's issuer, perceptions of the   
issuer, or ratings on a security.  Even though we supervise your portfolio, you 
should remember that we do not manage your portfolio.  Your trust will not sell 
a security solely because the market value falls as is possible in a managed    
fund.                                                                           

INTEREST RATE RISK is the risk that the value of securities will fall if    
interest rates increase.  The securities in your trust typically fall in value  
when interest rates rise and rise in value when interest rates fall.  Securities
with longer periods before maturity are often more sensitive to interest rate   
changes.                                                                        

 CREDIT RISK is the risk that a security's issuer or insurer is unable to meet
its obligation to pay principal or interest on the security.                    

                                            Understanding Your Investment     19

P-->485BPOS21st�Page�of�86TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�21st
CALL RISK is the risk that the issuer prepays or "calls" a bond before its  
stated maturity.  An issuer might call a bond if interest rates fall and the    
bond pays a higher interest rate or if it no longer needs the money for the     
original purpose.  If an issuer calls a bond, your trust will distribute the    
principal to you but your future interest distributions will fall.  You might   
not be able to reinvest this principal at as high a yield.  A bond's call price 
could be less than the price your trust paid for the bond and could be below the
bond's par value.  This means that you could receive less than the amount you   
paid for your units.  If enough bonds in your trust are called, your trust could
terminate early.  Some or all of the bonds may also be subject to extraordinary 
optional or mandatory redemptions if certain events occur, such as certain      
changes in tax laws, the substantial damage or destruction by fire or other     
casualty of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used, and      
various other events.  The call provisions are described in general terms in the
"Schedule of Investments".                                                      

BOND QUALITY RISK is the risk that a bond will fall in value if a rating    
agency decreases the bond's rating.                                             

CONCENTRATION RISK is the risk that the value of your trust is more         
susceptible to fluctuations based on factors that impact a particular type of   
bond because the portfolio concentrates in bonds of that type.  A portfolio     
"concentrates" in a type of bond when bonds in a particular category make up 25%
or more of the portfolio.  A table on page 5 lists the type of bonds held by the
trust with the percentage that each type represents in the portfolio.  The      
following discusses various types of bonds.  The information supplement contains
additional information on these types of bonds.                                 

General Obligation Bonds.  Certain of the bonds in your trust may be general
obligations of a governmental entity that are secured by the taxing power of the
entity.  General obligation bonds are backed by the issuer's pledge of its full 
faith, credit and taxing power for the payment of principal and interest.  The  
taxing power of any governmental entity may be limited, however, by provisions  
of state constitutions or laws.  An entity's credit will depend on many factors:
tax base, reliance on federal or state aid, and factors which are beyond the    
entity's control.                                                               

Revenue Bonds.  Certain of the bonds in your trust may be "revenue bonds"   
that are payable only from the revenue of a specific project or authority.  They
not supported by the issuer's general power to levy taxes, if any.  The risk of 
default in payment of interest or principal increases if the income of the      
related project or authority falters because that income is the only source of  
payment.  The following types of bonds are "revenue bonds".                     

Appropriations Bonds.  Certain bonds in your trust may be bonds that are, in
whole or in part, subject to and dependent upon either the governmental entity  
making appropriations from time to time or the continued existence of special   
temporary taxes which require legislative action for their reimposition.  The   
availability of any appropriation is subject to the willingness or ability of   
the governmental entity to continue to make such special appropriations or to   
reimpose such special taxes.  The obligation to make lease payments exists only 
to the extent of the monies available to the governmental entity therefor, and  
no liability is incurred by the governmental entity beyond the monies so        
appropriated.  Once an annual appropriation is made, the governmental entity's  
obligation to make lease rental payments is absolute and unconditional          
regardless of any circumstances or occurrences which might arise.  In the event 
of non-appropriation, certificateholders' or bondowners'                        

20     Understanding Your Investment                                            

P-->485BPOS22nd�Page�of�86TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�22nd
sole remedy (absent credit enhancement) generally is limited to repossession of 
the collateral for resale or releasing.  In the event of non-appropriation, the 
sponsor may instruct the trustee to sell such bonds.                            

Airport, Port and Highway Bonds.  Certain facility revenue bonds are payable
from and secured by the revenues from the ownership and operation of particular 
facilities, such as airports, highways and port authorities.  Airport operating 
income may be affected by the ability of airlines to meet their obligations     
under the agreements with airports.  Similarly, payment on bonds related to     
other facilities is dependent on revenues from the projects, such as use fees   
from ports, tolls on turnpikes and bridges and rents from buildings.  Payment   
may be adversely affected by reduction in revenues due to such factors and      
increased cost of maintenance or decreased use of a facility.  The sponsor      
cannot predict what effect conditions may have on revenues which are dependent  
for payment on these bonds.                                                     

Capital Improvement Facility Bonds.  Your trust may contain bonds which are 
in the capital improvement facilities category.  Capital improvement bonds are  
bonds issued to provide funds to assist political subdivisions or agencies of a 
state through acquisition of the underlying debt of a state or local political  
subdivision or agency.  The risks of an investment in such bonds include the    
risk of possible prepayment or failure of payment of proceeds on and default of 
the underlying debt.                                                            

Convention Facility Bonds.  Your trust may contain bonds of issuers in the  
convention facilities category.  Bonds in the convention facilities category    
include special limited obligation bonds issued to finance convention and sports
facilities payable from rental payments and annual governmental appropriations. 
The governmental agency is not obligated to make payments in any year in which  
the monies have not been appropriated to make such payments.  In addition, these
facilities are limited use facilities that may not be used for purposes other   
than as convention centers or sports facilities.                                

Correctional Facility Bonds.  Your trust may contain bonds of issuers in the
correctional facilities category.  Bonds in the correctional facilities category
include special limited obligation bonds issued to construct, rehabilitate and  
purchase correctional facilities payable from governmental rental payments      
and/or appropriations.                                                          

Education, University and College Bonds.  The ability of educational        
institutions, including universities and colleges, to meet their obligations is 
dependent upon various factors.  Some of these factors include the size and     
diversity of their sources of revenues, enrollment, reputation, management      
expertise, the availability and restrictions on the use of endowments and other 
funds, the quality and maintenance costs of campus facilities.  Also, in the    
case of public institutions, the financial condition of the relevant state or   
other governmental entity and its policies with respect to education may affect 
an institution's ability to make payment on its own.                            

Hospital and Health Care Facility Bonds.  The ability of hospitals and other
health care facilities to meet their obligations with respect to revenue bonds  
issued on their behalf is dependent on various factors.  Some such factors are  
the level of payments received from private third-party payors and government   
programs and the cost of providing health care services.  There can be no       
assurance that payments under governmental programs will remain at levels       
comparable to present levels or will be sufficient to cover the costs associated

                                            Understanding Your Investment     21

P-->485BPOS23rd�Page�of�86TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�23rd
with their bonds.  It also may be necessary for a hospital or other health care 
facility to incur substantial capital expenditures or increased operating       
expenses to effect changes in its facilities, equipment, personnel and services.
Hospitals and other health care facilities are additionally subject to claims   
and legal actions by patients and others in the ordinary course of business.    
There can be no assurance that a claim will not exceed the insurance coverage of
a health care facility or that insurance coverage will be available to a        
facility.                                                                       

 Housing Bonds.  Multi-family housing revenue bonds and single family mortgage
revenue bonds are state and local housing issues that have been issued to       
provide financing for various housing projects.  Multi-family housing revenue   
bonds are payable primarily from mortgage loans to housing projects for low to  
moderate income families.  Single-family mortgage revenue bonds are issued for  
the purpose of acquiring notes secured by mortgages on residences.  The ability 
of housing issuers to make debt service payments on their obligations may be    
affected by various economic and non-economic factors.  Such factors include:   
occupancy levels, adequate rental income in multi-family projects, the rate of  
default on mortgage loans underlying single family issues and the ability of    
mortgage insurers to pay claims.  All single family mortgage revenue bonds and  
certain multi-family housing revenue bonds are prepayable over the life of the  
underlying mortgage or mortgage pool.  Therefore, the average life of housing   
obligations cannot be determined.  However, the average life of these           
obligations will ordinarily be less than their stated maturities.  Mortgage     
loans are frequently partially or completely prepaid prior to their final stated
maturities.  To the extent that these obligations were valued at a premium when 
a unitholder purchased units, any prepayment at par would result in a loss of   
capital to the unitholder and reduce the amount of income that would otherwise  
have been paid to unitholders.                                                  

Industrial Development Revenue Bonds ("IDRs").  IDRs, including pollution   
control revenue bonds, are tax-exempt bonds issued by states, municipalities,   
public authorities or similar entities to finance the cost of acquiring,        
constructing or improving various projects.  These projects are usually operated
by corporate entities.  IDRs are not general obligations of governmental        
entities backed by their taxing power.  Issuers are only obligated to pay       
amounts due on the IDRs to the extent that funds are available from the         
unexpended proceeds of the IDRs or receipts or revenues of the issuer.  Payment 
of IDRs is solely dependent upon the creditworthiness of the corporate operator 
of the project or corporate guarantor.  Such corporate operators or guarantors  
that are industrial companies may be affected by many factors which may have an 
adverse impact on the credit quality of the particular company or industry.     

Lease Rental Bonds.  Lease rental bonds are predominantly issued by         
governmental authorities that have no taxing power or other means of directly   
raising revenues.  Rather, the authorities are financing vehicles created solely
for the construction of buildings or the purchase of equipment that will be used
by a state or local government.  Thus, the bonds are subject to the ability and 
willingness of the lessee government to meet its lease rental payments which    
include debt service on the bonds.  Lease rental bonds are subject to the risk  
that the lessee government is not legally obligated to budget and appropriate   
for the rental payments beyond the current fiscal year.  These bonds are also   
subject to the risk of abatement in many states as rental bonds cease in the    
event that damage, destruction or condemnation of the project prevents its use  
by the lessee.  Also,                                                           

22     Understanding Your Investment                                            

P-->485BPOS24th�Page�of�86TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�24th
in the event of default by the lessee government, there may be significant legal
and/or practical difficulties involved in the reletting or sale of the project. 

Moral Obligation Bonds.  Your trust may also include "moral obligation"     
bonds.  If an issuer of moral obligation bonds is unable to meet its            
obligations, the repayment of the bonds becomes a moral commitment but not a    
legal obligation of the state or municipality in question.  Thus, such a        
commitment generally requires appropriation by the state legislature and        
accordingly does not constitute a legally enforceable obligation of debt of the 
state.  The agencies or authorities generally have no taxing power.             

 Power Bonds.  The ability of utilities to meet their obligations with respect
to bonds they issue is dependent on various factors.  These factors include the 
rates they may charge their customers, the demand for a utility's services and  
the cost of providing those services.  Utilities may also be subject to         
extensive regulations relating to the rates which they may charge customers.    
Utilities can experience regulatory, political and consumer resistance to rate  
increases.  Utilities engaged in long-term capital projects are especially      
sensitive to regulatory lags in granting rate increases.  Utilities are         
additionally subject to increased costs due to governmental environmental       
regulation and decreased profits due to increasing competition.  Any difficulty 
in obtaining timely and adequate rate increases could adversely affect a        
utility's results of operations.  The sponsor cannot predict at this time the   
ultimate effect of such factors on the ability of any issuers to meet their     
obligations with respect to bonds.                                              

Refunded Bonds.  Refunded bonds are typically secured by direct obligations 
of the U.S. Government, or in some cases obligations guaranteed by the U.S.     
Government, placed in an escrow account maintained by an independent party until
maturity or a predetermined redemption date.  These obligations are generally   
non-callable prior to maturity or the predetermined redemption date.  In a few  
isolated instances to date, however, bonds which were thought to be escrowed to 
maturity have been called for redemption prior to maturity.                     

 Solid Waste Disposal Bonds.  Bonds issued for solid waste disposal facilities
are generally payable from tipping fees and from revenues that may be earned by 
the facility on the sale of electrical energy generated in the combustion of    
waste products.  The ability of solid waste disposal facilities to meet their   
obligations depends upon the continued use of the facility, the successful and  
efficient operation of the facility and, in the case of waste-to-energy         
facilities, the continued ability of the facility to generate electricity on a  
commercial basis.  Also, increasing environmental regulation of the federal,    
state and local level has a significant impact on waste disposal facilities.    
While regulation requires most waste producers to use waste disposal facilities,
it also imposes significant costs on the facilities.                            

Special Tax Bonds.  Special tax bonds are payable for and secured by the    
revenues derived by a municipality from a particular tax.  Examples of special  
taxes are a tax on the rental of a hotel room, on the purchase of food and      
beverages, on the rental of automobiles or on the consumption of liquor.        
Special tax bonds are not secured by the general tax revenues of the            
municipality, and they do not represent general obligations of the municipality.
Payment on special tax bonds may be adversely affected by a reduction in        
revenues realized from the underlying special tax.  Also, should spending on the
particular goods or services that are subject to the special

tax decline, the municipality may be under no obligation to increase the rate of
the special tax to ensure that sufficient revenues are raised from the shrinking
taxable base.                                                                   

Tax Allocation Bonds.  Tax allocation bonds are typically secured by        
incremental tax revenues collected on property within the areas where           
redevelopment projects, financed by bond proceeds are located.  Bond payments   
are expected to be made from projected increases in tax revenues derived from   
higher assessed values of property resulting from development in the particular 
project area and not from an increase in tax rates.  Special risk considerations
include: variations in taxable values of property in the project area;          
successful appeals by property owners of assessed valuations; substantial       
delinquencies in the payment of property taxes; or imposition of any            
constitutional or legislative property tax rate decrease.                       

Transit Authority Bonds.  Mass transit is generally not self-supporting from
fare revenues.  Additional financial resources must be made available to ensure 
operation of mass transit systems as well as the timely payment of debt service.
Often such financial resources include federal and state subsidies, lease       
rentals paid by funds of the state or local government or a pledge of a special 
tax.  If fare revenues or the additional financial resources do not increase    
appropriately to pay for rising operating expenses, the ability of the issuer to
adequately service the debt may be adversely affected.                          

Water and Sewer Revenue Bonds.  Water and sewer bonds are generally payable 
from user fees.  The ability of state and local water and sewer authorities to  
meet their obligations may be affected by a number of factors.  Some such       
factors are the failure of municipalities to utilize fully the facilities       
constructed by these authorities, declines in revenue from user charges, the    
possible inability to obtain rate increases, rising construction and maintenance
costs, impact of environmental requirements, the difficulty of obtaining or     
discovering new supplies of fresh water, the effect of conservation programs,   
the impact of "no growth" zoning ordinances and the continued availability of   
federal and state financial assistance and of municipal bond insurance for      
future bond issues.                                                             

LIQUIDITY RISK is the risk that the value of a security will fall if trading
in the security is limited or absent.  No one can guarantee that a liquid       
trading market will exist for any security because these securities generally   
trade in the over-the-counter market (they are not listed on a securities       
exchange).                                                                      

LITIGATION AND LEGISLATION RISK is the risk that future litigation or       
legislation could affect the value of your trust.  Litigation could challenge an
issuer's authority to issue or make payments on securities.  From time to time  
Congress or state legislatures may consider proposals to tax the interest on    
state and local obligations.  The Supreme Court has concluded the U.S.          
Constitution does not prohibit Congress from passing a nondiscriminatory tax on 
interest on state and local obligations.  This of legislation, if enacted into  
law, could adversely affect an investment in the units.                         

"WHEN ISSUED" AND "DELAYED DELIVERY" BONDS.  "When, as and if issued" bonds 
are bonds that trade before they are actually issued.  Bonds purchased on a     
"when issued" basis have not yet been issued by the issuer on the trust's       
inception date although such issuer has committed to issue such bonds.  This    
means that the sponsor can only deliver them to the trust "when, as and if" the 

24     Understanding Your Investment                                            

P-->485BPOS26th�Page�of�86TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�26th
bonds are actually issued.  In addition, other bonds may have been purchased by 
the sponsor on a "delayed delivery" basis.  These bonds are expected to be      
delivered to the trust after the trust's first settlement date (normally three  
business days after the trust's inception date).                                

Delivery of these bonds may be delayed or may not occur.  Interest on these 
bonds does not begin accruing to your trust until the bond is delivered to the  
trust.  You may have to adjust your tax basis of any bonds delivered after the  
expected delivery date.  Any adjustment would reflect interest that accrued     
between the time you purchased your units and the delivery of the bonds to your 
trust.  This could lower your first year estimated current return.  You may     
experience gains or losses on these bonds from the time you purchase units even 
though your trust has not yet received them.                                    

ORIGINAL ISSUE DISCOUNT BONDS.  Original issue discount bonds were initially
issued at a price below their face (or par) value.  These bonds typically pay a 
lower interest rate than comparable bonds that were issued at or above their par
value.  In a stable interest rate environment, the market value of these bonds  
tends to increase more slowly in early years and in greater increments as the   
bonds approach maturity.  The issuers of these bonds may be able to call or     
redeem a bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the      
bond's par value.                                                               

 Zero coupon bonds are a type of original issue discount bond.  These bonds do
not pay any current interest during their life.  If an investor owns this type  
of bond, the investor has the right to receive a final payment of the bond's par
value at maturity.  The price of these bonds often fluctuates greatly during    
periods of changing market interest rates compared to bonds that make current   
interest payments.  The issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a  
bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bond's par    
value.                                                                          

MARKET DISCOUNT.  The portfolio of the trust may consist of some bonds whose
current market values were below the principal value on the trust's inception   
date or your unit purchase date.  A primary reason for the market value of such 
bonds being less than the principal value is that the interest rate of such     
bonds is at a lower rate than the current market interest rates for comparable  
bonds.  Bonds selling at market discounts tend to increase in market value as   
they approach maturity.  A market discount tax-exempt bond held to maturity will
have a larger portion of its total return in the form of taxable ordinary income
and less in the form of tax-exempt income than a comparable bond bearing        
interest at current market rates.                                               

PREMIUM BONDS.  The portfolio of the trust may consist of some bonds whose  
current market values were above the principal value on the trust's inception   
date or your unit purchase date.  A primary reason for the market value of such 
bonds being higher than the principal value is that the interest rate of such   
bonds is at a higher rate than the current market interest rates for comparable 
bonds.  The current returns of bonds trading at a market premium are initially  
higher than the current returns of comparable bonds issued at currently         
prevailing interest rates because premium bonds tend to decrease in market value
as they approach maturity when the principal value becomes payable.  Because    
part of the purchase price is effectively returned not at maturity but through  
current income payments, early redemption of a premium bond at par or any other 
amount below the trust's purchase price will result in a reduction in yield.    
Redemption pursuant

to call provisions generally will, and redemption pursuant to sinking fund      
provisions may, occur at times when the bonds have a market value that          
represents a premium over par or for original issue discount securities a       
premium over the accreted value.                                                

PORTFOLIO CONSULTANT.  The Portfolio Consultant may be unsuccessful in      
identifying bonds consistent with the trust's investment strategy.  The trust   
may not achieve its objective if this happens.                                  

BOND INSURANCE

All bonds contained in your trust are covered by insurance guaranteeing     
payment of interest and principal, when due.  The premium for any bond insurance
is paid by the issuer, the trust's sponsor or by another prior owner of the     
bonds and any policy is non-cancelable and will continue in force so long as the
bonds so insured are outstanding and the bond insurer remains in business.  The 
bond insurers are listed in the bond names in the "Schedule of Investments".    
Bond insurance guarantees the timely payment of principal and interest on the   
bonds when they fall due.  For this purpose, "when due" generally means the     
stated payment or maturity date for the payment of principal and interest.  The 
insurance does not guarantee the market value of the bonds or the value of the  
trust units.  Each bond insurer is subject to regulation by the department of   
insurance in the state in which it is qualified to do business.  Such           
regulation, however, is no guarantee that a bond insurer will be able to perform
on its contract of insurance in the event a claim should be made.               

Most bond insurance companies have recently had their credit ratings        
downgraded or placed on review for possible downgrade by recognized credit      
rating agencies such as Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investor Services, Inc.   
While many insurance companies have historically maintained a "AAA" credit      
rating, most insurance companies are currently assigned a credit rating below   
this level.  To the extent that the issuer of a bond in your trust portfolio    
does not independently maintain a credit rating equal to or higher than the     
insurer of the bond, a downgrade in the rating of a bond insurer will result in 
a downgrade in the rating of the related bond.  This could have a material      
adverse effect on the value of the bonds and the value of your units.           

All bonds in the trust are covered by insurance issued by BHAC.  BHAC is a  
bond insurance company that is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Berkshire
Hathaway Inc.  BHAC is a New York stock insurance corporation that writes

insurance and related lines, including surety and credit insurance.  In         
addition, New York's financial guaranty insurance law (i) requires such insurers
to maintain a minimum surplus as regards policyholders, (ii) establishes limits 
on the aggregate net amount of exposure that may be retained in respect of a    
particular issuer or revenue source and on the aggregate net amount of exposure 
that may be retained in respect of particular types of risk as a percentage of  
surplus as regards policyholders; and (iii) establishes contingency, loss and   
unearned premium reserve requirements.  BHAC is also subject to the applicable  
insurance laws and regulations of all other jurisdictions in which it is

vary by jurisdiction.                                                           

At September 30, 2009, BHAC had surplus as regards policyholders of         
$992,000,000 and Columbia had surplus as regards to policyholders of            
$8,100,000,000, determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices

Standard & Poor's has assigned its "AA+" financial enhancement rating to        
Columbia.  The ratings on BHAC are based on a guaranty from Columbia in favor of
BHAC.  The guaranty issued by Columbia applies to BHAC's policy issued with     
respect to the bonds.  Any explanation of these ratings may only be obtained    
from Standard & Poor's.  The ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or   
hold the bonds, and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by        
Standard & Poor's.  Any downward revision or withdrawal of a rating may have an 
adverse effect on the market price of the bonds.                                

In addition, Moody's Investors Services, Inc. has assigned its "Aa1"        
insurance financial strength ratings to BHAC and Columbia.  Any explanation of  
these ratings may only be obtained from Moody's Investor Services, Inc.  The    
ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold the bonds, and are subject
to revision or withdrawal at any time by Moody's Investor Services, Inc.  Any   
downward revision or withdrawal of a rating may have an adverse effect on the   
market price of the bonds.  On April 8, 2009, the date that Moody's Investor    
Services, Inc. assigned its rating to BHAC, BHAC's ultimate parent company,     
Berkshire Hathaway Inc., maintained an investment in Moody's Investor Services, 
Inc.'s parent company of approximately 19.6% of the common shares then          
outstanding.

 HOW THE TRUST WORKS

YOUR TRUST.  Your trust is a unit investment trust registered under the     
Investment Company Act of 1940.  We created the trust under a trust agreement   
between Advisors Asset Management, Inc. (as depositor/sponsor, evaluator and    
supervisor) and The Bank of New York Mellon (as trustee).  To create your trust,
we deposited securities with the trustee (or contracts to purchase securities   
along with an irrevocable letter of credit or other consideration to pay for the
securities).  In exchange, the trustee delivered units of your trust to us.     
Each unit represents an undivided interest in the assets of your trust.  These  
units remain outstanding until redeemed or until your trust terminates.  The    
number of units, fractional interest of each unit in a trust, estimated interest
distributions per unit and estimated current and long-term returns will increase
or decrease to the extent of any adjustment.                                    

 CHANGING YOUR PORTFOLIO.  Your trust is not a managed fund.  Unlike a managed
fund, we designed your portfolio to remain relatively fixed.  Your trust will   
generally buy and sell securities:                                              

*  to pay expenses,                                                         

*  to issue additional units or redeem units,                               

*  in limited circumstances to protect the trust,                           

*  to make required distributions or avoid imposition of taxes on the trust,
or                                                                    

*  as permitted by the trust agreement.                                     

When your trust sells securities, the composition and diversity of the      
securities in the portfolio may be altered.  Your trust will generally reject   
any offer for securities or other property in exchange for the securities in its
portfolio.  If your trust receives securities or other property, it will either 
hold the securities or property in the portfolio or sell the securities or      
property and distribute the proceeds.                                           

We may increase the size of your trust as we sell units.  When we create    
additional units, we will seek to maintain a portfolio that replicates the      
principal amounts of the securities in the portfolio.  When your trust buys     
securities, it may pay brokerage or other acquisition fees.  You could          
experience a dilution of your investment because of these fees and fluctuations 
in security prices between the time we create units and the time your trust buys
the securities.  Because the trust pays the brokerage fees associated with the  
creation of new units and with the sale of securities to meet redemption and    
exchange requests, frequent redemption and exchange activity will likely result 
in higher brokerage expenses.  When your trust buys or sells securities, we may 
direct that it place orders with and pay brokerage commissions to brokers that  
sell units or are affiliated with your trust or the trustee.                    

 In the event of a failure to deliver any bond that has been purchased for the
trust under a contract ("failed bonds"), the sponsor is authorized to purchase  
other bonds ("replacement bonds").  The trustee shall pay for replacement bonds 
out of funds held in connection with the failed bonds and will accept delivery  
of such bonds to make up the original principal of the trust.  The replacement  
bonds must be purchased within 20 days after delivery of the notice of the      
failed contract, and the purchase price (exclusive of accrued interest) may not 
exceed the principal attributable to the failed bonds.  Whenever a replacement  
bond has been acquired for the trust, the trustee shall, within five days       
thereafter, notify all unitholders of the trust of the acquisition of the       
replacement bond and shall, on the next distribution date which is more than 30 
days thereafter, make a pro

P-->485BPOS30th�Page�of�86TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�30th
rata distribution of the amount, if any, by which the cost to the trust of the  
failed bond exceeded the cost of the replacement bond.  In addition, a          
replacement bond must (at the time of purchase):                                

*  be a tax exempt bond;                                                    

 *  have a fixed maturity or disposition date comparable to that of the failed
bond it replaces;                                                     

*  be purchased at a price that results in a yield to maturity and in a     
   current return which is approximately equivalent to the yield to maturity
and current return of the failed bond which it replaces; and          

*  individually insured by BHAC.                                            

If the right of limited substitution described above shall not be used to   
acquire replacement bonds in the event of a failed contract, the sponsor will   
refund the sales charge attributable to such failed bonds to all unitholders of 
the trust, and distribute the principal attributable to such failed bonds on the
next monthly distribution date which is more than 30 days thereafter.  In the   
event a replacement bond is not acquired by the trust, the estimated net annual 
interest income per unit would be reduced and the estimated current and long-   
term returns might be lowered.                                                  

ESTIMATED CURRENT AND LONG-TERM RETURNS.  The estimated current return and  
the estimated long-term return are shown under "Essential Information" in the   
"Investment Summary" section of this prospectus as of the date set forth herein.
Estimated current return is calculated by dividing the estimated net annual     
interest income per unit by the public offering price.  The estimated net annual
interest income per unit will vary with changes in fees and expenses of your    
trust and with the default, redemption, maturity, exchange or sale of bonds.    
The public offering price will vary with changes in the price of the bonds.     
Accordingly, there is no assurance that the present estimated current return    
will be realized in the future.  Estimated long-term return is calculated using 
a formula which (1) takes into consideration, and determines and factors in the 
relative weightings of, the market values, yields (which takes into account the 
amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated          
retirements of the bonds and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales      
charge associated with units.  Since the value and estimated retirements of the 
bonds and the expenses of your trust will change, there is no assurance that the
present estimated long-term return will be realized in the future.  The         
estimated current return and estimated long-term return are expected to differ  
because the calculation of estimated long-term return reflects the estimated    
date and amount of principal returned while the estimated current return        
calculation includes only net annual interest income and public offering price. 

In order to acquire certain bonds, it may be necessary for the sponsor or   
trustee to pay amounts covering accrued interest on the bonds which exceed the  
amounts which will be made available through cash furnished by the sponsor on   
the trust's inception date.  This cash may exceed the interest which would      
accrue to the first settlement date.  The trustee has agreed to pay for any     
amounts necessary to cover any excess and will be reimbursed when funds become  
available from interest payments on the related bonds.                          

AMENDING THE TRUST AGREEMENT.  The sponsor and the trustee can change the   
trust agreement without your consent to correct any provision that may be       
defective or to make other provisions that will not adversely affect your       
interest (as determined by the sponsor and the trustee).  We

cannot change this agreement to reduce your interest in your trust without your 
consent.  Investors owning two-thirds of the units in your trust may vote to    
change this agreement.                                                          

TERMINATION OF YOUR TRUST.  Your trust will terminate upon the maturity,    
payment, redemption, sale or other liquidation of all of the securities in the  
portfolio.  The trustee may terminate your trust early if the value of the trust
is less than 40% of the original value of the securities in the trust at the    
time of deposit.  At this size, the expenses of your trust may create an undue  
burden on your investment.  Investors owning two-thirds of the units in your    
trust may also vote to terminate the trust early.  The trustee will liquidate   
the trust in the event that a sufficient number of units not yet sold to the    
public are tendered for redemption so that the net worth of the trust would be  
reduced to less than 40% of the value of the securities at the time they were   
deposited in the trust.  If this happens, we will refund any sales charge that  
you paid.                                                                       

The trustee will notify you of any termination and sell any remaining       
securities.  The trustee will send your final distribution to you within a      
reasonable time following liquidation of all the securities after deducting     
final expenses.  Your termination distribution may be less than the price you   
originally paid for your units.                                                 

 THE SPONSOR.  The sponsor of the trust is Advisors Asset Management, Inc.  We
are a broker-dealer specializing in providing trading and support services to   
broker-dealers, registered representatives, investment advisers and other       
financial professionals.  Our headquarters are located at 18925 Base Camp Road, 
Monument, Colorado 80132.  You can contact our unit investment trust division at
8100 East 22nd Street North, Suite 900B, Wichita, Kansas 67226-2309 or by using 
the contacts listed on the back cover of this prospectus.  AAM is a registered  
broker-dealer and investment adviser, a member of the Financial Industry        
Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA) and Securities Investor Protection           
Corporation (SIPC) and a registrant of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board
(MSRB).  If we fail to or cannot perform our duties as sponsor or become        
bankrupt, the trustee may replace us, continue to operate your trust without a  
sponsor, or terminate your trust.                                               

We and your trust have adopted a code of ethics requiring our employees who 
have access to information on trust transactions to report personal securities  
transactions.  The purpose of the code is to avoid potential conflicts of       
interest and to prevent fraud, deception or misconduct with respect to your     
trust.                                                                          

The sponsor or an affiliate may use the list of securities in the trust in  
its independent capacity (which may include acting as an investment adviser or  
broker-dealer) and distribute this information to various individuals and       
entities.  The sponsor or an affiliate may recommend or effect transactions in  
the securities.  This may also have an impact on the price your trust pays for  
the securities and the price received upon unit redemption or trust termination.
The sponsor may act as agent or principal in connection with the purchase and   
sale of securities, including those held by the trust, and may act as a         
specialist market maker in the securities.  The sponsor may also issue reports  
and make recommendations on the securities in the trust.  The sponsor or an     
affiliate may have participated in a public offering of one or more of the      
securities in the trust.  The sponsor, an affiliate or their employees may have 
a long or short position in these securities or related securities.  An officer,
director or employee of the sponsor or an affiliate may be an officer or        
director for the issuers of the securities.

THE TRUSTEE.  The Bank of New York Mellon is the trustee of your trust with 
its principal unit investment trust division offices located at 2 Hanson Place, 
12th Floor, Brooklyn, New York 11217.  You can contact the trustee by calling   
the telephone number on the back cover of this prospectus or by writing to its  
unit investment trust office.  We may remove and replace the trustee in some    
cases without your consent.  The trustee may also resign by notifying us and    
investors.                                                                      

PORTFOLIO CONSULTANT.  The Portfolio Consultant, SMC Fixed Income Management,
LP, is a privately owned investment manager.  In addition to providing portfolio
consulting services to the trust, the Portfolio Consultant provides investment  
management services to mutual funds, and managed accounts for high net worth    
individuals and also makes direct investments on behalf of its clients.  The    
Portfolio Consultant was founded in 2006 and is based in Princeton, New Jersey. 
The Portfolio Consultant is not an affiliate of the sponsor.  The Portfolio     
Consultant selected a list of bonds to be included in the portfolio based on the
criteria provided by the sponsor.  The Portfolio Consultant makes no            
representations that the bond portfolio will achieve the investment objectives  
or will be profitable or suitable for any particular potential investor.  The   
Portfolio Consultant cannot forecast or guarantee future results and many risk  
factors, including but not limited to market fluctuations, may effect the       
Portfolio Consultant's bond selection and the bond portfolio's performance.     
Potential clients should consult with their tax and legal advisers before making
such an investment.  The Portfolio Consultant may use the list of bonds in its  
independent capacity as an investment adviser and distribute this information to
various individuals and entities.  The Portfolio Consultant may recommend to    
other clients or otherwise effect transactions in the bonds held by the trust.  
This may have an adverse effect on the prices of the bonds.  This also may have 
an impact on the price the trust pays for the bonds and the price received upon 
unit redemptions or liquidation of the bonds.  The Portfolio Consultant also    
issues reports and makes recommendations on securities, which may include the   
bonds in the trust.  Neither the Portfolio Consultant nor the sponsor manages   
the trust.  Opinions expressed by the Portfolio Consultant are not necessarily  
those of the sponsor, and may not actually come to pass.  The Portfolio         
Consultant is being compensated for its portfolio consulting services, including
selection of this trust portfolio.  A portion of this compensation is paid by   
the trust as part of the trust's organization costs and the remainder will be   
paid by the sponsor.  The Portfolio Consultant has not independently verified,  
and shall have no liability for determining whether the bond selection criteria 
is appropriate for the investment strategy.                                     

HOW WE DISTRIBUTE UNITS.  We sell units to the public through broker-dealers
and other firms.  We pay part of the sales fee to these distribution firms when 
they sell units.  The distribution fee (the broker-dealer concession or agency  
commission) for broker-dealers and other firms is equal to 2.00% of the public  
offering price per unit.                                                        

No distribution fee is paid to broker-dealers or other selling firms in     
connection with unit sales in investment accounts that charge a "wrap fee" or   
periodic fees for investment advisory, financial planning or asset management   
services in lieu of commissions.  We reserve the right to change the amount of  
concessions or agency commissions from time to time.                            

Any sales fee discount is borne by the broker-dealer or selling firm out of 
the concession or

agency commission, except as stated above.  We reserve the right to change the  
amount of concessions or agency commissions from time to time.                  

As compensation for purchasing a portion of the unit investment trust       
business of Citigroup Global Markets Inc. ("CGMI"), we will pay CGMI an amount  
based on the total dollar amount of units of municipal bond unit investment     
trusts that we sponsor.  For this trust, this amount equaled $1.50 per $1,000 of
units of such trust at inception.  This payment will be made out of our assets  
and not from assets of a trust.                                                 

We may provide, at our own expense and out of our own profits, additional   
compensation and benefits to broker-dealers who sell shares of units of these   
trusts and our other products.  This compensation is intended to result in      
additional sales of our products and/or compensate broker-dealers and financial 
advisors for past sales.  We may make these payments for marketing, promotional 
or related expenses, including, but not limited to, expenses of entertaining    
retail customers and financial advisors, advertising, sponsorship of events or  
seminars, obtaining shelf space in broker-dealer firms and similar activities   
designed to promote the sale of our products.  These arrangements will not      
change the price you pay for your units.                                        

 We generally register units for sale in various states in the U.S.  We do not
register units for sale in any foreign country.  This prospectus does not       
constitute an offer of units in any state or country where units cannot be      
offered or sold lawfully.  We may reject any order for units in whole or in     
part.                                                                           

We may gain or lose money when we hold units in the primary or secondary    
market due to fluctuations in unit prices.  The gain or loss is equal to the    
difference between the price we pay for units and the price at which we sell or 
redeem them.  We may also gain or lose money when we deposit securities to      
create units.                                                                   

 TAXES

 This section summarizes some of the main U.S. federal income tax consequences
of owning units of the trust.  This section is current as of the date of this   
prospectus.  Tax laws and interpretations change frequently, and these summaries
do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers.  For example,     
these summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a           
corporation, a non-U.S. person, a broker/dealer, or other investor with special 
circumstances.  In addition, this section does not describe your state, local or
foreign tax consequences.                                                       

 This federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice and opinion of
counsel to the sponsor.  The Internal Revenue Service could disagree with any   
conclusions set forth in this section.  In addition, our counsel was not asked  
to review, and has not reached a conclusion with respect to the federal income  
tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in the trust.  This may not be      
sufficient for you to use for the purpose of avoiding penalties under federal   
tax law.                                                                        

As with any investment, you should seek advice based on your individual     
circumstances from your own tax advisor.                                        

TRUST STATUS.  The trust intends to qualify as a "regulated investment      
company" under the federal tax laws.  If the trust qualifies as a regulated     
investment company and distributes its income as required by the tax law, the   
trust generally will not pay federal income taxes.                              

32     Understanding Your Investment                                            

P-->485BPOS34th�Page�of�86TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�34th
DISTRIBUTIONS.  After the end of each year, you will receive a tax statement
that separates your trust's distributions into four categories, exempt-interest 
dividends, ordinary income distributions, capital gains dividends and return of 
capital.  Exempt-interest dividends generally are excluded from your gross      
income for federal income tax purposes.  Some or all of the exempt-interest     
dividends, however, may be taken into account in determining your alternative   
minimum tax and may have other tax consequences (e.g., they may affect the      
amount of your social security benefits that are taxed).                        

Ordinary income distributions are generally taxed at your ordinary tax rate.
Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as long-term capital gains
regardless of how long you have owned your units.  See "Capital Gains and
Losses" below for information about the capital gains tax rate.  To determine   
your actual tax liability for your capital gains dividends, you must calculate  
your total net capital gain or loss for the tax year after considering all of   
your other taxable transactions, as described below.  In addition, the trust may
make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes and thus 
will generally not be taxable to you.  The tax status of your distributions from
your trust is not affected by whether you reinvest your distributions in        
additional shares or receive them in cash.  The income from your trust that you 
must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by amounts
used to pay a deferred sales fee, if any.  The tax laws may require you to treat
certain distributions made to you in January as if you had received them on     
December 31 of the previous year.                                               

DIVIDENDS RECEIVED DEDUCTION.  A corporation that owns units generally will 
not be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to dividends   
received from the trust because the dividends received deduction is generally   
not available for distributions from regulated investment companies.            

SALE OR REDEMPTION OF UNITS.  If you sell or redeem your units, you will    
generally recognize a taxable gain or loss.  To determine the amount of this    
gain or loss, you must subtract your tax basis in your units from the amount you
receive in the transaction.                                                     

Your tax basis in your units is generally equal to the cost of your units,  
generally including sales charges.  In some cases, however, you may have to     
adjust your tax basis after you purchase your units.  Further, if you hold your 
shares for six months or less, any loss incurred by you related to the          
disposition of such a share will be disallowed to the extent of the exempt-     
interest dividends you received.                                                

CAPITAL GAINS AND LOSSES.  If you are an individual, the maximum marginal   
federal tax rate for net capital gain is generally 15% (generally 5% for certain
taxpayers in the 10% and 15% tax brackets).  These capital gains rates are      
generally effective for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2011.  For    
later periods, if you are an individual, the maximum marginal federal tax rate  
for net capital gain is generally 20% (10% for certain taxpayers in the 10% and 
15% tax brackets).  The 20% rate is reduced to 18% and the 10% rate is reduced  
to 8% for long-term capital gains from most property acquired after December 31,
2000 with a holding period of more than five years.                             

Net capital gain equals net long-term capital gain minus net short-term     
capital loss for the taxable year.  Capital gain or loss is long-term if the    
holding period for the asset is more than one year and is short-term if the     
holding period for the asset is one year or less.  You must exclude the date    

                                            Understanding Your Investment     33

P-->485BPOS35th�Page�of�86TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�35th
you purchase your units to determine your holding period.  However, if you      
receive a capital gain dividend from your trust and sell your unit at a loss    
after holding it for six months or less, the loss will be disallowed to the     
extent of the exempt-interest dividends you received.  To the extent, if any, it
is not disallowed, it will be recharacterized as long-term capital loss to the  
extent of the capital gain dividend received.  The tax rates for capital gains  
realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as for    
ordinary income.  The Internal Revenue Code treats certain capital gains as     
ordinary income in special situations.                                          

EXCHANGES.  If you elect to have your proceeds from your trust rolled over  
into a future series of the trust, the exchange would generally be considered a 
sale for federal income tax purposes.                                           

DEDUCTIBILITY OF TRUST EXPENSES.  Expenses incurred and deducted by your    
trust will generally not be treated as income taxable to you.  In some cases,   
however, you may be required to treat your portion of these trust expenses as   
income.  In these cases you may be able to take a deduction for these expenses. 
However, certain miscellaneous itemized deductions, such as investment expenses,
may be deducted by individuals only to the extent that all of these deductions  
exceed 2% of the individual's adjusted gross income.  Further, because the trust
pays exempt-interest dividends, which are treated as exempt interest for federal
income tax purposes, you will not be able to deduct some of your interest       
expense for debt that you incur or continue to purchase or carry your shares.   

EXPENSES

Your trust will pay various expenses to conduct its operations.  The "Fees
and Expenses" section of the "Investment Summary" in this prospectus shows the  
estimated amount of these expenses.                                             

Your trust will pay a fee to the trustee for its services.  The trustee also
benefits when it holds cash for your trust in non-interest bearing accounts.    
Your trust will reimburse us as supervisor, evaluator and sponsor for providing 
portfolio supervisory services, for evaluating your portfolio and for providing 
bookkeeping and administrative services.  Our reimbursements may exceed the     
costs of the services we provide to your trust but will not exceed the costs of 
services provided to all of our unit investment trusts in any calendar year.    
All of these fees may adjust for inflation without your approval.               

Your trust will also pay its general operating expenses.  Your trust may pay
expenses such as trustee expenses (including legal and auditing expenses),      
various governmental charges, fees for extraordinary trustee services, costs of 
taking action to protect your trust, costs of indemnifying the trustee and the  
sponsor, legal fees and expenses, expenses incurred in contacting you and costs 
incurred to reimburse the trustee for advancing funds to meet distributions.    
Your trust may pay the costs of updating its registration statement each year.  
The trustee will generally pay trust expenses from interest income and principal
payments received on the securities but in some cases may sell securities to pay
trust expenses.                                                                 

 EXPERTS

LEGAL MATTERS.  Chapman and Cutler LLP acts as counsel for the trust and has
given an opinion that the units are validly issued.  Dorsey & Whitney LLP acts  
as counsel for the trustee.                                                     

INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM.  Grant Thornton LLP,         
independent registered public accounting firm, audited the financial statements 
in this prospectus.

 TAXABLE EQUIVALENT ESTIMATED CURRENT RETURN

As of the date of the prospectus, the following table shows the approximate 
taxable estimated current returns for individuals that are equivalent to tax-   
exempt estimated current returns under United States federal taxes using the    
published marginal federal tax rates scheduled to be in effect in 2010.  The    
table illustrates approximately what you would have to earn on taxable          
investments to equal the tax-exempt estimated current return in your income tax 
bracket.  The table does not reflect any state or local taxes, any alternative  
minimum taxes or any taxes other than federal personal income taxes.  The table 
does not show the approximate taxable estimated current returns for individuals 
that are subject to the alternative minimum tax.  The tables do not reflect the 
effect of federal or state limitations (if any) on the amount of allowable      
credits.  See "Understanding Your Investment--Taxes" for a more detailed        
discussion of federal tax issues.

GENERAL INFORMATION                                                             

  Each trust is one of a series of separate unit investment trusts created
under the name Advisors Disciplined Trust and registered under the Investment   
Company Act of 1940.  Each trust was created as a common law trust on the       
inception date described in the prospectus under the laws of the state of       
New York.  Each trust was created under a trust agreement among Advisors Asset  
Management, Inc. (as sponsor, evaluator and supervisor) and The Bank of New York
Mellon (as trustee).  The sponsor provides services to unit investment trusts   
through its Advisor's Asset Management division.                                

When your trust was created, the sponsor delivered to the trustee     
securities or contracts for the purchase thereof for deposit in the trust and   
the trustee delivered to the sponsor documentation evidencing the ownership of  
units of the trust.  Additional units of each trust may be issued from time to  
time by depositing in the trust additional securities (or contracts for the     
purchase thereof together with cash or irrevocable letters of credit) or cash   
(including a letter of credit or the equivalent) with instructions to purchase  
additional securities.  As additional units are issued by a trust as a result of
the deposit of additional securities by the sponsor, the aggregate value of the 
securities in the trust will be increased and the fractional undivided interest 
in the trust represented by each unit will be decreased.  The sponsor may       
continue to make additional deposits of securities into a trust, provided that  
such additional deposits will be in principal amounts which will generally      
maintain the same original percentage relationship among the principal amounts  
of the securities in such trust established by the initial deposit of the       
securities.  Thus, although additional units will be issued, each unit will     
generally continue to represent the same principal amount of each security, and 
the percentage relationship among the principal amount of each security in the  
related trust will generally remain the same.  If the sponsor deposits cash to  
purchase additional securities, existing and new investors may experience a     
dilution of their investments and a reduction in their anticipated income       
because of fluctuations in the prices of the securities between the time of the 
cash deposit and the purchase of the securities and because the trust will pay  
any associated brokerage fees.                                                  

The trustee has not participated in the selection of the securities   
deposited in the trust and has no responsibility for the composition of the     
trust portfolio.                                                                

     Each unit initially offered represents an undivided interest in the related
trust.  To the extent that any units are redeemed by the trustee or additional  
units are issued as a result of additional securities being deposited by the    
sponsor, the fractional undivided interest in a trust represented by each       
unredeemed unit will increase or decrease accordingly, although the actual      
interest in such trust represented by such fraction will remain unchanged.      
Units will remain outstanding until redeemed upon tender to the trustee by      
unitholders, which may include the sponsor, or until the termination of the     
trust agreement.                                                                

A trust consists of (a) the securities listed under the "Schedule of  
Investments" in the prospectus as may continue to be held from time to time in  
the trust, (b) any additional securities acquired and held by the trust pursuant
to the provisions of the trust agreement and (c) any cash held in the accounts  
of the trust.  Neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way   
for any failure in any of the securities.  However, should any contract for the 
purchase of any of the securities initially deposited in a trust fail, the      
sponsor will, unless substantially all of the moneys held in the trust to cover 
such purchase

are reinvested in substitute securities in accordance with the trust agreement, 
refund the cash and sales charge attributable to such failed contract to all    
unitholders on the next distribution date.                                      

INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE AND POLICIES                                               

    The trust seeks to provide monthly distributions of interest income exempt
from United States federal personal income tax and to provide capital           
preservation by investing in a portfolio primarily consisting of long-term      
municipal bonds.  There is, of course, no guarantee that the trust will achieve 
its objective.  The trust portfolio consists of interest-bearing obligations    
issued by or on behalf of states and territories of the United States, and      
political subdivisions and authorities thereof, the interest on which is        
excludable from gross income for United States federal personal income tax      
purposes under existing law in the opinion of recognized bond counsel to the    
issuer of the bonds.  The prospectus provides additional information regarding  
the trust's objective and investment strategy.                                  

     The trust is a unit investment trust and is not an "actively managed" fund.
Traditional methods of investment management for a managed fund typically       
involve frequent changes in a portfolio of securities on the basis of economic, 
financial and market analysis.  The portfolio of a trust, however, will not be  
actively managed and therefore the adverse financial condition of an issuer will
not necessarily require the sale of its securities from a portfolio.            

     The sponsor may not alter the portfolio of a trust by the purchase, sale or
substitution of securities, except in the special circumstances discussed herein
regarding the substitution of replacement securities for any failed securities. 
Thus, with the exception of the redemption or maturity of securities in         
accordance with their terms, the assets of a trust will remain unchanged under  
normal circumstances.                                                           

  The sponsor may direct the trustee to dispose of securities the value of
which has been affected by certain adverse events including institution of      
certain legal proceedings or decline in price or the occurrence of other market 
factors, including advance refunding, so that in the opinion of the sponsor the 
retention of such securities in a trust would be detrimental to the interest of 
the unitholders.  The proceeds from any such sales, exclusive of any portion    
which represents accrued interest, will be credited to the Principal Account of 
such trust for distribution to the unitholders.                                 

     The sponsor is required to instruct the trustee to reject any offer made by
an issuer of securities to issue new securities, or to exchange securities, for 
trust securities, the trustee shall reject such offer.  However, should any     
issuance, exchange or substitution be effected notwithstanding such rejection or
without an initial offer, any securities or property received shall be deposited
in the trust and shall be promptly sold by the trustee unless the sponsor       
advises the trustee to keep such securities or properties.  The excess cash     
proceeds of any such sales will be distributed to unitholders.                  

If a public tender offer has been made for a security or a merger,    
acquisition or similar transaction has been announced affecting a security, the 
trustee may either sell the security or accept a tender offer if the supervisor 
determines that the action is in the best interest of unitholders.  The trustee 
will distribute any excess cash proceeds to unitholders.  If your trust receives
securities or other property, it will either hold the securities or property in 
the portfolio or sell the securities or property and distribute the proceeds.   
The sponsor may direct the reinvestment of security sale proceeds if the sale is

 -3-

P-->485BPOS42nd�Page�of�86TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�42nd
the direct result of serious adverse credit factors which, in the opinion of the
sponsor, would make retention of the securities detrimental to the trust.  In   
such a case, the sponsor may, but is not obligated to, direct the reinvestment  
of sale proceeds in any other securities that meet the criteria for inclusion in
the trust on the trust's inception date. The sponsor may also instruct the      
trustee to take action necessary to ensure that the portfolio continues to      
satisfy the qualifications of a regulated investment company for federal tax    
purposes if the trust has elected to be taxed as a regulated investment company.

  The trustee may sell securities, designated by the sponsor, from a trust
for the purpose of redeeming units of such trust tendered for redemption and the
payment of expenses.                                                            

   In addition, if a trust has elected to be taxed as a regulated investment
company, the trustee may dispose of certain securities and take such further    
action as may be needed from time to time to ensure that a trust continues to   
satisfy the qualifications of a regulated investment company, including the     
requirements with respect to diversification under Section 851 of the Internal  
Revenue Code, and as may be needed from time to time to avoid the imposition of 
any tax on a trust or undistributed income of a trust as a regulated investment 
company.                                                                        

   Proceeds from the sale of securities (or any securities or other property
received by a trust in exchange for securities) are credited to the Principal   
Account of a trust for distribution to unitholders or to meet redemptions.      
Except for failed securities and as provided herein, in the prospectus or in the
trust agreement, the acquisition by a trust of any securities other than the    
portfolio securities is prohibited.                                             

     Because certain of the securities in certain of the trusts may from time to
time under certain circumstances be sold or redeemed or will mature in          
accordance with their terms and because the proceeds from such events will be   
distributed to unitholders and will not be reinvested, no assurance can be given
that a trust will retain for any length of time its present size and            
composition.  Neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for
any default, failure or defect in any security.  In the event of a failure to   
deliver any security that has been purchased for a trust under a contract,      
including those securities purchased on a "when, as and if issued" basis        
("Failed Securities"), the sponsor is authorized under the trust agreement to   
direct the trustee to acquire other securities ("Replacement Securities") to    
make up the original corpus of such trust.                                      

    Securities in certain of the trusts may have been purchased on a "when, as
and if issued" or delayed delivery basis with delivery expected to take place   
after the first settlement date.  Accordingly, the delivery of such securities  
may be delayed or may not occur.  Interest on these securities begins accruing  
to the benefit of unitholders on their respective dates of delivery.            
Unitholders of all trusts will be "at risk" with respect to any "when, as and if
issued" or "delayed delivery" securities included in their respective trust     
(i.e., may derive either gain or loss from fluctuations in the evaluation of    
such securities) from the date they commit for units.                           

    The Replacement Securities must be purchased within 20 days after delivery
of the notice that a contract to deliver a security will not be honored and the 
purchase price may not exceed the amount of funds reserved for the purchase of  
the Failed Securities.  The purchase price of the Replacement Securities        
(exclusive of accrued interest) shall not exceed the principal attributable to  
the Failed                                                                      

 -4-

Securities. In addition, no substitution of Replacement Securities will be made 
without an opinion of counsel that such substitution will not adversely affect  
the federal income tax status of the related trust.  Whenever a Replacement     
Security is acquired for a trust, the trustee shall, within five days           
thereafter, notify all unitholders of the trust of the acquisition of the       
Replacement Security and shall, on the next monthly distribution date which is  
more than 30 days thereafter, make a pro rata distribution of the amount, if    
any, by which the cost to the trust of the Failed Security exceeded the cost of 
the Replacement Security.  Once all of the securities in a trust are acquired,  
the trustee will have no power to vary the investments of the trust, i.e., the  
trustee will have no managerial power to take advantage of market variations to 
improve a unitholder's investment.                                              

    If the right of limited substitution described in the preceding paragraphs
is not utilized to acquire Replacement Securities in the event of a failed      
contract, the sponsor will refund the sales fee attributable to such Failed     
Securities to all unitholders of the trust and the trustee will distribute the  
principal and accrued interest attributable to such Failed Securities not more  
than 30 days after the date on which the trustee would have been required to    
purchase a Replacement Security.  In addition, unitholders should be aware that,
at the time of receipt of such principal, they may not be able to reinvest such 
proceeds in other securities at a yield equal to or in excess of the yield which
such proceeds would have earned for unitholders of such trust.                  

   Whether or not a Replacement Security is acquired, an amount equal to the
accrued interest (at the coupon rate of the Failed Securities) will be paid to  
unitholders of the trust to the date the sponsor removes the Failed Securities  
from the trust if the sponsor determines not to purchase a Replacement Security 
or to the date of substitution if a Replacement Security is purchased.  All such
interest paid to unitholders which accrued after the date of settlement for a   
purchase of units will be paid by the sponsor.  In the event a Replacement      
Security could not be acquired by a trust, the net annual interest income per   
unit for such trust would be reduced and the estimated current return and       
estimated long-term return might be lowered.                                    

  Subsequent to the trust's inception, a security may cease to be rated or
its rating may be reduced below any minimum required as of the trust's          
inception.  Neither event requires the elimination of such investment from a    
trust, but may be considered in the sponsor's determination to direct the       
trustee to dispose of such investment.                                          

The sponsor may not alter the portfolio of a trust except upon the    
happening of certain extraordinary circumstances.  Certain of the securities may
be subject to optional call or mandatory redemption pursuant to sinking fund    
provisions, in each case prior to their stated maturity.  A bond subject to     
optional call is one which is subject to redemption or refunding prior to       
maturity at the option of the issuer, often at a premium over par.  A refunding 
is a method by which a bond issue is redeemed, at or before maturity, by the    
proceeds of a new bond issue.  A bond subject to sinking fund redemption is one 
which is subject to partial call from time to time at par with proceeds from a  
fund accumulated for the scheduled retirement of a portion of an issue to       
maturity.  Special or extraordinary redemption provisions may provide for       
redemption at par of all or a portion of an issue upon the occurrence of certain
circumstances.  Redemption pursuant to optional call provisions is more likely  
to occur, and redemption pursuant to special or extraordinary redemption        
provisions may occur, when the securities have an offering side evaluation which
represents a premium over par, that is, when they are able to be                

 -5-

P-->485BPOS44th�Page�of�86TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�44th
refinanced at a lower cost.  The proceeds from any such call or redemption      
pursuant to sinking fund provisions, as well as proceeds from the sale of       
securities and from securities which mature in accordance with their terms from 
a trust, unless utilized to pay for units tendered for redemption, will be      
distributed to unitholders of such trust and will not be used to purchase       
additional securities for such trust.  Accordingly, any such call, redemption,  
sale or maturity will reduce the size and diversity of a trust and the net      
annual interest income of such trust and may reduce the estimated current return
and the estimated long-term return.  The call, redemption, sale or maturity of  
securities also may have tax consequences to a unitholder.                      

   Certain of the securities in certain of the trusts may have been acquired
at a market discount from par value at maturity.  The coupon interest rates on  
the discount securities at the time they were purchased and deposited in the    
trusts were lower than the current market interest rates for newly issued bonds 
of comparable rating and type.  If such interest rates for newly issued         
comparable securities increase, the market discount of previously issued        
securities will become greater, and if such interest rates for newly issued     
comparable securities decline, the market discount of previously issued         
securities will be reduced, other things being equal.  Investors should also    
note that the value of securities purchased at a market discount will increase  
in value faster than securities purchased at a market premium if interest rates 
decrease.  Conversely, if interest rates increase, the value of securities      
purchased at a market discount will decrease faster than securities purchased at
a market premium.  In addition, if interest rates rise, the prepayment risk of  
higher yielding, premium securities and the prepayment benefit for lower        
yielding, discount securities will be reduced.  A discount security held to     
maturity will have a larger portion of its total return in the form of taxable  
income and capital gain and loss in the form of tax-exempt interest income than 
a comparable security newly issued at current market rates.  Market discount    
attributable to interest changes does not indicate a lack of market confidence  
in the issue.  Neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way   
for any default, failure or defect in any of the securities.                    

     Certain of the securities in the trust may be "zero coupon" bonds, i.e., an
original issue discount bond that does not provide for the payment of current   
interest.  Zero coupon bonds are purchased at a deep discount because the buyer 
receives only the right to receive a final payment at the maturity of the bond  
and does not receive any periodic interest payments.  The effect of owning deep 
discount bonds which do not make current interest payments (such as the zero    
coupon bonds) is that a fixed yield is earned not only on the original          
investment but also, in effect, on all discount earned during the life of such  
obligation.  This implicit reinvestment of earnings at the same rate eliminates 
the risk of being unable to reinvest the income on such obligation at a rate as 
high as the implicit yield on the discount obligation, but at the same time     
eliminates the holder's ability to reinvest at higher rates in the future.  For 
this reason, zero coupon bonds are subject to substantially greater price       
fluctuations during periods of changing market interest rates than are          
securities of comparable quality which pay interest currently.                  

   To the best of the sponsor's knowledge, there is no litigation pending as
of the trust's inception in respect of any security which might reasonably be   
expected to have a material adverse effect on the trust.  At any time after the 
trust's inception, litigation may be instituted on a variety of grounds with    
respect to the securities.  The sponsor is unable to predict whether any such   
litigation may be instituted, or if instituted, whether such litigation might   
have a material adverse effect on the trust.  The sponsor and the trustee shall 
not be liable in any way for any default, failure or defect in any security.

RISK FACTORS                                                                    

     MUNICIPAL BONDS. The trusts include certain types of bonds described below.
Accordingly, an investment in a trust should be made with an understanding of   
the characteristics of and risks associated with such bonds. The types of bonds 
included in each trust are described in the prospectus. Neither the sponsor nor 
the trustee shall be liable in any way for any default, failure or defect in any
of the bonds.                                                                   

  Certain of the bonds may be general obligations of a governmental entity
that are backed by the taxing power of such entity. All other bonds in the      
trusts are revenue bonds payable from the income of a specific project or       
authority and are not supported by the issuer's power to levy taxes. General    
obligation bonds are secured by the issuer's pledge of its faith, credit and    
taxing power for the payment of principal and interest. Revenue bonds, on the   
other hand, are payable only from the revenues derived from a particular        
facility or class of facilities or, in some cases, from the proceeds of a       
special excise tax or other specific revenue source. There are, of course,      
variations in the security of the different bonds in a trust, both within a     
particular classification and between classifications, depending on numerous    
factors.                                                                        

  Certain of the bonds may be obligations which derive their payments from
mortgage loans. Certain of such housing bonds may be FHA insured or may be      
single family mortgage revenue bonds issued for the purpose of acquiring from   
originating financial institutions notes secured by mortgages on residences     
located within the issuer's boundaries and owned by persons of low or moderate  
income. Mortgage loans are generally partially or completely prepaid prior to   
their final maturities as a result of events such as sale of the mortgaged      
premises, default, condemnation or casualty loss. Because these bonds are       
subject to extraordinary mandatory redemption in whole or in part from such     
prepayments of mortgage loans, a substantial portion of such bonds will probably
be redeemed prior to their scheduled maturities or even prior to their ordinary 
call dates. Extraordinary mandatory redemption without premium could also result
from the failure of the originating financial institutions to make mortgage     
loans in sufficient amounts within a specified time period. Additionally,       
unusually high rates of default on the underlying mortgage loans may reduce     
revenues available for the payment of principal of or interest on such mortgage 
revenue bonds. These bonds were issued under Section 103A of the Internal       
Revenue Code, which Section contains certain requirements relating to the use of
the proceeds of such bonds in order for the interest on such bonds to retain its
tax-exempt status. In each case the issuer of the bonds has covenanted to comply
with applicable requirements and bond counsel to such issuer has issued an      
opinion that the interest on the bonds is exempt from Federal income tax under  
existing laws and regulations. Certain issuers of housing bonds have considered 
various ways to redeem bonds they have issued prior to the stated first         
redemption dates for such bonds. In connection with the housing bonds held by a 
trust, the sponsor at the date of deposit is not aware that any of the          
respective issuers of such bonds are actively considering the redemption of such
bonds prior to their respective stated initial call dates.                      

 Certain of the bonds may be health care revenue bonds. Ratings of bonds
issued for health care facilities are often based on feasibility studies that   
contain projections of occupancy levels, revenues and expenses. A facility's    
gross receipts and net income available for debt service may be affected by     
future events and conditions including, among other things, demand for services 
and the ability of the facility to provide the services required, physicians'   
confidence in the facility, management capabilities, competition                

 -7-

P-->485BPOS46th�Page�of�86TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�46th
with other health care facilities, efforts by insurers and governmental agencies
to limit rates, legislation establishing state rate-setting agencies, expenses, 
the cost and possible unavailability of malpractice insurance, the funding of   
Medicare, Medicaid and other similar third party pay or programs, government    
regulation and the termination or restriction of governmental financial         
assistance, including that associated with Medicare, Medicaid and other similar 
third party pay or programs.                                                    

Certain of the bonds may be obligations of public utility issuers,    
including those selling wholesale and retail electric power and gas. General    
problems of such issuers would include the difficulty in financing large        
construction programs in an inflationary period, the limitations on operations  
and increased costs and delays attributable to environmental considerations, the
difficulty of the capital market in absorbing utility debt, the difficulty in   
obtaining fuel at reasonable prices and the effect of energy conservation. In   
addition, Federal, state and municipal governmental authorities may from time to
time review existing, and impose additional, regulations governing the          
licensing, construction and operation of nuclear power plants, which may        
adversely affect the ability of the issuers of certain of the bonds to make     
payments of principal and/or interest on such bonds.                            

Certain of the bonds may be obligations of issuers whose revenues are 
derived from the sale of water and/or sewerage services. Such bonds are         
generally payable from user fees. The problems of such issuers include the      
ability to obtain timely and adequate rate increases, population decline        
resulting in decreased user fees, the difficulty of financing large construction
programs, the limitations on operations and increased costs and delays          
attributable to environmental considerations, the increasing difficulty of      
obtaining or discovering new supplies of fresh water, the effect of conservation
programs and the impact of "no-growth" zoning ordinances.                       

  Certain of the bonds may be industrial revenue bonds ("IRBs"). IRBs have
generally been issued under bond resolutions pursuant to which the revenues and 
receipts payable under the arrangements with the operator of a particular       
project have been assigned and pledged to purchasers. In some cases, a mortgage 
on the underlying project may have been granted as security for the IRBs.       
Regardless of the structure, payment of IRBs is solely dependent upon the       
creditworthiness of the corporate operator of the project or corporate          
guarantor. Corporate operators or guarantors may be affected by many factors    
which may have an adverse impact on the credit quality of the particular company
or industry. These include cyclicality of revenues and earnings, regulatory and 
environmental restrictions, litigation resulting from accidents or              
environmentally-caused illnesses, extensive competition and financial           
deterioration resulting from a corporate restructuring pursuant to a leveraged  
buy-out, takeover or otherwise. Such a restructuring may result in the operator 
of a project becoming highly leveraged which may impact on such operator's      
creditworthiness which in turn would have an adverse impact on the rating and/or
market value of such bonds. Further, the possibility of such a restructuring may
have an adverse impact on the market for and consequently the value of such     
bonds, even though no actual takeover or other action is ever contemplated or   
effected.                                                                       

    Certain of the bonds may be obligations that are secured by lease payments
of a governmental entity (hereinafter called "lease obligations"). Lease        
obligations are often in the form of certificates of participation. Although the
lease obligations do not constitute general obligations of the municipality for 
which the municipality's taxing power is pledged, a lease obligation is         
ordinarily backed by the municipality's covenant to appropriate for and make the
payments due under the lease obligation.                                        

 -8-

P-->485BPOS47th�Page�of�86TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�47th
However, certain lease obligations contain "non-appropriation" clauses which    
provide that the municipality has no obligation to make lease payments in future
years unless money is appropriated for such purpose on a yearly basis. A        
governmental entity that enters into such a lease agreement cannot obligate     
future governments to appropriate for and make lease payments but covenants to  
take such action as is necessary to include any lease payments due in its       
budgets and to make the appropriations therefor. A governmental entity's failure
to appropriate for and to make payments under its lease obligation could result 
in insufficient funds available for payment of the obligations secured thereby. 
Although "non-appropriation" lease obligations are secured by the leased        
property, disposition of the property in the event of foreclosure might prove   
difficult.                                                                      

Certain of the bonds may be obligations of issuers which are, or which
govern the operation of, schools, colleges and universities and whose revenues  
are derived mainly from ad valorem taxes or for higher education systems, from  
tuition, dormitory revenues, grants and endowments. General problems relating to
school bonds include litigation contesting the state constitutionality of       
financing public education in part from ad valorem taxes, thereby creating a    
disparity in educational funds available to schools in wealthy areas and schools
in poor areas. Litigation or legislation on this issue may affect the sources of
funds available for the payment of school bonds in the trusts. General problems 
relating to college and university obligations include the prospect of a        
declining percentage of the population consisting of "college" age individuals, 
possible inability to raise tuitions and fees sufficiently to cover increased   
operating costs, the uncertainty of continued receipt of Federal grants and     
state funding, and government legislation or regulations which may adversely    
affect the revenues or costs of such issuers.                                   

    Certain of the bonds in certain of the trusts may be obligations which are
payable from and secured by revenues derived from the ownership and operation of
facilities such as airports, bridges, turnpikes, port authorities, convention   
centers and arenas. The major portion of an airport's gross operating income is 
generally derived from fees received from signatory airlines pursuant to use    
agreements which consist of annual payments for leases, occupancy of certain    
terminal space and service fees. Airport operating income may therefore be      
affected by the ability of the airlines to meet their obligations under the use 
agreements. From time to time the air transport industry has experienced        
significant variations in earnings and traffic, due to increased competition,   
excess capacity, increased costs, deregulation, traffic constraints and other   
factors, and several airlines have experienced severe financial difficulties.   
Similarly, payment on bonds related to other facilities is dependent on revenues
from the projects, such as user fees from ports, tolls on turnpikes and bridges 
and rents from buildings. Therefore, payment may be adversely affected by       
reduction in revenues due to such factors as increased cost of maintenance,     
decreased use of a facility, lower cost of alternative modes of transportation, 
scarcity of fuel and reduction or loss of rents.                                

    Certain of the bonds may be obligations which are payable from and secured
by revenues derived from the operation of resource recovery facilities. Resource
recovery facilities are designed to process solid waste, generate steam and     
convert steam to electricity. Resource recovery bonds may be subject to         
extraordinary optional redemption at par upon the occurrence of certain         
circumstances, including but not limited to: destruction or condemnation of a   
project; contracts relating to a project becoming void, unenforceable or        
impossible to perform; changes in the economic availability of raw materials,   
operating supplies or facilities necessary for the operation of a project or    
technological or other unavoidable changes adversely affecting the operation of 
a project; and administrative or judicial                                       

 -9-

P-->485BPOS48th�Page�of�86TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�48th
actions which render contracts relating to the projects void, unenforceable or  
impossible to perform or impose unreasonable burdens or excessive liabilities.  
The sponsor cannot predict the causes or likelihood of the redemption of        
resource recovery bonds in a trust prior to the stated maturity of the bonds.   

   Certain of the bonds may have been acquired at a market discount from par
value at maturity. The coupon interest rates on discount bonds at the time they 
were purchased and deposited in a trust were lower than the current market      
interest rates for newly issued bonds of comparable rating and type. If such    
interest rates for newly issued comparable bonds increase, the market discount  
of previously issued bonds will become greater, and if such interest rates for  
newly issued comparable bonds decline, the market discount of previously issued 
bonds will be reduced, other things being equal. Investors should also note that
the value of bonds purchased at a market discount will increase in value faster 
than bonds purchased at a market premium if interest rates decrease. Conversely,
if interest rates increase, the value of bonds purchased at a market discount   
will decrease faster than bonds purchased at a market premium. In addition, if  
interest rates rise, the prepayment risk of higher yielding, premium bonds and  
the prepayment benefit for lower yielding, discount bonds will be reduced. A    
bond purchased at a market discount and held to maturity will have a larger     
portion of its total return in the form of taxable income and capital gain and  
less in the form of tax-exempt interest income than a comparable bond newly     
issued at current market rates. Market discount attributable to interest changes
does not indicate a lack of market confidence in the issue.  Neither the sponsor
nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any default, failure or defect in
any of the bonds.                                                               

   Certain of the bonds held by the trust may have been acquired at a market
premium from par value at maturity.  The coupon interest rates on the premium   
bonds at the time they were purchased by the trust were higher than the current 
market interest rates for newly issued bonds of comparable rating and type.  If 
such interest rates for newly issued and otherwise comparable bonds decrease,   
the market premium of previously issued bonds will be increased, and if such    
interest rates for newly issued comparable bonds increase, the market premium of
previously issued bonds will be reduced, other things being equal.  The current 
returns of bonds trading at a market premium are initially higher than the      
current returns of comparable bonds of a similar type issued at currently       
prevailing interest rates because premium bonds tend to decrease in market value
as they approach maturity when the face amount becomes payable.  Because part of
the purchase price is thus returned not at maturity but through current income  
payments, early redemption of a premium bond at par or early prepayments of     
principal will result in a reduction in yield.  Redemption pursuant to call     
provisions generally will, and redemption pursuant to sinking fund provisions   
may, occur at times when the redeemed bonds have an offering side valuation     
which represents a premium over par or for original issue discount bonds a      
premium over the accreted value.                                                

Certain of the bonds may be "zero coupon" bonds. Zero coupon bonds are
purchased at a deep discount because the buyer receives only the right to       
receive a final payment at the maturity of the bond and does not receive any    
periodic interest payments. The effect of owning deep discount bonds which do   
not make current interest payments (such as the zero coupon bonds) is that a    
fixed yield is earned not only on the original investment but also, in effect,  
on all discount earned during the life of such obligation. This implicit        
reinvestment of earnings at the same rate eliminates the risk of being unable to
reinvest the income on such obligation at a rate as high as the implicit yield  
on the discount obligation,                                                     

-10-

P-->485BPOS49th�Page�of�86TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�49th
but at the same time eliminates the holder's ability to reinvest at higher rates
in the future. For this reason, zero coupon bonds are subject to substantially  
greater price fluctuations during periods of changing market interest rates than
are securities of comparable quality which pay interest.                        

    Certain of the bonds may have been purchased on a "when, as and if issued"
or "delayed delivery" basis. See "Notes to Portfolio" in the prospectus. The    
delivery of any such bonds may be delayed or may not occur. Interest on these   
Bonds begins accruing to the benefit of unitholders on their respective dates of
delivery. To the extent any bonds are actually delivered to a trust after their 
respective expected dates of delivery, unitholders who purchase their unit prior
to the date such bonds are actually delivered to the trustee would be required  
to adjust their tax basis in their unit for a portion of the interest accruing  
on such bonds during the interval between their purchase of unit and the actual 
delivery of such bonds. As a result of any such adjustment, the Estimated       
Current Returns during the first year would be slightly lower than those stated 
in the Prospectus which would be the returns after the first year, assuming the 
portfolio of a trust and estimated annual expenses other than that of the       
trustee (which may be reduced in the first year only) do not vary from that set 
forth in the prospectus. Unitholders will be "at risk" with respect to all bonds
in the portfolios including "when, as and if issued" and "delayed delivery"     
bonds (i.e., may derive either gain or loss from fluctuations in the evaluation 
of such bonds) from the date they commit for unit.                              

 Certain of the bonds may be subject to redemption prior to their stated
maturity date pursuant to sinking fund provisions, call provisions or           
extraordinary optional or mandatory redemption provisions or otherwise. A       
sinking fund is a reserve fund accumulated over a period of time for retirement 
of debt. A callable debt obligation is one which is subject to redemption or    
refunding prior to maturity at the option of the issuer. A refunding is a method
by which a debt obligation is redeemed, at or before maturity, by the proceeds  
of a new debt obligation. In general, call provisions are more likely to be     
exercised when the offering side valuation is at a premium over par than when it
is at a discount from par. The exercise of redemption or call provisions will   
(except to the extent the proceeds of the called bonds are used to pay for unit 
redemptions) result in the distribution of principal and may result in a        
reduction in the amount of subsequent interest distributions; it may also affect
the current return on unit of the trust involved. Each trust portfolio contains 
a listing of the sinking fund and call provisions, if any, with respect to each 
of the debt obligations. Extraordinary optional redemptions and mandatory       
redemptions result from the happening of certain events. Generally, events that 
may permit the extraordinary optional redemption of bonds or may require the    
mandatory redemption of bonds include, among others: a final determination that 
the interest on the bonds is taxable; the substantial damage or destruction by  
fire or other casualty of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were  
used; an exercise by a local, state or Federal governmental unit of its power of
eminent domain to take all or substantially all of the project for which the    
proceeds of the bonds were used; changes in the economic availability of raw    
materials, operating supplies or facilities or technological or other changes   
which render the operation of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds   
were used uneconomic; changes in law or an administrative or judicial decree    
which renders the performance of the agreement under which the proceeds of the  
bonds were made available to finance the project impossible or which creates    
unreasonable burdens or which imposes excessive liabilities, such as taxes, not 
imposed on the date the bonds are issued on the issuer of the bonds or the user 
of the proceeds of the bonds; an administrative or judicial decree which        
requires the cessation of a substantial part of the operations of the project   
financed with the proceeds of the bonds; an overestimate of the costs of the    
project to be

financed with the proceeds of the bonds resulting in excess proceeds of the     
bonds which may be applied to redeem bonds; or an underestimate of a source of  
funds securing the bonds resulting in excess funds which may be applied to      
redeem bonds. The issuer of certain bonds in a trust may have sold or reserved  
the right to sell, upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, to third parties
all or any portion of its rights to call bonds in accordance with the stated    
redemption provisions of such bonds. In such a case the issuer no longer has the
right to call the bonds for redemption unless it reacquires the rights from such
third party. A third party pursuant to these rights may exercise the redemption 
provisions with respect to a bond at a time when the issuer of the bond might   
not have called a bond for redemption had it not sold such rights. The sponsor  
is unable to predict all of the circumstances which may result in such          
redemption of an issue of bonds. See also the discussion of single family       
mortgage and multi-family revenue bonds above for more information on the call  
provisions of such bonds.                                                       

    To the best knowledge of the sponsor, there is no litigation pending as of
the date of deposit in respect of any bonds which might reasonably be expected  
to have a material adverse effect upon any of the trusts. At any time after the 
trust's inception date, litigation may be initiated on a variety of grounds with
respect to bonds in a trust. Such litigation, as, for example, suits challenging
the issuance of pollution control revenue bonds under environmental protection  
statutes, may affect the validity of such bonds or the tax-free nature of the   
interest thereon. While the outcome of litigation of such nature can never be   
entirely predicted, each trust has received or will receive opinions of bond    
counsel to the issuing authorities of each bond on the date of issuance to the  
effect that such bonds have been validly issued and that the interest thereon is
exempt from Federal income tax. In addition, other factors may arise from time  
to time which potentially may impair the ability of issuers to meet obligations 
undertaken with respect to the bonds.                                           

PUERTO RICO.  Your trust may significantly invest in bonds issued by  
issuers located in Puerto Rico.  Accordingly, an investment in such a trust     
should be made with an understanding of the general risks associated with the   
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.                                                    

     Economic Conditions and Outlook.  Puerto Rico enjoyed almost two decades of
economic expansion through fiscal year 2001.  Almost every sector of the economy
participated, and record levels of employment were achieved.  Factors behind    
this expansion included government-sponsored economic development programs,     
periodic declines in the value of the U.S. dollar, which is the currency used in
the Commonwealth, increases in the level of federal transfers, a significant    
expansion in construction investment driven by infrastructure projects and      
private investment, primarily in housing, and the relatively low cost of        
borrowing.                                                                      

Puerto Rico has a diversified economy, with manufacturing and services
comprising its principal sectors.  The economy of Puerto Rico is closely linked 
to the United States economy.  The following exogenous variables are affected by
the United States economy: exports, direct investment, transfer payments,       
interest rates, inflation, and tourist expenditures.                            

 Manufacturing is the largest sector in terms of gross domestic product.
Manufacturing in Puerto Rico is now more diversified than during the earlier    
phases of its industrial development and includes several industries less prone 
to business cycles.  In the last three decades, industrial development has      
tended to be more capital intensive and more dependent on skilled labor. The    
services sector, which

includes finance, insurance, real estate, wholesale and retail trade, tourism,  
and other services, has shown a strong interaction with manufacturing, tourism, 
construction, and agriculture. Tourism makes a significant contribution to      
economic activity.  An estimated $3.4 billion was spent by visitors in Puerto   
Rico during fiscal year 2006.  San Juan has become the largest home port for    
cruise ships in the Caribbean and the fourth largest home port for cruise ships 
in the world.  During the year 2006, the number of persons registered in tourist
hotels maintained the same occupancy rate as fiscal year 2005.  The construction
sector is an integral part of the economic activity from fiscal year 1999       
through fiscal year 2006.  Puerto Rico is heavily dependent on oil imports for  
the production of electricity; however, as a result of the construction of two  
cogeneration plants, one of which is fueled by liquefied natural gas and the    
other by coal, Puerto Rico's dependence on oil imports for the production of    
electricity has been reduced from 99% to 72%.                                   

    The Puerto Rico Planning Board's preliminary reports of the performance of
the Puerto Rico economy during fiscal year 2006 indicate that the economy       
registered an increase of 0.7% in total gross product.  Gross product in fiscal 
year 2000 was $41.4 billion and gross product in fiscal year 2006 was $56.7     
billion.  This represents an increase in gross product of 36.9% from fiscal year
2000 to fiscal year 2006.  In terms of personal income, in fiscal year 2006,    
personal income per capita was $12,997 compared to $12,365 in 2005 and $10,204  
in 2000.  According to the Department of Labor and Human Resources, during      
fiscal year 2006 the labor force was 1.42 million compared to 1.39 million in   
fiscal year 2005.  Unemployment, although at relative low historical levels,    
remains above the United States average.  The average unemployment rate         
increased from 10.6% during fiscal year 2005 to 11.7% in fiscal year 2006.      

Financial Information.  The Commonwealth reported a deficit of $16.4  
billion as of June 30, 2006, a deterioration in the financial position of $1.2  
billion from last year's balances.  The accumulated deficit is principally the  
result of the Commonwealth's practice of issuing debt and transferring such     
funds to its discretely presented component units in order for them to carry out
the corresponding construction programs.                                        

    The Commonwealth's total deficit increased by $1.2 billion (a 7% increase)
as a result of this year's operations.  The governmental activities deficit     
increased by $0.3 billion (an 8% increase), while net assets of the             
business-type activities showed an increase of $97 million (a 10% increase).    
The Commonwealth's governmental activities had total revenue of $14.3 billion,  
which was exceeded by total expenses of $15.8 billion, excluding transfers      
received from business-type activities amounting to $243 million.  The          
Commonwealth's business-type activities had total revenue of $1.2 billion, which
exceeded total expenses of $903 million, excluding transfers made to the        
governmental activities amounting to $243 million.                              

   Cash Management.  The Commonwealth maintains a cash pool for its cash and
cash equivalents.  The balance in the pooled cash accounts is available to meet 
current operating requirements and any excess is invested in various            
interest-bearing accounts in the Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico    
(GDB), a discretely presented component unit.  In addition, the Puerto Rico     
Government Investment Trust Fund (PRGITF), was created by the Commonwealth      
pursuant to Act No. 176 of August 11, 1995, and began operations on December 4,
1995.  PRGITF is a no-load diversified collective investment trust that was     
created for the purpose of providing eligible

investors with a convenient and economical way to invest in a professionally    
managed money market portfolio.  The deposits on hand and the investments       
purchased are not collateralized, secured, or guaranteed by the Commonwealth or 
any of its agencies, instrumentalities, or political subdivisions.              

    The Commonwealth's investment policy is to minimize credit and market risk
while maintaining a competitive yield on its portfolio.  The cash temporarily   
idle during this year was invested mainly in U.S. government securities, stocks,
corporate bonds, repurchase agreements, Commonwealth securities, trading        
securities, and short-term investments.  These are primary government           
investments that are restricted and unrestricted.                               

    Budgetary Policy.  The fiscal year of the Commonwealth begins each July 1.
The Governor is constitutionally required to submit to the Legislature an annual
balanced budget of capital improvements and operating expenses of the Central   
Government for the ensuing fiscal year.                                         

    The Commonwealth maintains extensive budgetary controls.  The objective of
these controls is to ensure compliance with legal provisions embodied in the    
annual appropriated budget approved by the Legislature.  Activities of the      
general fund are included in the annual appropriated budget.  Budgetary control 
resides at the department level.  The Commonwealth also maintains an encumbrance
accounting system as one method of maintaining budgetary control.               

   The annual budget, which is developed using elements of performance-based
program budgeting and zero-based budgeting, includes an estimate of revenue and 
other resources for the ensuing fiscal year under laws existing at the time the 
budget is submitted and legislative measures proposed by the Governor and       
submitted with the proposed budget, as well as the Governor's recommendations as
to appropriations that in his judgment are necessary, convenient and in         
conformity with the four-year investment plan prepared by the Puerto Rico       
Planning Board.                                                                 

     The Legislature may amend the budget submitted by the Governor, but may not
increase items that would cause a deficit without imposing additional taxes to  
cover such deficit.  Once approved by the Legislature, the budget is referred to
the Governor, who may decrease or eliminate any item, but may not increase or   
insert new items in the budget.  The Governor may also veto the budget in its   
entirety and return it to the Legislature with his objections.  The Legislature,
by a two-thirds majority in each house, may override the Governor's veto.  If a 
budget is not adopted prior to the end of the fiscal year, as originally        
approved by the Legislature and the Governor, it is automatically renewed for   
the ensuing fiscal year until a new budget is approved by the Legislature and   
the Governor.  This allows the Commonwealth to continue to pay operating and    
other expenses until a new budget is approved.                                  

   Assets.  Total assets and total liabilities of the Commonwealth's primary
government at June 30, 2006 amounted to $14.9 billion and $31.3 billion,        
respectively, for a net deficit of $16.4 billion, compared to a $15.2 billion   
net deficit at the beginning of the current year, as restated.                  

A portion of the Commonwealth's net assets (deficit) reflects its     
investment in capital assets such as land, buildings, equipment and             
infrastructure, less any related debt used to acquire those assets that are     
still outstanding.  The Commonwealth uses these capital assets to provide       
services to its residents; consequentially, these assets are not available for  
future spending.  Although the                                                  

-14-

P-->485BPOS53rd�Page�of�86TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�53rd
Commonwealth's investment in its capital assets is reported net of related debt,
it should be noted that the resources needed to repay this debt must be provided
from other sources, since the capital assets themselves cannot be used to       
liquidate these liabilities.                                                    

     An additional portion of the Commonwealth's net assets (deficit) represents
resources that are subject to external restrictions on how they may be used.  An
otherwise positive remaining balance would be used to meet the Commonwealth's   
ongoing obligations to its residents and creditors.  Internally imposed         
designations of resources are not presented as restricted net assets.  At the   
end of the current fiscal year, the Commonwealth is able to report positive     
balances in two categories of net assets, and a deficit, both for the government
as a whole, as well as for its separate governmental and business-type          
activities.                                                                     

The net deficit of the primary government primarily results from the  
Commonwealth's practice of issuing debt and transferring such funds to the      
component units so that they can carry out the construction projects.  The      
primary government retains the debt while the component units report the        
corresponding asset financed by such debt.                                      

 Total assets increased by $1.5 billion during the fiscal year 2006 when
compared to the prior fiscal year.  Restricted cash increased by $647 million   
when compared to the prior year.  The increase was due to approximately $250    
million in cash restricted for tax revenue anticipation notes, and an overall   
increase in cash restricted for the payment of other long-term debt.  Taxes     
receivable increased $120 million when compared to the prior year.  Additions of
capital assets and depreciation expense amounted to $816 million and $223       
million, respectively.                                                          

    Total liabilities increased $3 billion during the current fiscal year when
compared to the prior fiscal year.  The key elements for this increase are      
mostly due to the net increase in debt issued of $1.64 billion, which consisted 
of issuances during fiscal year 2006 of Commonwealth general obligation bonds   
and notes payable amounting to $141 million, and $3.2 billion, respectively,    
offset by repayments of such debt in the amount of $209 million and $140        
million.  Increases were also experienced in the net pension obligation of $261 
million and accounts payable and tax revenue anticipation notes of $298 million 
and $250 million, respectively.                                                 

    The Commonwealth's net deficit increased by $1.2 billion, or 8%, from last
year's total net deficit.  Approximately 52% of the Commonwealth's total revenue
came from taxes, while 29% resulted from grants and contributions (primarily    
federal financial assistance).  Charges for services represented 13% of the     
total revenue.  The Commonwealth's expenses cover a range of services.  The     
largest expenses were for education, public housing and welfare, and public     
safety.  In 2006, governmental activities' expenses exceeded program revenue by 
$10.5 billion, resulting in the use of $9.2 billion in general revenue (mostly  
taxes) and transfers.  On the other hand, program revenue from business-type    
activities in 2006 exceeded expenses by approximately $306 million.  In         
addition, the business-type activities had unrestricted investment earnings of  
$33 million and transfers to the governmental activities amounting to $243      
million.                                                                        

 Governmental activities decreased the Commonwealth's net assets by $1.2
billion, which is $1.7 billion less than experienced in the prior year.         
Business-type activities decreased the                                          

-15-

P-->485BPOS54th�Page�of�86TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�54th
Commonwealth's net assets by $97 million.  The Commonwealth made efforts to     
decrease overall expenses; these efforts resulted in a decrease of $1.2 billion,
but revenues were still lower than total expenses.  The Commonwealth implemented
the 5.5% sales and use tax during fiscal year 2007.  This sales and use tax     
results in higher tax revenues.  The Commonwealth expects that the effort to    
decrease expenses and the increase in tax revenue with the sales and use tax    
will eliminate or significantly lower the deficit in future years.  The two main
factors that contributed to the increase in net assets were the reduction of $30
million in the operating expenses in lottery funds and the increase in          
nonoperating revenue of $37.3 million of contributions from the federal         
government on unemployment fund, water pollution control and treatment revolving
loan funds.                                                                     

 The key factor of this variance was a transfer of funds of $200 million
from the Additional Lottery System to the general fund as further explained in  
note 10 to the basic financial statements.                                      

     Debt Administration.  Section 2 of Article VI of the Constitution of Puerto
Rico provides that direct obligations of the Commonwealth evidenced by full     
faith and credit bonds or notes shall not be issued if the amount of the        
principal of and interest on such bonds and notes and on all such bonds and     
notes theretofore issued, which is payable in any fiscal year, together with any
amount paid by the Commonwealth in the preceding fiscal year on accounts of     
bonds or notes guaranteed by the Commonwealth, exceeds 15% of the average annual
revenue raised under the provisions of the Commonwealth Legislation and covered 
into Treasury of Puerto Rico in the two fiscal years preceding the current      
fiscal year.  Section 2 of Article VI does not limit the amount of debt that the
Commonwealth may guarantee so long as the 15% limitation is not exceeded.       

The Commonwealth's total long-term obligations increased by $2 billion
during the current fiscal year, representing an 8% increase.                    

Ratings.  As of June 2009, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico has a BBB- 
credit rating from Standard & Poor's Corporation and a Baa3 from Moody's        
Investor Service on general obligation bond issues.                             

Local Issuances.  It should be noted that the creditworthiness of     
obligations issued by local Pennsylvania issuers may be unrelated to the        
creditworthiness of obligations issued by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and  
there is no obligation on the part of the Commonwealth to make payments on such 
local obligations in the event of default.                                      

ADDITIONAL DEPOSITS.  The trust agreement authorizes the sponsor to   
increase the size of a trust and the number of units thereof by the deposit of  
additional securities, or cash (including a letter of credit or the equivalent) 
with instructions to purchase additional securities, in such trust and the      
issuance of a corresponding number of additional units.  In connection with     
these deposits, existing and new investors may experience a dilution of their   
investments and a reduction in their anticipated income because of fluctuations 
in the prices of the securities between the time of the cash deposit and the    
purchase of the securities and because a trust will pay the associated brokerage
fees and other acquisition costs.

INSURANCE ON THE BONDS                                                          

     Insurance has been obtained on certain bonds guaranteeing prompt payment of
interest and principal, when due, in respect of the bonds.  See "Bond Insurance"
in the prospectus.  There have been a number of recent developments with respect
to ratings actions impacting insurance companies by the rating agencies,        
Standard & Poor's, a Division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. ("Standard &   
Poor's"), Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's") and Fitch Ratings Ltd.    
("Fitch").  In light of the ongoing nature of ratings actions or announcements  
by the rating agencies, you should consult announcements by the rating agencies,
the websites of the rating agencies, and the websites of the portfolio insurers 
for the then current publicly available information.  These ratings actions have
had a significant impact on the portfolio insurers', and other bond insurers',  
ability to compete in the financial guarantee business.  A brief description of 
potential insurers is contained below.                                          

ACA Financial Guaranty Corporation ("ACA Financial Guaranty").  ACA   
Financial Guaranty is an insurance subsidiary of ACA Capital Holding, Inc.,     
organized in the State of Maryland.  ACA Financial Guaranty assumes credit risk 
through the issuance of financial guaranty insurance policies across all of its 
business lines.  Their insured risk portfolio contains exposures of various     
credit qualities.                                                               

   On Dec. 15, 2008, Standard & Poor's withdrew its ratings of ACA Financial
Guaranty at the company's request.  On that date, Standard & Poor's raised its  
financial strength, financial enhancement, and issuer credit ratings on ACA     
Financial Guaranty to B from CCC and removed the company from its CreditWatch   
developing status.  The outlook was developing.  The upgraded rating reflected  
the positive effects of the restructuring transaction completed in August 2008  
that settled all outstanding collateralized debt obligations ("CDO") and        
reinsurance exposures of the company, including the significantly deteriorated  
CDO of asset-backed securities ("ABS") transactions, eliminating a requirement  
to post a significant amount of collateral to the CDO of ABS counterparties.    
The settlement required that ACA Financial Guaranty make a $209 million cash    
payment and a distribution of surplus notes.  The surplus notes provided the    
former CDO counterparties and certain other counterparties with what amounted to
a 95% economic interest in the company.  As a result of the transaction, the    
company's $7 billion risk portfolio was comprised almost exclusively of U.S.    
public finance exposure predominantly of BBB and BB credit quality with above-  
average concentrations in the health care and higher education sectors.  The    
developing outlook reflected the following possibilities: that the company could
run off in an orderly fashion with capital adequacy improving due to low losses 
and effective expense management; or that capital adequacy could deteriorate    
through a combination of meaningful losses precipitated by weak credits and/or a
soft economy, poor expense management, and/or excessive distributions to surplus
noteholders as allowed by the Maryland Insurance Administration.  There is the  
risk that should finances deteriorate, the company could be placed under        
rehabilitation by its regulator, in which case the ratings would be changed to  
R.  An R rating signifies that an insurer is under regulatory supervision       
because of its financial condition.                                             

 As of September 30, 2009, ACA Financial Guaranty had admitted assets of
approximately $423.2 million and total liabilities of approximately $329.0      
million, as compared to approximately $441.2 million and $339.9 million,        
respectively, as of December 31, 2008.  Statutory capital of approximately      
$175.7 million at December 31, 2008 was down from approximately $414.8 million  
as of December 31, 2007, reflecting in part the cost of the above-discussed     
settlement.  ACA Financial

Guaranty assessed its capital adequacy as consistent with a  speculative-grade  
rating, based on a margin of safety in the range of  0.5x-0.7x.  The margin of  
safety expresses the relationship of theoretical losses incurred during a severe
stress modeling exercise to capital remaining at the end of the modeling period.

The parent company of ACA Financial Guaranty maintains a website at   
www.aca.com where it makes available, free of charge and as soon as reasonably  
practicable after they file with, or furnish to, the Securities and Exchange

  Ambac Assurance Corporation ("Ambac Assurance").  Ambac Financial Group,
Inc., headquartered in New York City, is a holding company incorporated on      
April 29, 1991 with activities divided into two business segments: (i) financial
guarantee and (ii) financial services.  Ambac Assurance provides financial      
guarantee insurance for public and structured finance obligations.  Ambac       
Assurance is the successor to the founding financial guarantee insurance        
company, which wrote the first bond insurance policy in 1971.  The holding      
company is largely dependent on dividends from Ambac Assurance to pay dividends 
on its common stock, to pay principal and interest on its indebtedness and to   
pay its operating expenses.                                                     

  As of January 29, 2010, Ambac Assurance was rated Caa2 with a developing
outlook by Moody's and CC with a developing outlook from Standard and Poor's,   
with the view that the company was effectively in runoff and in a weakened      
financial position.  These ratings are an essential part of Ambac Assurance's   
ability to provide credit enhancement and are essential to Ambac Assurance's    
ability to compete in the financial guarantee business.  Considering the high   
levels of delinquencies and defaults within residential mortgage loans, each of 
these rating agencies began a review of the capital adequacy of the financial   
guarantee industry in the fall of 2007.  In late December 2007, following the   
rating agency reviews, Ambac Assurance's triple-A rating was affirmed by both   
Standard & Poor's (with a negative outlook) and Moody's; however, Fitch placed  
Ambac Assurance's triple-A rating on "rating watch negative" and stated that    
Ambac Assurance had a modeled $1 billion capital shortfall.  By July 2008, Ambac
Assurance was rated AA with a negative outlook by Standard & Poor's and Aa3 with
a negative outlook by Moody's.  On June 18, 2008, Ambac Financial Group, Inc.   
announced its decision to terminate its ratings contract with Fitch.            

   On July 28, 2009, Ambac Assurance announced a large estimated increase in
loss reserve for 2Q 2009 which would reduce regulatory capital to levels below  
the regulatory-required minimum threshold.  The company petitioned the Wisconsin
insurance regulator to approve a reclassification of statutory contingency      
reserves to offset the capital depletion.  Although the company has received    
regulatory approval to release contingency reserves to bolster surplus, there   
could be additional commutations, which are largely viewed as distressed        
exchanges.  Ambac Assurance announced $856 million of statutory surplus for the 
end of the third quarter 2009, a significant improvement over the               

-18-

P-->485BPOS57th�Page�of�86TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�57th
$305 million reported at the end of June.  Although the substantial improvement 
in its surplus is a positive, the company's overall credit profile did not      
materially change.  Moody's cautioned in late January 2010 that Ambac           
Assurance's capitalization remained stressed due to mortgage-related exposures  
and high operating leverage that could result in relatively modest changes in   
mortgage loss estimates to have substantial effects on capital adequacy.        
Accordingly, Moody's warned that Ambac Assurance's insurance financial strength 
remained volatile and could meaningfully evolve depending on how mortgage       
losses, remediation efforts and regulatory risks play out.                      

    Ratings actions have had a significant impact on Ambac Assurance's ability
to compete in the financial guarantee business.  As a result of the rating      
agency actions described above, as well as significant disruption in the capital
markets and investor concern, Ambac Assurance has been able to write only a     
limited amount of new financial guarantee business since November 2007.  Ambac  
Assurance had been working with rating agencies and regulators to launch        
Everspan Financial Guarantee Corp. (doing business as Connie Lee Insurance      
Company in all states except Wisconsin), a wholly-owned but insulated subsidiary
of Ambac Assurance.  The new company had been designed to have segregated       
capital, separate risk management and a separate board of directors.  On June 1,
2009, however, management announced that it postponed its plan to establish the 
municipal-only financial guarantee company.                                     

As of September 30, 2009, Ambac Assurance had net admitted assets of  
approximately $8.99 billion and total liabilities of approximately $8.1 billion,
as compared to approximately $10.8 billion and $9.2 billion, respectively, as of
December 31, 2008.  The company's insured portfolio totaled $411.8 billion as of
June 30, 2009, approximately 5% less than it was at year-end 2008 and 21% less  
than what it was at year-end 2007.  Statutory capital and surplus was           
approximately $1.55 billion and $3.32 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007,    
respectively.  Statutory net income/(loss) for Ambac Assurance was approximately
$(4.03) billion and $54.0 million for 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Assured, credit enhancement products to the public finance, structured finance  
and mortgage markets directly and through financial institutions, serving the   
U.S. and international markets.                                                 

   On November 14, 2008, Assured Guaranty Ltd. announced that it had entered
into a definitive agreement with Dexia Holdings, Inc. to purchase Financial     
Security Assurance Holdings Ltd. ("FSAH") and, indirectly, all of its           
subsidiaries, including the financial guaranty insurance company FSA.  The      
definitive agreement provides that the company will be indemnified against      
exposure to FSAH's financial products segment, which includes its guaranteed    
investment contract business.  The transaction closed July 1, 2009 at a purchase
price of approximately $546 million in cash and 22.3 million of the company's   
common shares.                                                                  

  As of January 29, 2010, Assured was rated AAA with a negative outlook by
Standard & Poor's, Aa3 with a negative outlook by Moody's, and AA- with a       
negative outlook by Fitch.  If any of the above ratings were reduced below      
current levels, there may be an adverse effect on the company's prospects for   
future business opportunities and may also reduce the value of the reinsurance  
it offers, which may no longer be of sufficient economic value for its          
customers.                                                                      

As of September 30, 2009, Assured had total net admitted assets of    
approximately $2.1 billion and total liabilities of approximately $1.9 billion. 
At December 31, 2008, Assured had total net admitted assets of approximately    
$1.7 billion and total liabilities of approximately $1.4 billion.  The net      
income/(loss) for the second quarter 2009 was approximately $(170) million and  
approximately $545 million for the second quarter of the prior year.

less than $1,000,000,000, determined in accordance with statutory accounting    
practices ("SAP") prescribed or permitted by the New York Department of

The policies issued by BHAC are not covered by the Property/Casualty  
Insurance Security Fund specified in Article 76 of the New York Insurance Laws. 
Standard & Poor's has assigned its "AA+" financial strength and financial       
enhancement ratings to BHAC.  Standard & Poor's has assigned its "AA+" financial
enhancement rating to Columbia.  The ratings on BHAC are based on a guaranty    
from Columbia in favor of BHAC.  The guaranty issued by Columbia applies to     
BHAC's policy issued with respect to the bonds.  Any explanation of these       
ratings may only be obtained from Standard & Poor's.  The ratings are not a     
recommendation to buy, sell or hold the bonds, and are subject to revision or   
withdrawal at any time by Standard & Poor's. Any downward revision or withdrawal
of a rating may have an adverse effect on the market price of the bonds.        

  In addition, Moody's has assigned its "Aa1" insurance financial strength
ratings to BHAC and Columbia.  Any explanation of these ratings may only be     
obtained from Moody's.  The ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or    
hold the bonds, and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by        
Moody's.  Any downward revision or withdrawal of a rating may have an adverse   
effect on the market price of the bonds.  On April 8, 2009, the date that       
Moody's Investor Services, Inc. assigned its rating to BHAC, BHAC's ultimate    
parent company, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., maintained an investment in Moody's    
Investor Services, Inc.'s parent company of approximately 19.6% of the common   
shares then outstanding.  BHAC does not guarantee the market price or investment
value of the bonds nor does it guarantee that the ratings on the bonds will not 
be revised or withdrawn.

     CIFG Assurance North America, Inc. ("CIFG").  CIFG, a New York corporation,
and CIFG Europe provide financial guarantees for transactions in the public     
finance, structured finance, and infrastructure finance markets in the United   
States, Europe and around the world.                                            
On November 11, 2009, Moody's downgraded its rating of CIFG to Ca from Caa2 with
a developing outlook and simultaneously withdrew any future ratings for business
reasons.  Moody's stated that material deterioration in CIFG's insured portfolio
adversely affected the guarantor's capital adequacy profile and that CIFG may no
longer have sufficient financial resources to pay all insurance claims.  CIFG   
reported a $298 million statutory deficit in its second quarter financial       
statements, increasing its gross loss reserves by $339 million due to worsening 
performance trends.  Moody's added that the risk of regulatory intervention is  
meaningful given CIFG's failure to meet minimum regulatory capital requirements.
This could influence the pace of commutations with counterparties, potentially  
on terms that imply a distressed exchange, Moody's cautioned.  On June 15, 2009,
Standard & Poor's lowered                                                       

-22-

P-->485BPOS61st�Page�of�86TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�61st
its rating on CIFG from BB to CC with a negative outlook.  The ratings actions  
were prompted by significant deterioration in the company's remaining insured   
portfolio since January 2009 when CIFG initiated a broad restructuring.         

As of September 30, 2009, CIFG had net admitted assets and total      
liabilities of approximately $227 million and $123 million, respectively as     
compared to approximately $306 million and $2.9 billion, respectively, as of    
December 31, 2008.  Surplus as regards policyholders was approximately $104     
million as of September 30, 2009 and $(2.6) billion as of December 31, 2008.

Financial Guaranty Insurance Company ("FGIC").  FGIC is a wholly owned
subsidiary of FGIC Corporation.  The company provides financial guaranty        
insurance and other forms of credit enhancement for public finance and          
structured finance obligations.  FGIC typically guarantees the scheduled        
payments of principal and interest on an issuer's obligations when due.  FGIC is
licensed to write financial guaranty insurance in all 50 states, the District of
Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and, through
a branch, the United Kingdom.                                                   

   The deterioration in the U.S. housing and mortgage markets and the global
credit markets adversely affected FGIC's business, results of operations, and   
financial condition.  During 2008, FGIC's financial strength and credit ratings 
were downgraded by various rating agencies.  The financial strength ratings     
downgrades have adversely impacted the company's ability to generate new        
business and, unless restored, will impact the future business, operations and  
financial results.  As a result of these developments, the company ceased       
writing new business to preserve capital.  On September 30, 2008, FGIC entered  
into a reinsurance agreement with MBIA under which MBIA reinsured certain       
policies covering approximately $166 billion of FGIC's U.S. public finance      
insured par outstanding.  The reinsurance provided by MBIA was to enable covered
policyholders to make claims for payment directly against MBIA in accordance    
with the terms of the reinsurance agreement.                                    

 On November 24, 2009, the New York Insurance Department issued an order
requiring FGIC to cease writing new policies and suspend paying any and all     
claims because of ongoing surplus to policyholders deficits and impairment of   
required minimum surplus to policyholders.  The order required FGIC to provide a
detailed and final restructuring plan no later than January 5, 2010.  To satisfy
this requirement, prior to January 5, 2010, FGIC provided to the New York       
Insurance Department FGIC's proposed surplus restoration plan, which, as of     
February 1, 2010, was under review.  The order further required FGIC to return  
to compliance with regulatory requirements by March 25, 2010, or such subsequent
date as the Superintendent of Insurance deems appropriate.                      

 On April 22, 2009, Standard and Poor's lowered its rating of FGIC to CC
from CCC with a negative outlook, and subsequently withdrew its ratings because 
of an expectation that timely financial                                         

-23-

P-->485BPOS62nd�Page�of�86TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�62nd
information would no longer be available.  On March 24, 2009, FGIC was          
downgraded to Caa3 from Caa1 with a negative outlook by Moody's, which also     
announced that it was withdrawing the ratings of FGIC and FGIC Corporation for  
business reasons.  Effective November 24, 2008, Fitch no longer provides a      
rating for FGIC, citing its belief that FGIC's financial guaranty franchise was 
effectively in run-off and, as a result, that there was limited investor        
interest in continued coverage of the rating.  Prior to January 2008, FGIC was  
rated AAA, Aaa and AAA by Standard & Poor's, Moody's, and Fitch, respectively.  

As of September 30, 2009, FGIC had total assets of approximately $4.6 
billion and total liabilities of approximately $5.6 billion.  At year end 2008, 
FGIC had total assets of approximately $5.0 billing and total liabilities of    
approximately $5.4 billion.  As a result of certain statutory loss reserves,    
FGIC's statutory capital and surplus position was substantially reduced below   
historical levels.  As a result of these losses, FGIC's statutory surplus to    
policyholders was substantially reduced over time and, due primarily to a       
material increase in anticipated claims on its guarantees of residential        
mortgage-backed securities, was in a deficit position of $(865,834,577) with an 
impairment of its required minimum surplus to policyholders of $932,234,577 as  
of September 30, 2009.  Under New York State Insurance Law, FGIC must maintain  
surplus to policyholders of at least $65,000.  FGIC's failure to maintain the   
statutory minimum required surplus amount permits the New York State            
Superintendent of Insurance to seek a court order for appointment to act as     
rehabilitator or liquidator of FGIC.  As of September 30, 2009, FGIC's aggregate
net liability under its insured exposures continued to exceed the aggregate risk

     National Public Finance Guarantee Corporation ("National").  National is an
insurance subsidiary of MBIA, Inc., a Connecticut corporation.  On February 25,
2008, MBIA Insurance Corporation ("MBIA") announced a plan to implement several 
initiatives in connection with the restructuring of its business over the next  
few years.  A significant aspect of the plan was the creation of separate legal 
operating entities for MBIA's public, structured, and asset management          
businesses as soon as feasible, with a goal of within five years.  As part of   
that plan, on February 18, 2009, MBIA announced it had formed a new public      
finance-only financial guarantee insurance company which would conduct business 
only in the United States.  The new company initially did business as MBIA      
Illinois, but changed its name to National Public Finance Guarantee Corporation 
officially on March 19, 2009.  Its initial portfolio of approximately $537      
billion in net par outstanding as of February 18, 2009 consisted of both the    
U.S. public finance policies originally insured by MBIA and those reinsured as  

-24-

part of a 2008 portfolio transaction with FGIC.  All of the existing affected   
policyholders were to have reinsurance provided by National through the cut-    
through provision in the reinsurance agreement and second-to-pay policies, which
gave MBIA and FGIC policyholders the ability to make a claim for payment        
directly against National.                                                      

    On December 23, 2009, Moody's affirmed its rating on National of Baa1 with
a developing outlook, citing that despite the company's strong capital profile  
and operational infrastructure, uncertainty was caused by ongoing litigation    
challenging the recent restructuring of the group and the extended timeframe    
over which such uncertainty may persist.  On September 28, 2009, Standard and   
Poor's affirmed its A rating on National with a developing outlook.             

As of September 30, 2009, National's total net admitted assets were   
approximately $7.2 billion and its total liabilities were approximately $6.7    
billion.  Surplus as regards policyholders was approximately $509 million.  At  
December 31, 2008, the net par amount outstanding on MBIA Corp.'s insured       
obligations, including insured obligations of MBIA UK, MBIA Mexico, and CapMAC  
but excluding obligations that were ceded or assigned to MBIA Illinois as of    
January 1, 2009 and also excluding approximately $8.4 billion of MBIA insured   
investment agreements and medium term notes for MBIA Asset Management was       
approximately $233 billion.  Net insurance in force, which includes all insured 
debt service, at December 31, 2008 was approximately $290 billion.  Statutory   
capital and surplus was approximately $3.5 billion and $3.7 billion at December
31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.  For the year ended December 31, 2008, MBIA    
recorded a net loss of approximately $2.7 billion, compared with a net loss of  
$1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007.

 Radian Asset Assurance, Inc. ("Radian").  Radian Group Inc. is a global
credit risk management company headquartered in Philadelphia with significant   
operations in New York and London.                                              

    On December 22, 2009, Standard & Poor's lowered its rating on Radian to B+
from BB- with a negative outlook.  On March 12, 2009, Moody's downgraded Radian 
to Ba1 from A3, with a stable outlook, thus concluding its credit watch review  
that was initiated on October 10, 2008.  Radian Group Inc.'s management has     
stated that it has discontinued, for the foreseeable future, writing any new    
financial guaranty business in light of current market conditions, and that it  
intends to utilize Radian's available capital to support its mortgage insurance 
operations.                                                                     

As of September 30, 2009, Radian had total net admitted assets of     
approximately $2.1 billion, total liabilities of approximately $1.2 billion, and
had statutory policyholders' surplus of approximately $936 million.  The net    
loss for the full year 2008 was approximately $(410.6) million.  This compares  
to a net loss of approximately $(1.3) billion for the prior year.

  Syncora Guarantee Inc. (formerly XL Capital Assurance Inc.) ("Syncora").
Syncora is the sole subsidiary of Syncora Holdings Ltd., a holding company      
domiciled in Bermuda, and provides financial guarantee insurance and other      
credit enhancement for debt obligations in the U.S. and international capital   
markets, including municipal bonds, asset-backed securities, debt backed by     
utilities and selected infrastructure projects, future flow securitizations,    
bank deposit insurance and collateralized debt obligations.                     

On March 9, 2009, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength 
rating of Syncora to Ca from Caa1, with a developing outlook.  On January 29,
2009, Standard & Poor's lowered its rating on Syncora to CC from B with a       
negative outlook.  Both ratings agencies cited the company's run-off status, its
impaired capital adequacy position due to large incurred losses among mortgage- 
related exposures as well as its impaired financial flexibility.                

In its year-end 2008 annual statement, Syncora reported a statutory   
policyholders' deficit of approximately $2.4 billion, which would permit the New
York Insurance Department to intervene in Syncora's operations and seek court   
appointment as rehabilitator or liquidator of the company.  Syncora then engaged
in settlement negotiations with its counterparties and launched a tender offer  
for insured residential mortgage-backed securities as part of a broader         
restructuring initiative.  On July 17, 2009, Syncora announced that it completed
substantially all of the steps of its comprehensive restructuring contemplated  
by the master transaction agreement between Syncora and certain financial       
counterparties to its credit default swap and financial guarantee policies and  
accepted the tender offer for certain residential mortgage-backed securities    
insured by Syncora.  As a result, the company expected to remediate its         
policyholders' surplus deficit in the range of $3.9 and $4.1 billion.  The      
restructuring was to relieve the company of approximately $6.0 billion in losses
and loss reserves.  The company expected that the successful remediation of its 
policyholders' surplus deficit would allow it to return to compliance with the  
New York State Insurance Department's minimum policyholders' surplus requirement
of $65 million.  Syncora is not currently writing new insurance business and,   
along with its newly formed financial guarantee insurance subsidiary, Syncora   
Capital Assurance Inc., will not resume writing new insurance business.  The New
York State Insurance Department approved the transactions relating to the       
restructuring and directed that, upon the completion of each of the transactions
so approved, the company would confirm that such closings have occurred and the 
impairment to its policyholders' surplus had been removed.                      

  As of September 30, 2009, Syncora had total assets of approximately $1.2
billion, total liabilities of approximately $1.0 billion, and surplus as regards
policy holders of approximately $182 million.

ADMINISTRATION OF THE TRUST                                                     

    DISTRIBUTIONS TO UNITHOLDERS.  Interest received by a trust, including any
portion of the proceeds from a disposition of securities which represents       
accrued interest, is credited by the trustee to the Interest Account for the    
trust.  All other receipts are credited by the trustee to a separate Principal  
Account for the trust.  The trustee normally has no cash for distribution to    
unitholders until it receives interest payments on the securities in the trust. 
On the dates set forth under "Essential Information" in the prospectus, the     
trustee will commence distributions, in part from funds advanced by the trustee.

       Thereafter, assuming the trust retains its original size and composition,
after deduction of the fees and expenses and reimbursements (without interest)  
to the trustee for any amounts advanced to a trust, the trustee will normally   
distribute any income and principal received by the trust on each distribution  
date or shortly thereafter to unitholders of record on the preceding Record     
Date.  Unitholders will receive an amount substantially equal to their pro rata 
share of the balance of the Interest Account.  However, interest earned at any  
point in time will generally be greater than the amount actually received by the
trustee.  Therefore, there will generally remain an item of accrued interest    
that is added to the daily value of the units.  If unitholders sell or redeem   
all or a portion of their units, they will be paid their proportionate share of 
the accrued interest to, but not including, the third business day after the    
date of a sale or to the date of tender in the case of a redemption.            

 Unitholders of record on the first record date will receive an interest
distribution on the first distribution date.  Because the period of time between
the first distribution date and the regular distribution dates may not be a full
period, the first regular distributions may be partial distributions.           

  Persons who purchase units between a record date and a distribution date
will receive their first distribution on the second distribution date following 
their purchase of units.  Since interest on securities in the trust is payable  
at varying intervals and distributions are made to unitholders at different     
intervals from receipt of interest, the interest accruing to a trust may not be 
equal to the amount of money received and available for distribution from the   
Interest Account.  Therefore, on each distribution date the amount of interest  
actually deposited in the Interest Account and available for distribution may be
slightly more or less than the interest distribution made.  In order to         
eliminate fluctuations in interest distributions resulting from such variances, 
the trustee is authorized by the trust agreement to advance such amounts as may 
be necessary to provide interest distributions of approximately equal amounts.  

-27-

P-->485BPOS66th�Page�of�86TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�66th
The trustee will be reimbursed, without interest, for any such advances from    
funds available in the Interest Account.                                        

The trustee will distribute on each distribution date or shortly      
thereafter, to each unitholder of record on the preceding record date, an amount
substantially equal to such holder's pro rata share of the available cash       
balance, if any, in the Principal Account computed as of the close of business  
on the preceding record date.  However, no distribution will be required if the 
balance in the Principal Account is less than $.01 per unit.                    

STATEMENTS TO UNITHOLDERS.  With each distribution, the trustee will  
furnish to each unitholder a statement of the amount of income and the amount of
other receipts, if any, which are being distributed, expressed in each case as a
dollar amount per unit.                                                         

     The accounts of a trust are required to be audited annually, at the related
trust's expense, by independent public accountants designated by the sponsor,   
unless the sponsor determines that such an audit would not be in the best       
interest of the unitholders of the trust.  The accountants' report will be      
furnished by the trustee to any unitholder upon written request.  Within a      
reasonable period of time after the end of each calendar year, the trustee shall
furnish to each person who at any time during the calendar year was a unitholder
of a trust a statement, covering the calendar year, setting forth for the trust:

(A)  As to the Interest Account:                                                

(1) Income received;                                                  

    (2) Deductions for applicable taxes and for fees and expenses of the trust
and for redemptions of units, if any; and                     

(3) The balance remaining after such distributions and deductions,    
      expressed in each case both as a total dollar amount and as a dollar
        amount representing the pro rata share of each unit outstanding on the
last business day of such calendar year; and                  

(B)  As to the Principal Account:                                               

(1) The dates of disposition of any securities and the net proceeds   
received therefrom;                                           

 (2) Deductions for payment of applicable taxes and fees and expenses of
the trust and for redemptions of units, if any; and           

     (3) The balance remaining after such distributions and deductions expressed
       both as a total dollar amount and as a dollar amount representing the
     pro rata share of each unit outstanding on the last business day of
such calendar year; and

   (1) A list of the securities as of the last business day of such calendar
year;                                                         

(2) The number of units outstanding on the last business day of such  
calendar year;                                                

(3) The redemption price based on the last evaluation made during such
calendar year;                                                

(4) The amount actually distributed during such calendar year from the
      Interest and Principal Accounts separately stated, expressed both as
        total dollar amounts and as dollar amounts per unit outstanding on the
record dates for each such distribution.                      

  RIGHTS OF UNITHOLDERS.  A unitholder may at any time tender units to the
trustee for redemption.  The death or incapacity of any unitholder will not     
operate to terminate a trust nor entitle legal representatives or heirs to claim
an accounting or to bring any action or proceeding in any court for partition or
winding up of a trust.  No unitholder shall have the right to control the       
operation and management of a trust in any manner, except to vote with respect  
to the amendment of the trust agreement or termination of a trust.              

     AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION.  The trust agreement may be amended from time to
time by the sponsor and trustee or their respective successors, without the     
consent of any of the unitholders, (i) to cure any ambiguity or to correct or   
supplement any provision which may be defective or inconsistent with any other  
provision contained in the trust agreement, (ii) to make such other provision in
regard to matters or questions arising under the trust agreement as shall not   
materially adversely affect the interests of the unitholders or (iii) to make   
such amendments as may be necessary (a) for the trust to continue to qualify as 
a regulated investment company for federal income tax purposes if the trust has 
elected to be taxed as such under the United States Internal Revenue Code of    
1986, as amended, or (b) to prevent the trust from being deemed an association  
taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes if the trust has not   
elected to be taxed as a regulated investment company under the United States   
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  The trust agreement may not be      
amended, however, without the consent of all unitholders then outstanding, so as
(1) to permit, except in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof, the  
acquisition hereunder of any securities other than those specified in the       
schedules to the trust agreement or (2) to reduce the percentage of units the   
holders of which are required to consent to certain of such amendments.  The    
trust agreement may not be amended so as to reduce the interest in a trust      
represented by units without the consent of all affected    unitholders.  Except
for the amendments, changes or modifications described above, neither the       
sponsor nor the trustee may consent to any other amendment, change or           
modification of the trust agreement without the giving of notice and the        
obtaining of the approval or consent of unitholders representing at least 66    
2/3% of the units then outstanding of the affected trust.  No amendment may     
reduce the aggregate percentage of units the holders of which are required to   
consent to any amendment, change or modification of the trust agreement without 
the consent of the unitholders of all of the units then outstanding of the      
affected trust and in no event may any amendment be made which would (1) alter  
the rights to the unitholders as against each other, (2) provide the trustee    
with the power to engage in business or investment activities other than as     
specifically provided in the trust agreement, (3) adversely affect the tax      
status of the trust for federal income tax purposes or result in the units being
deemed to be sold or exchanged for federal income tax purposes or (4) unless the
trust has elected to be taxed as a regulated investment company                 

-29-

P-->485BPOS68th�Page�of�86TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�68th
for federal income tax purposes, result in a variation of the investment of     
unitholders in the trust.  The trustee will notify unitholders of the substance 
of any such amendment.                                                          

The trust agreement provides that a trust shall terminate upon the    
maturity, liquidation, redemption or other disposition of the last of the       
securities held in the trust but in no event is it to continue beyond the       
mandatory termination date.  If the value of a trust shall be less than the     
applicable minimum value stated in the prospectus (generally 40% of the total   
value of securities deposited in the trust during the initial offering period), 
the trustee may, in its discretion, and shall, when so directed by the sponsor, 
terminate the trust.  A trust may be terminated at any time by the holders of   
units representing 66 2/3% of the units thereof then outstanding.    A trust    
will be liquidated by the trustee in the event that a sufficient number of units
of the trust not yet sold are tendered for redemption by the sponsor, so that   
the net worth of the trust would be reduced to less than 40% of the value of the
securities at the time they were deposited in the trust. If a trust is          
liquidated because of the redemption of unsold units by the sponsor, the sponsor
will refund to each purchaser of units the entire sales fee paid by such        
purchaser.                                                                      

 Within a reasonable period after termination, the trustee will sell any
securities remaining in a trust and, after paying all expenses and charges      
incurred by the trust, will distribute to unitholders thereof (upon surrender   
for cancellation of certificates for units, if issued) their pro rata share of  
the balances remaining in the Interest and Principal Accounts of the trust.     

   THE TRUSTEE.  The trustee is The Bank of New York Mellon, a trust company
organized under the laws of New York. The Bank of New York Mellon has its       
principal unit investment trust division offices at 2 Hanson Place, 12th Floor, 
Brooklyn, New York 11217, (800) 848-6468. The Bank of New York Mellon is subject
to supervision and examination by the Superintendent of Banks of the State of   
New York and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and its      
deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the extent 
permitted by law.                                                               

   The trustee, whose duties are ministerial in nature, has not participated
in selecting the portfolio of any trust.  In accordance with the trust          
agreement, the trustee shall keep records of all transactions at its office.    
Such records shall include the name and address of, and the number of units held
by, every unitholder of a trust.  Such books and records shall be open to       
inspection by any unitholder at all reasonable times during usual business      
hours.  The trustee shall make such annual or other reports as may from time to 
time be required under any applicable state or federal statute, rule or         
regulation.  The trustee shall keep a certified copy or duplicate original of   
the trust agreement on file in its office available for inspection at all       
reasonable times during usual business hours by any unitholder, together with a 
current list of the securities held in each trust.  Pursuant to the trust       
agreement, the trustee may employ one or more agents for the purpose of custody 
and safeguarding of securities comprising a trust.                              

    Under the trust agreement, the trustee or any successor trustee may resign
and be discharged of a trust created by the trust agreement by executing an     
instrument in writing and filing the same with the sponsor.                     

The trustee or successor trustee must mail a copy of the notice of    
resignation to all unitholders then of record, not less than sixty days before  
the date specified in such notice when such resignation is                      

-30-

P-->485BPOS69th�Page�of�86TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�69th
to take effect.  The sponsor upon receiving notice of such resignation is       
obligated to appoint a successor trustee promptly.  If, upon such resignation,  
no successor trustee has been appointed and has accepted the appointment within 
thirty days after notification, the retiring trustee may apply to a court of    
competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor.  In case at any time 
the trustee shall not meet the requirements set forth in the trust agreement, or
shall become incapable of acting, or if a court having jurisdiction in the      
premises shall enter a decree or order for relief in respect of the trustee in  
an involuntary case, or the trustee shall commence a voluntary case, under any  
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in      
effect, or any receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee, sequestrator 
(or similar official) for the trustee or for any substantial part of its        
property shall be appointed, or the trustee shall generally fail to pay its     
debts as they become due, or shall fail to meet such written standards for the  
trustee's performance as shall be established from time to time by the sponsor, 
or if the sponsor determines in good faith that there has occurred either (1) a 
material deterioration in the creditworthiness of the trustee or (2) one or more
grossly negligent acts on the part of the trustee with respect to a trust, the  
sponsor, upon sixty days' prior written notice, may remove the trustee and      
appoint a successor trustee, as hereinafter provided, by written instrument, in 
duplicate, one copy of which shall be delivered to the trustee so removed and   
one copy to the successor trustee.  Notice of such removal and appointment shall
be mailed to each unitholder by the sponsor.  Upon execution of a written       
acceptance of such appointment by such successor trustee, all the rights,       
powers, duties and obligations of the original trustee shall vest in the        
successor.  The trustee must be a corporation organized under the laws of the   
United States, or any state thereof, be authorized under such laws to exercise  
trust powers and have at all times an aggregate capital, surplus and undivided  
profits of not less than $5,000,000.                                            

   THE SPONSOR.  The sponsor of the trust is Advisors Asset Management, Inc.
The sponsor is a broker-dealer specializing in providing services to broker-

Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB).                                             

  If at any time the sponsor shall fail to perform any of its duties under
the trust agreement or shall become incapable of acting or shall be adjudged a  
bankrupt or insolvent or shall have its affairs taken over by public            
authorities, then the trustee may (a) appoint a successor sponsor at rates of   
compensation deemed by the trustee to be reasonable and not exceeding such      
reasonable amounts as may be prescribed by the Securities and Exchange          
Commission, (b) terminate the trust agreement and liquidate any trust as        
provided therein, or (c) continue to act as trustee without terminating the     
trust agreement.                                                                

THE EVALUATOR AND SUPERVISOR.  Advisors Asset Management, Inc., the   
sponsor, also serves as evaluator and supervisor.  The evaluator and supervisor 
may resign or be removed by the sponsor and trustee in which event the sponsor  
or trustee is to use its best efforts to appoint a satisfactory successor.  Such
resignation or removal shall become effective upon acceptance of appointment by 
the

successor evaluator.  If upon resignation of the evaluator no successor has     
accepted appointment within thirty days after notice of resignation, the        
evaluator may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of 
a successor.  Notice of such resignation or removal and appointment shall be    
mailed by the trustee to each unitholder.                                       

LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY.  The sponsor, evaluator, and supervisor are 
liable for the performance of their obligations arising from their              
responsibilities under the trust agreement but will be under no liability to the
unitholders for taking any action or refraining from any action in good faith   
pursuant to the trust agreement or for errors in judgment, except in cases of   
its own gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct or its reckless       
disregard for its duties thereunder.  The sponsor shall not be liable or        
responsible in any way for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of the sale  
of any securities.                                                              

   The trust agreement provides that the trustee shall be under no liability
for any action taken in good faith in reliance upon prima facie properly        
executed documents or for the disposition of moneys, securities or certificates 
except by reason of its own gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct,  
or its reckless disregard for its duties under the trust agreement, nor shall   
the trustee be liable or responsible in any way for depreciation or loss        
incurred by reason of the sale by the trustee of any securities.  In the event  
that the sponsor shall fail to act, the trustee may act and shall not be liable 
for any such action taken by it in good faith.  The trustee shall not be        
personally liable for any taxes or other governmental charges imposed upon or in
respect of the securities or upon the interest thereof.  In addition, the trust 
agreement contains other customary provisions limiting the liability of the     
trustee.                                                                        

 The trustee and unitholders may rely on any evaluation furnished by the
evaluator and shall have no responsibility for the accuracy thereof.  The trust 
agreement provides that the determinations made by the evaluator shall be made  
in good faith upon the basis of the best information available to it, provided, 
however, that the evaluator shall be under no liability to the trustee or       
unitholders for errors in judgment, but shall be liable for its gross           
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct or its reckless disregard for its   
obligations under the trust agreement.                                          

  EXPENSES OF THE TRUST.  The sponsor will not charge a trust any fees for
services performed as sponsor.  The sponsor will receive a portion of the sale  
commissions paid in connection with the purchase of units and will share in     
profits, if any, related to the deposit of securities in the trust.             

     The trustee receives for its services that fee set forth in the prospectus.
The trustee's fee which is calculated and paid monthly is based on the total    
number of units of the related trust outstanding as of January 1 for any annual 
period, except during the initial offering period the fee will be based on the  
units outstanding at the end of each month.  The trustee benefits to the extent 
there are funds for future distributions, payment of expenses and redemptions in
the Principal and Interest Accounts since these Accounts are non-interest       
bearing and the amounts earned by the trustee are retained by the trustee.  Part
of the trustee's compensation for its services to a trust is expected to result 
from the use of these funds.                                                    

The supervisor will charge a trust a surveillance fee for services    
performed for the trust in an amount not to exceed that amount set forth in the 
prospectus but in no event will such compensation,                              

-32-

when combined with all compensation received from other unit investment trusts  
for which the sponsor both acts as sponsor and provides portfolio surveillance, 
exceed the aggregate cost to the sponsor of providing such services.  Such fee  
shall be based on the total number of units of the related trust outstanding as 
of January 1 for any annual period, except during the initial offering period   
the fee will be based on the units outstanding at the end of each month.        

     For evaluation of the securities in a trust, the evaluator shall receive an
evaluation fee in an amount not to exceed that amount set forth in the          
prospectus but in no event will such compensation, when combined with all       
compensation from other unit investment trusts for which the sponsor acts as    
sponsor and provides evaluation services, exceed the aggregate cost of providing
such services.  Such fee shall be based on the total number of units of the     
related trust outstanding as of January 1 for any annual period, except during  
the initial offering period the fee will be based on the units outstanding at   
the end of each month.                                                          

For providing bookkeeping and administrative services to a trust, the 
sponsor shall receive an administration fee in an amount not to exceed that     
amount set forth in the prospectus but in no event will such compensation, when 
combined with all compensation from other unit investment trusts for which the  
sponsor acts as sponsor and provides evaluation services, exceed the aggregate  
cost of providing such services.  Such fee shall be based on the total number of
units of the related trust outstanding as of January 1 for any annual period,   
except during the initial offering period the fee will be based on the units    
outstanding at the end of each month.                                           

The trustee's fee, sponsor's fee for providing bookkeeping and        
administrative services to the trust, supervisor's fee and evaluator's fee are  
deducted from the Interest Account of the related trust to the extent funds are 
available and then from the Principal Account.  Each such fee may be increased  
without approval of unitholders by amounts not exceeding a proportionate        
increase in the Consumer Price Index or any equivalent index substituted        
therefor.                                                                       

The following additional charges are or may be incurred by the trust: 
(a) fees for the trustee's extraordinary services; (b) expenses of the trustee  
(including legal and auditing expenses and reimbursement of the cost of advances
to the trust for payment of expenses and distributions, but not including any   
fees and expenses charged by an agent for custody and safeguarding of           
securities) and of counsel, if any; (c) various governmental charges;           
(d) expenses and costs of any action taken by the trustee to protect the trust  
or the rights and interests of the unitholders; (e) indemnification of the      
trustee for any loss, liability or expense incurred by it in the administration 
of the trust not resulting from negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on  
its part or its reckless disregard of its obligations under the trust agreement;
(f) indemnification of the sponsor for any loss, liability or expense incurred  
in acting in that capacity without gross negligence, bad faith or willful       
misconduct or its reckless disregard for its obligations under the trust        
agreement; (g) expenditures incurred in contacting unitholders upon termination 
of the trust.  The fees and expenses set forth herein are payable out of a trust
and, when owing to the trustee, are secured by a lien on the trust.  If the     
balances in the Interest and Principal Accounts are insufficient to provide for 
amounts payable by the trust, the trustee has the power to sell securities to   
pay such amounts.  These sales may result in capital gains or losses to         
unitholders.  A trust may pay the costs of updating its registration statement  
each year.

PURCHASE, REDEMPTION AND PRICING OF UNITS                                       

     PUBLIC OFFERING PRICE.  Units of a trust are offered at the public offering
price thereof.  During the initial offering period, the public offering price   
per unit is equal to the net asset value per unit (generally based on the       
offering side evaluations of the securities) plus the applicable sales fee      
referred to in the prospectus.  The public offering price for secondary market  
transactions is based on the net asset value per unit (generally based on the   
bid side evaluations of the securities).  Certain broker-dealers may charge a   
transaction fee for processing unit purchases.                                  

     The evaluator will appraise or cause to be appraised daily the value of the
underlying securities as of the close of regular trading on the New York Stock  
Exchange on days the New York Stock Exchange is open and will adjust the public 
offering price of the units commensurate with such valuation.  Such public      
offering price will be effective for all orders received at or prior to the     
close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange on each such day.       
Orders received by the trustee, sponsor or any dealer for purchases, sales or   
redemptions after that time, or on a day when the New York Stock Exchange is    
closed, will be held until the next determination of price.                     

   The public offering price per unit of the trust as shown under "Essential
Information" in the prospectus as of the date stated therein or on any          
subsequent date will vary from the amount stated under "Essential Information"  
in the prospectus in accordance with fluctuations in the prices of the          
underlying securities and the amount of accrued interest on the units.  Net     
asset value per unit is determined by dividing the value of a trust's portfolio 
securities (including any accrued interest), cash and other assets, less all    
liabilities (including accrued expenses), by the total number of units          
outstanding.  The portfolio securities are valued at their current market value 
or their fair value as determined in good faith by the Evaluator.  The aggregate
bid and offering side evaluations of the securities shall be determined (a) on  
the basis of current bid or offering prices of the securities, (b) if bid or    
offering prices are not available for any particular security, on the basis of  
current bid or offering prices for comparable securities, (c) by determining the
value of securities on the bid or offer side of the market by appraisal, or     
(d) by any combination of the above.                                            

The interest on the securities deposited in a trust, less the related 
estimated fees and expenses, will accrue daily.  The amount of net interest     
income which accrues per unit may change as securities mature or are redeemed,  
exchanged or sold, or as the expenses of a trust change or the number of        
outstanding units of a trust changes.                                           

   Although payment is normally made three business days following the order
for purchase, payments may be made prior thereto.  A person will become the     
owner of units on the date of settlement provided payment has been received.    
Cash, if any, made available to the sponsor prior to the date of settlement for 
the purchase of units may be used in the sponsor's business and may be deemed to
be a benefit to the sponsor, subject to the limitations of the Securities       
Exchange Act of 1934.  If a unitholder desires to have certificates representing
units purchased, such certificates will be delivered as soon as possible        
following his written request therefor.                                         

    ACCRUED INTEREST.  Accrued interest is the accumulation of unpaid interest
on a security from the last day on which interest thereon was paid.  Interest on
securities generally is paid monthly or semi-                                   

-34-

P-->485BPOS73rd�Page�of�86TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�73rd
annually although a trust accrues such interest daily.  Because of this, a trust
always has an amount of interest earned but not yet collected by the trustee.   
For this reason, the public offering price of units of a trust will have added  
to it the proportionate share of accrued interest to the date of settlement.    
Unitholders will receive on the next distribution date of a trust the amount, if
any, of accrued interest paid on their units.                                   

     In an effort to reduce the amount of accrued interest which would otherwise
have to be paid in addition to the public offering price in the sale of units to
the public, the trustee will advance the amount of accrued interest as of the   
first settlement date and the same will be distributed to the sponsor as the    
unitholder of record as of the first settlement date.  Consequently, the amount 
of accrued interest to be added to the public offering price of units will      
include only accrued interest from the first settlement date to the date of     
settlement, less any distributions from the Interest Account subsequent to the  
first settlement date.                                                          

Because of the varying interest payment dates of securities, accrued  
interest at any point in time will be greater than the amount of interest       
actually received by the applicable trusts and distributed to unitholders.      
Therefore, there will always remain an item of accrued interest that is added to
the value of the units.  If a unitholder sells or redeems all or a portion of   
his units, he will be entitled to receive his proportionate share of the accrued
interest from the purchaser of his units.  Since the trustee has the use of the 
funds held in the Interest Account for distributions to unitholders and since   
such account is non-interest-bearing to unitholders, the trustee benefits       
thereby.                                                                        

  COMPARISON OF PUBLIC OFFERING PRICE AND REDEMPTION PRICE.  The net asset
value of units will generally be determined on the basis of the current bid     
prices of the securities.                                                       

     PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION OF UNITS.  The sponsor intends to qualify the units for
sale in a number of states.  Units will be sold through dealers who are members 
of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. and through others.     
Sales may be made to or through dealers at prices which represent discounts from
the public offering price as set forth in the prospectus.  Certain commercial   
banks may be making units available to their customers on an agency basis.  The 
sponsor reserves the right to change the discounts from time to time.           

   We may provide, at our own expense and out of our own profits, additional
compensation and benefits to broker-dealers who sell shares of units of this    
trust and our other products. This compensation is intended to result in        
additional sales of our products and/or compensate broker-dealers and financial 
advisors for past sales. We may make these payments for marketing, promotional  
or related expenses, including, but not limited to, expenses of entertaining    
retail customers and financial advisors, advertising, sponsorship of events or  
seminars, obtaining shelf space in broker-dealer firms and similar activities   
designed to promote the sale of the our products. These arrangements will not   
change the price you pay for your units.                                        

  The sponsor reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any order
for the purchase of units.                                                      

     PROFITS OF SPONSOR.  The sponsor will receive gross sales fees equal to the
percentage of the offering price of the units of such trusts stated in the      
prospectus and will pay a portion of such sales fees                            

-35-

P-->485BPOS74th�Page�of�86TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�74th
to dealers and agents.  In addition, the sponsor may realize a profit or a loss 
resulting from the difference between the purchase prices of the securities to  
the sponsor and the cost of such securities to a trust, which is based on the   
offering side evaluation of the securities.  The sponsor may also realize       
profits or losses with respect to securities deposited in a trust which were    
acquired from underwriting syndicates of which the sponsor was a member.  An    
underwriter or underwriting syndicate purchases securities from the issuer on a 
negotiated or competitive bid basis, as principal, with the motive of marketing 
such securities to investors at a profit.  The sponsor may realize additional   
profits or losses on unsold units as a result of changes in the daily evaluation
of the securities in a trust.                                                   

   MARKET FOR UNITS.  After the initial offering period, while not obligated
to do so, the sponsor may, subject to change at any time, maintain a market for 
units of the trust offered hereby and to continuously offer to purchase said    
units at the net asset value, determined by the evaluator based on the aggregate
bid prices of the underlying securities in the trust, together with any accrued 
interest to the expected dates of settlement.  Unitholders who wish to dispose  
of their units should inquire of their broker as to current market prices in    
order to determine whether there is in existence any price in excess of the     
redemption price and, if so, the amount thereof.                                

 The offering price of any units resold by the sponsor will be in accord
with that described in the currently effective prospectus describing such units.
Any profit or loss resulting from the resale of such units will belong to the   
sponsor.  If the sponsor decides to maintain a secondary market, it may suspend 
or discontinue purchases of units of the trust if the supply of units exceeds   
demand, or for other business reasons.                                          

  REDEMPTION.  A unitholder who does not dispose of units in the secondary
market described above may cause units to be redeemed by the trustee by making a
written request to the trustee at its unit investment trust division office and,
in the case of units evidenced by a certificate, by tendering such certificate  
to the trustee properly endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument or      
instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the trustee.  Unitholders must  
sign the request, and such certificate or transfer instrument, exactly as their 
names appear on the records of the trustee and on any certificate representing  
the units to be redeemed.  If the amount of the redemption is $500 or less and  
the proceeds are payable to the unitholder(s) of record at the address of       
record, no signature guarantee is necessary for redemptions by individual       
account owners (including joint owners).  Additional documentation may be       
requested, and a signature guarantee is always required, from corporations,     
executors, administrators, trustees, guardians or associations.  The signatures 
must be guaranteed by a participant in the Securities Transfer Agents Medallion 
Program ("STAMP") or such other signature guaranty program in addition to, or in
substitution for, STAMP, as may be accepted by the trustee.  A certificate      
should only be sent by registered or certified mail for the protection of the   
unitholder.  Since tender of the certificate is required for redemption when one
has been issued, units represented by a certificate cannot be redeemed until the
certificate representing such units has been received by the purchasers.        

Redemption shall be made by the trustee no later than the seventh day 
following the day on which a tender for redemption is received (the "Redemption 
Date") by payment of cash equivalent to the redemption price, determined as set 
forth below under "Computation of Redemption Price," as of the close of regular 
trading on the New York Stock Exchange next following such tender, multiplied by

-36-

P-->485BPOS75th�Page�of�86TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�75th
the number of units being redeemed.  Any units redeemed shall be canceled and   
any undivided fractional interest in the related trust extinguished.  The price 
received upon redemption might be more or less than the amount paid by the      
unitholder depending on the value of the securities in the trust at the time of 
redemption.  Certain broker-dealers may charge a transaction fee for processing 
redemption requests.                                                            

  Under regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service, the trustee is
required to withhold a specified percentage of the principal amount of a unit   
redemption if the trustee has not been furnished the redeeming unitholder's tax 
identification number in the manner required by such regulations.  Any amount so
withheld is transmitted to the Internal Revenue Service and may be recovered by 
the unitholder only when filing a tax return.  Under normal circumstances the   
trustee obtains the unitholder's tax identification number from the selling     
broker.  However, any time a unitholder elects to tender units for redemption,  
such unitholder should make sure that the trustee has been provided a certified 
tax identification number in order to avoid this possible "back-up withholding."
In the event the trustee has not been previously provided such number, one must 
be provided at the time redemption is requested.  Any amounts paid on redemption
representing interest shall be withdrawn from the Interest Account of a trust to
the extent that funds are available for such purpose.  All other amounts paid on
redemption shall be withdrawn from the Principal Account for a trust.           

The trustee is empowered to sell securities in order to make funds    
available for the redemption of units.  To the extent that securities are sold, 
the size of a trust will be, and the diversity of a trust may be, reduced but   
each remaining unit will continue to represent approximately the same           
proportional interest in each security.  Sales may be required at a time when   
securities would not otherwise be sold and may result in lower prices than might
otherwise be realized.  The price received upon redemption may be more or less  
than the amount paid by the unitholder depending on the value of the securities 
in the portfolio at the time of redemption.                                     

 The trustee is irrevocably authorized in its discretion, if the sponsor
does not elect to purchase any unit tendered for redemption, in lieu of         
redeeming such units, to sell such units in the over-the-counter market for the 
account of tendering unitholders at prices which will return to the unitholders 
amounts in cash, net after brokerage commissions, transfer taxes and other      
charges, equal to or in excess of the redemption price for such units.  In the  
event of any such sale, the trustee shall pay the net proceeds thereof to the   
unitholders on the day they would otherwise be entitled to receive payment of   
the redemption price.                                                           

    The right of redemption may be suspended and payment postponed (1) for any
period during which the New York Stock Exchange is closed, other than customary 
weekend and holiday closings, or during which (as determined by the Securities  
and Exchange Commission) trading on the New York Stock Exchange is restricted;  
(2) for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which        
disposal by the trustee of securities is not reasonably practicable or it is not
reasonably practicable to fairly determine the value of the underlying          
securities in accordance with the trust agreement; or (3) for such other period 
as the Securities and Exchange Commission may by order permit.  The trustee is  
not liable to any person in any way for any loss or damage which may result from
any such suspension or postponement.

 COMPUTATION OF REDEMPTION PRICE.  The redemption price for units (the net
asset value) of each trust is computed by the evaluator as of the evaluation    
time stated in the prospectus next occurring after the tendering of a unit for  
redemption and on any other business day desired by it, by:                     

A.   adding:  (1) the cash on hand in the trust other than cash deposited in the
trust to purchase securities not applied to the purchase of such      
securities; (2) the aggregate value of each issue of the securities   
     (including "when issued" contracts, if any) held in the trust as determined
by the evaluator on the basis of bid prices therefor; and (3) interest
accrued and unpaid on the securities in the trust as of the date of   
computation;                                                          

B.   deducting therefrom (1) amounts representing any applicable taxes or       
   governmental charges payable out of the trust and for which no deductions
have been previously made for the purpose of additions to the Reserve 
Account; (2) an amount representing estimated accrued expenses of the 
trust, including but not limited to fees and expenses of the trustee  
     (including legal and auditing fees and any insurance costs), the evaluator,
the sponsor and counsel, if any; (3) cash held for distribution to    
    unitholders of record as of the business day prior to the evaluation being
made; and (4) other liabilities incurred by the trust; and            

C.   finally dividing the results of such computation by the number of units of 
the trust outstanding as of the date thereof.                         

RETIREMENT PLANS.  A trust may be suited for purchase by Individual   
Retirement Accounts, Keogh Plans, pension funds and other qualified retirement  
plans.  Generally, capital gains and income received under each of the foregoing
plans are deferred from Federal taxation.  All distributions from such plans are
generally treated as ordinary income but may, in some cases, be eligible for    
special income averaging or tax-deferred rollover treatment.  Investors         
considering participation in any such plan should review specific tax laws      
related thereto and should consult their attorneys or tax advisers with respect 
to the establishment and maintenance of any such plan.  Such plans are offered  
by brokerage firms and other financial institutions.  The trust may lower the   
minimum investment requirement for IRA accounts. Fees and charges with respect  
to such plans may vary.                                                         

OWNERSHIP OF UNITS.  Ownership of units will not be evidenced by      
certificates unless a unitholder, the unitholder's registered broker/dealer or  
the clearing agent for such broker/dealer makes a written request to the        
trustee.  Units are transferable by making a written request to the trustee and,
in the case of units evidenced by a certificate, by presenting and surrendering 
such certificate to the trustee properly endorsed or accompanied by a written   
instrument or instruments of transfer which should be sent by registered or     
certified mail for the protection of the unitholder.  Unitholders must sign such
written request, and such certificate or transfer instrument, exactly as their  
names appear on the records of the trustee and on any certificate representing  
the units to be transferred.  Such signatures must be guaranteed as described   
above.                                                                          

  Units may be purchased and certificates, if requested, will be issued in
denominations of one unit or any multiple thereof, subject to the minimum       
investment requirement.  Fractions of units, if any, will be computed to three  
decimal places.  Any certificate issued will be numbered serially for           
identification, issued in fully registered form and will be transferable only on
the books of the trustee.  The trustee may

require a unitholder to pay a reasonable fee, to be determined in the sole      
discretion of the trustee, for each certificate re-issued or transferred and to 
pay any governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with each such    
transfer or interchange.  The trustee at the present time does not intend to    
charge for the normal transfer or interchange of certificates.  Destroyed,      
stolen, mutilated or lost certificates will be replaced upon delivery to the    
trustee of satisfactory indemnity (generally amounting to 3% of the market value
of the units), affidavit of loss, evidence of ownership and payment of expenses 
incurred.                                                                       

TAXATION                                                                        

 The prospectus contains a discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax
issues concerning your trust and the purchase, ownership and disposition of     
trust units. The discussion below supplements the prospectus discussion and is  
qualified in its entirety by the prospectus discussion. Prospective investors   
should consult their own tax advisors with regard to the federal tax            
consequences of the purchase, ownership, or disposition of trust units, as well 
as the tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, locality, non-U.S. 
country, or other taxing jurisdiction.                                          

     The federal income tax summary below and in the prospectus is based in part
on the advice of counsel to your trust. The Internal Revenue Service could      
disagree with any conclusions set forth in these discussions. In addition, our  
counsel was not asked to review, and has not reached a conclusion with respect  
to the federal income tax treatment of the assets to be held by your trust. This
may not be sufficient for prospective investors to use for the purpose of       
avoiding penalties under federal tax law.                                       

     If so indicated in the prospectus, your trust intends (i) to elect and (ii)
to qualify annually as a regulated investment company under the Code and to     
comply with applicable distribution requirements so that it will not pay federal
income tax on income and capital gains distributed to its unitholders.          

  To qualify for the favorable U.S. federal income tax treatment generally
accorded to regulated investment companies, your trust must, among other things,
(a) derive in each taxable year at least 90% of its gross income from dividends,
interest, payments with respect to securities loans and gains from the sale or  
other disposition of stock, securities or foreign currencies or other income    
derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities or  
currencies, and net income from certain publicly traded partnerships; (b)       
diversify its holdings so that, at the end of each quarter of the taxable year, 
(i) at least 50% of the market value of the trust's assets is represented by    
cash and cash items (including receivables), U.S. government securities, the    
securities of other regulated investment companies and other securities, with   
such other securities of any one issuer generally limited for the purposes of   
this calculation to an amount not greater than 5% of the value of the trust's   
total assets and not greater than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of   
such issuer, and (ii) not more than 25% of the value of its total assets is     
invested in the securities (other than U.S. government securities or the        
securities of other regulated investment companies) of any one issuer, or two or
more issuers which the trust controls and are engaged in the same, similar or   
related trades or businesses, or the securities of certain publicly traded      
partnerships; and (c) distribute at least 90% of its investment company taxable 
income (which includes, among other items, dividends, interest and net short-   
term capital gains in excess of net long-term capital losses but excludes net   
capital gain, if any) and at least 90% of its net tax-exempt interest income    
each taxable year.                                                              

-39-

P-->485BPOS78th�Page�of�86TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�78th
     As a regulated investment company, your trust generally will not be subject
to U.S. federal income tax on its investment company taxable income (as that    
term is defined in the Code, but without regard to the deduction for dividends  
paid) and net capital gain (the excess of net long-term capital gain over net   
short term capital loss), if any, that it distributes to unitholders. The trusts
intend to distribute to its unitholders, at least annually, substantially all of
its investment company taxable income and net capital gain. If your trust       
retains any net capital gain or investment company taxable income, it will      
generally be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates on the    
amount retained. In addition, amounts not distributed on a timely basis in      
accordance with a calendar year distribution requirement are subject to a       
nondeductible 4% excise tax unless, generally, your trust distributes during    
each calendar year an amount equal to the sum of (1) at least 98% of its        
ordinary income (not taking into account any capital gains or losses) for the   
calendar year, (2) at least 98% of its capital gains in excess of its capital   
losses (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for the one-year period ending    
October 31 of the calendar year, and (3) any ordinary income and capital gains  
for previous years that were not distributed during those years. To prevent     
application of the excise tax, your trust intends to make its distributions in  
accordance with the calendar year distribution requirement. Further, if your    
trust retains any net capital gain, the trust may designate the retained amount 
as undistributed capital gains in a notice to unitholders who, if subject to    
federal income tax on long-term capital gains (i) will be required to include in
income for federal income tax purposes, as long-term capital gain, their share  
of such undistributed amount, and (ii) will be entitled to credit their         
proportionate share of the tax paid by the trust against their federal income   
tax liabilities if any, and to claim refunds to the extent the credit exceeds   
such liabilities. A distribution will be treated as paid on December 31 of the  
current calendar year if it is declared by your trust in October, November or   
December with a record date in such a month and paid by your trust during       
January of the following calendar year. These distributions will be taxable to  
unitholders in the calendar year in which the distributions are declared, rather
than the calendar year in which the distributions are received.                 

     If your trust failed to qualify as a regulated investment company or failed
to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement in any taxable year, the trust would
be taxed as an ordinary corporation on its taxable income (even if such income  
were distributed to its unitholders) and all distributions out of earnings and  
profits would be taxed to unitholders as ordinary dividend income.              

PERFORMANCE INFORMATION                                                         

   INTEREST, ESTIMATED LONG-TERM RETURN AND ESTIMATED CURRENT RETURN.  As of
the close of business on the business day before the trust's inception date, the
estimated long-term return and the estimated current return, if applicable, for 
each trust were as set forth in the "Essential Information" for each trust in   
the prospectus.  Estimated current return is calculated by dividing the         
estimated net annual interest income per unit by the public offering price.  The
estimated net annual interest income per unit will vary with changes in fees and
expenses of the trustee, the sponsor and the evaluator and with the principal   
prepayment, redemption, maturity, exchange or sale of the securities while the  
public offering price will vary with changes in the offering price of the       
underlying securities and accrued interest; therefore, there is no assurance    
that the present estimated current return will be realized in the future.       
Estimated long-term return is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into   
consideration, and determines and factors in the relative weightings of, the    
market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and
the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirements or average life of        

-40-

P-->485BPOS79th�Page�of�86TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�79th
all of the securities in a trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and    
sales fee associated with each trust unit.  Since the market values and         
estimated retirements of the securities and the expenses of a trust will change,
there is no assurance that the present estimated long-term return will be       
realized in the future.  Estimated current return and estimated long-term return
are expected to differ because the calculation of estimated long-term return    
reflects the estimated date and amount of principal returned while estimated    
current return calculations include only net annual interest income and public  
offering price.                                                                 

  GENERAL.  Information contained in this Information Supplement or in the
prospectus, as it currently exists or as further updated, may also be included  
from time to time in other prospectuses or in advertising material.  Information
on the performance of a trust strategy or the actual performance of a trust may 
be included from time to time in other prospectuses or advertising material and 
may reflect sales fees and expenses of a trust.  The performance of a trust may 
also be compared to the performance of money managers as reported in SEI Fund   
Evaluation Survey or of mutual funds as reported by Lipper Analytical Services  
Inc. (which calculates total return using actual dividends on ex-dates          
accumulated for the quarter and reinvested at quarter end), Money Magazine Fund 
Watch (which rates fund performance over a specified time period after sales fee
and assuming all dividends reinvested) or Wiesenberger Investment Companies     
Service (which states fund performance annually on a total return basis) or of  
the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index, the American Stock Exchange Index  
(unmanaged indices of stocks traded on the New York and American Stock          
Exchanges, respectively), the Dow Jones Industrial Average (an index of 30      
widely traded industrial common stocks) or the Standard & Poor's 500 Index (an  
unmanaged diversified index of 500 stocks) or similar measurement standards     
during the same period of time.                                                 

DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES RATINGS 

  STANDARD & POOR'S, A DIVISION OF THE MCGRAW-HILL COMPANIES. A Standard &
Poor's issue credit rating is a current opinion of the creditworthiness of an   
obligor with respect to a specific financial obligation, a specific class of    
financial obligations, or a specific financial program (including ratings on    
medium-term note programs and commercial paper programs). It takes into         
consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors, insurers, or other forms of   
credit enhancement on the obligation and takes into account the currency in     
which the obligation is denominated. The issue credit rating is not a           
recommendation to purchase, sell, or hold a financial obligation, inasmuch as it
does not comment as to market price or suitability for a particular investor.   

Issue credit ratings are based on current information furnished by the
obligors or obtained by Standard & Poor's from other sources it considers       
reliable. Standard & Poor's does not perform an audit in connection with any    
credit rating and may, on occasion, rely on unaudited financial information.    
Credit ratings may be changed, suspended, or withdrawn as a result of changes   
in, or unavailability of, such information, or based on other circumstances.    

Issue credit ratings can be either long term or short term. Short-term
ratings are generally assigned to those obligations considered short-term in the
relevant market. In the U.S., for example, that means obligations with an       
original maturity of no more than 365 days, including commercial paper. Short-  
term ratings are also used to indicate the creditworthiness of an obligor with  
respect to put                                                                  

-41-

P-->485BPOS80th�Page�of�86TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�80th
features on long-term obligations. The result is a dual rating, in which the    
short-term rating addresses the put feature, in addition to the usual long-term 
rating. Medium-term notes are assigned long-term ratings.                       

Long-Term Issue Credit Ratings                                                  

Issue credit ratings are based, in varying degrees, on the following  
considerations:                                                                 

*  Likelihood of payment capacity and willingness of the obligor to meet its
   financial commitment on an obligation in accordance with the terms of the
obligation;                                                           

*  Nature of and provisions of the obligation;                              

*  Protection afforded by, and relative position of, the obligation in the  
     event of bankruptcy, reorganization, or other arrangement under the laws of
bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors' rights.                

 The issue rating definitions are expressed in terms of default risk. As
such, they pertain to senior obligations of an entity. Junior obligations are   
typically rated lower than senior obligations, to reflect the lower priority in 
bankruptcy, as noted above. (Such differentiation applies when an entity has    
both senior and subordinated obligations, secured and unsecured obligations, or 
operating company and holding company obligations.) Accordingly, in the case of 
junior debt, the rating may not conform exactly with the category definition.   

AAA--An obligation rated 'AAA' has the highest rating assigned by Standard &    
Poor's. The obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on the          
obligation is extremely strong.                                                 

AA--An obligation rated 'AA' differs from the highest-rated obligations only to 
a small degree. The obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on the  
obligation is very strong.                                                      

A--An obligation rated 'A' is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects  
of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higher- 
rated categories. However, the obligor's capacity to meet its financial         
commitment on the obligation is still strong.                                   

BBB--An obligation rated 'BBB' exhibits adequate protection parameters. However,
adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to
a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the      
obligation.                                                                     

BB, B, CCC, CC, and C                                                           

  Obligations rated 'BB', 'B', 'CCC', 'CC', and 'C' are regarded as having
significant speculative characteristics. 'BB' indicates the least degree of     
speculation and 'C' the highest. While such obligations will likely have some   
quality and protective characteristics, these may be outweighed by large        
uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions.                         

-42-

P-->485BPOS81st�Page�of�86TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�81st
BB--An obligation rated 'BB' is less vulnerable to nonpayment than other        
speculative issues. However, it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to
adverse business, financial, or economic conditions which could lead to the     
obligor's inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the           
obligation.                                                                     

B--An obligation rated 'B' is more vulnerable to nonpayment than obligations    
rated 'BB', but the obligor currently has the capacity to meet its financial    
commitment on the obligation. Adverse business, financial, or economic          
conditions will likely impair the obligor's capacity or willingness to meet its 
financial commitment on the obligation.                                         

CCC--An obligation rated 'CCC' is currently vulnerable to nonpayment, and is    
dependent upon favorable business, financial, and economic conditions for the   
obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. In the event of     
adverse business, financial, or economic conditions, the obligor is not likely  
to have the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.        

CC--An obligation rated 'CC' is currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment.      

C--A subordinated debt or preferred stock obligation rated 'C' is currently     
highly vulnerable to nonpayment. The 'C' rating may be used to cover a situation
where a bankruptcy petition has been filed or similar action taken, but payments
on this obligation are being continued. A 'C' also will be assigned to a        
preferred stock issue in arrears on dividends or sinking fund payments, but that
is currently paying.                                                            

D--An obligation rated 'D' is in payment default. The 'D' rating category is    
used when payments on an obligation are not made on the date due even if the    
applicable grace period has not expired, unless Standard & Poor's believes that 
such payments will be made during such grace period. The 'D' rating also will be
used upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition or the taking of a similar action 
if payments on an obligation are jeopardized.                                   

Plus (+) or minus (-)--The ratings from 'AA' to 'CCC' may be modified by the    
addition of a plus (+) or minus (-) sign to show relative standing within the   
major rating categories.                                                        

N.R.--This indicates that no rating has been requested, that there is           
insufficient information on which to base a rating, or that Standard & Poor's   
does not rate a particular obligation as a matter of policy.                    

Active Qualifiers (Currently applied and/or outstanding)                        

i--This subscript is used for issues in which the credit factors, terms, or     
both, that determine the likelihood of receipt of payment of interest are       
different from the credit factors, terms or both that determine the likelihood  
of receipt of principal on the obligation. The 'i' subscript indicates that the 
rating addresses the interest portion of the obligation only. The 'i' subscript 
will always be used in conjunction with the 'p' subscript, which addresses      
likelihood of receipt of principal. For example, a rated obligation could be    
assigned ratings of "AAAp N.R.i" indicating that the principal portion is rated 
"AAA" and the interest portion of the obligation is not rated.                  

L--Ratings qualified with 'L' apply only to amounts invested up to federal      
deposit insurance limits.

p--This subscript is used for issues in which the credit factors, the terms, or 
both, that determine the likelihood of receipt of payment of principal are      
different from the credit factors, terms or both that determine the likelihood  
of receipt of interest on the obligation.  The 'p' subscript indicates that the 
rating addresses the principal portion of the obligation only. The 'p' subscript
will always be used in conjunction with the 'i' subscript, which addresses

assigned ratings of "AAAp N.R.i" indicating that the principal portion is rated 
"AAA" and the interest portion of the obligation is not rated.                  

pi--Ratings with a 'pi' subscript are based on an analysis of an issuer's       
published financial information, as well as additional information in the public
domain. They do not, however, reflect in-depth meetings with an issuer's        
management and are therefore based on less comprehensive information than       
ratings without a 'pi' subscript. Ratings with a 'pi' subscript are reviewed    
annually based on a new year's financial statements, but may be reviewed on an  
interim basis if a major event occurs that may affect the issuer's credit       
quality.                                                                        

pr--The letters 'pr' indicate that the rating is provisional. A provisional     
rating assumes the successful completion of the project financed by the debt    
being rated and indicates that payment of debt service requirements is largely  
or entirely dependent upon the successful, timely completion of the project.    
This rating, however, while addressing credit quality subsequent to completion  
of the project, makes no comment on the likelihood of or the risk of default    
upon failure of such completion. The investor should exercise his own judgment  
with respect to such likelihood and risk.                                       

t--This symbol indicates termination structures that are designed to honor their
contracts to full maturity or, should certain events occur, to terminate and    
cash settle all their contracts before their final maturity date.               

MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE, INC. Long-Term Obligation Ratings                    

  Moody's long-term obligation ratings are opinions of the relative credit
risk of fixed-income obligations with an original maturity of one year or more. 
They address the possibility that a financial obligation will not be honored as 
promised. Such ratings reflect both the likelihood of default and any financial 
loss suffered in the event of default.                                          

Long-Term Rating Definitions:                                                   

Aaa--Obligations rated Aaa are judged to be of the highest quality, with minimal
credit risk.                                                                    

Aa--Obligations rated Aa are judged to be of high quality and are subject to    
very low credit risk.                                                           

A--Obligations rated A are considered upper-medium grade and are subject to low 
credit risk.                                                                    

Baa--Obligations rated Baa are subject to moderate credit risk. They are        
considered medium-grade and as such may possess certain speculative             
characteristics.                                                                

-44-

P-->485BPOS83rd�Page�of�86TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�83rd
Ba--Obligations rated Ba are judged to have speculative elements and are subject
to substantial credit risk.                                                     

B--Obligations rated B are considered speculative and are subject to high credit
risk.                                                                           

Caa--Obligations rated Caa are judged to be of poor standing and are subject to 
very high credit risk.                                                          

Ca--Obligations rated Ca are highly speculative and are likely in, or very near,
default, with some prospect of recovery of principal and interest.              

C--Obligations rated C are the lowest rated class of bonds and are typically in 
default, with little prospect for recovery of principal or interest.            

Note: Moody's appends numerical modifiers 1, 2, and 3 to each generic rating    
classification from Aa through Caa. The modifier 1 indicates that the obligation
ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category; the modifier 2 indicates
a mid-range ranking; and the modifier 3 indicates a ranking in the lower end of 
that generic rating category.                                                   

Medium-Term Note Ratings                                                        

     Moody's assigns long-term ratings to individual debt securities issued from
medium-term note (MTN) programs, in addition to indicating ratings to MTN       
programs themselves. Notes issued under MTN programs with such indicated ratings
are rated at issuance at the rating applicable to all pari passu notes issued   
under the same program, at the program's relevant indicated rating, provided    
such notes do not exhibit any of the characteristics listed below:              

*  Notes containing features that link interest or principal to the credit  
performance of any third party or parties                             

*  Notes allowing for negative coupons, or negative principal               

  *  Notes containing any provision that could obligate the investor to make any
additional payments                                                   

*  Notes containing provisions that subordinate the claim.                  

   For notes with any of these characteristics, the rating of the individual
note may differ from the indicated rating of the program.                       

  Market participants must determine whether any particular note is rated,
and if so, at what rating level. Moody's encourages market participants to      
contact Moody's Ratings Desks or visit www.moodys.com directly if they have     
questions regarding ratings for specific notes issued under a medium-term note  
program. Unrated notes issued under an MTN program may be assigned an NR symbol.
