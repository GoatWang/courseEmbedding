LEGAL TERMS

(more...)A federal law that requires employers to provide an employee with 12 weeks of unpaid leave during a year's time for the birth or adoption of a child, family health needs or personal illness. The employer must allow the employee to return to the same position or a position similar to that held before taking the leave. There are exceptions to the FMLA: the most notable is that only employers with 50 or more employees are covered--about half the workforce.

SEPARATE PROPERTYIn community property states, property owned and controlled entirely by one spouse in a marriage. At divorce, separate property is not divided under the state's... (more...)In community property states, property owned and controlled entirely by one spouse in a marriage. At divorce, separate property is not divided under the state's property division laws, but is kept by the spouse who owns it. Separate property includes all property that a spouse obtained before marriage, through inheritance or as a gift. It also includes any property that is traceable to separate property -- for example, cash from the sale of a vintage car owned by one spouse before marriage-and any property that the spouses agree is separate property. Compare community property and equitable distribution.

QUALIFIED MEDICAL CHILD SUPPORT ORDER (QMSCO)A court order that provides health benefit coverage for the child of the noncustodial parent under that parent's group health plan.

GUARDIANAn adult who has been given the legal right by a court to control and care for a minor or her property. Someone who looks after a child's property is called a '... (more...)An adult who has been given the legal right by a court to control and care for a minor or her property. Someone who looks after a child's property is called a 'guardian of the estate.' An adult who has legal authority to make personal decisions for the child, including responsibility for his physical, medical and educational needs, is called a 'guardian of the person.' Sometimes just one person will be named to take care of all these tasks. An individual appointed by a court to look after an incapacitated adult may also be known as a guardian, but is more frequently called a conservator.

TENANCY BY THE ENTIRETYA special kind of property ownership that's only for married couples. Both spouses have the right to enjoy the entire property, and when one spouse dies, the su... (more...)A special kind of property ownership that's only for married couples. Both spouses have the right to enjoy the entire property, and when one spouse dies, the surviving spouse gets title to the property (called a right of survivorship). It is similar to joint tenancy, but it is available in only about half the states.

CENSUSAn official count of the number of people living in a certain area, such as a district, city, county, state, or nation. The United States Constitution requires ... (more...)An official count of the number of people living in a certain area, such as a district, city, county, state, or nation. The United States Constitution requires the federal government to perform a national census every ten years. The census includes information about the respondents' sex, age, family, and social and economic status.

COMMUNITY PROPERTYA method for defining the ownership of property acquired during marriage, in which all earnings during marriage and all property acquired with those earnings ar... (more...)A method for defining the ownership of property acquired during marriage, in which all earnings during marriage and all property acquired with those earnings are considered community property and all debts incurred during marriage are community property debts. Community property laws exist in Arizona, California, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin. Compare equitable distribution and separate property.

CONSOLIDATED OMNIBUS BUDGET RECONCILIATION ACT (COBRA)A federal law requiring that employers offer employees -- and their spouses and dependents -- continuing insurance coverage if their work hours are cut or they ... (more...)A federal law requiring that employers offer employees -- and their spouses and dependents -- continuing insurance coverage if their work hours are cut or they lose their job for any reason other than gross misconduct. Courts are still in the process of determining the meaning of gross misconduct, but it's clearly more serious than poor performance or judgment. COBRA also makes an ex-spouse and children eligible to receive group rate health insurance provided by the other ex-spouse's employer for three years following a divorce.

MINORIn most states, any person under 18 years of age. All minors must be under the care of a competent adult (parent or guardian) unless they are 'emancipated'--in ... (more...)In most states, any person under 18 years of age. All minors must be under the care of a competent adult (parent or guardian) unless they are 'emancipated'--in the military, married or living independently with court permission. Property left to a minor must be handled by an adult until the minor becomes an adult under the laws of the state where he or she lives.

Responsibilities: Chief Human Resources Officer, Chairman Philips Foundation
 
Ronald de Jong is Chief Human Resources Officer, a position he has held since April 2017. He is also Executive Vice President and has been a Member of the Executive Committee since 2011.

As Chief Market Leader, Ronald led the transformation of Philips’ market organization under the global Accelerate! program in 2011 with the objective of building more entrepreneurial market and country organizations; improving customer focus by generating deep market and customer insights; developing local business opportunities by co-creating locally relevant propositions with customers and helping drive the company’s approach to winning more long-term strategic partnerships. 
 
Since 2014 Ronald has been Chairman of the board of the Philips Foundation, set up to enable lasting social change in disadvantaged communities and access to healthcare through the application of innovation, talent and resources provided by Philips.
 
Ronald was appointed Distinguished Professor of Practice in Business at the School of Economics and Management of Tilburg University in July 2017. He is responsible for educating students in marketing, services and innovation management, and for contributing to the impact of research on society and applied science.
 
In 2007 Ronald was honored by the World Economic Forum as a ‘Young Global Leader’ and in 2015 he was proclaimed a Distinguished Fellow of the Globalization, Aging, Innovation and Care (GAIC) research program at Tilburg University. Ronald is a member of the Supervisory Board of SNV, an international not-for-profit organization based in the Netherlands.
