KT High-Tech Marketing Inc. Key Developments

KULR Technology Corp to Debut New Space-Ready Carbon Fiber Cooling Solutions
May 23 17
KULR Technology announced that it will unveil three new, NASA-tested carbon fiber cooling solutions for space and commercial technology. The three products are: Phase change material (PCM) heat sink; Fiber thermal interface material (FTI); Lithium-Ion battery runaway shield (TRS). The PCM heat sinks are integrated into their respective mounting decks so that the thermal and structural functions are combined in one unit. The A-deck provides >900 kJ of latent heat and >12 kJ/°C sensible heat frozen (>14k J/°C melted). The I-deck provides >600 kJ of latent heat and >9 kJ/°C sensible heat frozen (>10.8 kJ/°C melted). KULR thermal interface materials (FTI) consist of sparse carbon fiber velvets attached to a film of polymer or metal. The fiber packing density and orientation are selected to serve a wide range of applications, including hostile thermal and chemical environments, sliding interfaces, and interfaces with widely varying gaps. They require low contact pressure and provide high thermal conductivity. KULR has developed a vaporizing heatsink aimed at passive resistance to thermal runaway propagation (TRS) in lithium ion batteries in partnership with NASA Johnson Space Center. The heat sink shield keeps trigger cell's neighbor cells safe from thermal runaway propagation. This lightweight solution can achieve 220 Wh/kg in battery energy density. This solution is used for energy storage, industrial and consumer electronics applications where it requires a lightweight and passive solution to the battery safe.

The selling stockholders will receive all of the proceeds from the sale of the
shares offered by them under this prospectus. The Company will not receive any
proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders covered by this
prospectus. 

With respect to sales of shares by the Company, the proceeds thereof will be
received by the Company. The Company plans to use all of the net proceeds from
this offering received by it to fund operations, for working capital, for future
capital investment and for general corporate purposes.


The Company would compete with traditional distributors and marketers of
technology products. Such companies would include large U.S. electronics
distribution companies, such as Avnet and Future Electronics, as well as OEM
Brand Marketing Companies, such as Audiovox and Sylvania.


Company Description
The Company plans to market and distribute technology products. The Company
intends to market and sell these products to end users and customers based on
agreements that it plans to enter into other companies that allow the Company to
distribute products. 

The Company has identified three growth


 markets (IoT, Mobile and Energy Storage)
in consumer electronics and energy markets to target initially. The Company
plans to work closely with supply partners to provide the latest technology and
products in these three markets to serve its customers. 

The Company plans to focus on products that have very compact designs and come
with highly efficient thermal management designs. Better thermal management
designs make the product more reliable and safer to operate. A compact design is
more attractive for the end user. 

Devices which the Company intends to distribute are the following: HD Security
Cameras, Virtual Reality (VR) and Augment Reality (AR) glasses, drones accessory
devices, connected car accessories and smart home devices. 

Marketing and sales of Internet of Things (IoT), Mobile and Energy Storage
Devices will occur in the United States and the Greater China Region. 

Mobile devices include: Smartphone modules for consumer and industrial
applications, tablet computers for business application and 3/4G modules for
machine-to-machine (M2M) applications. Energy storage devices include:
Lithium-Ion Battery (LiB) pack for electrical bike, LiB pack for industrial
machine application and medical equipment applications. 

The Company believes that today’s consumers value choice, not just in terms of
the variety of products on offer, but also in the channels where they can buy
them. Whereas the internet allows the increasingly-savvy consumer to research
products from home at his/her leisure in terms of functionality, more 
importantly, it also allows him/her to find the best deal in terms of price.
Store-based retailing, on the other hand, offers consumers expert advice; the
latter is particularly important in TCG, where products are becoming
increasingly complex, and the prospect of the interconnected home is resulting
in increased need for installation and consumer demand for after sales care. The
Company will provide both online and in-store product marketing materials for
its partners and retail channels to reach and educate its customers.
---

The Company was incorporated in the State of Delaware in December 2015, and was
formerly known as Grant Hill Acquisition Corporation. 

In April 2016, the Company implemented a change of control by issuing shares to
new shareholders, redeeming shares of existing shareholders, electing new
officers and directors and accepting the resignations of its then existing
officers and directors. In connection with the change of control, the
shareholders of the Company and its board of directors unanimously approved the
change of the Company’s name from Grant Hill Acquisition Corporation to KT
High-Tech Marketing Inc. in April 2016. 

The Company is located at 14440 Big Basin Way, #12, Saratoga, California 95070.
The Company’s main phone number is (408) 663-5247.
