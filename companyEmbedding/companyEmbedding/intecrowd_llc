Florida Institute Funds Orlando-based Intecrowd

						 from   Florida Institute for the Commercialization of Public Research 











 
















































 

 




















 


GAINESVILLE and BOCA RATON, Fla., Dec. 14, 2015 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The Florida Institute for the Commercialization of Public Research (the Institute) announced today that it has finalized a funding agreement with Intecrowd LLC an Orlando-based company with technology licensed from the University of Central Florida. The Institute supports new company creation based on publicly-funded research, and bridges early funding gaps for companies spinning out of Florida-based universities and research institutions. 
Intecrowd is a Workday Services Partner focused solely on helping Workday Human Capital Management (HCM) customers integrate with third-party payroll solutions. Workday is a leading provider of enterprise cloud applications for finance and human resources. Customers who require payroll beyond Workday's country-specific offerings in the U.S., UK, and Canada can take advantage of bi-directional, pre-built payroll integrations from certified partners in the Workday Global Payroll Cloud. Intecrowd works closely with these global payroll providers to help customers integrate their payroll solutions with Workday HCM, enabling delivery of one global system with a consistent user experience. Intecrowd also supports Workday HCM customers who select a payroll provider that is not part of the Workday Global Payroll Cloud and build their integration with Workday Cloud Connect for third-party payroll. Intecrowd is comprised of deployment leaders, technical experts, and payroll functional experts.
"One of the big challenges that global organizations face is the complexity involved with serving the needs of employees in different countries around the world, making payroll one of the most important components of any Workday deployment," said Don McDougal, chief executive officer, Intecrowd. "As the only Workday partner focused exclusively on payroll integration, customers will benefit from Intecrowd's deep understanding of local payroll requirements and relationships with Workday payroll providers."
"Intecrowd is helping companies determine efficient integration designs and rapid deployment strategies that ultimately lower costs and increase efficiency and customer satisfaction," said Jamie Grooms, chief executive officer, the Institute. "The Institute is pleased to support Intecrowd's delivery of business process improvement solutions to help large companies rationalize human resource data and improve the bottom line."
"The Institute's investment in Intecrowd enables us to accelerate talent acquisition and the development of our product line, which provides Intecrowd with unique tools, capabilities and offerings in the Cloud Integration space," adds Don McDougal.
About the Institute 
Formed by the Florida Legislature in 2007, the Florida Institute for the Commercialization of Public Research is a non-profit organization that works collaboratively with the technology licensing and commercialization offices of Florida's state universities and private research institutions to leverage a $2B+ research base and form investable companies that create clean jobs in new industries that are driving the global economy. Over 100 new company projects have been identified across the state, and the Institute deploys company building and funding programs to promising Florida startups. Forty-seven companies have been funded since the program's inception.
About Intecrowd
