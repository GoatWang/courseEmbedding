Sparrow Enterprises - Importer and distributor of coconut, seeds, cocoa, chocolate and milk powders, and other ingredients.



Weather Forecast | Weather Maps



Located in East Boston, Massachusetts, Sparrow Enterprises  was founded in 1924 as a regional distributor of cocoa powder and chocolate to  the confectionary trade.  Today, Sparrow  offers over 10 specialty chocolate lines, and carries over 2,000 products for  use throughout the food industry.  We  specialize in chocolate and other commodity items for use in baking,  confectionary, and ice cream/dairy industries.   Many of our products are packed conveniently for foodservice.  Our wide range of products allows Sparrow to  serve users across all spectrums, from institutions and manufacturers to fine  pastry chefs.
Special Certifications and other requirements – Many of our  products are covered by special certification.   We have many Kosher products, some of which are also Pareve.  Nut free certification is available for some  of our chocolates and other products. Gluten Free products and statements are  also available for many items. As the elimination of Trans Fats from our diets  becomes of greater concern, more and more oil based products, such as compound  chocolates, garlic spread, etc, are available trans fat free.  
The absence of genetically modified organisms appears to be  the next big concern in foodstuffs, though at the moment this is a much larger  issue in Europe that in the U.S. If GMO, or other special certification, is  required for an important project please call us to discuss your needs.
Our product categories include but are not limited to:
 

Chocolate
Imported and Domestic Couvertures
Chocolate Specialty Items
Nuts, Dried Fruit and Seeds
Spices and Flavors
Ready-to-Fill Pastry Shells
Frozen Fruit Purees
Baking Ingredients and Staples
Canned Fillings and Fruit Slices
Toppings and Garnishes
Cake Decorations
Dessert Powder Bases
Ganache

See our Product page for more details.



                  Sparrow is proud to share some great news!! We now have a solar energy system up and running on our roof in East Boston.  The Solectria Inverter System  was activated  in July 2014  by another Massachusetts company. We are very pleased to be able to show our commitment to green energy and to the local business community.
                  Over its lifetime the system will produce about 3,000,000 kwh, which is enough power to replace 250,000 gallons of gasoline, or the equivalent of the electricity needed to power nearly 300 homes. 
This system will have a payback of less than 4 years, so that the investment in pollution reduction and energy saving is well worth it, for us, for our neighborhood, and for a more eco-friendly world.
