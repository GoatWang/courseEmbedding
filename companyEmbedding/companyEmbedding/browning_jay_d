New guns and gear for 2017






















































































Celebrating 40 years of the BPS shotgun. 1977 - 2017. 




A proven reputation for durability and reliability. In his lifetime John Moses Browning designed a number of pump action shotguns. His designs and patents still influence pump action design well more than a century later. And although he did not design Browning's famous BPS shotgun, his fingerprints are clearly all over it. The ad at left is from the introduction and reflects the orignal price. You can only wish.  READ MORE ABOUT THE HISTORY OF BROWNING AND THE BPS. 














Celebrating 100 years of the BAR semi-auto. 1917 to 2017. 




It has been 100 years since the original John Moses Browning BAR was invented. 50 years later the sporting version arrived on the market making this year a unique celebration for the BAR concept. Clearly, today's BAR reigns supreme among all semi-auto centerfire rifles, with proven accuracy, exceptional strength and durability like no other.  READ MORE ABOUT THE 100 YEAR HISTORY OF THE BROWNING BAR . . .

Why should you buy a Browning shotgun?




The pleasure of owning a Browning shotgun is derived partly by legendary traditions of excellence started by John Moses Browning  a century and a half  ago. The original Automatic 5 shotgun established a standard that was never truly supplanted. And today's brilliant Browning shotguns are derivative of all the great inventiveness of our founder.  Not all guns suit everyone perfectly. But there is a perfect Browning shotgun for you.

A New Benchmark in Bolt-Action Design







The bolt-action rifle was forever changed with the introduction of the Browning X-Bolt. The X-Bolt builds on the proven successes of past Browning rifles, and adds numerous improvements that  place the X-Bolt at the top of any side by side comparison. Most notable are the adjustable three-lever Feather Trigger™ system that offers the best feel on any Browning rifle ever and our proprietary barrel manufacturing systems which produce barrels recognized for their custom-class accuracy.












WATCH THE FULL PLAYLIST OF BROWNING X-BOLT VIDEOS AND LEARN WHAT ALL THE FUSS IS ABOUT.  CLICK OR TAP HERE.










There is a lot of talk on the internet these days about what makes the Browning X-Bolt achieve accuracy that used to be reserved for custom rifles. In this video independently produced by GoHunt.com the concepts of acheiving M.O.A. accuracy and beyond are explored in detail. The GoHunt team came to Browning headquarters in Utah and asked the important questions. 




























The X-Bolt is free-floated by bedding the front and rear of the action for stability and to help maintain barrel to stock spacing for consistent accuracy. A recessed muzzle crown helps protect the rifling from damage.






















The X-Bolt's new three-lever Feather Trigger provides a clean, crisp pull with no take-up or creep and minimal overtravel. Read more...





















X-Lock scope mounts feature an all new four screw per base design that replaces the traditional two screw system. The benefits are obvious, with the bases being secured at all four corners. Read more...




















This recoil pad has proprietary construction and material to promote a directional deflection of recoil forces, pulling the stock comb away from your face to reduce felt recoil and muzzle climb. Read more...





















The bolt unlock button works in conjunction with the top-tang safety to provide an added measure of safety during checking and unloading of the chamber. Read more...





















Short 60° bolt lift is fast cycling and allows you to work the bolt quickly without the scope getting in the way. Read more...





















An all new detachable rotary magazine is incorporated into the X-Bolt. Constructed from a durable lightweight polymer, the magazine is designed to feed cartridges directly in-line with the bolt. Read more...




















X-Bolt Product Overviews


































Innovation is in Our Blood: The John Browning legacy. 







Have you watched the video series on the X-Bolt? In a series of informative videos, Browning's top gun designers and engineers talk about what sets Browning apart from the rest. Browning broke new ground with the X-Bolt in 2008. Other companies are attempting to imitate Browning, but Browning remains the true innovators and Browning consistently develops and patents new concepts and features that no other company even comes close to providing. Since the beginnings of the company, with John Moses Browning as our chief designer and inventor, ground-breaking innovation has been in our blood. You be the judge. WATCH THE FULL X-BOLT VIDEO COLLECTION HERE. 




















Willi Schmidt is the host of the TV show Pure Hunting. Willi puts together hunts the way ordinary hunters can. He is a DIY guy that hunts public land. That means he has to work harder and smarter to achieve success. Watch his video above that explains why he chooses the Browning X-Bolt. For more on his show go to: www.purehunting.com









IMPORTANT NOTE: Some X-Bolt rifles are pictured with scope bases, rings and scopes mounted. This is for illustration purposes only. No actual models come with scopes, rings and bases unless specifically listed in the specifications for that model.

The Leading Over and Under for Generations




Today's Citori over and under line-up includes the original, legendary Citori (with many proven models and configurations) and the new 725 version (with low profile receiver, mechanical triggers and Invector-DS).  Which one is right for you? No over and under has more fans than the original Citori and it continues to reign supreme in top performance and incredible durability. The 725 offers a new level of "One With The Gun" handling finesse that sets a new bar for the competition to shoot for.









Citori. A perfect blend of beauty and performance.




The Citori is more than a shotgun, it is the quintessential representative of the quality of the Browning brand. Wood-to-metal fit is paramount on the Citori and with tight, consistent junctions it doesn’t disappoint. Action components are machined to exacting tolerances, heat-treated for greater strength and fitted using the traditional lampblack-and-file method to ensure the precise fit of critical components prior to being assembled to the action. It is this extreme level of craftsmanship that leads to the dependable function, impeccable looks, championship performance and respect from both Citori owners and the competition alike.
We challenge you to take any Citori from the rack and you’ll see the same high level of fit and finish on every gun. Open and close the action and throw it to your shoulder. Sight down the barrels. Only then will you fully understand why the Citori has gained its reputation as the finest over and under shotgun available in the world. 




Hammers and Ejectors




Hammers are powered by powerful coil-type mainsprings for positive primer ignition. The convenient barrel selector allows the shooter to choose which barrel fires on the first pull of the single trigger, and the second pull fires the remaining barrel. Ejectors are activated by a sharp hammer blow for more positive ejection than the push imparted by competitors’ ejectors. The automatic ejectors eject fired shells when the breech is opened and elevate unfired shells for easy removal.





Locking Bolt and Hinge Pin




The Citori utilizes a transverse-mounted, full-width tapered locking bolt. The tapered locking bolt engages a full-width tapered recess in the rear barrel lugs. The taper allows the bolt to seat deeper over the years. The hinge pin extends from one side of the receiver to the other for maximum strength. It’s the reason people say a Citori wears in, not out.












Full-width hinge pin











Full-width locking bolt







Chrome Chambers




All Citori shotguns feature chrome-plated chambers that resist the toll thousands of shells can take on lesser quality guns. Corrosion resistance is also greatly improved.





Triple Trigger System


















All Sporting Clays, XT and XS Series Citori shotguns come equipped with the Triple Trigger™ system, which allows the shooter to fine tune the length of pull and switch between a wide checkered, a narrow smooth and a wide smooth canted trigger shoe.





















12 and 20 gauge Citori shotguns feature Back-Bored Technology.





















12 and 20 gauge Citori shotguns include the interchangeable Invector-Plus™ choke tube system. 28 gauge and .410 bore Citori shotguns include the Standard Invector™ system.
