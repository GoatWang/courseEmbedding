FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

To present new preclinical data suggesting the potential utility of DCR-PHXC for treating all forms of primary hyperoxaluria (PH)


Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Presents New Preclinical Data Suggesting the Potential Utility of DCR-PHXC
Jul 17 17
Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc. presented on July 15, 2017, new preclinical data suggesting the potential utility of DCR-PHXC, a GalXC™-based investigational therapy, for treating all forms of primary hyperoxaluria (PH). In a series of presentations at the 12th International Workshop on Primary Hyperoxaluria for Professionals, Patients and Families in Tenerife, Spain from July 14-16, 2017, Dicerna scientists presented research from animal models demonstrating how DCR-PHXC inhibits the lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) gene, which Dicerna has identified as potentially being an optimal therapeutic target in patients with PH, a group of severe, rare, inherited disorders of the liver that often result in kidney failure. In patients with PH, the liver over-produces oxalate, a metabolite that can accumulate throughout the body and particularly in the kidneys, often resulting in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and the need for both kidney and liver transplants. DCR-PHXC, the lead investigational product candidate in Dicerna's pipeline of therapies targeting rare diseases of the liver, yields potent, liver-specific LDHA inhibition in animal models of PH, an effect that reduces oxalate to near-normal levels, which may prevent the damage caused to kidneys and other organs by oxalate accumulation. At the 12th International Workshop, Dicerna presented research findings on LDHA inhibition, which was shown in animal models to reduce oxalate to normal or near-normal levels in PH types 1, 2, and ethylene glycol-induced PH. In contrast, research findings showed that inhibiting the enzyme glycolate oxidase (GO) - a common target of investigational therapies for PH, including Dicerna’s earlier IV-administered program for PH1 - does not appear to have the potential to treat PH2 or IPH. In animal models of PH2 and ethylene glycol-induced PH, LDHA knockdown with DCR-PHXC nearly normalized oxalate levels within one-month post-treatment, whereas oxalate levels remained unchanged and elevated in animals receiving GO-targeted therapy. LDHA reduction has a linear correlation with oxalate reduction and offers a minimal metabolic intervention, unlike GO reduction. These benefits of LDHA inhibition may translate into consistent therapeutic activity even in the event of a missed dose. There are numerous case reports of LDHA deficiency naturally occurring in humans, with no reported adverse effects due to deficiency in the liver. DCR-PHXC is the most advanced product candidate utilizing Dicerna’s GalXC technology, a proprietary platform that advances the development of next-generation RNAi-based therapies designed to silence disease-driving genes in the liver. GalXC compounds are intended to be broadly applicable across multiple therapeutic areas, including rare diseases, chronic liver diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and viral infectious diseases. GalXC enables subcutaneous delivery of RNAi therapies to hepatocytes in the liver and offers several distinct potential benefits, as extensively demonstrated in various animal models. Such benefits could include potent silencing of LDHA and other genes; highly specific targeting to hepatocytes, sparing other cell types in the body; a long duration of action; and a simple, infrequent dosing regimen. The 12th International Workshop also featured an update from the Primary HYperoxaluria Observational Study (PHYOS), an international, multicenter study in patients with PH1 that is collecting data on key biochemical parameters implicated in the pathogenesis of PH1 to better understand the baseline disease state, knowledge that will help guide long-term drug development plans. The study’s primary objective is to measure changes in oxalate, glycolate, and other metabolites over a six-month period in patients with PH1. In a poster presentation, PHYOS investigators reported data from 20 enrolled patients with a median age at screening of 21 years (range 12-61 years). The patients had been diagnosed at a median age of 7 years (range 1-59 years), and 14 patients (74%) had a medical history of renal stones. Over the six-month observation period the variability (coefficient of variation) between 24-hour urine measurements of oxalate at different time points was 28%. These data will help the Dicerna clinical team design a clinical study using 24-hour urinary oxalate excretion as a surrogate marker for clinical benefit.

Dicerna Pharmaceuticals














Pipeline


Pipeline
Developing next-generation RNAi therapies.


Dicerna has a growing pipeline of product candidates to address unmet medical needs in diseases involving the liver, including rare diseases, chronic liver diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and viral infectious diseases. Our optimized, subcutaneously administered GalXCTM molecules are designed to potently and selectively silence genes that are implicated in these disorders. We have qualified dozens of disease-associated genes in clinical indications where we believe an RNAi-based inhibitor may provide substantial benefit to patients, providing expansive therapeutic opportunities. In addition, Dicerna has developed hits and/or optimized GalXC conjugate inhibitors against almost 40 of these qualified targets.
We choose to attack disease targets where we have high confidence that successful silencing of the target gene will provide substantial benefit to patients, and for which we can move rapidly through the drug approval process. Whether focusing on our core area of rare diseases or on serious, life-threatening, chronic diseases, the common threads are the expression of faulty genes in the liver and a substantial need for new treatment options. In making these choices, we are working to improve the lives of patients suffering from potentially debilitating conditions.
 
FOCUSED PATIENT POPULATIONS (RARE DISEASES)
Primary Hyperoxaluria (PH)
DCR-PHXC, a subcutaneously delivered GalXC-based investigational therapy for treating all forms of primary hyperoxaluria (PH), is the lead investigational product candidate in Dicerna’s pipeline of therapies targeting rare diseases of the liver. Dicerna is preparing to file a clinical trial application in the EU in the fourth quarter, 2017, and plans to begin Phase 1 clinical trials in early 2018 as the Company pursues its goal of developing new therapies that address the full range of patients with PH.
PH is a family of severe, rare, genetic liver disorders characterized by overproduction of oxalate, a natural chemical in the body that is normally eliminated as waste through the kidneys. In patients with PH, the kidneys are unable to eliminate the large amount of oxalate that is produced, and the accumulation of oxalate can result in severe damage to the kidneys and other organs. Currently, there are no approved therapies for the treatment of PH in the US.
 
Genetic Orphan Disease
Dicerna launched a GalXC research program that targets a liver-expressed gene involved in a serious rare disease. The compound is currently in preclinical development.
 
COMPLEX DISEASES WITH LARGE PATIENT POPULATIONS
Hypercholesterolemia (PCSK9-targeted therapy)
We are using our GalXC RNAi platform to develop a therapeutic that targets the PCSK9 gene for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Based on the Company’s candidate development work during the fourth quarter of 2016, Dicerna is positioned to advance DCR-PCSK9, which targets the PCSK9 gene and will be evaluated for the treatment of statin-refractory patients with hypercholesterolemia, into formal preclinical development. PCSK9 is a validated target for hypercholesterolemia, and there are FDA-approved therapies targeting PCSK9 that are based on monoclonal antibody technology. Based on preclinical studies, we believe that our GalXC RNAi platform can produce a PCSK9-targeted therapy with attractive commercial properties, such as small subcutaneous injection volumes and less frequent dosing.
An undisclosed rare disease involving the liver
We are developing a GalXC-based therapeutic, targeting a liver-expressed gene involved in a serious rare disease. For competitive reasons, we have not yet publicly disclosed the target gene or disease. We have selected this target gene and disease based on criteria that include having a strong therapeutic hypothesis, a readily-identifiable patient population, the availability of a potentially predictive biomarker, high unmet medical need, favorable competitive positioning, and what we believe is a rapid projected path to approval. We plan to file an IND for this program in the second quarter of 2018.
Chronic Hepatitis B Virus infection
Dicerna is using its GalXC RNAi platform to investigate potential pharmaceutical treatments for HBV. Current therapies for HBV rarely lead to a long-term immunological cure as measured by the clearance of HBV surface antigen (“HBsAg”) and sustained HBV deoxyribonucleic acid (“DNA”) suppression. Based on preclinical studies, we are evaluating whether our GalXC RNAi platform can produce an experimental HBV-targeted therapy that profoundly reduces HBsAg expression in HBV patients and that has the potential to be delivered in a commercially attractive subcutaneous dosing paradigm. Dicerna would expect to file an IND or a CTA around the end of 2018.
Chronic Liver Disease
Dicerna is using its GalXC RNAi platform to investigate potential pharmaceutical therapeutic options for the treatment of chronic liver diseases (CLDs) such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC), and other indications. Estimates suggest that more than three million Americans live with some form of chronic liver disease. Based on preclinical studies, Dicerna believes that its GalXC RNAi platform enables exquisite targeting of hepatocytes and the silencing of injury-responsive mRNAs that result in release of profibrotic damage signals offering a novel approach to developing potential therapeutics for the treatment of CLD.

Unlocking the Potential of RNAi
RNA interference (RNAi) is a natural biological method for silencing or “turning off” specific genes known to cause or drive disease. In the RNAi process, small, carefully selected molecules of RNA inhibit the expression of these harmful genes by causing the targeted destruction of their messenger RNAs (mRNAs). RNAi has the potential to generate a revolution in medicine.on in medicine.

Unlocking the Potential of RNAi
RNA interference (RNAi) is a natural biological method for silencing or “turning off” specific genes known to cause or drive disease. In the RNAi process, small, carefully selected molecules of RNA inhibit the expression of these harmful genes by causing the targeted destruction of their messenger RNAs (mRNAs). RNAi has the potential to generate a revolution in medicine.on in medicine.
