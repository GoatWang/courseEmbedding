  DESCRIPTION  


The Pro Hunter is so much more than your standard pack. Our custom internal/external aluminum frame is designed to conform to your back, transfer the weight to your hips, and offer great ventilation. The frame also incorporates a quick-attach Pack Pod™ that can be used for glassing, shooting, or filming at a quarter of the weight! In addition to this new tripod technology, we’ve designed a revolutionary way of packing heads and meat out of the field. Our custom head carrier is a simple and effective way to carry the skull, cape and antlers of big game, as well as quarters or boned-out meat.
The Pro Hunter is perfect for day hunts as well as overnight or multi day hunts and can handle anything else you throw at it. We’ve drawn from decades of hunting experience to design the end-all-be-all pack to make your hunting life easier and more comfortable. If you can only use one pack, this is it!

Great app to view daily tech hunts!


            The Product Hunter app is great, especially the Cortana integration! However, to improve the app, I would love if you added all the sections from the site (games, books, podcasts, collections). Also, it would be great if you could upvote products on the app

            Too slow. A good app for browsing, and the live tile integration is nice, but it's far from perfect
