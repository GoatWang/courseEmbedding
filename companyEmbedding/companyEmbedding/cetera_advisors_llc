 FINRA Rules 2090 & 2111








New FINRA Rules Effective July 2012Welcome! Your financial representative may have referred you to this page to learn more about an upcoming regulatory rule change, intended to help protect investors, that is scheduled to go into effect later this year. As your financial representative’s broker-dealer, Cetera Advisors plays an important role in ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements and adapting to rule changes. Although this upcoming rule change will not become effective until July 9, 2012, we are working to facilitate the transition in advance of the regulation deadline to ensure that both our firm and your financial professional are fully prepared.BackgroundIn 2011, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved two new rules, both modifications of existing rules, that were proposed by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). FINRA is the largest independent regulator of the U.S. securities industry (previously known as the National Association of Securities Dealers, or NASD). As summarized in its mission statement, “FINRA is dedicated to investor protection and market integrity through effective and efficient regulation of the securities industry.”These new rules, Rules 2090 and 2111 (described below under More about the Rules), expand upon previous industry regulations. As a result, your financial representative may need to ask you for updated or additional information in order to ensure he or she is in full compliance with the new rules.What type of information might I need to provide to my financial representative, and why?Included in the information that must be collected and maintained in order to comply with the new rules are a customer’s risk tolerance, liquid net worth, account liquidity needs andinvestments held elsewhere. Your representative will explain to you the exact information needed.What if I’ve already given my representative this information?Even if you have already provided this information to your representative in the past, you may be asked for it again, as this information must be captured and maintained in a newly required format.Will I notice any other changes?In the coming months, you may also notice that paperwork needed to create a new account or update information on an existing account has been expanded and updated. If you receive letters periodically confirming your financial status or account needs, you will notice they have been expanded and updated.How can I ensure I’m protected?There are a number of steps you can take to help protect yourself and your information. When providing information or discussing your account over the phone, be absolutely certain you are speaking with your representative or someone from their office. If you ever suspect that an individual who has called you is not from your representative’s office, simply tell them you need to call back, then hang up and call the office using the number you have on file.Other steps you can take to help protect yourself and your information can be found here on our Security page. Additional resources to help protect against fraud, scams and identity theft can be found on the following websites:FINRA  Protect YourselfFederal Trade Commission  ID Theft and Data SecurityMore about the RulesFINRA Rules 2090 and 2111 are two interrelated rules that are modifications of two former rules, NYSE 405 and NASD 2310, but also expand on those rules. By requiring firms, or “members,” to collect and maintain a range of information about customers’ financial status and account needs, these rules are designed to help ensure that financial representatives have the information necessary to make recommendations that are suitable to their individual customers.Below is the wording of the new rules. Complete details and background information on the rules can be found in FINRA’s Regulatory Notice 11-25. Though this language is geared toward industry professionals rather than individual investors, it may help you understand the essence of the rules.Rule 2090 (Know Your Customer) Every member shall use reasonable diligence, in regard to the opening and maintenance of every account, to know (and retain) the essential facts concerning every customer and concerning the authority of each person acting on behalf of such customer.Rule 2111 (Suitability) (a) A member or an associated person must have a reasonable basis to believe that a recommended transaction or investment strategy involving a security or securities is suitable for the customer, based on the information obtained through the reasonable diligence of the member or associated person to ascertain the customer’s investment profile. A customer’s investment profile includes, but is not limited to, the customer’s age, other investments, financial situation and needs, tax status, investment objectives, investment experience, investment time horizon, liquidity needs, risk tolerance, and any other information the customer may disclose to the member or associated person in connection with such recommendation. (b) A member or associated person fulfills the customer-specific suitability obligation for an institutional account, as defined in NASD Rule 3110(c)(4), if (1) the member or associated person has a reasonable basis to believe that the institutional customer is capable of evaluating investment risks independently, both in general and with regard to particular transactions and investment strategies involving a security or securities and (2) the institutional customer affirmatively indicates that it is exercising independent judgment in evaluating the member’s or associated person’s recommendations. Where an institutional customer has delegated decision-making authority to an agent, such as an investment adviser or a bank trust department, these factors shall be applied to the agent.Additional InformationPlease contact your financial representative if you have questions.

Financial Industry Regulatory Authority Orders 12 Firms to Pay Restitution Totaling More than $4 Million and Fines Totaling More than $2.6 Million for Failing to Apply Available Sales Charge Discounts to Customers’ Purchases of Unit Investment Trusts and Related Supervisory Failures
Oct 20 15
The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) announced that it has ordered 12 firms to pay restitution totaling more than $4 million and fines totaling more than $2.6 million for failing to apply available sales charge discounts to customers’ purchases of Unit Investment Trusts (UITs), and related supervisory failures. FINRA imposed sanctions against the following firms: First Allied Securities, Inc. of San Diego, CA, was ordered to pay $689,647 in restitution and fined $325,000. Fifth Third Securities, Inc. of Cincinnati, OH, was ordered to pay $663,534 in restitution and fined $300,000. Securities America, Inc. of La Vista, NE, was ordered to pay $477,686 in restitution and fined $275,000. Cetera Advisors LLC of Denver, CO, was ordered to pay $452,622 in restitution and fined $250,000. Park Avenue Securities LLC of New York, NY, was ordered to pay $443,255 in restitution and fined $300,000. Commonwealth Financial Network of Waltham, MA, was ordered to pay $357,521 in restitution and fined $225,000. MetLife Securities, Inc. of New York, NY, was ordered to pay $349,748 in restitution and fined $300,000. Comerica Securities of Detroit, MI, was ordered to pay $197,757 in restitution and fined $150,000. Cetera Advisor Networks LLC of El Segundo, CA, was ordered to pay $151,108 in restitution and fined $150,000. Ameritas Investment Corp. of Lincoln, NE, was ordered to pay $128,544 in restitution and fined $150,000. Infinex Investments, Inc. of Meridian, CT, was ordered to pay $109,627 in restitution and fined $150,000. The Huntington Investment Company of Columbus, OH, was ordered to pay $60,973 in restitution and fined $75,000. A UIT is a type of investment company that offers redeemable units of a generally fixed portfolio of securities that terminate on a specific date. UIT sponsors generally offer sales charge discounts to investors, known as "breakpoint discounts" and "rollover and exchange discounts." A breakpoint discount is a reduced sales charge based on the dollar amount of the purchase—the higher the amount the greater the discount. Breakpoints generally function as a sliding reduction in the sales charge percentage available for purchases, usually beginning at $25,000 or $50,000 (or the corresponding number of units). A rollover or exchange discount is a reduced sales charge that is offered to investors who use the termination or redemption proceeds from one UIT to purchase another UIT. In March 2004, FINRA issued a Regulatory Notice to firms titled, Unit Investment Trust Sales, to remind broker-dealers that they should develop and implement procedures to ensure customers receive appropriate sales charge discounts for UITs. In concluding these settlements, the firms neither admitted nor denied the charges, but consented to the entry of FINRA’s findings.
