Regulation G – GAAP Reconciliation 
Appendix P-2 
Non GAAP Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Sales Percentage 
 
The Company reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, the Company's management believes 
that certain non-GAAP financial measures may provide users of this financial information additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in 
prior operating periods. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures can provide additional meaningful reflection of underlying trends of the 
business because they provide a comparison of historical information that excludes certain non-operational, non-recurring or intermittently recurring items that 
impact the overall comparability. See the table below for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to GAAP financial measures for quarterly 
adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company's reported 
results prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Regulation G – GAAP Reconciliation  
Appendix P-2 
Non GAAP Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Sales Percentage 
 
The Company reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, the Company's management believes 
that certain non-GAAP financial measures may provide users of this financial information additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in 
prior operating periods. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures can provide additional meaningful reflection of underlying trends of the 
business because they provide a comparison of historical information that excludes certain non-operational, non-recurring or intermittently recurring items that 
impact the overall comparability. See the table below for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to GAAP financial measures for quarterly 
adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company's reported 
results prepared in accordance with GAAP.

My fellow employees are the most supportive and friendly that I have ever known and the culture of teamwork is deeply ingrained within the organization.A large numbers of employees have stuck with Lawson for most of their careers because it’s such a great company and has lots of opportunities for upward mobility. They do a great job promoting from within the organization and I personally have earned two promotions in the past five years.Lawson offers many leadership and career development training programs to help employees develop their skillsets and grow within the organization. They also use Lean Six Sigma projects to encourage continuous improvement and it’s an exciting time to work at Lawson because we are growing rapidly. I would definitely recommend a pursuing a career at Lawson Products.ConsI don't really have any consShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Lawson Products Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Lawson Products 2017-07-14 11:31 PDT Jul 9, 2017 Helpful (1)"Fantastic company to work for.

You have a lot of freedom to make your own schedule and find your customers. The company offers a salary guarantee to new "field reps" but then it becomes commission only. Most managers don't believe in micro management and you have a great "family" culture. A lot of support from the product engineers and customer service!ConsThe Company still thinks that they are in the 80's and some reps still think that they are independent agents making it hard for the company to grow. There can be several reps in a single geographical area making it a challenge to get new business let alone to compete against other MRO suppliers. Closing down a distribution center, minimizing the product lines, and the corporate downsizing only says one thing "Business For Sale"...Losing strategic accounts hurts the reps abilities to land the "Large Accounts" and the competitive edge to the big guys. There is currently no "career ladder" unless you just want to be a sales rep and slowly grow your own business.Advice to ManagementYou should have never gotten rid of a great sales leader. He really motivated the sales teams! Rethink the growth process and put "true" sales leaders in charge of the sales teams and not an accountant. The current path looks like the end of the Dinosaurs...Couldn't adapt and became extinct!Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Lawson Products Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Lawson Products 2017-07-11 06:36 PDT Jun 14, 2017"Good Luck...."StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Sales RepresentativeCurrent Employee - Sales RepresentativeDoesn't RecommendNegative OutlookApproves of CEOI have been working at Lawson Products full-time (More than a year)Prosgreat work and life balanceConscompanies greedy and charges customer way, way, way to muchAdvice to ManagementHelp your salesmen to be better salesmen, and manage.

Just because someone has done the same job for 20 years does not make that job indispensable.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (1) Lawson Products Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Lawson Products 2017-05-19 09:43 PDT Apr 7, 2017"Warehouse worker"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Anonymous EmployeeCurrent Employee - Anonymous EmployeeDoesn't RecommendI have been working at Lawson Products full-time (More than a year)ProsDecent hourly rate for the jobConsWay to much work and not enough staff and equipment is awfulAdvice to ManagementUpgrade the equipmentShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Lawson Products Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Lawson Products 2017-04-07 14:43 PDT Feb 27, 2017 Helpful (2)"Do you research"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Sales RepresentativeCurrent Employee - Sales RepresentativeDoesn't RecommendNeutral OutlookApproves of CEOI have been working at Lawson Products full-time (More than 3 years)ProsYou make your own schedule which allows you a lot of freedom. There are uncapped commissions with unlimited earning potential.ConsCorporate offices can't seem to make their mind up about which direction they want to take the company in. They are constantly hiring new reps which only floods the territories, along with it seeming like there are thousand things about the company but you only know what your manager wants you to know. Company seems to want to be more price-competitive are the reps expense, i.e. less commissions. You use your own car, pay for your own gas, and they require you to carry boat loads of insurance on your own vehicle which costs you even more money.Advice to ManagementPick a direction and stick to it. Let all of your reps know the ins and outs of the company, it will only help then gain more business which will in turn help the company. It's one thing if you want to be more competitive and charge less for a product but the company should take a hit along with your reps... they're the ones that can't afford it.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (2) Lawson Products Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Lawson Products 2017-02-27 15:15 PST Feb 8, 2017 Helpful (2)"Pricing Analyst"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Pricing Analyst in Chicago, ILFormer Employee - Pricing Analyst in Chicago, ILDoesn't RecommendNeutral OutlookNo opinion of CEOI worked at Lawson Products full-time (More than 5 years)ProsGreat direct team, always worked well together and got along great.

	Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements













	Note 1 — Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies









	The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Lawson Products, Inc. (the “Company”) have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information, the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not contain all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles. Reference should be made to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended


	December 31, 2016


	. In the opinion of the Company, all normal recurring adjustments have been made that are necessary to present fairly the results of operations for the interim periods. Operating results for the three month period ended


	March 31, 2017


	 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending


	December 31, 2017


	.









	The Company operates in one reportable segment as a Maintenance, Repair and Operations ("MRO") distributor of products and services to the industrial, commercial, institutional, and governmental maintenance, repair and operations marketplace.









	For the three months ended


	March 31, 2017


	 and


	2016


	, stock options to purchase


	40,000


	 of the Company's common stock were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because they were anti-dilutive.









	Effective January 1, 2017, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2016-09, “Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718)” (“ASU 2016-09”). Prior to January 1, 2017, the Company recognized excess tax benefits or deficiencies of stock-based compensation expense, to the extent that there were sufficient recognized excess tax benefits previously recognized, as a component of additional paid-in capital. ASU 2016-09 requires the Company to account for excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur. The adoption was applied on a modified retrospective basis. All deferred tax assets related to stock-based compensation are fully reserved and, therefore, there is no net effect on the Company's balance sheet for the first quarter of 2017.









	As a result of including the income tax effects from excess tax benefits in income tax expense, the effects of the excess tax benefits are no longer included in the calculation of diluted shares outstanding, resulting in an increase in the number of diluted shares outstanding. The Company adopted this change in the method of calculating diluted shares outstanding on a prospective basis.









	ASU 2016-09 also permits entities to make an accounting policy election related to how forfeitures will impact the recognition of compensation cost for stock-based compensation to either estimate the total number of awards for which the requisite service period will not be rendered, as currently required, or to account for forfeitures as they occur. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-09, the Company elected to change its accounting policy to account for forfeitures as they occur. The change was applied on a modified retrospective basis with a cumulative effect adjustment to reduce retained earnings by


	$178,000


	, as of January 1, 2017.









	Additionally, ASU 2016-09 addressed the presentation of employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows. The Company is now required to present the cost of shares withheld from the employee to satisfy the employees’ income tax liability as a financing activity on the statement of cash flows rather than as an operating cash flow. The Company adopted this change retrospectively. There were no shares withheld from employees in the first quarter of 2017 or 2016.









	Except for the changes described above, there have been no other material changes in the Company's significant accounting policies during the three months ended


	March 31, 2017


	 as compared to the significant accounting policies described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended


	December 31, 2016


	.













	Note 2 — Restricted Cash









	The Company has agreed to maintain


	$0.8 million


	 in a money market account as collateral for an outside party that is providing certain commercial card processing services for the Company. The Company is restricted from withdrawing this balance without the prior consent of the outside party during the term of the agreement.

	Note 4 - Property Held For Sale









	During 2016, the Company announced plans to cease operations at the distribution center located in Fairfield, New Jersey. During the first quarter of 2017, the Company ceased operations at this location and classified the net book value of


	$0.7 million


	 as property held for sale. Depreciation of the property has been discontinued and the Company is under contract to sell the property for a gain in the second quarter of 2017.













	Note 5 — Acquisitions and Goodwill









	Primarily to expand its sales coverage and obtain experienced sales representatives, the Company completed three acquisitions in 2016. In March 2016, the Company acquired the assets of Perfect Products Company of Michigan ("Perfect Products"), an auto parts distributor for approximately


	$1.3 million


	 in cash and


	$30 thousand


	 in contingent consideration. In May 2016, the Company acquired the assets of F.B. Feeney Hardware ("F. B. Feeney") in Ontario, Canada, for approximately


	$1.3 million


	 in cash and


	$0.1 million


	 in contingent consideration. And, in November 2016, the Company acquired the assets of Mattic Industries Limited ("Mattic") an industrial parts distributor located in western Canada, for approximately


	$3.5 million


	 in cash and


	$0.3 million


	 in contingent consideration.









	The following table contains unaudited pro forma net sales and net income for Lawson Products assuming the Perfect Products, F.B Feeney and Mattic acquisitions closed on January 1, 2015.

This pro forma information utilizes certain estimates, is presented for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to be indicative of the actual results of operation. In addition, future results may vary significantly from the results reflected in the pro forma information. The unaudited pro forma financial information does not reflect the impact of future positive or negative events that may occur after the acquisition, such as anticipated cost savings from operating synergies.

	Note 6 — Loan Agreement









	In 2012, the Company entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (“Loan Agreement”). The Loan Agreement consists of a


	$40.0 million


	 revolving line of credit facility, which includes a


	$10.0 million


	 sub-facility for letters of credit. Certain terms of the original Loan Agreement have been revised by subsequent amendments. The Loan Agreement, as amended, expires in August 2020. Due to the lock box arrangement and a subjective acceleration clause contained in the Loan Agreement, any outstanding borrowings under the revolving line of credit are classified as a current liability.









	Currently, credit available under the Loan Agreement, as amended, is based upon:


















	a)






	85%


	 of the face amount of the Company’s eligible accounts receivable, generally less than


	60


	 days past due, and





















	b)






	the lesser of


	60%


	 of the lower of cost or market value of the Company’s eligible inventory, generally inventory expected to be sold within


	18 months


	, or


	$20.0 million


	.












	The applicable interest rates for borrowings are at the Prime rate or, if the Company elects, the LIBOR rate plus


	1.50%


	 to


	1.85%


	 based on the Company’s debt to EBITDA ratio. The Loan Agreement is secured by a first priority perfected security interest in substantially all existing assets of the Company. Dividends are restricted to amounts not to exceed


	$7.0 million


	 annually.









	At


	March 31, 2017


	, the Company had


	$1.8 million


	 of borrowings under its revolving line of credit facility and additional borrowing availability of


	$34.0 million


	. The Company paid interest of


	$0.1 million


	 and


	$0.2 million


	 for the three months ended


	March 31, 2017


	 and


	2016


	, respectively. The weighted average interest rate was


	3.81%


	 for the three months ended


	March 31, 2017


	.









	In addition to other customary representations, warranties and covenants, the Company is required to meet a minimum trailing twelve month EBITDA to fixed charges ratio, as defined in the amended Loan Agreement if the excess capacity is below


	$10.0 million


	. On


	March 31, 2017


	, the Company's borrowing capacity exceeded


	$10.0 million


	. Therefore, the Company was not subject to this financial covenant, however, for informational purposes the results of the financial covenant is provided below:

	 will substantially be paid by the end of 2017.

	Note 8 — Stock-Based Compensation









	The Company recorded a stock-based compensation benefit of


	$30 thousand


	 and


	$1.2 million


	 for the first three months of 2017 and 2016, respectively, as a portion of stock-based compensation is related to the change in the market value of the Company's common stock.









	A summary of stock-based awards issued during the


	three months ended March 31, 2017


	 follows:









	Stock Performance Rights ("SPRs")




	The Company issued


	35,351


	 SPRs to key employees with an exercise price of


	$22.75


	 per share that cliff vest on December 31, 2019 and have a termination date of December 31, 2024.









	Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs")




	The Company issued


	21,614


	 RSUs to key employees with a vesting date of December 31, 2019. Each RSU is exchangeable for one share of the Company's common stock at the end of the vesting period.









	Restricted Stock Awards ("RSAs")




	The Company issued


	3,000


	 RSAs to key employees with a vesting date of December 31, 2019. Each RSA is exchangeable for one share of the Company's common stock at the end of the vesting period.









	Market Stock Units ("MSUs")




	The Company issued


	39,238


	 MSUs to key employees that cliff vest on December 31, 2019. MSU's are exchangeable for the Company's common stock at the end of the vesting period. The number of shares of common stock that will be issued upon vesting, ranging from


	zero


	 to


	58,857


	, will be determined based upon the trailing sixty-day weighted average closing price of the Company's common stock on December 31, 2019.













	Note 9 — Income Taxes









	Although the Company has minimal cumulative income over the past three years, the Company has determined that there is insufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that it will be able to utilize its deferred tax assets to offset future taxable income. Therefore, substantially all deferred tax assets are currently subject to a tax valuation allowance. However, sufficient evidence may become available in future periods regarding the utilization of deferred tax assets that would lead to the reduction of all or a portion of the valuation allowance resulting in a decrease to income tax expense for the period in which the reduction is recorded. Although the Company is in this full tax valuation allowance position, a tax benefit of


	$14 thousand


	 and an expense of


	$0.1 million


	 was recorded for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, primarily due to reserves for uncertain tax positions and state taxes.









	The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. Federal income tax, as well as income tax of multiple state and foreign jurisdictions. As of


	March 31, 2017


	, the Company is subject to U.S. Federal income tax examinations for the years 2013 through 2015 and income tax examinations from various other jurisdictions for the years 2006 through 2015.









	Earnings from the Company’s foreign subsidiary are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. A distribution of these non-U.S. earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise would subject the Company to both U.S. Federal and state income taxes, as adjusted for foreign tax credits.

	Note 10 — Contingent Liabilities









	In 2012, the Company identified that a site it owns in Decatur, Alabama, contains hazardous substances in the soil and groundwater as a result of historical operations prior to the Company's ownership. The Company retained an environmental consulting firm to further investigate the contamination including the measurement and monitoring of the site. In August 2013, the site was enrolled in Alabama's voluntary cleanup program. On October 30, 2014, the Company received estimates from its environmental consulting firm for three potential remediation solutions. The estimates included a range of viable remedial approaches. The first solution included limited excavation and removal of the contaminated soil along with monitoring for a period up to


	10


	 years. The second solution included the first solution plus the installation of a groundwater extraction system. The third scenario included the first and second solutions plus treatment injections to reduce the degradation time. The estimated expenditures over a


	10


	-year period under the three scenarios ranged from


	$0.3 million


	 to


	$1.4 million


	, of which up to


	$0.3 million


	 may be capitalized. As the Company has determined that a loss was probable and no scenario was more likely than the other at that time, a liability in the amount of


	$0.3 million


	 was established in 2014.









	During 2015, after further evidence had been collected and analyzed, the Company concluded that it was probable that future remediation would be required, and accordingly accrued an additional


	$0.9 million


	 for the estimated costs. This estimate is based on the information developed to date and as the remediation efforts proceed, additional information may impact the final cost. As of


	March 31, 2017


	, agreement with Alabama’s voluntary cleanup program on viable treatment of the property has not yet been reached and the Company continues to evaluate potential remediation alternatives that could impact the ultimate cost of remediation. As of


	March 31, 2017


	, approximately


	$1.0 million


	 was accrued for remediation in other long-term liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

	ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS













	Overview









	The Maintenance, Repair and Operations ("MRO") distribution industry is highly fragmented. We compete for business with several national distributors as well as a large number of regional and local distributors. The MRO business is significantly impacted by the overall strength of the manufacturing sector of the U.S. economy. One measure used to evaluate the strength of the industrial products market is the PMI index published by the Institute for Supply Management, which is considered by many economists to be a reliable near-term economic barometer of the manufacturing sector. A measure above 50 generally indicates expansion of the manufacturing sector while a measure below 50 generally represents contraction. The average monthly PMI was


	57.0


	 in the


	first quarter of 2017


	 and


	49.8


	 in the


	first quarter of 2016


	, indicating an increase in the growth of the U.S. manufacturing economy.









	Our sales are also affected by the number of sales representatives and the amount of sales which each representative can generate, which we measure as average sales per day per sales representative. As of


	March 31, 2017


	, we had a sales force of


	979


	 sales representatives, a net increase of


	19


	 over the prior year quarter. We have moderated the rate of hiring incremental sales representatives in the first quarter, and we anticipate that the pace of rep growth growth will be slower in the near future as we concentrate our efforts on providing training and support for our expanded sales force to drive their productivity. The Company is under contract to complete the sale of the Fairfield distribution center in the second quarter of 2017 and to recognize a gain on the sale at that time.

	Net Sales









	Net sales were


	$74.6 million


	 for the


	first quarter of 2017


	, compared to


	$69.7 million


	 for the


	first quarter of 2016


	. Sales were positively impacted by the overall improvement in the MRO marketplace, an increase in the number of sales representatives, the integration of acquisitions completed in 2016 and increased sales representative productivity. The Company experienced growth in all major sectors including regional, large strategic, Kent Automotive and Governmental accounts. Excluding 2016 acquisitions, net sales grew 5.0%. Average daily sales improved to


	$1.166 million


	 in the


	first quarter of 2017


	 compared to


	$1.089 million


	 in the prior year quarter. The first quarter of both 2017 and 2016 had 64 selling days.









	Gross Profit









	Gross profit increased to


	$44.9 million


	 in the first quarter of 2017 compared to


	$42.5 million


	 in the first quarter of 2016 and decreased as a percent of sales to


	60.1%


	 from


	60.9%


	 a year ago. The decline in gross profit from a year ago was primarily driven by higher sales to larger strategic customers which typically have lower product margins, the impact of the 2016 acquisitions, and labor and freight costs associated with the closure of the Fairfield, New Jersey, distribution center.









	Selling Expenses









	Selling expenses consist of compensation paid to our sales representatives and related expenses to support our sales efforts. Selling expenses increased to


	$24.8 million


	 in the


	first quarter of 2017


	 from


	$22.8 million


	 in the prior year quarter and as a percent of sales, increased to


	33.2%


	 from


	32.6%


	 in the


	first quarter of 2016


	. The $2.0 million increase was primarily due to compensation costs on higher sales, costs associated with adding and training more sales representatives over the past year and higher health insurance expenses.









	General and Administrative Expenses









	General and administrative expenses consist of expenses to operate our distribution network and overhead expenses to manage the business. General and administrative expenses increased to


	$19.4 million


	 in the


	first quarter of 2017


	 from


	$18.5 million


	 in the prior year quarter due primarily to a lower benefit from stock-based compensation expense and increased severance expense, partially offset by lower depreciation expense and continued cost control efforts.









	Interest and Other Expenses (Income), Net









	Interest and other expenses (income), net improved by


	$0.2 million


	 over the prior year quarter, due primarily to interest on income tax and customs and duties obligations.









	Income Tax (Benefit) Expense









	Primarily due to minimal cumulative income over the past three years, all of our deferred tax assets are currently subject to a tax valuation allowance. Although we are in a full tax valuation allowance position, an income tax benefit of


	$14 thousand


	 and an expense of


	$0.1 million


	 was recorded in the first quarter of 2017 and 2016, respectively, due to state taxes and reserves for uncertain tax positions.

	Liquidity and Capital Resources









	Available cash and cash equivalents were


	$8.0 million


	 on


	March 31, 2017


	 compared to


	$10.4 million


	 on


	December 31, 2016


	. The net cash used in operations of


	$3.3 million


	 and


	$1.0 million


	 in the


	three months ended




	March 31, 2017


	 and 2016, respectively, were primarily used to fund increases in working capital due to higher sales compared to the previous quarter and payments related to performance compensation.









	 Capital expenditures, primarily for improvements to our distribution centers and information technology, were


	$0.2 million


	 in the


	three months ended




	March 31, 2017


	 compared to


	$0.5 million


	 in the prior year period.









	On


	March 31, 2017


	, we had


	$1.8 million


	 of borrowings on our revolving line of credit and no dividends were paid to shareholders in the


	three months ended




	March 31, 2017


	 and 2016. Dividends are currently restricted under the Loan Agreement to amounts not to exceed $7.0 million annually.









	Loan Agreement









	At


	March 31, 2017


	, we had additional borrowing availability of


	$34.0 million


	. We believe cash provided by operations and funds available under our Loan Agreement are sufficient to fund our operating requirements, strategic initiatives and capital improvements throughout the remainder of


	2017


	.









	In addition to other customary representations, warranties and covenants, we are required to meet a minimum trailing twelve month EBITDA to fixed charges ratio, as defined in the amended Loan Agreement, if the excess capacity is below


	$10.0 million


	. On


	March 31, 2017


	, our borrowing capacity exceeded


	$10.0 million


	, therefore, we were not subject to this financial covenant, however, for informational purposes we have provided the results of the financial covenant below:

























	Quarterly Financial Covenants






	 






	Requirement






	 






	Actual








	EBITDA to fixed charges ratio






	 






	1.10 : 1.00






	 






	2.01 : 1.00














	While we were in compliance with the financial covenant for the quarter ended


	March 31, 2017


	, failure to meet this covenant requirement in future quarters could lead to higher financing costs, increased restrictions, or reduce or eliminate our ability to borrow funds and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

	ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK









	There have been no material changes in market risk at


	March 31, 2017


	 from that reported in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended


	December 31, 2016


	.
















	ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES









	Under the supervision and with the participation of our senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), as of the end of the period covered by this report (the “Evaluation Date”). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded as of the Evaluation Date that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective such that (i) the information relating to Lawson, including our consolidated subsidiaries, required to be disclosed in our SEC reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.









	There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended


	March 31, 2017


	 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
