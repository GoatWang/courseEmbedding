Corporate history[edit]
The predecessor companies of S&P Global have history dating to 1888, when James H. McGraw purchased the American Journal of Railway Appliances. He continued to add further publications, eventually establishing The McGraw Publishing Company in 1899. John A. Hill had also produced several technical and trade publications and in 1902 formed his own business, The Hill Publishing Company. In 1909 both men, having known each other's interests, agreed upon an alliance and combined the book departments of their publishing companies into The McGraw-Hill Book Company. John Hill served as President, with James McGraw as Vice-President. In 1917, the remaining parts of each business were merged into The McGraw-Hill Publishing Company[4] In 1986, McGraw-Hill bought out competitor The Economy Company, then the United States' largest publisher of educational material.

See also: Category:McGraw-Hill books

McGraw-Hill maintained a general publishing division for some years, whose best known book was the (unpublished) Autobiography of Howard Hughes, a fake biography of Howard Hughes by Clifford Irving, which caused a scandal at the time.
The McGraw-Hill Building[edit]




1221 Avenue of the Americas, former McGraw-Hill headquarters


Main article: 1221 Avenue of the Americas
The company was based at 1221 Avenue of the Americas, otherwise known as the McGraw-Hill Building, until July 2015.[1]
The building in New York City has received prominent attention. In April 2008, surveillance camera footage was released of Nicholas White, a production manager for BusinessWeek (then published by McGraw-Hill) who was trapped in the building's elevator for 41 hours in October 1999.[31]
Connection to the family of George W. Bush[edit]
The McGraws and the George W. Bush family have close ties dating back several generations. Harold McGraw Jr. (deceased) was a member of the national grant advisory and founding board of the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy.[32]
McGraw-Hill Federal Credit Union[edit]
Established in 1935, the McGraw-Hill Federal Credit Union originally served employees of the McGraw-Hill companies in New York City only.[33] The credit union moved from its location inside the McGraw-Hill building to East Windsor, New Jersey, in 2005. Its accounts are insured by the National Credit Union Administration. It provides savings, checking accounts, CDs, money-market accounts, IRAs, credit cards, auto loans, and home mortgages.
Awards[edit]
In 1999, the National Building Museum presented the McGraw-Hill Companies with its annual Honor Award for the corporation's contributions to the built environment.[34]

Corporate history[edit]
The predecessor companies of S&P Global have history dating to 1888, when James H. McGraw purchased the American Journal of Railway Appliances. He continued to add further publications, eventually establishing The McGraw Publishing Company in 1899. John A. Hill had also produced several technical and trade publications and in 1902 formed his own business, The Hill Publishing Company. In 1909 both men, having known each other's interests, agreed upon an alliance and combined the book departments of their publishing companies into The McGraw-Hill Book Company. John Hill served as President, with James McGraw as Vice-President. In 1917, the remaining parts of each business were merged into The McGraw-Hill Publishing Company[4] In 1986, McGraw-Hill bought out competitor The Economy Company, then the United States' largest publisher of educational material. The buyout made McGraw-Hill the largest educational publisher in the United States.[5]

See also: Category:McGraw-Hill books

McGraw-Hill maintained a general publishing division for some years, whose best known book was the (unpublished) Autobiography of Howard Hughes, a fake biography of Howard Hughes by Clifford Irving, which caused a scandal at the time.
The McGraw-Hill Building[edit]




1221 Avenue of the Americas, former McGraw-Hill headquarters


Main article: 1221 Avenue of the Americas
The company was based at 1221 Avenue of the Americas, otherwise known as the McGraw-Hill Building, until July 2015.[1]
The building in New York City has received prominent attention. In April 2008, surveillance camera footage was released of Nicholas White, a production manager for BusinessWeek (then published by McGraw-Hill) who was trapped in the building's elevator for 41 hours in October 1999.[31]
Connection to the family of George W. Bush[edit]
The McGraws and the George W. Bush family have close ties dating back several generations. Harold McGraw Jr. (deceased) was a member of the national grant advisory and founding board of the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy.[32]
McGraw-Hill Federal Credit Union[edit]
Established in 1935, the McGraw-Hill Federal Credit Union originally served employees of the McGraw-Hill companies in New York City only.[33] The credit union moved from its location inside the McGraw-Hill building to East Windsor, New Jersey, in 2005. Its accounts are insured by the National Credit Union Administration. It provides savings, checking accounts, CDs, money-market accounts, IRAs, credit cards, auto loans, and home mortgages.
Awards[edit]
In 1999, the National Building Museum presented the McGraw-Hill Companies with its annual Honor Award for the corporation's contributions to the built environment.[34]
