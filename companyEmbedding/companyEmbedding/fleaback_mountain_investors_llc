PetLock® Launches New Line of Flea and Tick Treatment and  Prevention Products
March 17, 2016

PetLock® Rolls Out NEW Affordable Flea & Tick Products for Dogs and Cats
EAGLE, Idaho (March 17, 2016)— PetLock® today announced the launch of its full line of quality and affordable products for the treatment and prevention of fleas, ticks, and other pests on dogs and cats, inside the home, and other outdoor areas. PetLock products are exclusively sold at Petco and other pet specialty stores.
“When it comes to flea and tick products, each dog and cat has unique needs,” said Glen Moore, Vice President of Marketing at PetIQ™, maker of PetLock®. “The mission of PetLock® is to provide a variety of quality products to meet those needs at affordable prices. In many cases, our PetLock® products have the same active ingredients as the leading brands, but sell for a fraction of the cost.”
Prevention Products

PetLock Plus (For Dogs and Cats) – Same active ingredients as the leading brand
NEW PetLock II (For Dogs and Cats) – Same active ingredients used in Advantage® II**
NEW PetLock Six Month Collar for Large Dogs – Same active ingredient as Scalibor® Protector Band for Dogs***
NEW PetLock Six Month Collar for Small Dogs – Same active ingredient as Scalibor® Protector Band for Dogs***

Treatment Products 

NEW PetLock Flea & Tick Dog Shampoo
NEW PetLock Flea & Tick Spray for Dogs
NEW PetLock Indoors for Fleas, Ticks and Spiders Ready-To-Use Spray
NEW PetLock Yard for Fleas, Ticks and Mosquitoes – Yard Spray Concentrate

If not treated right away, fleas and ticks can become a serious concern for a dog or cat. Fleas can cause flea allergy dermatitis, anemia, tapeworms, and hair loss. While many ticks transmit serious diseases such as Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. If pet parents focus more on prevention and treatment options, they can better avoid the headache of a full infestation.
“When it comes to preventative healthcare for pets, it’s important to us to offer a range of great product options,” said Glen Moore. “PetLock offers a quality solution for pet parents on a budget.”

FLEAS AND TICKS: HIDING, LURKING AND READY TO ATTACK

 

Where do fleas and ticks live? ​ You may not see them, but they're there.
Fleas and ticks can be nestled in hiding places inside and out without you ever knowing it.
See below for some of their more common hideouts:

On other pets and animals
Around shrubbery and bushes in your backyard where other infested animals such as possums and feral cats frequent

In addition, developing stages of fleas may be lurking out of sight:

In carpets, floors and sofas of your home

That's why you need flea & tick protection like FRONTLINE brand products. Anything less just won't do.





  


The flea life cycle—break it, or else.
Flea infestations start with just 2 fleas laying hundreds of flea eggs within a matter of days.1 FRONTLINE brand products prevent infestations by not only killing adult fleas—which comprise only
                5% of the total flea population—but also by killing flea eggs and larvae too.
Flea infestations start with just 2 fleas laying hundreds of flea eggs within a matter of days.1 FRONTLINE brand products prevent infestations by not only killing adult fleas—which comprise only 5% of the total flea population—but
                also by killing flea eggs and larvae too.
This diagram demonstrates the 4 main stages of the common flea life cycle including flea eggs, larvae, pupae and adult fleas.1

Protect your pet and your home.

                    Regular use of FRONTLINE Gold for Dogs on your dog may reduce flea infestations in the home. For best results, use FRONTLINE Gold for Dogs as part of a comprehensive flea treatment plan, which includes coordinated treatment of the home, yard and pet.
                



Flea bites can lead to diseases.
These nibbles start out as a simple itch but can lead to a wide range of diseases or other parasites, including:

Flea Allergy Dermatitis (FAD)3
Anemia4
Tapeworm5
Rickettsiosis6

These conditions can deprive your pet of energy, cause skin problems or adversely affect your pet’s health in a number of ways.





  


Identify some of the common US ticks.7

Ticks are disgusting and can be dangerous. Don't let their tiny size fool you—ticks are menacing creatures. Once they burrow into your pet's skin, they may transmit life-threatening diseases.
See below for some of the most common tick-borne diseases8:

Lyme disease
Babesiosis
Rocky Mountain spotted fever
Ehrlichiosis










  

                     

Lone Star Tick
American Dog Tick
Deer Tick
Brown Dog Tick



Primarily found in the Southeastern, Eastern US.


Found east of the Rocky Mountains and in limited areas on the Pacific Coast.


Commonly found in the Northeastern and upper Midwestern states.


Found throughout the United States.






  



  


Other Flea and Tick Protection Tips
For protection that goes beyond keeping your pets safe, take aim at fleas and ticks in and around your home. Here are a few tips:

Periodically, wash your pet’s bed cover in hot water and dry it on a high heat setting to kill any flea eggs and larvae
Make your yard less appealing to ticks by cutting grass short and eliminating brush piles
Vacuum frequently in your home, especially carpets where your pet tends to lounge
Cover up all outside crawl spaces and garbage cans to deter wildlife that may carry fleas and ticks
