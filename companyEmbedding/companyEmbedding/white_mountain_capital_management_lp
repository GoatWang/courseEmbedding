* This undertaking does not affect any limits Section 102(a) of the National Securities Markets
Improvement Act of 1996 ("NSMIA") [Pub. L. No. 104-290, 110 Stat. 3416 (Oct. 11, 1996)] imposes on the ability of States to
require information. As a result, if the securities that are the subject of this Form D are "covered securities" for purposes
of NSMIA, whether in all instances or due to the nature of the offering that is the subject of this Form D, States cannot
routinely require offering materials under this undertaking or otherwise and can require offering materials only to the
extent NSMIA permits them to do so under NSMIA's preservation of their anti-fraud authority.

Other important information




As an introducing broker, White Mountain Capital will share your personal information with our clearing firm, Hilltop Securities Inc (SWST). SWST handles transaction processing, clearing and custody and provides statements and confirmations.  





ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING PROGRAM
Under the USA PATRIOT Act and other regulations, White Mountain Capital must establish a compliance program, which includes policies and procedures to detect and report suspicious transactions to the government, as well as ensure compliance with the laws. White Mountain Capital must also implement specialized employee training programs, designate an anti-money laundering compliance officer and conduct independent testing of the effectiveness of the program. White Mountain Capital has appointed an anti-money laundering officer to direct the program. All of our employees are trained in anti-money laundering practices and procedures and the details of the firm's policies.

The regulations have also imposed new requirements on client information and verification of that information. White Mountain Capital is required to verify the identity of the clients with whom they do business, determine the source of funds in a client's account and obtain the information about a client's financial status. As part of our compliance with these new regulations and in support of the fight against money laundering around the world, we may ask clients for additional information and documentation about certain accounts and transactions. This information may be used to verify client identity.

If you have any questions regarding our anti-money laundering program, please contact your Account Executive. 



BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLAN
White Mountain Capital has developed a Business Continuity Plan to provide procedures for response and recovery in the event of a significant business disruption. The purpose of the plan is to identify responsible personnel in the event of a local or regional disaster, natural or otherwise; safeguard employee lives and firm property; evaluate the situation and initiate appropriate action; recover and resume operations to allow continuation of business; provide customers with access to their funds and securities; and protect books and records. The Plan was developed considering the types of business conducted, systems critical to support business, and geographic dispersion of offices and personnel.

The Plan is designed for implementation to continue conducting business in the event of a disaster that results in a significant business disruption. Whether all or only parts of the Plan are implemented depends on the nature of the disruption. Generally, a significant business disruption would include:

	
Destruction of one of White Mountain Capital's offices or facilities, whether by natural causes or other means
Loss of life or major injuries to personnel in an office location that disables that office's ability to conduct business
Disruption of service from a critical service provider
Disruption of service due to wide-ranging regional outages such as a power outage

A localized disruption in White Mountain Capital’s office or city would result in a shorter outage than a major regional or national event (e.g., hurricane, widespread power outage or terrorism).  In all cases, resumption of business is anticipated within the same business day.  White Mountain Capital has made arrangements to safeguard its books and records in the event of a disaster.  Should we need to move our operations to an alternate location, we will notify you through our website (www.whitemountaincapital.com) and/or outgoing message on 212-509-0313, our firm’s phone number, how to contact us.  If the significant business disruption is so severe that it prevents us from remaining in business, we will assure our customers’ prompt access to their funds and securities.

White Mountain Capital’s clearing agent maintains customer confirmations and statements under the terms of the clearing agreement. Hilltop Securities Inc (SWST) has developed a disaster and recovery plan to recover and retrieve its records lost in a disaster, including backing up its important records in a geographically separate area.

White Mountain Capital has received assurance from its clearing agent (SWST) that SWST’s business continuity plan is consistent with self-regulatory organization rule requirements and provides adequate protection of customer funds and securities held on behalf of White Mountain Capital’s customers. White Mountain Capital’s senior management will review the clearing firm plan or a summary of its plan at least annually or whenever its plan is changed.

ORDER ROUTING AND EXECUTION DISCLOSURE
The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted two rules to enhance the visibility of execution quality of the U.S. securities markets for public investors.

SEC Rule 605 (Formerly SEC Rule 11Ac1-5) - Disclosure of Order Execution Information
Rule 11 Ac1-5 requires that White Mountain Capital, LLC publicly disclose, on a monthly basis, basic standardized information concerning its handling and execution of orders.

Introducing Broker Agreement
White Mountain Capital maintains an introducing clearing agreement with Hilltop Securities Inc (SWST). 

White Mountain Capital, LLC does not receive compensation for directing order flow.

SEC Rule 606 (Formerly SEC Rule 11Ac1-6) Disclosure of Order Routing Information

In addition, White Mountain Capital is required to disclose to its customers, upon request, the markets to which their individual orders were routed.
