    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

                            ABB Board proposes Peter Voser as its new Chairman
                        


Hubertus von Grünberg (72) and Michael Treschow (71) decide not to stand for re-election to the Board of Directors at the next Annual General Meeting in April 2015
All other current members of the Board to stand for re-election
Zurich, Switzerland, Dec. 18, 2014 – ABB Chairman Hubertus von Grünberg and Michael Treschow have decided not to stand for re-election to the Board of Directors at the next Annual General Meeting (AGM). The Board of Directors of ABB unanimously nominated Peter Voser to succeed Hubertus von Grünberg as Chairman. David Constable will stand for election at the AGM, as previously announced, and all other members of the Board will stand for re-election. Shareholders will vote on the proposed changes on April 30, 2015.

“I am delighted that Peter Voser has accepted to stand for election as Chairman of ABB”, Hubertus von Grünberg said. “Peter Voser brings intimate knowledge of ABB and its key markets as well as an excellent track record as a leader in large, global organizations”.

Shareholders elect Board members for a one-year term and will vote on the nominations at the AGM on April 30, 2015. The Board intends to elect Jacob Wallenberg as Vice-Chairman of the Board after the AGM. 

Von Grünberg has been Chairman of the ABB Board since May 2007. During his tenure ABB’s revenues have risen from about $23 billion in 2006 to $42 billion in 2013, whilst net income has doubled. Under his leadership ABB also achieved an unprecedented global balance in its business across Europe, the Americas, Asia/Middle East and Africa. In his time as Chairman, ABB launched many breakthrough innovations including a breaker for high-voltage direct current (HVDC), the revolutionary human-machine collaborative robot YuMi, and Emax2, the world’s first low-voltage circuit breaker that also functions as an energy manager.

Michael Treschow, Chairman of the Governance and Nomination Committee, joined the ABB Board in 2003 and has contributed strongly to the company’s return to profitable growth with his wealth of industrial leadership experience in key markets of ABB.  

In addition to Hubertus von Grünberg, the current members of the ABB Board are Roger Agnelli, Matti Alahuhta, Louis R. Hughes, Michel de Rosen, Michael Treschow, Jacob Wallenberg and Ying Yeh.

“I am honored to be nominated as Chairman of the Board and look forward to working with ABB’s CEO Ulrich Spiesshofer, his executive team and the Board of Directors to drive accelerated sustainable value creation through the implementation of the recently announced Next Level strategy,” said Peter Voser.

Peter Voser, a Swiss citizen, was CEO of Royal Dutch Shell, one of the world’s largest companies, from 2009 to the end of 2013. Prior to this he served as Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of Royal Dutch Shell. Between 1982 and 2002 Voser worked for Shell and served in a number of finance and business roles in Switzerland, the UK, Argentina and Chile. 

Between 2002 and October 2004, Peter Voser was CFO of ABB Ltd. and a key leader behind the successful turnaround and repositioning of the company for long-term profitable growth. Voser also brings a wealth of experience as a Board member of publicly listed companies such as Roche, UBS (until 2010) and Aegon (until 2006). 

ABB (www.abb.com) is a leader in power and automation technologies that enable utility and industry customers to improve their performance and lower their environmental impact. The ABB Group of companies operates in more than 100 countries and employs about 145,000 people.

The Business Council

                  The Business Council is a voluntary association of business leaders whose members meet several times a year for the free exchange of ideas both among themselves and with thought leaders from many sectors.

In its most fundamental form, the Council seeks to foster understanding through discussion.  It promotes learning, best practice sharing and networking by its members with a view to making a contribution to our society, the global economy and to business generally.

Since its founding more than 75 years ago, The Business Council membership has consisted of a group of current or former chief executive officers from a broad range of companies.  All major industries are represented among the members of The Business Council.

Because schedule demands on senior business executives are extensive, the Council provides an especially valuable opportunity to discuss major subjects in a broader ranging forum than is normally available in the course of business activities.

As part of its process, the Council invites leaders in government, politics, academia, science, medicine, technology and other sectors to address the Council and to participate in its discussions.  Council members hope that these discussions result in better understanding by their invited guests as well as by the members themselves.

Today, the Council meets three times a year in a collegial atmosphere to share and explore ideas.As a gathering of peers from many fields, the Council is entirely an educational and deliberative forum.  It never takes positions as an organization and does not advocate any policy or course of action.

Individual members sometimes do present their own views in public discussions.  But they do so as individuals, rather than as representatives of the Council.

European Round Table of Industrialists

                  ERT today brings together up to 50 chief executives and chairmen of major multinational companies of European parentage, covering a wide range of industrial sectors. Individuals join at the personal invitation of existing Members, which confers on ERT membership a personal rather than corporate character.

ERT Members meet twice a year, in person, at Plenary Sessions. At these Plenary Sessions, Members determine ERT’s work programme, set priorities and establish specialised Working Groups to work on them. Decisions are taken by consensus.

The ERT Chairman, two vice-Chairmen, the former ERT Chairman and five other elected Members form the Steering Committee. The Steering Committee reviews ERT activities and makes recommendations to the Plenary Sessions.

Each ERT Member nominates an Associate to act as a main point of liaison at working level and to help implement the decisions taken by Members.

Much of the work is done by the Working Groups established by the Plenary Sessions. They are chaired by ERT Members and comprise Members, Associates and experts from the companies behind ERT Members. The Working Groups present proposals to the Plenary and take a leading role in the drafting of official ERT messages and positions.

The Secretary General is in charge of a small Executive based in Brussels, which coordinates projects, acts as a contact point, provides administrative support and publishes the ERT reports.

Peter G. Peterson Institute for International Economics

                    The Peterson Institute for International Economics is a private, nonprofit, nonpartisan research institution devoted to the study of international economic policy. Since 1981 the Institute has provided timely and objective analysis of, and concrete solutions to, a wide range of international economic problems. It is one of the very few think tanks that are widely regarded as "nonpartisan" by the press and "neutral" by the US Congress. Its research staff has been cited by the quality media more than that of any other such institution. It was voted "best think tank in the world" in 2008 by the first global survey of over 5,000 such institutions and again in 2011 by the British magazine Prospect, whose selections are called "the Oscars of the think tank world" by the BBC.

The Institute, attempts to anticipate emerging issues and to be ready with practical ideas, presented in user-friendly formats, to inform and shape public debate. Its audience includes government officials and legislators, business and labor leaders, management and staff at international organizations, university-based scholars and their students, other research institutions and nongovernmental organizations, the media, and the public at large. It addresses these groups globally from its base in Washington, DC.

The Institute’s staff of about 50 includes 20 senior researchers, all distinguished for their combination of research productivity and policy experience. The Institute’s agenda emphasizes global macroeconomic policy, international finance and exchange rates, trade and investment, energy and the environment, and area studies of key economic regions. Institute staff and research cover all key regions—especially Asia, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East, as well as the United States itself and with special reference to China, India, Korea, and Russia.

Current priority is attached to the global financial and economic crisis and especially its European component; debt and recovery; the growing role of China in the world economy; the economic dimensions of the Arab Spring; globalization and its political controversies; global imbalances and exchange rates; national and international financial regulations; export competitiveness; reform of the international economic and financial architecture; sovereign wealth funds; and trade negotiations at the multilateral, regional, and bilateral levels.

Institute studies have helped provide the intellectual foundation for many of the major international policy initiatives of the past three decades: reforms of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), including those initiated by the G-20 in 2009–10; adoption of international banking standards and broader financial regulatory reforms; the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum and Trans-Pacific Partnership; the restoration and then extension of trade promotion authority in the United States; the development of the World Trade Organization; the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and other US free trade agreements (including with Korea notably); initiation and implementation of the Strategic and Economic Dialogue between the United States and China; a series of United States–Japan negotiations; reform of sanctions policy; liberalization of US export controls and export credits, and specific trade issues such as permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) for China in 2000 and Russia in 2012, import protection for steel, and Buy American legislation in 2009.

Other influential analyses have addressed economic reform in Europe, Japan, the former communist countries, and Latin America (including what became known as the Washington Consensus), the social impact of globalization and policy responses to it, outsourcing, corruption, foreign direct investment both into and out of the United States, global warming and international environmental policy, measures of currency manipulation and of equilibrium exchange rates, and the sources and growth of services trade.

The Business Council

                    The Business Council is a voluntary association of business leaders whose members meet several times a year for the free exchange of ideas both among themselves and with thought leaders from many sectors.

In its most fundamental form, the Council seeks to foster understanding through discussion.  It promotes learning, best practice sharing and networking by its members with a view to making a contribution to our society, the global economy and to business generally.

Since its founding more than 75 years ago, The Business Council membership has consisted of a group of current or former chief executive officers from a broad range of companies.  All major industries are represented among the members of The Business Council.

Because schedule demands on senior business executives are extensive, the Council provides an especially valuable opportunity to discuss major subjects in a broader ranging forum than is normally available in the course of business activities.

As part of its process, the Council invites leaders in government, politics, academia, science, medicine, technology and other sectors to address the Council and to participate in its discussions.  Council members hope that these discussions result in better understanding by their invited guests as well as by the members themselves.

Today, the Council meets three times a year in a collegial atmosphere to share and explore ideas.As a gathering of peers from many fields, the Council is entirely an educational and deliberative forum.  It never takes positions as an organization and does not advocate any policy or course of action.

Individual members sometimes do present their own views in public discussions.  But they do so as individuals, rather than as representatives of the Council.

2012 Bilderberg Meeting

                  The 60th Bilderberg Meeting will be held in Chantilly, Virginia, USA from 31 May - 3 June 2012. The Conference will deal mainly with political, economic and societal issues like Transatlantic Relations, Evolution of the Political Landscape in Europe and the US, Austerity and Growth in Developed Economies, Cyber Security, Energy Challenges, the Future of Democracy, Russia, China and the Middle East.
Approximately 145 participants will attend of whom about two-thirds come from Europe and the balance from North America and other countries. About one-third is from government and politics, and two-thirds are from finance, industry, labor, education, and communications. The meeting is private in order to encourage frank and open discussion.

Bilderberg takes its name from the hotel in Holland, where the first meeting took place in May 1954. That pioneering meeting grew out of the concern expressed by leading citizens on both sides of the Atlantic that Western Europe and North America were not working together as closely as they should on common problems of critical importance. It was felt that regular, off-the-record discussions would help create a better understanding of the complex forces and major trends affecting Western nations in the difficult post-war period.
The Cold War has now ended. But in practically all respects there are more, not fewer, common problems - from trade to jobs, from monetary policy to investment, from ecological challenges to the task of promoting international security. It is hard to think of any major issue in either Europe or North America whose unilateral solution would not have repercussions for the other.
Thus the concept of  a European-American forum has not been overtaken by time. The dialogue between these two regions  is still - even increasingly - critical.

What is unique about Bilderberg as a forum is the broad cross-section of leading citizens that are assembled for nearly three days of informal and off-the-record discussion about topics of current concern especially in the fields of foreign affairs and the international economy; the strong feeling among participants that in view of the differing attitudes and experiences of the Western nations, there remains a clear need to further develop an understanding in which these concerns can be accommodated; the privacy of the meetings, which has no purpose other than to allow  participants to speak their minds openly and freely.
In short, Bilderberg is a small, flexible, informal and off-the-record international forum in which different viewpoints can be expressed and mutual understanding enhanced.

Bilderberg's only activity is its annual Conference. At the meetings, no resolutions are proposed, no votes taken, and no policy statements issued. Since 1954, fifty-nine conferences have been held. The names of the participants are made available to the press.  Participants are chosen for their experience, their knowledge, and their standing; all participants attend Bilderberg in a private and not an official capacity.

2011 World Economic Forum Annual Meeting

                  The first Annual Meeting of the second decade of the 21st century opened amid an atmosphere of microoptimism combined with macropessimism. The impact of Davos for 2011 is to begin the year with active optimism, introducing new thinking, new connections, new ideas and networks to build on the micro-opportunities to contribute to the Forum’s mission to improve the state of the world.
