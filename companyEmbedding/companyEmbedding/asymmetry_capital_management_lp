ABOUT US
​





Asymmetry Capital Management, L.P. is a San Francisco-based alternative asset management firm founded in 2012 by Scott Kay, a 20-year veteran of healthcare investing. We utilize a data-driven primary research process to identify and invest in out-of-consensus healthcare companies that we believe have both asymmetric return profiles and near-term valuation catalysts. Our differentiated investment process and focus on fundamental shorts seek to produce a return stream for investors that is both unique and repeatable over the long term. Asymmetry seeks to deliver high risk-adjusted returns, low correlations to both broad market and healthcare indices and lower volatility.



















A LETTER FROM OUR FOUNDER
​






When I decided to launch Asymmetry, it was the culmination of a dream that brought me full circle to a family history of entrepreneurship and healthcare. My grandfather owned pharmacies in Brooklyn, NY and my parents were entrepreneurs. My grandfather wasn’t alive to see me accept my first job at Pfizer, a pharmaceutical company, but he would have been proud to know I had continued in the sector to which he dedicated his life. Having grown up watching my father and grandfather invest in the stock market, I developed a passion for investing alongside theirs, this ultimately led me to Wall Street as a healthcare analyst. I was fortunate to be able to integrate the two interests that have been a driving force in my life: healthcare and investing.
 
I have always been competitive and drawn to complex problem solving. Healthcare investing allows me to exercise both of these traits. I wake up every day thankful I am able to do what I love on behalf of our investors, partners and the team we have assembled at Asymmetry.
 
Healthcare is unique among the sectors compromising the global economy. What other sector offers the opportunity to advance peoples well-being and happiness, fulfills a basic human need, comprises so many diverse sub-sectors and encompasses so much complexity? Many of the businesses we invest in save lives and make products that enhance day-to-day living. Businesses that do not fulfill their promises to patients, customers and shareholders are firms we bet against.
 
The success of Asymmetry rests on our ability to deliver, for our partners and investors, attractive investment returns over the long-term while effectively managing risk. Investment success is not easily measured month-to-month or even year-to-year as we operate in a dynamic and volatile industry. Recognizing that different views on valuation inevitability become reconciled over a longer horizon, and that in the short-term market pricing is often inefficient, led me to develop Asymmetry’s founding investment principals and philosophy:
 

A structured, rigorous, and iterative process provides both a strong foundation upon which to build and a guiding light from which to navigate forward.

 

Company fundamentals must, over time, drive asset valuations.

 

Portfolio diversification can both enhance returns and mitigate risk.

 

Portfolio liquidity offers both a margin of safety if an exit strategy is necessary, as well as the opportunity to capitalize on positive fundamental developments.

 

Just like a successful athlete, investing success is about doing the work. There are no short cuts. It is a constant process and it can be grueling. But, I have found few other things as satisfying as identifying an idea, validating it through one’s own efforts and then being objectively rewarded when others recognize the value of what you uncovered.

 
We have built an institutional asset management business that reflects the entrepreneurship, pride of ownership and high standard we hold as the sacred responsibility entrusted to us by our partners and investors. The concept of fiduciary responsibility is one we have always taken seriously and is an overarching principal in how we manage our business and investments. This is what guides us as a steward of our clients’ capital. Thank you for your continued partnership and trust.
 
Respectfully,

ASYMMETRY® | Managed Accounts










































































 






 
As your investment manager, we help you get what you want. 
ASYMMETRY® Global Tactical is an unconstrained, flexible, adaptable, go-anywhere global tactical strategy without the limitations of a fixed benchmark.  Shell Capital pursues absolute returns applying active risk management and unconstrained tactical trading decisions across a broad universe of global currency, bonds, stocks, and commodities.
Contact Us










Why ASYMMETRY®
ASYMMETRY® is designed to meet investor objectives for total return within a specific risk tolerance. Prospect theory finds that investors objectives are asymmetric: we are more disappointed by losses than we are pleased with gains. Loss aversion suggests that investors are more likely to have stronger reactions in the case of large losses. 
We believe world markets require active risk management to avoid large losses and directional trend systems to position capital in profitable price trends and avoid losing trends. Seeking absolute returns, ASYMMETRY® takes asset management to the next level by actively managing risk and dynamically adapting to evolving markets.
ASYMMETRY® Global Tactical has one of the strongest and longest track records applying active risk management and directional trend systems to global markets via exchange traded securities (ETFs, etc)




Why a Separately Managed Account?
A separately managed account is titled in the investors own name offering:

Transparency: You can see the activity
Liquidity: Daily liquidity of securities
Control: You own the securities
Tax Management: Loss Harvesting

Why Now?
We believe the positive global equity market trends are aged and even bonds will become risky as interest rates eventually rise. We believe global markets require active risk management and tactical shifts to avoid downside loss and profit from directional trends. For more information, contact us.

ASYMMETRY® Managed Accounts are managed by Shell Capital Management, LLC. ASYMMETRY® is a risk-managed, unconstrained, flexible, adaptable, go-anywhere style applied to a wide universe of markets without limitations of a fixed benchmark. ASYMMETRY® pursues absolute returns applying active risk management and directional trend systems to a global universe of exchange traded securities.
Investment results are probabilistic, not a sure thing. There is no guarantee that any investment strategy will be successful. Investing involves risk including the potential loss of principal a client must be willing to bear. No investment strategy can guarantee a profit or assure against loss. Risk should be managed, directed, and controlled, but such tactics are not guaranteed. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

ASYMMETRY® | Global Tactical – ASYMMETRY® | Managed Accounts











































































 






We believe world markets require active risk management to avoid large losses and directional trend systems to position capital in profitable price trends. ASYMMETRY® Global Tactical objective is a positive asymmetric return proﬁle that ﬁts within investor’s tolerance for risk and desired return over both bull and bear markets. An asymmetric return proﬁle is a total return that exceeds its downside risk.
Shell Capital Management, LLC has one of the longest and strongest actual track records pursuing absolute returns through active risk management and tactical investment decisions across a global universe of multi-asset exchange traded securities (ETFs, etc).
Contact us for more information. 














ASYMMETRY® Global Tactical is an unconstrained, flexible, adaptable, go-anywhere global tactical strategy without the limitations of a fixed benchmark. Rather than track a benchmark, our objective is to compound capital as much as possible within our risk tolerance. Even though we don’t intend to track an index, we can compare the performance to the alternatives to understand its risk and return profile over a range of market conditions.
 




ASYMMETRY® Global Tactical may compliment or replace strategic asset allocation. The fact sheet compares it to the Dow Jones Global Moderate Asset Allocation Index, which is rebalanced monthly across 14 indexes to create a global allocation of 60% stocks and 40% bonds. We consider this fully invested index long-only “pure beta”. The Dow Jones Global Moderate Allocation index does not reflect any fund fees, trading costs, or advisory fees.




ASYMMETRY® Global Tactical may be considered a transparent and liquid alternative to hedge funds, especially global macro or global tactical trading. We include a comparison to the Barclay Hedge Fund Index to demonstrate a comparison to “pure alpha”. The Barclay Hedge Fund Index is a measure of the average return of all hedge funds (except Funds of Funds) in the Barclay database. It includes multiple strategies including Long/Short, Global Macro, Event Driven, Arbitrage, Multi-Strategy, etc. The index is net of fees of several thousand reporting funds.

Q&A with Scott Kay & Chris Zellner
of Asymmetry Capital.
Principle Series:
Family Office Insights sits down with Scott Kay, Founder & CIO, and Chris Zellner, Founder & COO & CCO, to discuss high, absolute, risk-adjusted returns for investors through constructing a portfolio of long and shorts in global healthcare securities.

Tell us about your background and your company, Asymmetry Capital Management, L.P.   
SCOTT KAY: Founder and Chief Investment Officer of Asymmetry Capital Management.
I started my career in the pharmaceutical industry, at Pfizer where I held various positions over my 8-year tenure and was involved in the launches of some of their largest selling pharmaceutical products.  Then, following my passion for investing I moved into a Research Analyst position for Bank of America Securities (BofA) where I eventually became an II ranked Senior Global Pharmaceutical Analyst.  After BofA I joined Andor Capital Management, a multi-billion dollar hedge fund, as a VP, research analyst.  In 2004 I became a Founding Partner of Partner Fund Management (PFM), an equity long/short hedge fund, where I founded, along with two others, the PFM Healthcare Fund.  In the second half of 2011, I left PFM to launch Asymmetry.  I have always had an interest and passion for investing and being an entrepreneur, but coming from a pharmaceutical background, my route managing a fund has been quite different than most.  I grew up in an entrepreneurial family and always had a desire to run my own business and the combination of my background in healthcare, being an analyst, and then helping to build a successful and large healthcare fund has served me well as we have grown Asymmetry.  My experiences have fostered, what I believe is, a unique approach to healthcare investing and portfolio management.  We have an investment philosophy and process steeped in fundamental, deep dive analysis and we employ proprietary tools for portfolio and risk management that have been successful in protecting investor capital.  We take very seriously our fiduciary responsibility to our partners/investors and seek to minimize losses while still achieving attractive returns.  That is the guiding philosophy behind Asymmetry Capital Management. 
-------------------
CHRIS ZELLNER: Founder, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Compliance Officer of Asymmetry Capital Management.
When Scott and I met he was looking for someone to run the business side of Asymmetry.  He had seen other CIOs build successful firms only to find that they were spending a considerable amount of time running the business and not focused on investing.  He wanted a business partner that could manage all the various operational, financial, regulatory and IR/business development aspects of the fund while he focused on doing what he does best, investing long and short in healthcare.
With over 25 years of diversified Wall Street experiences; including positions in investment banking, equity capital markets, and prime brokerage at leading firms such as The New York Stock Exchange, Morgan Stanley, Lehman Brothers, and Merrill Lynch, I had built a well-rounded career that seamlessly fit into the role of Chief Operating Officer at Asymmetry.  But, no one person can do everything and we have assembled a very capable business team that includes a CFO and a VP of Operations.  With this team, and a group of globally recognized service providers, Asymmetry has always had an institutional caliber business organization.
Asymmetry Capital Management, which manages the Asymmetry Global Healthcare Funds, was founded in 2012.  We launched the Funds in 2013.  Asymmetry is designed to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns to investors by constructing a diversified, global portfolio of equity long/short healthcare securities.  The Fund invests across all healthcare sectors, including; Therapeutics (Branded Pharmaceuticals, Specialty Pharmaceuticals, Biotechnology and Generics), Medical Devices, Labs, Diagnostics, Healthcare IT, Insurers and Healthcare Services, to name a few. We are valuation-oriented, long-term investors.  We seek investments where our view of a company’s value differs significantly from the current market price and where we can identify catalysts that should close the gap.  To do this we employ a rigorous, deep-dive, fundamental research process, which we apply equally to both long and short positions. Individual stock selection operates within a framework of equally rigorous and disciplined portfolio and risk management to protect capital and deliver attractive long-term risk adjusted returns. 



What is your target investment?  
Asymmetry allocates capital opportunistically across all healthcare sub-sectors based on the fundamental analysis of data to identify long-term, value-oriented long and short investments within the following investment framework:
•	Asymmetric Opportunities: Assess the probability and magnitude of a gain and determine whether or not it is significantly greater than the possibility of a loss.
•	Liquidity: We seek stocks that have minimum average dollar traded per day to avoid getting “trapped” in a position during volatile market environments or a meaningful change in the fundamental outlook.
•	Access to Management: Regardless of our position, long or short, we require a dialogue with the C suite, not just investor relations.
•	Sector Diversification: While we allocate capital to our “best picks” we are committed to maintaining a diversified portfolio across healthcare sub-sectors.  We believe there are opportunities, long/short, in all sectors and that diversification is important from a risk management perspective. 
Our investable universe is made up of approximately 2,500 global listed healthcare companies.  Applying the liquidity and management access filter narrows the universe to 4-500 companies.  Asymmetry’s portfolio is typically comprised of 45 – 55 individual positions (20 – 30 long/20 – 25 short). 
Our target investments are companies where there is a significant divergence between our view of fundamental value and the current market price and/or consensus view.  To do this we employ a disciplined and structured investment process that we abbreviate CSM&E (Calls, Surveys, Model, and Expectations):
C & S (Calls & Surveys): Represents the foundation of our deep-dive research and includes; meeting with companies, attending medical conferences, speaking with competitors, suppliers, key opinion leaders, regulatory and legal experts, IP attorneys, etc.  Surveys help us cast a wider net to gain quantitative and qualitative data to support our modeling and identify trends and themes.
M (Models):  All our models are proprietary and based on 10 year discounted cash flows (DCF).  They are very detailed, tailored to each specific company and include; revenue drivers, P&L, balance sheet, valuation and a multi-scenario outcomes analysis.  Our models represent what we know about the company and are the basis for our price targets.
E (Expectations): This represents an analysis that is completely separate from our fundamental work.  Here we are examining the non-fundamental elements that impact stock price movements.  The questions we seek to answer include: What does the stock price tell us?  What is the consensus view?  What is view of those that disagree with us?  Why?  



What are some of the challenges you face in this market? 
As data-driven, fundamental investors we believe that stock prices, over the medium to long-term, must rise or fall based on a company’s operating performance.  Markets go through various cycles and when we are in a period where underlying fundamentals are less of a factor in stock prices that can be challenging.  The market environment over the past two years has been heavily influenced by macro factors and the flow of funds into and out of different market sectors.  We have had to adjust some aspects of our investment process, while keeping to our core capabilities, to adapt to this environment.  One of the eternal challenges of successful investing is to balance portfolio risk management (capital preservation) while still maintaining confidence and patience to stick to one’s convictions when market sentiment and performance is against you.



How are you different from your key competitors?  
A critical difference between Asymmetry and most other equity long/short funds is our expertise in short selling. These are investments where we expect the company’s share price to go down. We fundamentally short individual companies vs. using ETFs, which is what many fund manager’s do.  Our short positions are not hedges.  We expect our shorts to produce positive returns, the same as our long positions, and we apply the same fundamental, deep-dive investment process to every position in the portfolio.
Another difference is our commitment to portfolio diversification and liquidity.  We believe there are attractive opportunities, long/short, across all healthcare sub-sectors.  Many healthcare funds either by mandate or CIO bias focus on a specific sub-sector or related sub-sectors.  Asymmetry typically has 50% - 55% of its portfolio in therapeutic companies (branded pharmaceuticals, specialty pharmaceuticals, generics and biotech) with the other 45% - 50% in non-therapeutic companies (medical technology, diagnostics, healthcare services, labs, tools, payers, etc.). Portfolio liquidity is critical for our process.  Healthcare can be volatile and our theses can change quickly. Separately when market conditions are unfavorable we want to be able to adjust position sizes as well as portfolio gross/net exposure quickly with minimal market impact.  This is an important aspect to capital preservation.  
Finally, we believe that the Asymmetry investment process and company culture is another differentiator.  The investment process is structured, rigorous and repeatable.  It is designed to uncover valuation dispersion – before it’s recognized by others – through the objective analysis of data.  Given that our top ten positions frequently represent over 50% of our portfolio we need to build conviction in these positions and our process is designed to do just that. We have a passion for what we do and get pleasure from being ahead of the curve and finding things that other people aren’t seeing.
Culturally we believe that better investment and business decisions arise from multiple inputs and divergent viewpoints. We have continuous discussions and debates to test and re-test our investment thesis for current and prospective positions and investment ideas. We have a talented team of collaborative and goal-oriented individuals who love what they do and enjoy working together. This type of positive and encouraging environment is hard to find, we are lucky to have great synergy in our professional home. 



The Funds’ name is Asymmetry Global Healthcare and you previously discussed asymmetric opportunities, can you be more specific about what is an asymmetric opportunity? 
An asymmetric opportunity is characterized by a positive return probability that is significantly greater than the risk of loss.  A simple long example might be a pharmaceutical company trading at $10/share with $5/share of cash on the balance sheet and with our DCF (discounted cash flow) valuation at $30/share.  The concept is applied equally to long and short positions.  As a general guideline, we typically target a minimum risk/reward of 3 to 1 for long positions and 2 to 1 on our shorts.   



Who is your ideal investor? How much capital are you looking to raise? 
Our current investors include high net worth individuals, single and multi-family offices and institutions. What they have in common is an interest, for some an excitement, in healthcare investing.  Our investors generally have interest in working with a manager who enjoys doing the deep-dive fundamental work that plays out in the long-term.  Healthcare is a large, dynamic sector where individual companies have historically displayed a lot of performance dispersion.  That means winners and losers.  It is a sector where persistent valuation inefficiencies are driven by complexity and rapid change.  Where specialized investment teams able to navigate complex scientific, technological and regulatory environments can identify and capture these valuation differences.
We like to work with people who understand what we do and have developed the same level of conviction in our team as we have in our top positions. Our investors are interested in the healthcare sector, and its prospective returns, but recognize that it can be a volatile.  They choose to partner with us because we seek to maximize risk-adjusted returns while also protecting capital.  Everyone on the Asymmetry team that is able to invest in the Fund is invested in the Fund.  Our limited partners are co-investing alongside of us.
The current AUM of the firm is $94mm and our capacity is between $700-$800mm.  Our intention is to keep our AUM below $1Bn as we believe that with an AUM greater than $1Bn it would be difficult to achieve our annual return target.  We plan to soft close the Fund at $500M and then will grow organically until we get to $700-$800mm.



What is your mission? 
A passion and love for healthcare is at the core of our mission. There’s a societal overlay about supporting good companies with innovative products that are changing the world and saving lives – and conversely, voting against companies with underwhelming products or poor management teams by shorting stocks. We believe in supporting solid companies with operating profits that we believe will be greater than consensus expectations and forecasting against poorly run companies with products that do not add value are overly promotional or obsolescent.  Essentially, we aim to deploy capital in an ethical way. 
We have a dynamic team and investment process in place. Our mission is to grow the fund and produce attractive risk-adjusted returns for our partners, investors, and for ourselves. We enjoy working with people we like, doing what we are passionate about and expect to generate outsized returns for our stakeholders and Asymmetry.



What’s next for you? 
Both Scott and I have worked for big and small companies over our careers. We are very happy with the team we have built and would be happy to manage and grow Asymmetry for, at least, the next ten years. We love being in this environment with our team and investors.  Over the next couple years we could look to add another healthcare fund or two that expresses unique strategies from our core fund.
