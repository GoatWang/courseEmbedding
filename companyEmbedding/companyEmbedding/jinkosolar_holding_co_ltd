Earnings Release
JinkoSolar Announces First Quarter 2017 Financial Results
JinkoSolar Holding Co., Ltd. ("JinkoSolar" or the "Company") (JKS), a global leader in the solar PV industry, today announced its unaudited financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017.
First Quarter 2017 Highlights
• Total solar module shipments were 2,068 megawatts ("MW"), an increase of 19.3% from 1,733 MW in the fourth quarter of 2016 and an increase of 29.3% from 1,600 MW in the first quarter of 2016.
• Total revenues were RMB5.78 billion (US$839.3 million), an increase of 12.8% from the fourth quarter of 2016 and an increase of 9.4% from the first quarter of 2016.
• Gross margin was 11.2%, compared with 14.3% in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 20.5% in the first quarter of 2016.
• Income from operations was RMB56.8 million (US$8.3 million), compared with RMB77.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and RMB529.1 million in the first quarter of 2016.
• Net income attributable to the Companys ordinary shareholders from continuing operations was RMB60.6 million (US$8.8 million) in the first quarter of 2017, compared with RMB145.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and RMB382.7 million in the first quarter of 2016.
• Diluted earnings per American depositary share ("ADS") from continuing operations were RMB1.88 (US$0.28).
• Non-GAAP net income attributable to the Companys ordinary shareholders from continuing operations in the first quarter of 2017 was RMB80.0 million (US$11.6 million), compared with RMB228.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and RMB437.8 million in the first quarter of 2016.
• Non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS from continuing operations were RMB2.52 (US$0.36) and RMB2.48 (US$0.36) respectively in the first quarter of 2017.
Mr. Kangping Chen, JinkoSolars Chief Executive Officer commented, "Module shipments during the quarter hit a record high of 2,068MW, a 19.3% increase sequentially while generating US$839.3 million in revenue. We continued to capitalize on the growing recognition of JinkoSolars brand and high quality products and services to increase our market share and capture new opportunities during the quarter."
"Our gross margin contracted to 11.2% from 14.3% last quarter as a result of a slight decline in the average selling prices ("ASP") of solar modules, increased silicon prices and material costs caused by a shortage of supply in the first quarter. We believe our margins have room to improve in the second quarter and throughout the second half of the year as our mono wafer and PERC cell capacity increases and polysilicon prices stabilize."
"Demand in China remains strong with growth momentum expected to continue into the next quarter. While the June 30 Feed-in-Tariff has created some uncertainties in Chinas utility-scale market, we havent seen demand weaken. Our deep involvement in the Top Runner and PV Poverty Alleviation projects as well as distributed generation projects will provide strong support for demand during the second half of the year."
"We strongly oppose the petition under Section 201 in the US, but believe growth momentum there will continue. ASPs of solar modules in the US have risen slightly in recently months due to strong demand. Demand from India and other emerging markets where we are devoting more resources to expand our leading market share also continue to grow rapidly. With such strong demand from across the globe, we expect module shipments to increase by approximately 25% sequentially in the second quarter of 2017."
"We continue to ramp up our mono wafer and PERC cell capacity, which will reduce the overall cost of our mono products and help increase our margins. Our mono PERC products are in short supply and have been fully booked out for the rest of the year, demonstrating the strong demand for our high quality products. In the meanwhile, our team is working hard to optimize the cost structure of both our mono and multi products."
"While we are facing some short-term industry headwinds, the continued development of the global solar industry is irreversible. We are confident in the long-term prospects of the solar industry and our sustainable growth strategy."
First Quarter 2017 Financial Results
Total Revenues
Total revenues in the first quarter of 2017 were RMB5.78 billion (US$839.3 million), an increase of 12.8% from RMB5.12 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016 and an increase of 9.4% from RMB5.28 billion in the first quarter of 2016. The sequential and year-over-year increases were mainly attributable to an increase in solar module shipments in the first quarter of 2017.

Gross profit in the first quarter of 2017 was RMB649.0 million (US$94.3 million), compared with RMB730.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and RMB1.08 billion in the first quarter of 2016. The sequential and year-over-year decreases were mainly attributable to a decline in the ASP of solar modules in the first quarter of 2017.
Gross margin was 11.2% in the first quarter of 2017, compared with 14.3% in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 20.5% in the first quarter of 2016.
Income from Operations and Operating Margin
Income from operations in the first quarter of 2017 was RMB56.8 million (US$8.2 million), compared with RMB77.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and RMB529.1 million in the first quarter of 2016. Operating margin in the first quarter of 2017 was 1.0%, compared with 1.5% in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 10.0% in the first quarter of 2016.
Total operating expenses in the first quarter of 2017 were RMB592.2 million (US$86.0 million), a decrease of 9.2% from RMB652.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and an increase of 6.6% from RMB555.7 million in the first quarter of 2016. The sequential decrease was primarily due to the reversal of an allowance for doubtful accounts because of subsequent collection. The year-over-year increase was mainly due to increased shipping costs which were in line with the increase in solar module shipments.
Total operating expenses accounted for 10.3% of total revenues in the first quarter of 2017, compared to 12.7% in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 10.5% in the first quarter of 2016.
Interest Expense, Net
Net interest expense in the first quarter of 2017 was RMB57.1 million (US$8.3 million), a decrease of 23.4% from RMB74.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and a decrease of 25.7% from RMB76.9 million in the first quarter of 2016.The sequential decrease was due to the repurchase of US$61.1 million in convertible senior notes. The year-over-year decrease was due to the repurchase of US$184.0 million in convertible senior notes and the repayment of US$17.4 million in bond payables.
Exchange Gain / (Loss), Net
The Company recorded a net exchange loss of RMB5.2 million (US$0.8 million) in the first quarter of 2017, compared to a net exchange gain of RMB17.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and a net exchange gain of RMB29.5 million in the first quarter of 2016.
Income Tax Expense / (Benefit), Net
The Company recorded an income tax expense of RMB1.5 million (US$0.2 million) in the first quarter of 2017, compared with an income tax benefit of RMB49.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and an income tax expense of RMB100.3 million in the first quarter of 2016. The sequential change was mainly due to the successful renewal of a National High and New Technology Enterprise license which grants one of the Companys subsidiaries a preferential tax rate. The year-over-year change was due to one of the Companys overseas subsidiaries receiving a tax exemption for a five-year period starting from August 2015.
The Company adopted ASU 2015-17, "Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes" in 2017, which is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and prospectively classified deferred tax liabilities and assets as noncurrent in the financial statements during the quarter ended March 31, 2017.
Net Income and Earnings per Share
Net income attributable to the Companys ordinary shareholders from continuing operations in the first quarter of 2017 was RMB60.6 million (US$8.8 million), compared with RMB145.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and RMB382.7million in the first quarter of 2016.
Basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share from continuing operations were RMB0.48 (US$0.07) and RMB0.47 (US$0.07), respectively, during the first quarter of 2017. This translates into basic and diluted earnings per ADS from continuing operations of RMB1.92 (US$0.28) and RMB1.88 (US$0.28), respectively.
Non-GAAP net income in the first quarter of 2017 was RMB80.0 million (US$11.6 million), compared with RMB228.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and RMB437.8 million in the first quarter of 2016.
Non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share from continuing operations were RMB0.63 (US$0.09) and RMB0.62 (US$0.09), respectively, during the first quarter of 2017. This translates into non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS from continuing operations of RMB2.52 (US$0.36) and RMB2.48 (US$0.36), respectively.
Financial Position
As of March 31, 2017, the Company had RMB1.71 billion (US$249.0 million) in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, compared with RMB2.82 billion as of December 31, 2016.
As of March 31, 2017, the Companys accounts receivables due from third parties were RMB5.93 billion (US$860.9 million), compared with RMB4.75 billion as of December 31, 2016.
As of March 31, 2017, the Companys inventories were RMB5.37 billion (US$780.2 million), compared with RMB4.47 billion as of December 31, 2016. The strategic increase in inventories was primarily due to strong anticipated demand during the second quarter of 2017.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement its consolidated financial results presented in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), JinkoSolar uses certain non-GAAP financial measures including, non-GAAP net income , non-GAAP earnings per Share, non-GAAP earnings per ADS, and non-GAAP diluted weighted average ordinary shares outstanding, which are adjusted from the comparable GAAP results to exclude certain expenses or incremental ordinary shares relating to share-based compensation, convertible senior notes and capped call options:
• Non-GAAP net income is adjusted to exclude the expenses relating to changes in fair value of convertible senior notes and capped call options, change in fair value of derivative liability, interest expenses of convertible senior notes, exchange gain on the convertible senior notes and capped call options, stock-based compensation, allocation of net income to redeemable non-controlling interests, and accretion to redemption value of redeemable non-controlling interests; given these Non-GAAP net income adjustments above are either related to the Company or its subsidiaries incorporated in Cayman Islands, which are not subject to tax exposures, or related to those subsidiaries with tax loss positions which result in no tax impacts, therefore no tax adjustment is needed in conjunction with these Non-GAAP net income adjustments; and
• Non-GAAP earnings per Share and non-GAAP earnings per ADS are adjusted to exclude the expenses relating to the issuance costs of convertible senior notes, changes in fair value of convertible senior notes and capped call options, interest expenses of convertible senior notes and exchange gain on the convertible senior notes and capped call options, stock-based compensation, and accretion to redemption value of redeemable non-controlling interests.
The Company believes that the use of non-GAAP information is useful for analysts and investors to evaluate JinkoSolars current and future performances based on a more meaningful comparison of net income and diluted net income per ADS when compared with its peers and historical results from prior periods. These measures are not intended to represent or substitute numbers as measured under GAAP. The submission of non-GAAP numbers is voluntary and should be reviewed together with GAAP results.

JinkoSolar Resumes Production at its Haining FacilityHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreYahooSearchSearchSkip to NavigationSkip to Main ContentSkip to Related Content0JinkoSolar Resumes Production at its Haining FacilityPR NewswireOctober 11, 2011ReblogShareTweetShareSHANGHAI, Oct. 11, 2011 /PRNewswire-Asia-FirstCall/ -- JinkoSolar Holding Co., Ltd. ("JinkoSolar" or the "Company") (NYSE:JKS - News), a fast growing, vertically integrated solar power product manufacturer in China, today announced that it has resumed production at  its facility in Haining City in Zhejiang Province, China.  The Haining facility, one of two JinkoSolar production facilities, suspended production on September 17, 2011, after an accident involving suspected leakage of fluoride from a waste storage warehouse into a nearby small water channel due to extreme and unforeseen weather conditions. The Company has taken all the steps recommended by one of the top environmental engineering firms that is licensed by the Chinese government ("Licensed Engineers").  These few steps complemented the measures that the Company had already taken to upgrade its environmental protection practices immediately after the discovery that some amount of fluoride might have accidentally leaked into a small water channel behind its solid waste storage facility at the end of August 2011. "While we have always been fully committed to environmental safety and social responsibility, we understand from this accident that we always need to think about extreme and unforeseen circumstances and generally enhance our risk management practices," commented Mr. Li Xiande, Chairman of JinkoSolar. "We will apply the lessons we have learned in all our production facilities for the benefit of the environment, the community and all our stakeholders."  "We are expanding our outreach to the communities surrounding our production facilities. We have proposed regular meetings with Hongxiao Village officials to discuss issues of mutual interest," said Mr. Chen Kangping, Chief Executive Officer. "Additionally, we are finalizing our selection of an international environment, health and safety [EHS] company to perform a full scale audit of all our facilities. The management team decided to take this additional step as a testimony to the high international standards that we hold ourselves to. We believe that enhancing environmental performance and improving relationships with nearby communities will lead to increased shareholder value."On September 28, 2011, a committee of experts ("Experts Committee") established by the Haining government approved a set of recommendations developed by the Licensed Engineers with the assistance of the Company and the Haining government to be implemented by the Company.  On October 6, 2011, the Experts Committee, the Environmental Bureau of the Haining government and representatives of Hongxiao Village, reviewed the steps taken by the Company based on the recommendations of the Experts Committee and provided their comments to JinkoSolar's management.On October 9, 2011, the Experts Committee notified the Company that it was satisfied with the steps taken by the Company.The Company is waiting for a response from Hongxiao Village on its proposal for a regular schedule of meetings with village officials. The Company is deeply committed to going beyond symbolism to establish a greater understanding of how JinkoSolar and Hongxiao Village can better coexist and how the village can benefit from JinkoSolar's growth.
