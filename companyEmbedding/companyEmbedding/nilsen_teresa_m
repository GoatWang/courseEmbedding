Past performance does not guarantee future results. Fund managers named to the Barron’s list of the industry's top 100 have consistently outperformed their peers. The Barron's/Value Line annual rankings system awards points to managers who generate more stable returns and subtracts points from funds deemed too volatile. A manager with average performance and volatility gets a score of zero. Superior managers get positive scores commensurate with the value they’ve added to a fund’s performance on an annualized basis. Value Line first scanned 1,008 equity funds, screening out those with more than two lead managers and managers with less than three years’ tenure. The remaining funds were then organized by investment objective, and those with less than $200 million in assets were eliminated. 564 managers qualified to be ranked.




Unwavering commitment to our shareholders is a guiding principle at Hennessy Funds.  We strive to always deliver outstanding customer care, and we maintain a strong and dedicated Sales and Service team to serve our clients, shareholders and business partners.

The Funds' investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses must be considered carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and other important information about the investment company. Please read it carefully before investing. A hard copy of the prospectus can be requested by calling 1-800-966-4354.
Mutual fund investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Small and medium-capitalization companies may have more limited liquidity and greater price volatility than large-capitalization companies. Investments in foreign securities may involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risk and differences in accounting methods. A non-diversified fund, one that may concentrate its assets in fewer individual holdings than a diversified fund, is more exposed to individual stock volatility than a diversified fund. A fund that concentrates its investments within one country, one sector, or a small group of industries, such as Japan, Technology, Financials or Natural Gas, may be subject to a higher degree of risk. Investments in debt securities typically decrease in value when interest rates rise. The risk is greater for longer-term debt securities. Investment by a fund in lower-rated and non-rated securities presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher-rated securities. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities are subject to prepayment risk, which is the risk that the borrower will prepay some or all of the principal owed to the issuer. Funds that invest in pooled investment vehicles (including ETFs) may experience higher fees. The formula-based strategy employed by some Funds may cause those Funds to buy or sell securities at times when it may not be advantageous.
