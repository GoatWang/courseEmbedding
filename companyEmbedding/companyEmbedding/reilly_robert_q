This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

PITTSBURGH, March 15, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (NYSE:   PNC) today announced that Robert Q. Reilly will succeed Richard J. Johnson as chief financial officer.  
(Photo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20130315/NE77659 )
Reilly has led PNC's Asset Management Group (AMG), which includes its Wealth Management, Capitol Advisors and Hawthorn asset management units, since 2005. He will assume his new position upon the retirement of Johnson, who has announced his plan to leave PNC in the third quarter.
"Rob helped build PNC's asset management group into one of the top 10 bank-held wealth managers in the United States, with total sales growth above 30 percent in each of the last two years and revenue approaching $1 billion," said James E. Rohr, chairman and chief executive officer of PNC. "We believe he is the right person to advance the work of Rick Johnson. Rick's leadership contributed to PNC's dramatic expansion over the past 10 years, and he was instrumental in guiding PNC through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression."
Reilly joined PNC Bank in 1987 and has held numerous management positions in investment and commercial banking, including serving as executive vice president for PNC's Corporate Banking business. Prior to assuming his current role, Reilly was deputy head of PNC Advisors. 
Reilly serves on the board of directors for RAF Industries, the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society and the Delaware Valley Community Reinvestment Fund Investment Committee. He has a bachelor's degree in finance from Georgetown University. 
Succeeding Reilly as head of AMG and joining PNC's Executive Committee will be Orlando C. Esposito, current Corporate Banking executive vice president.
Esposito is responsible for growing corporate finance and middle market clients in the Northeast, including the states of Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, as well as the Akron, Cleveland, and Youngstown markets. He has been a key leader of the Sales Force Effectiveness initiative, which has contributed to strong client growth in newly acquired Southeastern markets. He joined PNC in 1985 from international accounting firm Touche Ross & Company, where he was a certified public accountant. He has a bachelor's degree in accounting from Philadelphia University and an MBA from Villanova University. He is a board member of Philadelphia Museum of Art and the Southeastern Pennsylvania United Way.
The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (www.pnc.com) is one of the nation's largest diversified financial services organizations providing retail and business banking; residential mortgage banking; specialized services for corporations and government entities, including corporate banking, real estate finance and asset-based lending; wealth management and asset management.
