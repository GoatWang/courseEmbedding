MBA Inducts 17 Companies into Hall of Honor Program
Oct 16, 2014


Washington, DC (October 16, 2014) - Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) is inducting 17 companies into the Hall of Honor program. The Hall of Honor recognizes
      both corporations and individual corporate leaders for their commitment to veterans and active-duty military personnel. 
      The Hall of Honor program was created to acknowledge MBA member companies with programs that serve our nation's heroes in
         three categories—financial counseling, employment opportunities and homeownership assistance. MBA solicited submissions from
         its member companies and then chose from a variety of applicants which programs deserved recognition.
      
"MBA is pleased to honor these 17 companies by inducting them into the Hall of Honor," said Bill Cosgrove, CMB, 2015 MBA Chairman
         and CEO of Union Home Mortgage Corp." Each company, through their commitment to helping the military community, has demonstrated
         first-class service towards recognizing the men and women who defend our nation. It’s programs such as these that reinforce
         the mortgage industry’s dedication to the military.”
      
Below is a list of the companies who are being inducted into the program:

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Overview


Prior to 29 July 2016, the PIMCO Dynamic Credit and Mortgage Income Fund was named the PIMCO Dynamic Credit Income Fund.
PRESS RELEASES




Fund Overview
The fund utilizes a dynamic allocation strategy across multiple fixed income sectors, with an emphasis on opportunities in developed and emerging global credit markets, to pursue current income as a primary objective and capital appreciation as a secondary objective.
The fund will normally invest at least 80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in a portfolio of mortgage-related securities and other debt instruments of varying maturities.  The fund will normally invest at least 25% of its total assets (i.e., concentrate) in privately issued (commonly known as “non-agency”) mortgage-related securities.
The fund may also invest up to 40% of its total assets in securities of issuers economically tied to emerging market countries. The fund will normally maintain an average portfolio duration of between zero and eight years.

Yields & Distributions Footnotes & Disclosures


disclosures
1Data is based on distributions since the most recent calendar year end and does not include special cash dividends.

Distribution yields are not performance and are calculated by annualizing the most recent distribution per share and dividing by the NAV or Market Price as of the reported date. Distributions may be comprised of ordinary income, net capital gains, and/or a return of capital (ROC) of your investment in the fund. Because the distribution rate may include a ROC, it should not be confused with yield or income. A negative value for Undistributed Net Investment Income represents the potential for a ROC on an estimated tax basis. Please refer to the most recent Section 19 Notice, if applicable, for additional information regarding the composition of distributions. Final determination of a distribution’s tax character will be made on Form 1099 DIV sent to shareholders each January.


It is important to note that differences exist between the fund’s daily internal accounting records, the fund’s financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and recordkeeping practices under income tax regulations. It is possible that the fund may not issue a Section 19 Notice in situations where the fund’s financial statements prepared later and in accordance with U.S. GAAP or the final tax character of those distributions might later report that the sources of those distributions included capital gains and/or a return of capital. Please see the fund’s most recent shareholder report for more details.

Prices & Performance Footnotes & Disclosures


disclosures

Past performance is not a guarantee or a reliable indicator of future results. An investment in the fund involves risk, including loss of principal. Investment return and the value of shares will fluctuate. Shares may be worth more or less than original purchase price. Due to market volatility, current performance may be lower or higher than average annual returns shown. Returns are calculated by determining the percentage change in NAV or market price (as applicable) in the specific period. The calculation assumes that all dividends and distributions, if any, have been reinvested. NAV and market price returns does not reflect broker sales charges or commissions in connection with the purchase or sales of Fund shares and includes the effect of any expense reductions. Returns for a period of less than one year is not annualized. Returns for a period of more than one year represents the average annual return. Performance at market price will differ from results at NAV. Although market price returns typically reflect investment results over time, during shorter periods returns at market price can also be influenced by factors such as changing views about the fund, market conditions, supply and demand for the fund’s shares or changes in fund dividends and distributions.


             Daily YTD return is from the most recent calendar year end.

Portfolio Composition Footnotes & Disclosures


disclosures
4For information as of October 31, 2015 and hereafter, the Sector Allocation MV% shown reflects exposures gained through the use of interest rate swaps at the market value of the swaps. Such exposures were reflected at the notional amount of the swaps for prior periods. As a result, this change may have the effect of reflecting lower exposures for one or more sectors and correspondingly higher exposures for other sectors than has or would be shown using the prior method.
5May include nominal and inflation-protected Treasuries, Treasury futures and options, agencies, FDIC-guaranteed and government-guaranteed corporate securities, and interest rate swaps.
6Short duration emerging markets instruments includes an emerging market security or other instrument economically tied to an emerging market country by country of risk with an effective duration less than one year and rated investment grade or higher or if unrated, determined to be similar quality by PIMCO. Emerging Markets includes the value of short duration emerging markets instruments previously reported in another category.
7May include convertibles, preferreds, and yankee bonds.
8Net Other Short Duration Instruments includes securities and other instruments (except instruments tied to emerging markets by country of risk) with an effective duration less than one year and rated investment grade or higher or, if unrated, determined by PIMCO to be of comparable quality, commingled liquidity funds, uninvested cash, interest receivables, net unsettled trades, broker money, short duration derivatives (for example Eurodollar futures) and derivatives offsets. With respect to certain categories of short duration securities, the Adviser reserves the discretion to require a minimum credit rating higher than investment grade for inclusion in this category. Derivatives Offsets includes offsets associated with investments in futures, swaps and other derivatives. Such offsets may be taken at the notional value of the derivative position which in certain instances may exceed the actual amount owed on such positions.
9By country of issuer, sorted by gross market value.

             Duration is a measure of the fund's price sensitivity to changes in interest rates expressed in years.
        

             Total Leverage -Adjusted Duration represents the Fund’s effective portfolio duration taking into account its use of leverage, including both portfolio leverage (e.g., reverse repos, credit default swaps, and tender option bonds), and any structural leverage, such as auction-rate preferred shares, if any, issued by the Fund. Effective duration is the duration for a bond with an embedded option when the value is calculated to include the expected change in cash flow caused by the option as interest rates change.

             Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investing in securities entails risk, including possible loss of principal. The use of leverage may cause a Fund to liquidate portfolio positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations or to meet segregation requirements. The use of leverage may cause a Fund to be more volatile, which may increase the risk of investment loss.

Disclosures 




A word about risk:


The value of most bond funds and fixed income securities are impacted by changes in interest rates. Bonds and bond funds with longer durations tend to be more sensitive and more volatile than securities with shorter durations; bond prices generally fall as interest rates rise. Mortgage and asset-backed securities may be sensitive to changes in interest rates, subject to early repayment risk, and their value may fluctuate in response to the market’s perception of issuer creditworthiness; while generally supported by some form of government or private guarantee there is no assurance that private guarantors will meet their obligations. High-yield, lower-rated, securities involve greater risk than higher-rated securities; portfolios that invest in them may be subject to greater levels of credit and liquidity risk than portfolios that do not. Investing in foreign denominated and/or domiciled securities may involve heightened risk due to currency fluctuations, and economic and political risks, which may be enhanced in emerging markets. The use of leverage may cause a portfolio to liquidate positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations or to meet segregation requirements. Leverage, including borrowing, may cause a portfolio to be more volatile than if the portfolio had not been leveraged. Derivatives may involve certain costs and risks such as liquidity, interest rate, market, credit, management and the risk that a position could not be closed when most advantageous. Investing in derivatives could lose more than the amount invested.

        

             As with any stock, the price of the fund’s common shares will fluctuate with market conditions and other factors. Shares of closed-end management investment companies frequently trade at a price that is less than (a “discount”) or more than (a “premium”) from their net asset value. If the fund’s shares trade at a premium to net asset value, there is no assurance that any such premium will be sustained for any period of time and will not decrease, or that the shares will not trade at a discount to net asset value thereafter. Additionally, the fund's distribution rate may be affected by numerous factors, including changes in realized and projected market returns, fund performance, and other factors. There can be no assurance that a change in market conditions or other factors will not result in a change in the fund distribution rate at a future time.

             Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously offered. After the initial public offering, shares are sold on the open market through a stock exchange. Closed-end funds may be leveraged and carry various risks depending upon the underlying assets owned by a fund. Investment policies, management fees and other matters of interest to prospective investors may be found in each closed-end fund annual and semi-annual report.

Most fixed income securities provide you with periodic interest payments over the stated term of the security and repay the principal in full at maturity. Most mortgage- and asset-backed securities, however, make both principal and interest payments monthly, quarterly, or semi-annually over the life of the security. Interest payments are fully taxable; principal payments are not. 


Most mortgage-backed securities are driven by the principal and interest payments on home mortgages. For example, a government-sponsored enterprise that provides housing loans, such as Fannie Mae, will issue a mortgage-backed security to generate capital for lending. The bondholders later receive their interest and principal in the form of monthly payments, as the mortgages that the funds were used to finance are paid off.


Since homeowners have the right to pay off their mortgages at any time, these monthly payments may include additional payments of principal (known as prepayments).


Generally, when interest rates decline, prepayments accelerate beyond the initial pricing assumptions, which could cause the average life and expected maturity of the securities to shorten. Conversely, when interest rates rise, prepayments slow down beyond the initial pricing assumptions, and could cause the average life and expected maturity of the securities to extend, and the market value to decline.


When prepayments accelerate due to falling interest rates, principal may have to be reinvested at a lower interest rate than the coupon of the security.


Similarly, many asset-backed securities are driven by consumer and home equity loans. For this reason, asset-backed securities structures always contain some form of credit enhancement to bring the credit quality to the desired level.


In exchange for the cash flow uncertainty caused by prepayments, mortgage- and asset-backed securities afford you relative safety (provided you hold them to maturity), liquidity, and superior yields, relative to comparable bonds.


Most mortgage- and asset-backed securities are available in small denominations, making them a good vehicle for diversifying your portfolio.
