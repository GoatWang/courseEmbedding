Sold ArtworkPainter - Landscape and WildlifeGrowing up in Texas, John was always captivated with art. “I had two aunts who were talented artists and I was fascinated by the work they created. When I was young, I remember staring at their work and studying it for long periods of time.”
John began honing his own talent at a young age. In grade school, his work often showed up in his school’s display cases. In junior high, he won scholarships to summer art camps. And in high school… well, that’s another story.
At that time, his family had moved to a very small town in central Texas. So small, in fact, that the one high school there didn’t offer art classes. He continued his interest anyway by finding ways to use his drawing and sketching skills to illustrate homework projects in his biology and history classes as well as sketching other subjects of interest.
John decided to get serious about his art in college, and enrolled in art and design classes. Graduating with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in communication design, he pursued a career in graphic design. Today he co-owns a successful design business. In addition, John has frequently been called upon to teach design and illustration classes at Texas Tech University School of Art during the past 15 years.
John now devotes his time to his painting. Primarily a self-taught painter, he enjoys all art styles but is drawn to traditional, representational art. He is inspired by landscapes, people at work and scenes of everyday life.
During his college days, John met and married his wife Karen, who is his biggest fan and helpful critic. They have two daughters and one granddaughter.
John is a member of the Oil Painters of America.

Sold ArtworkPainter  SouthwestEncouraged by the wealth of landscape and artist interpretation in the Bay Area and with such early experiences as Van Gogh’s exhibition at De Young Museum in San Francisco, John’s appreciation of art emerged at an early age.
A childhood full of drawing and painting foreshadowed an artistic future: after completing four years in the U.S. Coast Guard, he attended and graduated from the Academy of Art College (AAC) in San Francisco, winning numerous student awards and scholarships. After graduation, John accepted the AAC’s offer to remain at the college as an instructor of painting and drawing, and eventually served as Director of Foundations overseeing all Freshmen Drawing, and Color and Design classes.
John believes in the importance of an academic grounding in basic principles of art and adheres strongly to the classical premises of art education. He values his teaching and administrative experiences as having increased his perspective as an educator and artist.
John’s works reflect his inspired appreciation of the landscape. His paintings can be found in numerous private collections across the country.
His numerous professional awards and honors include "Best of Show" Society of Western Artists; Arts for the Parks Annual National Juried Exhibition; The Artist Magazine Annual National Juried Competition; The Sonoma Plein Air, Sedona Plein Air; and The Rocky Mountain Annual Plein Air Paint Out.
John lives in Liberty, Utah with his wife Jenny, their six children, and Spike the cat.

Oily Fish
A healthy diet should contain at least two portions of fish a week, including one oily fish. Oil-rich fish is a key source of the omega-3 fats EPA and DHA which support a healthy heart.

For over 160 years, John West has trawled the world’s oceans and followed its wildest rivers, to bring you the finest, freshest and tastiest oil rich fish. From succulent salmon caught in the wilds of Alaska to tender mackerel and delicious sardines from the depths of the Atlantic, there’s no stopping our fishermen when it comes to bringing you the very best.
