Description










Sharks are sure to make a splash in your classroom! This in-depth teaching unit dispels myths and helps kids understand the amazing abilities and unique characteristics of these spectacular creatures. They’ll write shark poems, map migration routes, play games, make shark puppets, and much more. Includes background information, creative cross-curricular activities, hands-on reproducibles, and more!




How to use this product:
Acrostic Poem: Each line of the poem begins with a letter in a word. For example, if the word is shark, the first line begins with s, the next begins with h, and so on. Each line usually consists of just one word, but kids can also write a phrase or sentence that begins with the appropriate letter. Encourage students to use this form to write poems about specific types of sharks!

Description










Sharks are sure to make a splash in your classroom! This in-depth teaching unit dispels myths and helps kids understand the amazing abilities and unique characteristics of these spectacular creatures. They’ll write shark poems, map migration routes, play games, make shark puppets, and much more. Includes background information, creative cross-curricular activities, hands-on reproducibles, and more!




How to use this product:
Acrostic Poem: Each line of the poem begins with a letter in a word. For example, if the word is shark, the first line begins with s, the next begins with h, and so on. Each line usually consists of just one word, but kids can also write a phrase or sentence that begins with the appropriate letter. Encourage students to use this form to write poems about specific types of sharks!

TESTIMONIALS






 
Just what I needed for laying out at the beach, they are also for tanning but I don't do tanning beds. I got these at a random color selection, I got hot pink, which was what I really wanted. They are also hard plastic and comes with tie on elastic.
BayouDoll 



 
I purchased these to use for when I get my UV-B light treatments at the dermatologist. The light treatment system they use is a stand up one and I needed goggles that had a head band included to keep them in place. They work perfectly and are a great value for the price.
Colie M. 



 
THESE GOGGLES ARE FLEXIBLE AND VERY COMFORTABLE. THEY DON'T LET ANY LIGHT IN AT THE CORNER OF YOUR EYES. THEY ARE FAR SUPERIOR TO THE SUPER SUNNIES THAT CAME WITH OUR TANNING UNIT WHICH ARE RIGID, HARD TO ADJUST TO BLOCK THE LIGHT, AND NOT COMFORTABLE. THE EVO FLEX SUNNIES COST A LITTLE MORE BUT ARE WELL WORTH IT.
 
James Madigan 



 
These are your basic tanning goggles. They work exactly as they should and they arrived on time and well-packaged. Nothing more could be wanting in this product.
SouffleGirl “OswinO” 



 
I don't use it for tanning bed, but use it while I'm in the infra red sauna for eye protection to keep my eyes from drying out.
 
J. Jones 



 
Comfortable flexible and durable fit; My wife and I both like ours. Strap enables stand up or lying down tanning.
Michael C. Senisch 



 
These glasses worked just fine. The size was a little small for a big face, but they are supposed to be small. They worked as advertised and I would recommend them to anyone.
Steelcomic 



 
Love the goggles. I use them to tan outside...when I go to the tanning bed they have their own. Super fast shipping!
J. Stewart 



 
Came earlier then it said which was great and super cute pink works great used it last night when I went tanning and they were a good price better than in the salon.
Ashlyxoxo 



 
There is not too much someone can say about sun tan goggles. They work, they are comfey, and a quick delivery. Good buy for me.
Jack G 



 
I ordered these on a Friday and received them the following Wednesday. They are way cheaper than buying them at a tanning place, and with free shipping you can't beat it. I was looking for goggles with the option for elastic so I can use them in a stand up booth and these are exactly what I wanted.
Jessica 



 
My husband and I use these for our afternoon cat naps and they work just fine at keeping out the light -- much better than the eye shades one gets from airlines, for example, which allow light in from the edges. The strap needs to be adjusted properly to keep the goggles on, without pressing them too tightly against the face. Still, they're the best napping eye shades we've yet come across.
Karen A. Amrhein 



 
So glad that I got them. They work great and are dark. I am very satisfied. Would buy these again.
AmandaJ 



 
These came just as described. They are just what I needed. I see no tanning light with them on! They fit my eyes perfect, the old sunnies just didnt cut it, they didnt form to my eyes at all. These work great!
TNMel 



 
I love my super sunnies. Not only did I get a purple pair but I also got them like two days later. Plus they weren't super expensive and they do a great job at keeping the light out of my eyes. I am actually about to order my sis in law a pair too. 🙂
Bonita

Gary Shannon aka Axion uses Engine Oil Stop Leak




We just installed a 2nd engine in our 2001 Xterra, that has sat for 6 years with only 20,000 miles on it
As worried as we were that the engine might have sat too long our mechanic suggested 1 quart of Lucas Oil Stop Leak to give it new re-break in protection and help it opperate with less friction!
After 5 thousand miles the new engine sounds and runs like a brand new one!
I can't stess to much about the added protection Lucas oil products gave this engine after sitting so long!
Thank You!!

Top critical reviewSee the critical review› 3.0 out of 5 starsThe tale the tracks tell is sketchyByBob Walchon February 24, 2014Although I liked the approach the author used focusing on what dinosaur tracks can tell us but I was not impressed by the execution of the idea. Granted this little paperback is intended for young readers (grades K-3) but the attempt at rhyming the text wasn't that effective and was perhaps even limiting in setting forth the concrete facts that were being conveyed here. I think a non-rhymed presentation would have allowed the author to offer a greater range of hard facts and details.  A second concern I have involved some of the illustrations. They were adequate but they were also a little too busy for my liking given this book was for the younger set. And a few of them were actually a little scary. I wouldn't be surprised if I read this paperback to my granddaughter and she was a little taken back by some of the pictures. The last thing I want is to have an innocent story reading session result in a nightmare or two!  I'd suggest checking out this book at the local library first before making a purchase. On the other hand, it is rather inexpensive so if you do buy it sight unseen and it's not to your liking you can perhaps donate it to a school or local library.  This book was supplied by the publisher.

Used and recommended by major firearms manufacturers, Lucas Oil Hunting Gun Oil is an all-weather, environmentally friendly lubricant. Great for general lubrication on all sporting arms such as pump, over/under and side by side shotguns, bolt and lever action rifles and revolvers. This oil is odorless which makes it ideal for use on hunting firearms.
Prevents jamming and overheating, resists evaporation and penetrates rust freeing stuck parts and actions. Polymeric film protects from rust, wear and moisture and makes copper, lead and wad fouling much easier to clean. It neutralizes acids from fingerprints and resists drying for long term storage use.
Key Benefits

Odorless, a must for hunting firearms.
Great for use on compound bows.
An excellent general purpose household lubricant.
Superior to any competitors oil products, at a lower cost.
Made in U.S.A.

Forrest Lucas has never taken a single vacation—and, at 73, he has no intention of taking any time off now.

Lucas says he simply can’t find anyone else to run his California-based Lucas Oil Products Inc. the way he can. He founded the company, which sells fuel and oil additives and other automotive products, in 1988.

The Hoosier native and former truck driver paid $121.5 million to put the Lucas Oil name on the home of the Indianapolis Colts for 20 years.

What’s your education level? 

	I graduated high school, then went to a long college called hard knocks.

Do you feel like you missed out on anything by not going to college?

	Not really. I don’t know what I would have studied.

	I thought I might have wanted to be a lawyer, but there was no way I could afford to go to college. So, instead, I bought my first truck when I was 19 and my first semi when I was 21.

	Sometimes, college can work against you. I learned to make oil because I was a good mechanic and knew I needed a better oil. By working and learning how to make oil on my own, I was able to think outside the box. If I had gone to school, I would have never done what I’ve done.

How did you get into the trucking business?

	I was working in a factory—the night shift—and driving a dump truck by day. I already had kids and I didn’t want to spend the rest of my life in a factory. I wanted to have my own business.

	I figured I had to get some money ahead to do it. I was fascinated with trucks and trucking and wanted to see the country. I saved up enough money to live for a few months so I could transition into the trucking company and went to work for Mayflower.

	I bought a truck, went through training, and went out and made a lot more money than they thought I could. I was working night and day and living cheap. Unfortunately, my first wife blew the money as fast as it came in. In two or three years, I thought I’d be able to save enough money, sell the truck, and start a gas station or something like that. It never happened.

	I had to divorce [my first wife] and start life over again. And I later ended up with a fleet of trucks.

What’s the average work day for Forrest Lucas?

	I still work 12 hours a day. I’m on call all the time. And virtually every weekend, I’m at a sporting event or some other kind of event our company is involved in—either we’re sponsoring it or hosting something. The company is still growing and there’s so many things I can do [that] I can’t find anyone else who can do.

In a few sentences, what’s your business philosophy?

	Be absolutely honest with everybody. People like doing business with somebody they can trust.

	Don’t be in debt. Work yourself to death and get cash in your pocket. When you have cash, that’s when the bargains come along. And treat your people the way you want to be treated. Share the good will with them … and you’ll have good people.

What’s your management style?

	I try to run the whole company like a big team. There aren’t a lot of levels of bosses, but if you get out of line, you’ll find you have a boss. I don’t have a temper, and I’m pretty laid-back. But when it comes down to it, I am the top boss here.

Who are your role models, business or personal?

	I only had one sports hero and that’s Larry Bird. I liked the way he lived his life. He made it to the top and is still a really nice guy. As far as business, I don’t follow anybody. I do my own thing.

What’s your politics?

	I’m a Republican.

What are your thoughts on Donald Trump as a presidential candidate?

	He certainly is a surprise.

	He’s saying a lot of things a lot of people want to hear. A lot of people are discouraged with the House and Senate [members] for letting the president get by with all the things he’s gotten away with. They want a change.

	What [Trump is] doing is a technique I’ve never before seen.

Would you be comfortable with Trump getting the Republican nomination?

	It would be like when Obama got elected. I’d say, “I don’t really like it, but I have no choice and I’ll have to make the best of it.”

	I could never have been more disappointed with any one human being than I have been with [Obama]. There are a lot of other potential disappointers out there, so I do hope we can get this straightened out. It is a bit of a problem because [Trump] has such a toehold.

Do you think a guy with a business background, but not a political one, can make a good president?

	Absolutely. I think a good person with good business sense could come in there and surround himself with good people.

Where did you take your last vacation?

	I’ve never been on a vacation. No, never have.•
