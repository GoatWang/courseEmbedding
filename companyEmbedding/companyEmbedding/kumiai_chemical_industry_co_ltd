Agricultural Chemicals

Confronted by a food crisis of global proportions, current attitudes toward existing food reserves and efforts to increase production are under question. In this context, agricultural chemicals are universally recognized as being essential to the future of the agricultural industry. With labor savings as well as a host of other benefits, agricultural chemicals are contributing significantly to the stability of agricultural production. Accordingly, research and development into the agricultural chemical field is attracting wide and keen interest.

Kumiai Chemical plays a significant role in this important effort, always putting the safety of foods and the environment first in the development of agricultural chemicals.
