What are analysts saying about Air Products and Chemicals stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Air Products and Chemicals stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Air Products’ second-quarter fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Sales rose by double-digits year over year, and beat expectations. Air Products has a strong project backlog and benefits from cost-reduction measures and a diverse customer base. Moreover, acquisitions, strategic investments and new business deals are expected to continue to support results in fiscal 2017. However, the company’s industrial gases business in the EMEA region is seeing pressure from a weak operating environment. The company is also seeing lower volumes in Latin America due to weak demand. Moreover, volumes in packaged gases continue to be weak while LNG sales remain under pressure due to low project activity. The company is also exposed to currency headwinds." (5/1/2017)
2. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "KMI will hold an Analyst Conference in Houston on Jan. 25th to review operations, discuss strategic initiatives, and profile financial guidance. We expect mgmt to detail 2017 financial projections, expanding upon preliminary estimates it offered in December. Moreover, we anticipate significant discussion of its $12B project backlog and efforts to potentially partner on certain assets and/or otherwise work to minimize risk while extracting value. 2017 guidance. On Dec. 5th, KMI initiated 2017 adjusted EBITDA & DCF guidance of ~ $7.2B and ~$4.46B, respectively, and noted plans to deploy ~$3.2B on growth initiatives with anticipated YE leverage of ~5.4x (debt/EBITDA). As is its historic custom, we expect mgmt to greatly expand upon this preliminary outlook at its Analyst Conference and anticipate segment-specific forecasts will be forthcoming. As KMI remains focused on achieving leverage targets consistent with a return to dividend growth, we believe investors will explore mgmt’s expectations for big-ticket projects, legacy asset declines, and ongoing JV initiatives."

What are analysts saying about Air Products and Chemicals stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Air Products and Chemicals stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Air Products’ second-quarter fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Sales rose by double-digits year over year, and beat expectations. Air Products has a strong project backlog and benefits from cost-reduction measures and a diverse customer base. Moreover, acquisitions, strategic investments and new business deals are expected to continue to support results in fiscal 2017. However, the company’s industrial gases business in the EMEA region is seeing pressure from a weak operating environment. The company is also seeing lower volumes in Latin America due to weak demand. Moreover, volumes in packaged gases continue to be weak while LNG sales remain under pressure due to low project activity. The company is also exposed to currency headwinds." (5/1/2017)
2. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "KMI will hold an Analyst Conference in Houston on Jan. 25th to review operations, discuss strategic initiatives, and profile financial guidance. We expect mgmt to detail 2017 financial projections, expanding upon preliminary estimates it offered in December. Moreover, we anticipate significant discussion of its $12B project backlog and efforts to potentially partner on certain assets and/or otherwise work to minimize risk while extracting value. 2017 guidance. On Dec. 5th, KMI initiated 2017 adjusted EBITDA & DCF guidance of ~ $7.2B and ~$4.46B, respectively, and noted plans to deploy ~$3.2B on growth initiatives with anticipated YE leverage of ~5.4x (debt/EBITDA). As is its historic custom, we expect mgmt to greatly expand upon this preliminary outlook at its Analyst Conference and anticipate segment-specific forecasts will be forthcoming. As KMI remains focused on achieving leverage targets consistent with a return to dividend growth, we believe investors will explore mgmt’s expectations for big-ticket projects, legacy asset declines, and ongoing JV initiatives."
