Beneath the Ink, which adds enhancements to eBooks, entered the Shark Tank on April 17th. Heavy interviewed co-founder and CEO Sherisse Hawkins.

1. The Education & Corporate World Merged With a Startup  
(ABC)
Hawkins started the company with Alex Milewski. At the time, Hawkins had been working in corporate America, at Disney and then Time-Warner Cable. Milewski was studying at the University of Colorado.
Hawkins refers to them as ‘unlikely co-founders’ in the video above, but the pairing has worked for them. When asked what they have learned from one another, Hawkins said, “The power of having diversity of thought on a team – it’s not only interesting and fun we solve problems better due to our broad experience base.”
Running a startup has challenges, one of which Hawkins described as “letting go of the security of a ‘normal job.'” In the beginning, Milewski wrote the software, but now they have a bigger team to work on that aspect.

2. The Links Are Called Binks  


Thrilled to announce that @JohnShors Beneath a Marble Sky is now available with Binks!  http://t.co/SBOX89mfi9 pic.twitter.com/0H8AjyzlS7
— beneaththeink (@gobeneaththeink) April 30, 2014



The Beneath the Ink links are called Binks. The words that are highlighted in gold on the page are connections to more information. Without an internet connection or even leaving the page, you can find enhancements like pictures, maps, videos and character descriptions. There are no external links or apps needed.
When asked what has been an interesting Bink to work on, she answered, “We did a panoramic image of the Taj Mahal for John Shor’s novel Beneath A Marble Sky. It’s available in the ibooks version, and it’s amazing.”

3. ‘Shark Tank’ Was the ‘Most High Pressure’ Pitch They’ve Ever Done  
 
At first, Hawkins wasn’t sure if they should apply to the reality show. In fact, the application sat on her desk- printed out- until very near the deadline. 
 

 
Although the partners are used to pitching their product, the Tank was unlike anything they had ever done before. “Pitching is part of the process however, just usually not on TV and with five high powered Sharks,” she said. 
Watch one of their five-minute pitches in the video above.

4. Boulder Helped Them Out   
(BeneaththeInk.com)
The company is based in Boulder, Colorado and the state was instrumental in the company’s early success. According to the Daily Camera, they participated in CU’s New Venture Challenge, a ‘cross-campus entrepreneurship championship’ at the University of Colorado Boulder. This exposure helped them raise $300,000. 
 

 
They also got $250,000 from The Advanced Industries Accelerator Program, which is a part of the Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade. On their website, it describes the mission of the program as being to “promote growth and sustainability in Colorado’s 7 advanced industries by helping drive innovation, accelerate commercialization, encourage public-private partnerships, increase access to early stage capital and create a strong ecosystem that increases the state’s global competitiveness.”

5. They’re Launching a New Product in May   
When asked what the company’s future plans were, Hawkins responded, “Grow grow grow!”
They are launching a new product on May 15th. Hawkins asks anyone interested to visit their website to ‘see a sneak peek or even become an early adopter/Beta user.’

The author – reader connection just got even stronger. 
Using Beneath the Ink technology, it’s easy for authors to embed additional content for readers to access when they choose. These enhancements are called Binks. Each Bink gives readers more insight into the characters, places, concepts, and words that pique their curiosity — without ever leaving their page.
Authors can connect with readers by sharing additional multimedia content unobtrusively. Binks give authors greater creative control and endless ways to entice and delight their audiences.
Literary Agents can offer their clients Beneath the Ink technology, providing an additional way to set their projects apart from the status quo. Binks make this possible.
Publishers can use Beneath the Ink technology to promote an author’s current and upcoming titles from within each ebook. Binks may include the author’s story behind the story, identify key characters who appear in related works, and promote complimentary content.
Corporations can embed Binks in their business and marketing materials. Binks effectively illuminate key words, phrases, concepts, data and product descriptions in investor, consumer, and internal facing e-documents.
Your ebooks should be much more than just “print under glass”. Binks change everything. 
Ready to start enhancing your eBook? See a sample and contact the Beneath the Ink team at www.BeneathTheInk.com.

FAQs
Is it a good idea to put my Table of contents at the end of my eBook?
Some people do this to increase the size of the free samples automatically generated by the eBook retailers. However, the Kindle and other devices will re-set the “last read location” to the end of the book if you have your Table of Contents there, so we normally recommend against that practice.
What is the difference between HTML5 and XHTML5?
HTML5 is the latest version of the HTML standard used on the Web and in eBooks. XHTML5 is a stricter and cleaner version of HTML5, with rules from XML imposed on the code. For example, when a tag is opened it has to be closed, and all of the tags have to be properly nested. XHTML5 allows the code to be more easily interpreted by the display engine, and it keeps the code more consistent and easier to edit.
I have heard you can’t use color in eBooks. Is that correct?
No, that is absolutely incorrect. eBooks look great with color, and we highly recommend using color images and even colored text (within reason) in your eBook files. Some devices have grayscale eInk screens, so the color will not show up on those devices. However, the color will be in the file, and it will work on all of the color devices. We do recommend you test colored text on a device with an eInk screen and ensure that the text will not be too light to read.
Do you need to have a separate ISBN for each version of the eBook for different companies?
Technically, yes. See an extended answer on our ISBNs page.
What is KindleGen?
KindleGen is Amazon’s eBook creation/compiling program. It is used on the KDP website to auto-convert files uploaded into the Kindle store, and it is also integrated into the Kindle Previewer program to handle the conversion of non-Kindle files loaded in that program. You can download KindleGen and get access to other Kindle creation information at amazon.com/kindlepublishing.
What is a fixed layout eBook?
Fixed Layout eBooks are HTML-based eBook files that are usually designed to match the layout of a print book. The key difference between fixed layout files and reflowable files is that reflowable eBooks allow the reader to have more control over the reading experience, such as changing the font size, background color, etc. For more information, please see our Fixed Layout Children’s and Non-Fiction pages.
Does Amazon sell HTML files or only Kindle?
Amazon only sells eBooks in the Kindle format, but that format, just like ePub, is built using HTML and CSS files.
How is fixed layout different from a pdf of the book?
Fixed layout eBooks are built using HTML, so they have more functionality than PDF files. For example, the narration overlay functionality used in many children’s eBooks is not possible in PDF files. In addition, none of the eBook retailers sell PDFs, so fixed layout eBook files offer the best sales opportunities.
A university librarian told me they are not acquiring any Kindle books but only HTML5/ePub. Have you found that to be common with other libraries? I know our local public library does buy Kindle books.
Libraries acquire their eBooks from services like 3M and Overdrive. These services sometimes offer an option for Kindle checkouts, but typically they are limited to ePub files because of the more common use of the Adobe DRM.
Has the Kindle format gotten any more sophisticated in how it handles tables or floating images?
Yes, Amazon’s Kindle Format 8 has support for many great design features, including floating images, tables, color text, embedded fonts, and more.
How are page numbers handled in an eBook?
Print book page numbers are included in the HTML code of both the Kindle and ePub formats as anchors. They are also listed in the PageList section of the NCX or Navigation file. The PageList is used by some reading systems (like the Kindle and iBooks) to show the reader the print page numbers of the book as they read.
How are page headers created in eBook files?
The different reading systems control what shows up in the header of your eBook. Most will display the title of the book, and some will also display the author name. That text cannot currently be set to display the chapter name or other information about where the reader is currently reading in the text.
How do eBooks handle hyphenation of long words?
Some eBook reading systems will apply hyphenation to longer words to make the text better fit on the screen. This is typically controlled by the reading system, and will change depending on the font size and other settings the reader has set on their device.
What about protecting the file?
eBook file protection is called Digital Rights Management (DRM). Please see our DRM page for information on how it works and suggestions on how to use it.
Can I sell my eBooks on my own website?
Yes! You are certainly able to sell your eBooks on your own website. For more information, please see this page.
