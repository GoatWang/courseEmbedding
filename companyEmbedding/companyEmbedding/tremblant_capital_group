Firm Overview

Tremblant Capital (“Tremblant”) is a global asset management firm founded in 2001 by Brett Barakett.  Mr. Barakett leads a team of experienced Sector Portfolio Managers (“Sector PMs”) who conduct deep fundamental research to uncover investments that are trading at a material dislocation from fair value.  Key to Tremblant’s investment approach is an expertise in identifying and evaluating consequential changes, as they are often the catalyst for compelling opportunities.
For more than 15 years, Tremblant has invested across a range of market environments, honing its unique process and developing a cohesive team of investment professionals trained in Tremblant’s methodology.  All of the Sector PMs have spent at least ten years working with Mr. Barakett, and bring a nuanced understanding of their areas of specialization to the firm.  We believe that a collaborative culture, focused sector expertise, and a proven, repeatable process provides a sustainable competitive advantage.
Tremblant offers several equity strategies and managed accounts to accommodate the portfolio needs of its investors. Tremblant is registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as a Registered Investment Adviser and is a Qualified Professional Asset Manager under ERISA.

Abstract
Brett Barakett, CEO and founder of Tremblant Capital Group, a New York-based hedge fund, must decide what to do with his fund's position in Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, which has dropped in value by more than 40 percent in recent months. Tremblant is a hedge fund that specializes in forecasting consumer behavioral change, and capitalizes on the disconnect between stock prices and consumer behavior. In the case of Green Mountain Coffee, many other sophisticated investors have taken short positions in the stock, leading Barakett to question whether his fund had the right trade thesis.

The Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet as a Financial-Stability Tool
Robin Greenwood, Samuel Gregory Hanson and Jeremy C. Stein
We argue that the Federal Reserve should use its balance sheet to help reduce a key threat to financial stability: the tendency for private-sector financial intermediaries to engage in excessive amounts of maturity transformation—i.e., to finance risky assets using dangerously large volumes of runnable short-term liabilities. Specifically, we make the case that the Fed can complement its regulatory efforts on the financial-stability front by maintaining a relatively large balance sheet, even when policy rates have moved well away from the zero lower bound (ZLB). In so doing, it can help ensure that there is an ample supply of government-provided safe short-term claims—e.g., interest-bearing reserves and reverse repurchase agreements (RRP). By expanding the overall supply of safe short-term claims, the Fed can weaken the market-based incentives for private sector intermediaries to issue too many of their own short-term liabilities. And crucially, we argue that the Fed can crowd out private-sector maturity transformation in this way without compromising the ability of conventional monetary policy to focus on its traditional dual mandate of promoting maximum employment and stable prices.
