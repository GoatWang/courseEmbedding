High Quality Production
With annual live U.S farm-raised catfish production nearing 37 million pounds, Guidry’s Catfish, Inc. is large enough to carry a full line of catfish items for the foodservice industry as well as a large assortment of retail-ready items. We have become experts at producing some of the best tasting catfish on the market. Guidry’s Catfish, Inc. processes only select, U.S. Farm -raised catfish that have been fed with specially formulated grain pellets – which float on top of the water. Because the catfish eat the floating grain and are not feeding from the lower section of the pond, they have a mild and sweet flavor.
Guidry’s IQF (Individually Quick Frozen) catfish products are stored in an on-site, 20,000 square foot, climate-controlled warehouse. The temperature, which is monitored daily,  in our cold storage facility is kept below freezing to preserve flavor and quality. Guidry’s frozen inventory is regularly inspected and rotated to ensure only the freshest and most recent production lots are on hand at all times.
 
 
 
 



Large Variety of Items
Guidry’s Catfish, Inc. has a large variety of premium catfish items to choose from including fillets, nuggets, whole dressed,  and whole.  We also process splits and strips, which are specialty cuts made from our premium catfish fillets.   Try our products fresh, IQF (Individually Quick Frozen), Breaded and or marinated.  Guidry’s home-style breaded items are prepared with a Guidry family recipe which is why they are so delicious and crispy. It’s no wonder they are such a hot selling item.. The product literally sells itself through word of mouth!
Guidry’s offers a variety of retail items which include 3 and 4lb boxes as well as 2 and 3 lb. bags. This provides a larger assortment of choices on products and at the same time tailors to both larger families as well smaller households.
Guidry’s home-style  Jalapeno and Onion hushpuppies are made with premium ingredients so they always cook up crispy and flavorful.   Guidry’s mouth-watering hushpuppies come packed for foodservice and  retail applications.
Guidry’s new fish fry is our own family recipe.  Its so good we just had to share it.  Made with a secret blend of cornmeal and spices, we guarantee your catfish will cook up crispy and light every time.!
 
 
 



 
 
 





 

Carefully Selected
As well as having our own ponds, Guidry’s buys its carefully selected catfish from 40 of the industries most respected farmers who maintain only the highest level of quality and adhere to the stringent HACCP guidelines.
