For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

The loans were contributed to the trust by German American Capital Corporation and Citigroup Global Markets Realty Corp.Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, including site inspections on 79.5% of the properties by balance and asset summary reviews and cash flow analysis of 90.5% of the pool.KEY RATING DRIVERSLow Fitch Leverage: The transaction has significantly lower leverage than other recent Fitch-rated transactions. The pool's weighted average (WA) Fitch DSCR of 1.25x is better than both the YTD 2016 average of 1.16x and the 2015 average of 1.18x. The pool's WA Fitch LTV of 95.5% is better than both the YTD 2016 average of 107.5% and the 2015 average of 109.3%. Excluding the credit opinion loans (27.7% of the pool), the Fitch DSCR and LTV are 1.17x and 108.9%, respectively.Investment-Grade Credit Opinion Loans: Four of the 10 largest loans in the pool, representing 27.7%, have investment-grade credit opinions, this is well above the YTD 2016 average of 5.0% credit opinion loans. 10 Hudson Yards (9.2% of the pool) is the largest loan in the pool and has an investment-grade credit opinion of 'BBBsf*' on a stand-alone basis. Westfield San Francisco Centre (8.5%), the third largest loan in the pool, has an investment-grade credit opinion of 'Asf*' on a stand-alone basis. Further, Gas Company Tower (5.7%) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (4.3%) have investment grade credit opinions of 'Asf*' and 'BBB-sf*', respectively. The implied credit enhancement levels for the conduit portion of the transaction for 'AAAsf' and 'BBB-sf' are 25.875% and 8.750%, respectively.High Pool Concentration: The pool is more concentrated than other recent Fitch-rated multiborrower transactions. The top 10 loans comprise 66.6% of the pool, which is greater the YTD 2016 average of 54.6% and the 2015 average of 49.3%. The pool's loan concentration index (LCI) of 543 is above the YTD 2016 average of 420 and the 2015 average of 367.RATING SENSITIVITIESFor this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 9% below the most recent year's net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a full-year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing during this period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level NCF could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted loans and in potential rating actions on the certificates.Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to CD 2016-CD1 certificates and found that the transaction displays average sensitivity to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'Asf' could result. In a more severe scenario, in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB+sf' could result. The presale report includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities on page 12.Read MoreDUE DILIGENCE USAGEFitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from KPMG, LLP. The third-party due diligence information was provided on Form ABS Due Diligence-15E and focused on a comparison and re-computation of certain characteristics with respect to each of the mortgage loans. Fitch considered this information in its analysis and the findings did not have an impact on the analysis.

      a)Privately placed pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      b)Notional amount and interest-only.
    

      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of Aug. 2, 2016.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 32 loans secured by 58 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of $703,219,986 as of 
      the cut-off date. The loans were contributed to the trust by German 
      American Capital Corporation and Citigroup Global Markets Realty Corp.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 79.5% of the properties by balance and 
      asset summary reviews and cash flow analysis of 90.5% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Low Fitch Leverage: The transaction has significantly lower leverage 
      than other recent Fitch-rated transactions. The pool's weighted average 
      (WA) Fitch DSCR of 1.25x is better than both the YTD 2016 average of 
      1.16x and the 2015 average of 1.18x. The pool's WA Fitch LTV of 95.5% is 
      better than both the YTD 2016 average of 107.5% and the 2015 average of 
      109.3%. Excluding the credit opinion loans (27.7% of the pool), the 
      Fitch DSCR and LTV are 1.17x and 108.9%, respectively.
    

      Investment-Grade Credit Opinion Loans: Four of the 10 largest loans in 
      the pool, representing 27.7%, have investment-grade credit opinions, 
      this is well above the YTD 2016 average of 5.0% credit opinion loans. 10 
      Hudson Yards (9.2% of the pool) is the largest loan in the pool and has 
      an investment-grade credit opinion of 'BBBsf*' on a stand-alone basis. 
      Westfield San Francisco Centre (8.5%), the third largest loan in the 
      pool, has an investment-grade credit opinion of 'Asf*' on a stand-alone 
      basis. Further, Gas Company Tower (5.7%) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals 
      (4.3%) have investment grade credit opinions of 'Asf*' and 'BBB-sf*', 
      respectively. The implied credit enhancement levels for the conduit 
      portion of the transaction for 'AAAsf' and 'BBB-sf' are 25.875% and 
      8.750%, respectively.
    

      High Pool Concentration: The pool is more concentrated than other recent 
      Fitch-rated multiborrower transactions. The top 10 loans comprise 66.6% 
      of the pool, which is greater the YTD 2016 average of 54.6% and the 2015 
      average of 49.3%. The pool's loan concentration index (LCI) of 543 is 
      above the YTD 2016 average of 420 and the 2015 average of 367.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 9% below the most 
      recent year's net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a 
      full-year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during this period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level 
      NCF could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted 
      loans and in potential rating actions on the certificates.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to CD 2016-CD1 
      certificates and found that the transaction displays average sensitivity 
      to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF declined a 
      further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' 
      certificates to 'Asf' could result. In a more severe scenario, in which 
      NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB+sf' could result. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on page 12.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from KPMG, 
      LLP. The third-party due diligence information was provided on Form ABS 
      Due Diligence-15E and focused on a comparison and re-computation of 
      certain characteristics with respect to each of the mortgage loans. 
      Fitch considered this information in its analysis and the findings did 
      not have an impact on the analysis. A copy of the ABS Due Diligence 
      Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this transaction may be 
      obtained through the link contained on the bottom of the related rating 
      action commentary.

      The following classes are not expected to be rated:
    

      --$23,733,985ab class X-F;
    

      --$23,733,985a class G.
    

      a)Privately placed pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      b)Notional amount and interest-only.
    

      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of Aug. 2, 2016.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 32 loans secured by 58 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of $703,219,986 as of 
      the cut-off date. The loans were contributed to the trust by German 
      American Capital Corporation and Citigroup Global Markets Realty Corp.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 79.5% of the properties by balance and 
      asset summary reviews and cash flow analysis of 90.5% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Low Fitch Leverage: The transaction has significantly lower leverage 
      than other recent Fitch-rated transactions. The pool's weighted average 
      (WA) Fitch DSCR of 1.25x is better than both the YTD 2016 average of 
      1.16x and the 2015 average of 1.18x. The pool's WA Fitch LTV of 95.5% is 
      better than both the YTD 2016 average of 107.5% and the 2015 average of 
      109.3%. Excluding the credit opinion loans (27.7% of the pool), the 
      Fitch DSCR and LTV are 1.17x and 108.9%, respectively.
    

      Investment-Grade Credit Opinion Loans: Four of the 10 largest loans in 
      the pool, representing 27.7%, have investment-grade credit opinions, 
      this is well above the YTD 2016 average of 5.0% credit opinion loans. 10 
      Hudson Yards (9.2% of the pool) is the largest loan in the pool and has 
      an investment-grade credit opinion of 'BBBsf*' on a stand-alone basis. 
      Westfield San Francisco Centre (8.5%), the third largest loan in the 
      pool, has an investment-grade credit opinion of 'Asf*' on a stand-alone 
      basis. Further, Gas Company Tower (5.7%) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals 
      (4.3%) have investment grade credit opinions of 'Asf*' and 'BBB-sf*', 
      respectively. The implied credit enhancement levels for the conduit 
      portion of the transaction for 'AAAsf' and 'BBB-sf' are 25.875% and 
      8.750%, respectively.
    

      High Pool Concentration: The pool is more concentrated than other recent 
      Fitch-rated multiborrower transactions. The top 10 loans comprise 66.6% 
      of the pool, which is greater the YTD 2016 average of 54.6% and the 2015 
      average of 49.3%. The pool's loan concentration index (LCI) of 543 is 
      above the YTD 2016 average of 420 and the 2015 average of 367.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 9% below the most 
      recent year's net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a 
      full-year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during this period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level 
      NCF could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted 
      loans and in potential rating actions on the certificates.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to CD 2016-CD1 
      certificates and found that the transaction displays average sensitivity 
      to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF declined a 
      further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' 
      certificates to 'Asf' could result. In a more severe scenario, in which 
      NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB+sf' could result. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on page 12.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from KPMG, 
      LLP. The third-party due diligence information was provided on Form ABS 
      Due Diligence-15E and focused on a comparison and re-computation of 
      certain characteristics with respect to each of the mortgage loans. 
      Fitch considered this information in its analysis and the findings did 
      not have an impact on the analysis. A copy of the ABS Due Diligence 
      Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this transaction may be 
      obtained through the link contained on the bottom of the related rating 
      action commentary.

The loans were contributed to the trust by German American Capital Corporation and Citigroup Global Markets Realty Corp.Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, including site inspections on 79.5% of the properties by balance and asset summary reviews and cash flow analysis of 90.5% of the pool.KEY RATING DRIVERSLow Fitch Leverage: The transaction has significantly lower leverage than other recent Fitch-rated transactions. The pool's weighted average (WA) Fitch DSCR of 1.25x is better than both the YTD 2016 average of 1.16x and the 2015 average of 1.18x. The pool's WA Fitch LTV of 95.5% is better than both the YTD 2016 average of 107.5% and the 2015 average of 109.3%. Excluding the credit opinion loans (27.7% of the pool), the Fitch DSCR and LTV are 1.17x and 108.9%, respectively.Investment-Grade Credit Opinion Loans: Four of the 10 largest loans in the pool, representing 27.7%, have investment-grade credit opinions, this is well above the YTD 2016 average of 5.0% credit opinion loans. 10 Hudson Yards (9.2% of the pool) is the largest loan in the pool and has an investment-grade credit opinion of 'BBBsf*' on a stand-alone basis. Westfield San Francisco Centre (8.5%), the third largest loan in the pool, has an investment-grade credit opinion of 'Asf*' on a stand-alone basis. Further, Gas Company Tower (5.7%) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (4.3%) have investment grade credit opinions of 'Asf*' and 'BBB-sf*', respectively. The implied credit enhancement levels for the conduit portion of the transaction for 'AAAsf' and 'BBB-sf' are 25.875% and 8.750%, respectively.High Pool Concentration: The pool is more concentrated than other recent Fitch-rated multiborrower transactions. The top 10 loans comprise 66.6% of the pool, which is greater the YTD 2016 average of 54.6% and the 2015 average of 49.3%. The pool's loan concentration index (LCI) of 543 is above the YTD 2016 average of 420 and the 2015 average of 367.RATING SENSITIVITIESFor this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 9% below the most recent year's net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a full-year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing during this period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level NCF could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted loans and in potential rating actions on the certificates.Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to CD 2016-CD1 certificates and found that the transaction displays average sensitivity to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'Asf' could result. In a more severe scenario, in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB+sf' could result. The presale report includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities on page 12.Read MoreUSE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10Fitch was provided with Form ABS Due Diligence-15E (Form 15') as prepared by KPMG, LLP. The third-party due diligence described in Form 15E focused on a comparison and re-computation of certain characteristics with respect to each of the mortgage loans. Fitch considered this information in its analysis and it did not have an effect on Fitch's analysis or conclusions.Additional information is available at www.fitchratings.com.Applicable CriteriaCounterparty Criteria for Structured Finance and Covered Bonds (pub. 18 Jul 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/884963Criteria for Analyzing Large Loans in U.S. Commercial Mortgage Transactions (pub. 18 Aug 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/885802Criteria for Analyzing Multiborrower U.S. and Canadian Commercial Mortgage Transactions (pub. 01 Jul 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/882237Criteria for Rating Caps and Limitations in Global Structured Finance Transactions (pub. 16 Jun 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/882401Global Structured Finance Rating Criteria (pub. 27 Jun 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/883130Rating Criteria for Structured Finance Servicers (pub. 01 Jul 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/884140Rating Criteria for U.S. Commercial Mortgage Servicers (pub. 14 Feb 2014)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/735382U.S. and Canadian Fixed-Rate Multiborrower CMBS Surveillance and U.S. Re-REMIC Criteria (pub. 13 Nov 2015)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/873395Related ResearchCD 2016-CD1 Mortgage Trust -- Appendixhttps://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/886127Additional DisclosuresDodd-Frank Rating Information Disclosure Formhttps://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/press_releases/content/ridf_frame.cfm?pr_id=1010818ABS Due Diligence Form 15E 1https://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/press_releases/content/ridf15E_frame.cfm?pr_id=1010818&flm_nm=15e_1010818_1.pdfSolicitation Statushttps://www.fitchratings.com/gws/en/disclosure/solicitation?pr_id=1010818Endorsement Policyhttps://www.fitchratings.com/jsp/creditdesk/PolicyRegulation.faces?context=2&detail=31ALL FITCH CREDIT RATINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS.
