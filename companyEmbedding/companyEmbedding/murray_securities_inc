Why Repair?
By repairing your own household appliances and electronics, you are giving them a second chance and saving them from the landfill. You'll also reduce the amount of waste, power and gas it requires to manufacture and deliver new products.


 



							How to Locate Your Murray Model Number						



							If you’re reading this, you probably need some help finding the model number on your Murray product. Murray prints their model number on a sticker or etched plate. So you’ll want to start by trying to find that. If you've already found that, you’re ready to take your model number and start ordering parts. If not, check out some of our suggestions on finding the nameplate below:

If you have a Murray riding lawnmower, then look under the seat for the nameplate. 

If you have a walk-behind mower, check the mower’s deck, usually they place the nameplate in the center of it.

Our Customer Service team is always happy to help you search for your model number, so feel free to call us at (866) 802-6383 if you have trouble finding your tool’s information.







							Need a Hand with Your Murray Repair?						

							Our great relationship with Murray means that you’ll get the best quality OEM parts from our warehouse and the best expert advice from our technicians. So if you need a little help replacing the lawn mower blade on your Murray 30503x11A or repairing an auger shaft on a Murray 1694997, we have you covered with both a big stock of replacement parts and expert advice. 

We encourage visitors to browse our parts lists and Repair Forum to see what we can offer you. We’re confident that with our resources, we can help you through even the toughest situation.

Securities Class Action Lawsuits, Stock Lawsuits, Securities Fraud Lawsuits

Securities fraud lawsuits and stock lawsuits have been filed against numerous financial firms, stockbrokers, financial advisers and companies alleging fraud or other misconduct. These allegations include claims that the issuers of securities have misled investors regarding the value of their investments, that stockbrokers or financial advisers acted improperly in managing clients' accounts or that companies that offer employee stock options or benefits plans failed to act in the best interests of plan participants. In some cases, investors can file securities class action lawsuits; in other cases, investors must file an arbitration if they hope to recover their losses.

FREE CASE EVALUATION

			Send your securities claim to a Lawyer who will review your claim at NO COST or obligation.


Securities and Stock Fraud
Stock fraud occurs when the issuer of the security makes false statements about the company's status or fails to disclose important facts that may affect stock value, causing investors to buy or sell stocks under false pretenses. Claims can be brought against the issuer of the security, i.e. the public company, the company's officers, directors or others involved in the violation, including stockbrokers, underwriter or auditors.

Exchange Traded Funds

Companies that issued Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) face lawsuits alleging that they did not adequately disclose the risks associated with those ETFs in their prospectus and registration filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In June, 2009, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) issued a regulatory warning regarding leveraged and inverse ETFs, noting that the ETFs are typically not suitable for retail investors who planned to hold them for more than one trading session.

Auction Rate Securities

Investors who put their money in Auction Rate Securities (ARS) have filed lawsuits alleging that they were told the securities were a safe, liquid investment. However, when the ARS market was frozen, many investors found they could not sell their Auction Rate Securities. Some companies have settled claims with clients and agreed to purchase back the Auction Rate Securities.  

Stockbroker Fraud and Stockbroker Arbitration
There are a number of ways a Stockbroker or Financial Advisor can break laws surrounding investment practices. Stockbroker fraud or negligence can include misrepresenting stocks or the risks associated with those investments, recommending unsuitable stocks, charging excessive transaction fees or failing to diversify an investor's portfolio. It is a stockbroker's responsibility to consider his client's best interest in all investment transactions.

Clients who believe their stockbroker has acted improperly may be able to file an arbitration against the broker and, possibly, the financial firm the broker works for. 

Stock Options and ERISA Complaints
ERISA (Employee Retirement Income Security Act) regulates employee benefit and pension plans, both of which can be tied into stock options. Employees and retired employees can file a lawsuit against a company and/or its officers for breaching fiduciary responsibilities and putting stock options and pension plans at risk.

Issues involved in ERISA include wrongfully canceling or breaching employee stock options, denying an employee rights granted by a Stock Option Agreement, misrepresenting the value of the stock, failing to act in the best interests of stock option plans, failing to act prudently in conducting and managing investments or lying about the number of options employees will be given. Furthermore, it is a violation of ERISA for an employer to take deductions from an employee's paycheck for benefits but then not make those payments into the benefits plan.

Under ERISA, it is illegal for an employer to "discharge, fine, suspend, expel, discipline, or discriminate against a participant or beneficiary for exercising any right to which he is entitled under the provisions of an employee benefit plan…" Claims have been made alleging that employees were terminated or discriminated against when the employer suspected that the employee was about to make a claim under a benefits plan. In such situations, the employee must prove that the action taken against him was done so primarily to prevent him from accessing benefits and not that the loss of benefits was simply a consequence of the action taken.

Companies that have had ERISA complaints filed against them include YRC Worldwide Inc (concerning the Yellow Freight Pension Plan), Motorola and Sterling Financial Corporation.
