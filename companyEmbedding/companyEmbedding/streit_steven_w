Scott Reckard, Los Angeles Times


Steven W. Streit thought teenagers would use his prepaid debit cards for… (Green Dot Corp. )The gig: Steven W. Streit is founder and chief executive of Monrovia-based Green Dot Corp., the nation's largest provider of prepaid debit cards. Customers, mostly people without bank accounts, buy the cards at retail outlets, load them with cash or direct-deposit paychecks and use them like bank-issued plastic. They are branded under the Green Dot name and also branded for Wal-Mart Stores. Past life: Streit was a disc jockey (Streiter with the Heater; the Ayatollah of Rock 'n' Rolla) and radio programming executive. He was left jobless with a sizable golden parachute when Clear Channel took over AMFM Inc., where he was a vice president, in 1999. "I like going to cities like Washington, D.C., or Orlando, [Fla.,] where stations where I worked are still thriving with the same formats I developed. A highlight on the fun scale was filling in for ['American Top 40' host] Casey Kasem in the mid-'90s. Casey Kasem was to music radio what Walter Cronkite was to TV news." Paying his dues: Streit nearly exhausted his savings from his radio career getting Green Dot started. He thought teenagers would use his cards for online purchases. But when drugstore chain Rite Aid became the first big retailer to sell the cards, credit-challenged adults proved to be the main buyers. Personal: Streit, 49, who is divorced, lives in Pasadena and has two sons and four daughters, all grown. He is preparing for the wedding of his eldest daughter, who is 24. Does an early-morning fitness regime with weights and cardiovascular exercise. Currently reading biography of Steve Jobs. Started a foundation, Patti's Way, that helps single mothers pay off debts. On career-hopping: "What I have in common with other people who have switched businesses in a hurry is a highly curious mind. Maybe I have a plumber cleaning the main drain out to the street from my house. I'll go out hang out with him and spend 45 minutes finding out about clay pipes and all. And by the end of that 45 minutes I'll be able to have an intelligent conversation with someone else who is in the business." On card costs: Green Dot customers pay on average $6.50 a month in total fees, Streit says. "That is fractional for what the average customer pays for checking at the bank, where one bounced check or overdraft costs you far more — $35 a lot of the time. I know many people use big banks and never pay a fee. But my average customer is a single mom with a couple of kids, trying to make ends meet. People like that are never going to have that $1,500 [minimum balance] just hanging out there at all times to avoid the monthly charge at the bank. And at Green Dot you can't overdraft." Avoid confusion: "I like easy things, basic things. Even back in radio I liked that. I would launch a station with a new format — say easy listening. And I'd name it Easy 105. Or Rock 104. Or Country 103.... I think the consumer's mind likes simplicity. If you have to have an owners manual, you messed up." On using his own product: "I use it on a daily basis at Starbucks, at the grocery store, for dry cleaning. If I'm shopping online to buy a product, I'll use it for that too. I don't use it for corporate expenses, and I wouldn't use it for large-ticket items — if I were booking a vacation to Europe, it wouldn't be great. But for all regular bill-paying and most of the daily things in my life, I use the debit card." On banks: I'm not on the bank-bashing bandwagon. No one tool fits all. If you're making 80 grand, 90 grand or 100 grand a year and you're meticulous at balancing your bank book and you need to see a teller at a branch, then a bank may be perfect. If you make less than that and have challenges at keeping from going below the minimum [balance] — and that's half the country — then Green Dot's a great product for you. For Americans making less than $75,000, and especially less than $50,000, this is a product with a lot of utility. The median income in this country is $48,000 and change — that's a market opportunity of more than half the country." scott.reckard@latimes.com

Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Dara, and welcome, everyone, to our second quarter earnings call. I'm pleased to report that Q2 was another strong quarter for Green Dot, delivering results ahead of our expectations on both the top- and bottom-line. Total GAAP operating revenue came it at $173.5 million versus our expectation of $168 million, adjusted EBITDA including $7.2 million of unusual and incremental launch expenses associated with the roll-out of our new suite of prepaid products was $32.4 million versus our expectation of $28 million.
Non-GAAP EPS including those incremental launch expenses were $0.27 versus our expectation of $0.21. Revenue growth came from all our product lines across the company, including prepaid cards, GoBank checking accounts, cash transfers, and tax refund processing. But without question, the big story of the quarter is the acceleration of our core prepaid card business where per active card metrics accelerated to new highs across most of the KPIs we track. For example, on a year-over-year basis, average revenue per active card was up 13%, purchase volume per active was up 13%, interchange revenue per active card was up 11%, direct deposit penetration was up 13%, and total GDV per active card was up 17%, the number of reloads or cash transfers per active card was up 5%, and the revenue we earn on each of those transactions was up 4%. A good high level way to think of it is that even though our active card base was down 11% year-over-year, the revenue from the Account Services segment was up slightly, which we believe is a pretty amazing statistic and indicative that the improvement and features we've deployed to our suite of new and existing products is helping to drive engagement and usage of our products. We believe we are doing a better job of pleasing our customers.

As you know, we've laid out a six-step plan to drive growth and deliver at least $1.75 in non-GAAP EPS in 2017. And I'd like to update you on each of those initiatives and those steps and discuss how they contributed to our performance during the second quarter.
Step one on our six-step plan is to launch new more appealing products with materially better unit economics at all 100,000 retailers. So on this step, which is our card business, the key headline for the quarter is at both our new card products and our legacy card products are contributing unit economics at historic highs. Our overall portfolio is a blend of all the new cards, so over time our portfolio shifts towards more new cards with the new economics, but today the portfolio still dominated by the old cards. That why it's important to note that both old cards and new cards performed strongly in Q2.
Across the portfolio, average revenue per active was up 13%, as I mentioned earlier. We believe the stronger revenue per active card is the result of a few changes we've made to our business over the past few years. First, as you know, we discontinued our old MoneyPak product in February of 2015. This change made our products less attractive to certain segments of customers who used MoneyPak to reload their cards with cash. It also so happened that the segment of customers who relied on MoneyPak were mostly lower revenue generating customers and included many one-and-done customers where we made little money. As such, in the last 12 months, we believe we lost approximately 500,000 mostly low-value active accounts. As a result of these changes, our legacy card portfolio now contains a larger share of higher-revenue generating committed customers who are generating substantially higher revenue per active card.
In terms of our new suite of cards, they've been on sale at Walmart since late Q1 on a full chain basis and most other Green Dot brand retailers since early Q2. The new products are enjoying very strong customer usage metrics, like, first-time reloading, spend, and GDV.
Most importantly, as a result of the strong customer usage metrics and the materially better unit economics, they're generating high revenue per new card sold. Of course, prepaid cards, just like other types of subscription businesses, take time to mature as a portfolio. So we don't yet have enough historical data to know precisely how the portfolio of new cards will look with age, but so far signs are very encouraging, as you can tell in part from our results in Q2.
As mentioned earlier, one trend we're observing is that the new cards seem to attract fewer one-and-done buyers. Our cards are still far and away the bestsellers on the rack, but we seem to have peeled away some of the repeat one-and-done users that used to generate a lot of unit sales but not a lot of revenue and sometimes even negative margins on that revenue. So the cards we're selling today seem to be higher revenue producing and made up of more committed customers.
Another benefit of increasing revenue per active card is margin expansion. Incremental revenue on an active card drops to the bottom line at a very high contribution margin since the costs of supporting an active card are essentially the same regardless of the revenue that the card generates. This is one of the reasons why we're continuing to see margin expansion on a year-over-year basis after adjusting for the unusual launch expense of $7.2 million in the quarter and normalizing for the higher Walmart rev share increases which did not lap until May.
This is the trend we expect to continue as we work to drive increasing customer usage and increasing revenue per active card on top of an increasingly more efficient operating platform. So the summary here is that between the greatly improving revenue-generating characteristics of our legacy portfolio and the superior unit economics of our new card products, we are benefiting from material year-over-year organic growth in our prepaid card business lines.

Remember that, to stay flat for the year, we estimated we would need to generate an additional $35 million in revenue to make up for the MoneyPak related losses. The fact that we're actually up year-over-year in revenue, is an indication that we're on track with our expectations.
Now let's discuss the second step in our six-step plan and that's bringing back MoneyPak with new risk controls. To recap, several years ago, Green Dot and others with similar reload products saw dramatic rise in nefarious use of those products. We were unable to impede the fraud at that time so we took the difficult step of removing MoneyPak from store shelves. Concurrently, we've rolled out a new easier and more fraud resistant method of reloading cards called Reload @ the Register which, as the name implies, allows the customer to reload their card with a simple swipe of the card at the register. As you can tell from our reload volumes, this service has caught on quite well with consumers and it's now the standard by which how prepaid cards are reloaded throughout our industry.
Meanwhile, we were hard at work designing a new MoneyPak equipped with new anti-fraud technology so that we could one day bring back the popular MoneyPak product. The culmination of those efforts was that the new MoneyPak, which rolled out to retailers in April and it's currently on sale, at around 17,000 Green Dot retailers including Walgreens, Rite Aid, and Kroger.
The product is selling within our expectations with volumes growing month-over-month. We also expect to gain additional distribution at other major Green Dot retailers, including CVS, who will start selling MoneyPak later this year.
Of course, the new MoneyPak may never be as a big as the old MoneyPak given that many customers have switched to Green Dot's Reload @ the Register service and other customers have moved on to other replacement products and now satisfy their needs. But we think it will be a nice contributor, over time, for the segment of customers who use MoneyPak for putting cash on prepaid cards and various other non-card related use cases.
Step three in our six-step plan is to make modest investments in high potential initiatives that aligned with our roadmap to growth. I'd like to touch on one or two of those initiatives to give you a sense of where we stand and what we're seeing.
First, let's talk about lending, we believe there is an enormous unmet need within our customer base for well designed and fairly priced credit products. At the same time, it's not easy frankly to lend profitably to the consumers we serve. As a result, we're entering the lending marketplace deliberately but carefully through two complementary paths, one is called Green Dot Money, which is our lending marketplace, the other is our launch of a secured credit card and I'll tell you about both.
Green Dot Money lets us partner with others to bring credit to our customers without taking the credit risk ourselves. Our secured credit card lets us lend directly to our customers while managing credit risk by tying the customers' credit line to a security deposit held at Green Dot Bank.
Green Dot Money is up and running. The good news is that the application volume is good and growing substantially month-over-month, validating our belief about unmet need. The bad news is that approval rates for the marketplace lenders are far too low to make the marketplace perform the way we want.
The inherent challenge of lending to consumers with low or no credit scores has been exacerbated by the recent upheaval in the alternative lending market, some lenders have restricted the number of loans they're making, and others have tightened underwriting standards, both of which limit approvals at the low-end of the FICO spectrum which is where our customers generally rate. We are working with our marketplace lenders to provide them with better incremental underwriting data that might be able to help them say yes more often and it will continue to explore how Green Dot Money can help us serve our customers and grow our business.

In terms of our secured credit card, we plan to launch that product by late Q3 and we'll offer it to applicants who have an interest in approving their credit scores. For both Green Dot Money and our secured card program, we have been disciplined on the scope in how we design these products and we've kept investments low. Our technology expense to build the Green Dot Money site was quite modest and our cost of customer acquisition is essentially zero.
As a result, we have little downside and we believe lots of potential upside as we work to build this business over the medium to long-term. The other growth initiatives I'd like to discuss is our Uber 1099 payroll account that we developed to focus on what we're now calling the gig economy. The theory underlying this initiative is pretty simple, as more and more Americans leave the W-2 economy and join the 1099 economy, the gig economy, the on-demand economy, we believe we can meaningfully expand our customer base by putting Green Dot in the flow, making us a natural choice for consumers and small business owners that need a checking account. Uber's a test case for this thesis. When drivers enroll with Uber, they are offered the chance to open a GoBank checking account.
Since the program launched on a national basis just a few months ago, Uber Debit by GoBank has registered over 80,000 drivers and advanced over $80 million in wages to GoBank account. More recently, we've worked with Uber to make Green Dot an even more compelling option, by introducing a new product called Instant Pay to any debit.
Drivers use Instant Pay, pay a small fee and in return Green Dot Bank advances their wages ride by ride and in near real-time to just about any domestic bank issue debit card. We make money by sharing of the transaction fee charged to the driver. Instant Pay, which launched just a few weeks ago, is experiencing terrific growth on a week-over-week basis and we've already completed over 60,000 Instant Pay transactions to drivers in just a short amount of time.
We're proud of what we're doing for Uber drivers, but what's really notable is how the program demonstrates the opportunity to use Green Dot's unique assets to win business. Over the past few years, we've made substantial investments in cutting-edge financial technology and mobile UX capabilities. At the same time, we own a bank and maintain a strong balance sheet. There are lots of banks out there, but very few banks that are Silicon Valley, FinTech, and mobile leaders.
We believe that we've created a unique platform we can now use to drive long-term growth by extending our reach to new modern use cases and new distribution channels in addition to our profitable core legacy channels.
Step four in our six-step plan is to launch major platform initiatives that are intended to drive significant cost reductions this year and next. We've made solid progress so far. And with the exception of some new unknowns related to the processor migration project, which is part of this savings initiative, we feel good about our progress to-date.
Step five in our six-step plan is to make opportunistic and accretive acquisitions using cash or debt. It's hard to find high quality acquisitions that are accretive and digestible but we're always on the lookout for deals that could be strategically and financially compelling.
Step six in our six-step plan is to execute on our $150 million share repurchase plan. As you know, we still have made $100 million in buyback so far since we announced our three-year plan in late 2015. We still have $50 million of buybacks remaining in the authorization, which we expect to execute in due course. In addition to the share buybacks, we're also actively seeking opportunities to improve returns from Green Dot Bank.

When we bought the bank, our regulators imposed very strict limits on us given that we were new bank operator. But now as we hit the five-year anniversary of owning Green Dot Bank, we're working with our regulators to give us greater flexibility to invest our stable core deposits into higher yielding but safe investments, to dividend excess capital held up at the bank back to the holding company so we could use it to fund other accretive activities, and to extend our lending capabilities. Over time, we believe that we'll be able to make Green Dot Bank a more powerful competitive advantage in the marketplace and become a more material contributor to Green Dot Corporation's consolidated results.
Now having updated you on our six-step plan, I'd like to bring you up-to-date on the processor migration project. This multi-year effort involves the migration of 100 million accounts from TSYS to MasterCard PTS. To manage of the risk, we split the migration into four distinct waves, each dealing with a specific part of our card base.
The first two waves happened on time and without material incident in late 2015, and then again in March of this year, wave three of the migration which went forward in May did not go as well as the prior conversion waves, with approximately 60,000 cardholders or about 1.5% of our 4 million-plus active cardholders, experiencing some type of service disruption ranging from minor to major. The vast majority of all issues were fixed in just a few days and all systems have been working properly since that first week post-migration. Nevertheless, it was a painful experience for us and our partners. We cannot overemphasize how critical uninterrupted service is to our value proposition customers and to the success of our company. We're taking the matter very seriously and have taken and will continue to take the steps we feel are right to make sure our cardholders are served effectively.
First, we paid out over $4 million to cardholders prior to Memorial Day in the form of cash credits and monthly fee waivers to show our sincere apology to impacted customers and as a way of thanking them for being great customers. Second, the wave four conversion has been put on hold to give our processing teams time to perform a thorough root cause analysis, design an appropriate remediation plan, and retest the system. Once our technology leaders are comfortable, we can proceed safely. We will reschedule the wave four migration which now likely won't happen until sometime in the first half of 2017. Mark Shifke will talk more about the economic implications in his section of today's remarks.
Before I turn it over to Mark, I just wanted to cover a few corporate governance items, that is, first, I want to welcome our new directors to the board, Nino Fanlo and George Gresham. And I want to thank our investors for electing me to a new three-year term of service.
Second, on June 27, the board appointed Bill Jacobs to be our new Chairman. Many of you may know Bill from his role at Global Payments. He brings many years of operational, board service, and governance experience to Green Dot and we are delighted to have him serve as Board Chair. Thank you, Bill.
And with that, I'll now hand the call over to Mark Shifke. Mark?
Mark L. Shifke - Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Steve. I'd like to start by providing some insight into our strong performance in the quarter on the top- and bottom-line, followed by commentary on our two business segments and how they each contributed to our results. Based on another quarter where we exceeded our expectations, I'm pleased to be able to announce another modest top-line guidance raise for the full year and will provide those details along with our soft guidance for Q3 later in my prepared remarks. First, I'm pleased to report that we delivered $173.5 million in total operating revenue, representing a year-over-year increase of approximately 2%.

Recall that due to MoneyPak discontinuation in early 2015 and the negative impact it had to active cards and associated revenue over the course of the year, we started this year with an approximate $35 million headwind that we would need to grow past just to break even in 2016 on a year-over-year basis. So the fact that we grew in absolute terms in the quarter shows our growth plans are working as expected and actually a little bit better than expected.
Revenue growth came from all of our product lines including prepaid cards, GoBank accounts, cash transfers, and our tax refund processing business TPG. In our Account Services segment, we saw a year-over-year increase in revenue per actives of 13% driven by strong performance on our legacy portfolio plus better unit economics on our new products.
In addition, in our Processing and Settlement segment, revenue per cash transfer increased 4%. Revenue per reload continues to grow for two reasons. First, we no longer offer free reloads on our new suite of products. And second, the new MoneyPak sells for $1 more than the old MoneyPak had, as the concentration of our portfolio receiving free reloads declines.
And as we sell more MoneyPaks and build more scale with that new product, we expect our average revenue per reload will continue to rise. So, in the wake of the detour that started in late 2013, when we introduced lower fee MoneyCards and then worsened with the negative impacts from the discontinuation of MoneyPak in 2015, it's encouraging to see robust organic growth in the Account Services segment. As you may recall, we had previously forecast that the revenues from our core prepaid business would return us to a growth trajectory in Q2. As the numbers indicate, we did exactly that.
Adjusted EBITDA margins in the quarter were also very strong and well ahead of our expectations. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $32.4 million, including the absorption of $7.2 million of unusual incremental expenses associated with launching our new prepaid products and inclusive of one month work of higher Walmart commission rate that did not lap in the quarter until May.
The majority of that strong underlying organic margin expansion was driven by, what we believe to be four sustainable and repeatable factors: one, higher revenue per active card from our installed base of older prepaid cards; two, better unit economics from our new suite of prepaid cards; three, a continuing trend of higher revenue per reload transaction; and four, an increasingly more efficient operating platform allowing more of that incremental revenue to fall to the bottom-line. In terms of non-GAAP EPS, we exceeded our estimates and delivered $0.27 per share, taking into account the incremental launch expenses.
We continued to generate strong cash flows in Q2 with net cash generated from operations in the quarter equaling $19.5 million and unencumbered cash at the holding company equal to approximately $101.1 million after taking into account the $50 million ASR we executed in April.
Before I discuss guidance, I'd like to talk about the financial implications of the May processing conversion event and the subsequent material costs we incurred or expect to incur related to items such as providing impacted customers with courtesy credits and fee reversals from wave three, the cost of settling the class action lawsuit that was filed in connection with that conversion event and the cost of delaying the fourth and final conversion wave off of TSYS and on to the MasterCard PTS platform until sometime in the first half of 2017.
We have discussed this matter with our new processing partners at MasterCard. They have been great partners and have reimbursed us for all material costs that were incurred by us in Q2 and have committed to reimburse us for the incremental material costs that we expect to incur for the remainder of the year. As such, we expect there to be no material negative financial impact to Green Dot as a result of the processor conversion issues in 2016. As it relates to 2017, the sizing of any potential negative impact to Green Dot is a bit of an unknown at this point, because we don't yet have a firm wave four conversion date scheduled, although we expect it to occur in the first half of the year. In any event, until we ultimately complete the final conversion wave with all customer accounts off of the existing platform and successfully operating on the new platform in a normal fashion, we would expect to continue to incur material incremental expenses for which we would seek additional reimbursement at that time.

Now let's discuss our thoughts for the remainder of 2016. On the revenue side, our portfolio performed well in Q2 and we believe we have a good visibility into and are quite encouraged by our revenue trends. The quarter posted top-line over-performance relative to our expectations of $6 million. However, offsetting that $6 million beat is that we have around $3 million of potential revenue headwinds related to some of our new initiatives in the second half of the year.
In particular, we're off to a slower start than we expected on Green Dot Money as Steve mentioned in his prepared remarks. And the launch of one of our new card distribution partnerships we announced previously has been delayed from Q3 into later this year or early next. Given that, we're increasing our full-year revenue guidance by $3 million from a range of $705 million to $710 million to a new range of $708 million to $713 million.
We generated $402 million of revenue in the first half, so our new full-year guidance at the midpoint implies we will achieve $309 million of revenue in the second half. Of that, we expect to generate $152 million of revenue in Q3 implying $157 million in Q4. This revised guidance reflects, on the one hand, the continued strong and improving results from our core prepaid and reload business lines in the first half. And our conservatism around the timing and performance of our new suite of prepaid cards as we get more data around active card trends and expected lifetime revenue of those active cards and other new initiatives planned in the second half.
For adjusted EBITDA, we are currently tracking towards the higher-end of our current range of $156 million to $160 million. However, given the delay noted above in some new initiatives and in performing the final wave four processor conversion that was originally planned to take place this year as well as our desire to get another quarter or two of data on our new card products and other new initiatives, we have decided to hold steady at our current adjusted EBITDA range until more certainty emerges in the second half.
As a result, notwithstanding the $4 million adjusted EBITDA beat and the $0.06 per share of non-GAAP EPS beat, we are not raising guidance in respect of adjusted EBITDA or non-GAAP EPS. But we are reaffirming our prior guidance ranges for adjusted EBITDA of $156 million to $160 million and non-GAAP EPS of $1.39 to $1.43 per share. For Q3, implied guidance adjusted EBITDA, and non-GAAP EPS are expected to be $22 million and $0.16 per share, respectively.
Aside from the question around potential incremental expenses and potential reimbursements related to the processor conversion delays we just discussed, we are still on track to fulfill our commitment to achieve at least $1.75 and non-GAAP EPS in 2017.
And with that, I would like to ask the operator to open the phone for questions. Operator?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. Our first question comes from Ramsey El-Assal of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Christen Chen - Jefferies LLC
Hi, guys. This is Christen Chen for Ramsey. Thanks for taking my question.
Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Sure. Hi, Christen.
Christen Chen - Jefferies LLC
Hi. Can you provide some more color on the Q3 and Q4 guidance – cadence especially on the bottom-line, it seems like that Q3 EPS guide was somewhat shy of our model, but the full year is still the same. Is there just some puts and takes there that we should be thinking about? Thanks.
Mark L. Shifke - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Look, you're absolutely right, on a full year basis, we're coming out to where we were going to come out before but we've accelerated some of that beat into Q2 and then we didn't raise on the bottom-line for the rest of year. So what you have is pretty much the same full year result that we previously had.

Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Maybe we don't, Christen, understand specifically the question.
Christen Chen - Jefferies LLC
I guess – so the guide implies fee for acceleration into Q4. I know you had called out in the prepared remarks that there was a delay of initiative, a launch initiative from Q3 to Q4, but is there anything else we should be thinking about? I mean, we initially thought maybe this was related to the MasterCard processing migration, if there's going to be incremental expenses, but it seems like MasterCard has already gotten that taken care of and will be reimbursed. So, I guess, we're just wondering if there's something kind of the Q4 or Q3 migration that we should...
Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
No, we don't think so, but maybe what we can do, Christen, is we're looking at the face of Chief Accounting Officer, notice in the room, who is sort of a little bit puzzled. And maybe when we do the one-on-ones, after we can better understand the nature of the disconnect and try to answer it mathematically, but there's nothing unusual coming up in the room, so I am not sure we know how to answer it.

Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Please go ahead.
Tai DiMaio - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hi, this is actually Tai DiMaio in for Sanjay. Thanks for talking my question.
Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
No worries.
Tai DiMaio - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
I guess my question is a little bit more strategic, I mean, given where we are in the competitive cycle, you've seen a lot of the large individuals exit. I mean how do you think about your pricing on legacy accounts, given that you're getting much higher per unit economics on the new accounts. Do you have the ability to price them up – would you – I mean how do you think about that?
Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, well, so we did in some cases. For the Green Dot portfolio, we did a modest, what's called, the Change in Terms, where we raised the monthly maintenance fee to match the new monthly maintenance fee on our new products that are sold. So we were at $5.95 and we went to $7.95 and we did that fairly recently. Was that at the end of 2015? We forget the dates. Remember we talked about it at that time.
And so, it doesn't generate a tremendous amount of money because the cards don't have very long lives as you know. But it does help somewhat and it helps normalize the difference between a new card and an old card in that respect. So we did do that – we did not to do it on our other portfolios for various reasons. But, I also want to be clear that it isn't just that we're getting better economics on the new cards, and you look at these as an aging cohort, so we've tracked the first 30 days, 60 days, 90 days and you keep going out until you get to the end of a card's prospective life in three years and sometimes later than three years. For direct deposit customers, we have some that have been on there for many years.
And so, you first track in that first 90 day cohort, because that really helps you understand the way that the things were likely to go, if you will. And so we're getting more money on the new cards for sure because of the better unit economics of the fee plans and also because we're doing things that are encouraging more behavior, more spend, more reloading which means better interchange and all those – reload fees and all those goodies.

But in the old cards even though the fees are largely the same except for the monthly maintenance fee on a segment of them which is not material to our overall revenue, you've just seen better usage. And so, the extra revenue we're getting is from people putting more money on the card and spending it more and seeing direct deposit become a bigger part of the portfolio. And so they are very, very valuable. So we'd never want to do anything to rock the boat unnecessarily of those existing cardholders. And many of them, frankly, qualify for the fee waivers anyhow, which is another reason why the Change in Terms doesn't generated a ton of money, because they have the fee waiver from the direct deposit limits and the load limits.
So we're just benefiting on both sides, a terrific revenue growth per active card, people have been on the system for months and years and many years in the case of our direct deposit customers. And then the 90 day cohorts of the new customers, which means – and hopefully as they get older, will look even better than the customers we have today.
So in the same way that portfolios take time to decline like when we rolled out the new MoneyCard portfolio back at the end of 2013, it takes time. In that case, a negative trend for that revenue to decline. And then when you replace cards with better priced cards, it takes time for that to build. In our case, we're benefiting from both. And that's why it's looking so strong.
Tai DiMaio - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay, that helps. And then maybe my follow-up to that is on customer acquisition costs. I mean have you seen the dynamic change maybe over the last year, especially when you think about these new initiatives that you're rolling out. Are you kind of thinking about the level of investments related to that in a different way maybe to the past or is it kind of the same?
Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
So – well, okay, both. So it's the same in retail where the cost of hanging the card and merchandising the card and printing a package and all that kind of thing, for filling a personalized card, that doesn't change without regard to the fee schedule and our acquisition cost is the same. In other words, retail commissions outside of the Walmart contract renewal last year and so forth, those would all be consistent and you wouldn't see significant changes in our cost per acquisition for that channel.
But for cards sold online, you have a different advantage. When you're collecting more money and you have higher lifetime revenue per card, you can afford to spend more on marketing on the Internet, click marketing, different kinds of things that you couldn't do if you had a lower value card. So when you have an Internet generated card from one of our Green Dot direct channels, which is a significant part of our business, those you can have a little bit more leeway in how you market because you have a higher revenue generation per card and so it gives you an opportunity in channels that maybe you couldn't have competed in before.
Having said that, we tend to be cheapskates and we tend to hold ourselves to rigid cost per acquisition online and it's just working not quite well. So the answer is no change in your models where there shouldn't be to cost per acquisition, but anytime you have a card generating more money in that first 90 days, it gives us a little bit more leeway for how we may want to spend to acquire a customer.

Our next question comes from Vasu Govil of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Vasu Govil - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi, thanks for taking my question. I quickly wanted to ask about the active cards which were down 11% year-on-year and I think even on a q-on-q basis, the decline seemed higher than in last years from 1Q to 2Q. I'm guessing we've mostly – we are mostly done recycling the impact of the discontinued MoneyPak products, but can you sort of elaborate on what was going on and what we should expect in the back half for active cards?

Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Sure. Well – so the first question is the decline is – in our view, the results of the MoneyPak removal back in 2015, you could just see if you remember that painful period of time, we removed the product at the end of January, some stragglers where there till the middle of February, but essential it was gone in January.
And then starting at about March or April, you just saw the decline in new card sales come down which predicates a decline in active cards. And then you have fewer people who were buying the card – for MoneyCard, buying cards, which also generates a decline in active cards. So the 0.5 million of decline year-over-year is – the MoneyPak decline I believe is more than, but you have offsetting impacts. You have the MoneyPak users going away, but then you also have other people who are retaining longer, right, which helps to build your active card. So you have some portions of your portfolio increasing in actives. You have the lower revenue generating guys, thankfully decreasing in activity and active cards and the net is 500,000 down. But your revenue per card is so much higher because the percentage of your customers who are the higher revenue producing customers just keep becoming a larger part of your active base.
So anyhow, but that's the reason for the year-over-year decline. Had we removed MoneyCard in 2014 or something, you would have seen it in a different year. But that's why it's more this year than in other years because MoneyPak is the big determinant of that.
In terms of when we'd see active cards turning around, we first have to lap the MoneyPak ecosystem declines, which we're expecting to be sometime about the end of this year. And so, we'll lap that period of decline, so, call it, November, December. And I want to say from memory that the MoneyPak ecosystem in our view officially ended end of October early November. So, we wouldn't expect active card growth to happen until a period of stabilization in actives and then you'd see that actual growth come back sometime in 2017.
The actual timing and rate of the active card stabilization then growth would depend on new unit sales of reloading cardholders and then the level of churn, right, in the existing installed base of actives and the higher the unit sales of reloading cards and the lower the churn rate of the installed active base means the higher the net active card base. So that would happen sometime in our expectation in 2017 sooner, if churn is lower and sales are higher, a little bit later if churn is higher or sales are lower and then we really rock and roll if sales are higher and churn is lower, but we wouldn't want to get over our skis on that. So we're always modest in our expectations but that's how the math works.
Vasu Govil - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great. Thanks for that. And then just quickly on the Green Dot Money product launch. You talked about already starting to take some applications. Can you talk about the lending partners that you're working with? Have you signed a bunch? I don't think we've seen announcements of the lending partners that you're working with.
Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
No. Yes, we haven't – the answer is, I know of a bunch, we have, I want to say, six or seven or maybe a little more than that, signed up and getting ready to enroll and then they have a technology deployment into the site. And I want to say, we have about two or three currently active and reviewing our applications. And we want to get up to a base of about 10 active lenders. Frankly, there are not a zillion lenders who lend the people in our FICO range. The average Green Dot customer, as you can imagine, has a very low FICO score and has a spotty lending history and a spotty banking history, which is, in many cases, why they end up at Green Dot Bank.

So it's a tough customer to underwrite and there's not a lot of lenders who specialize in that and say, hey, I love this customer base, I want to lend to them. And then it gets even harder because of our brand name at Green Dot and our quite serious devotion to our customer base. We can't and won't market loans that we think are, in any way, unfair or predatory or not in keeping with what we think is the kind of thing we want our customers to take advantage of. So it doesn't mean that we're not – we don't mean that to be overly-pious or anything like that, it's just a matter of how we manage the brand. So when you look at the clients out there who are willing to both serve this customer base and willing to charge them a rate that we think is appropriate and that we can live with, there's just not a lot of lenders.
But we do have some good ones and there are ones that specialize in it. And now we have to figure out how to get them better data and append – if you will, append the data if they're a Green Dot Bank customer, for example, can we tell that lender that they're on direct deposit or can we give that lender information about how long they've been a good customer. Anything that can help that lender say yes and then take a risk on that customer. And as we get that formula better, as lenders get more confident in their decision making, as we develop an underwriting track record, I think you'll see those approvals go up. But one of the ways to go up, to your point, is have more lenders with more secret sauce in underwriting to hopefully say yes to more customers.

Our next question comes from George Mihalos of Cowen. Please go ahead.
George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC
Great. Thanks, guys. Just wanted to delve a little bit more into the guidance – maybe you can breakdown the reasons for keeping the EBITDA guidance where it is, given the outperformance in 2Q and then the revenue outperformance that we're seeing. It doesn't really sound like it has that much to do with the card migrations. So maybe you can help us there a little bit.
Mark L. Shifke - Chief Financial Officer
Sure, George. Look, our beat in the quarter was $6 million, but we believe we're going to have revenue headwinds in the second half associated with the new initiatives and we believe they will now deliver about $3 million less than we had planned. So we think that $6 million is really just a net beat of $3 million and that's why we took up our guidance to that extent on revenue.
On adjusted EBITDA, we beat by $4 million and we think there is about a $2 million bottom-line headwind from the slow start that we have on Green Dot Money and the delay in the new program launch. And so, we think there is around $2 million also of potential headwinds from the processor conversion event. So, as a consequence, when you put that all together, we raised revenue $3 million and we're holding EBITDA and EPS flat.
Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
To us, it's just a mathematical equation. In other words, when we do the buildup, we're looking at who are the good guys and we take the good guys and then we see are there are any bad guys lurking in the dark shadows in the second half, and we subtract out the bad guys. And so that's the number you come up with. Could we be more aggressive based on our trends in our active card portfolio? Probably. Should we be more aggressive in our trends? Probably not. And that's what I meant earlier by aging.
We only have 1.5 cohorts of 90-day cohorts, that's a pretty limited data set to play with guidance. And so we want to be thoughtful and conservative and we do know, as Mark said, we have anywhere from a $2 million to $4 million headwind on adjusted EBITDA because of the processor thing and the slower start to those initiatives. So, mathematically, it makes sense to hold steady. And, look, in the old days, would we have been more exuberant? Maybe.

I think it's fair to say that we're increasingly more thoughtful and conservative as we try to view our guidance which doesn't mean we can't miss it. So who knows? But we always try to guide where we believe we can meet it at the very least.
George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC
Okay. Appreciate that. And if you guys can provide the percentage of revenue coming from your largest customer, Walmart, this quarter?
Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Total revenue? Yes.
Mark L. Shifke - Chief Financial Officer
I think the concentration this quarter is 46%.
Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. We want to remind you of something, though, because it's easy to get confused. So in the old days – in the olden days, we used to give the concentration just of the Walmart MoneyCard portfolio, just that one portfolio, remember we saw a lot of things at Walmart. That's just one part of it as the Walmart MoneyCard portfolio. And that one portfolio was 50%, 60%-some-odd of our revenue for the whole company. This new number of 46% is everything we sell at Walmart, the Walmart MoneyCard, gift cards, the Green Dot Everyday Visa product, GoBank, reloads, so it's a – so the number is still lower than what used to be at 46%, but it includes everything we sell whereas in the old days it was only the Walmart MoneyCard portfolio.

Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citibank. Please go ahead.
Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Hi, Ashwin, good to hear from you.
Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Hi, thank you for all the detail you guys are providing here. I wanted to delve a little bit deeper into the aging cohort comment that you had – you had basically now – as you said, maybe 1.5, 90-day periods. But you are beginning to see – possibly more attractive new consumer come in. And I wanted to get an idea of how long it might take to – not to complete the transition, but to reach something of a tipping point where you got sort of a sweet spot of enough good guys coming in that it offsets the downward pressure that might see on the other side.
Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. If you think about portfolio, let me think of an imagery here. I was trying to think of a softball, let's use a softball. I'm trying to think an analogy we'd all think about. And you have sort of the soft outer and then it gets a little bit more firm inside and then at the center of the softball, you have a really hard core. And so, if I just said, hey, take your fingers and start peeling away at that softball, you get to the first layer, okay, the second layer would be a little bit harder but you'd really struggle to get rid of that hard core. That's the same thing in a card portfolio like ours. You have customers who are here today gone tomorrow, that's where the soft outer core and they will turn fairly quickly, although they are turning slower than they used to turn, that's still been a benefit. But they'll turn fairly quickly. But then as you get on the middle, those guys will be there forever, so when you think about – well, not forever, but for many years, because they're on direct deposit, they use the card for their everyday banking needs, that's the core of your company, the person you want to keep forever. They deliver the best revenue and they stay with you the longest.
So when you think about a new product hitting the store shelves, those new people are coming in and it's going to take a while to figure out, of those customers, who are going to become your hard inner core that stays with you for years, who are the people that are just going to reload once or never and throw the card away.

So the answer is, you'll replace, if you will, the first half of that softball, you will replace in the course of 12 months of our average retention that we report just in the Q is, what, eight months or something like that, which is sort of a retention number that's everything mixed in together in a big mixing bowl.
Then, in theory, over the course of eight months, the vast majority of those cards will turn over. But you'll still be left over with those core – the hard inner core of that softball that will be with you for many years. And so that sort of gives you a year-over-year growth and it has the impact of making your revenue per average customer much higher because the guys in the outer softer core just don't contribute a lot.
So the answer is, you will replace the soft outer core with new customers coming into system, that's a positive sign. The perfect storm, if you will, for revenue meaning in the good way the perfect combination, is you keep that hard core of the old portfolio, because they're delivering tremendous revenues and they are waiving out of the fees anyhow for the most part.
So you want keep that hard core, but you're replacing the soft core with new customers that are paying more money than the old customers used to come on. And so that's what your ultimate hope is. So you'll never get rid of or not in the next year or two certainly – I shouldn't use words like never, I'm speaking colloquially with you, I'm not speaking in an audited fashion.
But you're not going to have all the customers leave, you don't want them to leave. They'll be with you for many years. We have Walmart MoneyCard customers that are seven years old. We have Green Dot customers who are eight years, nine years old. So those will stay there. But you will replace the easier to replace customers more quickly with higher fee cards. So I don't know if that's helpful color commentary or if I confused everyone even more. But does that make sense?
Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
No, that makes sense. It gives a good framework to think about it. Sort of a follow-up question is, you do have the higher fee that you laid on higher per card fee and then the takeaway of the zero fee MoneyPak. Is there a situation sort of, let's call it, middle of next year where those things anniversary and then we should – as we'd start thinking of modeling out the next 12 months to 18 months that it creates sort of a comp issue.
Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, this is the secret to understanding the cohorts. The usage has been so much better than we thought it would be on the new cards. In other words, you sort of anticipate what might happen and I think when we first guided the year, we said – and we disclosed our assumptions for the year, if you remember, and we said that one of our assumptions was that behavioral metrics on the new cards stay the same to the old cards. And we weren't sure if that was risky or not, they could have been much worse, let's say.
But it turns out they're better. So as you see these portfolios come together over the next year, just like our current card, of active cards keeps getting better and better, that's been a trend over just, I don't know if you remember, we did the analysis last call, but it's many quarters in a row that our active cards have been getting better in terms of revenue per average active.
And so, it could well be that we have that's still seasoning and coming together. As long as the portfolio seasoning, meaning your installed base keeps getting better because you're left at more and more of a hard core center to my previous analogy. And because of new guys coming in are of higher money than the old guys replacing, you'll continue to have solid comps in theory in the model as you go. But that's the part that we wouldn't know. In another words, if you were to say, hey, Steve, guide out 24 months, you'd have a pretty wide range of potential outcomes depending on the retention of that hard core from your existing portfolio and depending on how many of the new guys turn into hard core going forward.

The easy part is you replacing a $5 card with a $7 card, that part is easy. But frankly, that's the smallest part of your revenue composition. It's really that hard core that generates all that revenue and that's why we're trying to invest and have been investing in things like the ability to write checks to pay your rent and person to person payments and savings vault on the MoneyCard, which is a savings account on the card.
All these kinds of cool things to try to make the card more meaningful, Cash-Back Rewards, right. If you're buying the card that advertises, buy me because I've Cash-Back Rewards, you're not buying it, I would assume, to pay your phone bill and throw it away. Right?
So these are all the kinds of things we're doing to try to encourage that hard core center to stick around. And when you only have 90 days plus of data, you wouldn't want to bet your life on it. But the first 90 days has certainly been fulfilling as you can see from our results.
Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Yeah, no, absolutely. My last question and this is kind of what I was trying to build up to is, not to speak concretely of guidance for next year. But the $1.75 for next year with everything that's going on, all these initiatives and where they stand and some are a little bit ahead, some are not where you want it to be. But overall, the $.75, is that still sort of a good ballpark to think about.
Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, listen, we're still talking about it and that means we have confidence in it. It could be higher, yes, if everything lines up and things work out, yes, it could be lower, but we hope not – the only thing in 2017 that is a negative that or one of the things we see in 2017 that could be negative is, as we mentioned on the call, the process conversion, while we feel like the platform would be ready to go and we'll convert and, to the extent we not, we believe that MasterCard will continue to work with us and take care of us as they have. Well, then, that's okay. But it's hard to perfectly foretell the future on that. And so I feel better once the conversion is done and everything is working great.
And we know that that's a thing of the past. That will give me some comfort because that was supposed to happen this year, right? And it's still might, but our guess is first half of 2017. And so I want to see that done and in the bag and lock down and that's good. And then I want to see our active card cohorts working the way we want them to work. Are they matching our expectations? Is behavior still the same or better than what it is today? And that's bit of an unknown, but absent those two metrics, if you will, things should work out on the upside, but we've always want to guide at a range that we believe we can hit.
Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)

Our next question comes from Mike Grondahl of Northland Securities. Please go ahead.
Mike Grondahl - Northland Securities, Inc.
Thank you, guys. First question, is there just anything else anecdotally you could share about the new cards with the higher economic, just that you've seen in these first 90 days in terms of usage or any patterns developing?
Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, I think I'll give you the high level, I suppose, Mike. Look, we're thrilled with their performance and we talked about that in different ways, in different metrics. We haven't broken apart the metrics for the new card versus existing card because it's just too granular, and it'll drive people nuts with making their model. But we're currently obviously pleased with reloading behavior spend and all those other revenue generating activities that are driven by customer behavior, those are all looking very positive. Look, the reason why that's important is you can't fee yourself in the glory. Maybe for a month you can, but you can't fee yourself in the glory because if people don't like the product or they don't feel like it's a value, then you're going to crash the portfolio.

So, in addition, to launching the products with different fees, you've got to see people engaging in the usability of the card. So the fees to us are the easiest part. Will people reload more money? What's your first 30-day reload rate? What's the average amount of GDV? What's your direct deposit enrollment? All those things to us are way more important than the fees because they predict what that hard core, to my previous analogy, will be in the out months and the out years.
So all that behavior so far is looking positive. But I want to caution again. We have 1.5, 90-day cohorts. Fee revenue is clearly up, as you know, and as customers use the card more, they also pay more fees. So there is another benefit to people engaging in the card more. So we're only have limited amount of data, Mike, on this cohort analysis of the Walmart cards and the new Green Dot cards, but we're very encouraged. I don't know that I can give you – I'll give you one anecdote. Those people – I don't want to leave you with nothing. I want to give you something good. We have a product which look great in the research lab, but you never know what it looks like on the self and that's called the Green Dot 5% Cash Back Visa. It's a debit card, not a prepaid card. And it's targeted to the mass market, not necessarily the low and moderate income segment. And it's the most expensive card we've ever sold in the company's history. It's $9.95 a month, and it has 5% cash back on it. And it's a beautiful piece of plastic and it's a gorgeous package using rich blues and whites and the card is a pearl white finish with the blue version of the Visa logo, it's just a really nice piece of plastic. And all those things matter. And sales on that are doing very well. And engagement on it is clearly a different kind of customer than a regular prepaid card. So that's a little bit of an anecdote. How is that?
Mike Grondahl - Northland Securities, Inc.
No, that's helpful. And then second question is the new MoneyPak, I think it's in 17,000 locations today, plus CVS later this year. How does that compare to the number of locations that the old MoneyPak was in?
Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, the old MoneyPak would have been in – I'm going to say, all of our retailers or the vast majority, so let's call it 90,000 retailers in the heyday, call it the middle of 2014. And there was CVS, call it another 8,000 stores, that brings you up to 25,000 retailers, let's say. So we have a long way to go.
Having said that, your biggest retailers are your biggest retailers, right, so the Walgreens, CVSs, Rite Aids, all those. The big winner is if down the line, you can get it back into a Walmart, which we moved MoneyPak long time ago, long before we moved it everywhere else. Could you get it into there? Could you get into – so we still have a lot of real estate left to go and we have a lot to prove to our partners. We would never want to sell a product that made our retailers feel like there was something wrong with the product. And I think, for the most part, the retailers we work with were proud of us for pulling the product, it was very Green Dot thing to do it, if you will. In terms of making sure we are protecting customers and protecting the reputation of those retailers.
And then the new system is pretty slip. I doubt you'd use it necessarily to put money on your prepaid card. But the back end interface, if you got a MoneyPak.com, is a really cool website, and people are using it and it's working, and the fraud controls are working and it's very exciting to see that come to fruition. But, look it's a very small fraction of what the old MoneyPak would have been at its peak.
And so we have a long way to go in terms of bringing it back with more distribution, and then we have to see how many more retailers can sell it, but given that it's only been in the market for a very short period of time, we feel good about the real estate we're getting back.

Our next question comes from Reggie Smith of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Reginald Lawrence Smith - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey, guys, congrats on the quarter. Just wanted to dig in on the comments you made earlier. I think you said that in regards to new sales that you guys continue to be the share leader as you retails with your new products. I guess my question is so you're still the leader, has share shifted at all with the rollout of these higher priced products? And I have a few follow-ups.
Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, so the answer is, it has because we've lost – and this what I mentioned in the prepared remarks and it's a good question, I'll give you some color on it – we've lost on the repeat one-and-done customers and that was part of the design of the products. A significant part of our customer base use the products as a free throwaway product. And which is not their fault, it's our fault. That's how we design the product and they're taking advantage of it.
But the card was cheaper than a gift card. So you could buy a Green Dot card or a Walmart card, you buy it, it's a couple of bucks to buy, but cheaper than a gift card than may be is $5 to buy, you buy it, you register it with the fake name like Rumpelstiltskin or something, we decline you, right, we're not going to approve you for the card, but you can spend down the card in the package and they do that and they pay their Verizon bill or they pay their Sprint bill or whatever it is, and whatever their DIRECTV bill, it was a very common one. And they throw it away, and they just do that every month. But every month we're doing a CIP and going out to Experian to get their data and to LexisNexis and we're sending out plastic in the mail and all those kind of things. So you're sitting here running a fulfillment cost and, of course, the retailer commission because the retailer gets paid whether that customer turns out to be long-term or short-term.
So you're sitting here with an acquisition cost that is maybe $6 or $7 all-in and a customer who, by the time we went to collect the fee, was already long gone. They had made their bill, they used it up and throw it away. And that's the way it's been for years with the company. So it's shouldn't be a surprise to us that it encouraged one-and-done behavior.
The other thing that we used to do is we sold cards for free on promotion. And we may still do that, it's a great way to get people into that card. But for a long time, we were free at Walgreens, we were free at Rite Aid, I forget where else, we may have been free for a little bit at the retailers, and you generate these massive amount of unit sales but the quality of those customers were horrific. So you'd see your revenue rise a little bit, right, and then you see your EBITDA get crunched as these customers just generated losses and repeat losses.
So what we've done is we've peeled off by design that layer of repeat one-and-dones. And the card is priced now where you're more likely to the want to reload it. You've already bought it, you invested in it, it's now cheaper than to reload than it is to buy a new card before it's cheaper to buy a new card than it was to reload. And we've changed those dynamics. And so we don't look at our market share as unit count because that's somewhat frankly irrelevant to the long-term, I mean obviously it's important intake fact.
But I'd rather sell, let's pretend, 10 cardholders who are reloading and generating strong lifetime revenue than 100 guys where we're losing $1 a card, right. So the answer is we're still far and away the share leader but we've absolutely given up some unit sales on the rack and we're okay with that. Now the question is – in fact it was part of the design – so now the question is, how do we sell and introduce the cardholders to a different kind of customer segment that people are buying us now and say, Green Dot is for the serious prepaid cardholder and generate more of those customers.

It's gone very well so far as you can see but we want to make sure that we get that out here and so the mantra in our sales effort is cut expenses, sell more quality cards, cut expenses, sell more quality cards, it's a very simple metric. And you will see our promotional activity or if you see what Steve Harvey talks on his TV shows or any of those, you will see where the thrust of our promotional effort is.
Reginald Lawrence Smith - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Understood. And I guess a follow-up to that. You talked about I guess the usage of the new cards and that has been, I guess, better than what you had modeled initially. Just curious have the sales also been better than what you modeled? So it sounds like you've got a better cardholder base than you thought. I guess my question is, is it a little bit larger than you thought as well or is it smaller or is it in line.
And then lastly when thinking about the Uber relationship and I guess pre-funding and direct deposit, how should we think about the incremental expense associate with that or is there one, how – the mechanics of how that works and whether that's a potential drag? Thanks.
Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, so the answer is, we don't really – we clearly have an expectation for new card sales but we model based on active cards. And for the active cards, we say would within a certain range, I forget what it is, a few points up or down. And, I think we're basically within our range of that. And ultimately it's a combination of active cards and the revenue per active, that's how we run the model. And we don't particularly guide on unit sales, although we have a forecast for each retailer. And the reason is because it's somewhat of a meaningless metric I can blow the door off of unit sales by saying, buy a Green Dot card for free and we'll put $10 at acquisition, right, but you'd see the company not do very well. So that's how we model it and that's within line. The next question is – I mean in the active cards and the revenue – the next question was about direct deposit – I'm sorry, would you give me that last one again? The cost of...?
Reginald Lawrence Smith - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yes. So correct me if I don't understand this correctly, but I thought with Uber deal that you guys were prefunding the payroll and then it would settle with you guys maybe a day or two later, I'm just curious is there costs associated with that and how should we think about that?
Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. The answer is it's an implied cost. We're using our bank's balance sheet, right. So every day you have settlements incoming. Every day you have settlements posting and outgoing, and that would be a settlement in transit and that's what that is, because you're getting the money every business day. It's no different by the way, in fact, it's identical to what we do with our retailers and we have for 15 years. When I reload a card – pick your favorite retailer, Reggie, Dollar General – when I reload a card at a Dollar General, the customers getting access to those funds the second they leave the store, right. But Green Dot doesn't get paid the second they leave the store, we're going to get pay the next business day or two days later or if it's a long holiday weekend, four days later.
But the customer got to use the money right away. So there's always a fairly large outstanding receivables balance at the bank or settlement in transit. And so when we underwrite and do a risk analysis on our balance sheet at the bank, we're underwriting that retail or that organization for their ability to make sure they pay us pack in the time agreed to. And there would been an implied cost of money for that overnight or there would be an implied cost of money for the two-day, but as you can imagine, it wouldn't be significant and it's just part of the revenue and the EBITDA model for the product.

Reginald Lawrence Smith - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. Understood. Thanks, guys.
Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Sure.

Our last question comes from Bob Napoli of William Blair. Please go ahead.
Bob P. Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC
Thank you.
Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Napoli, it's been a long time. Good to hear from you.
Bob P. Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC
Yeah, how are you doing buddy?
Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Very good.
Bob P. Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC
Any thoughts on adopting the EMV cards for your prepaid cards?
Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
So the answer is we're going do EMV, but it's not going be until the later years. When I say later, I'm taking about end of 2017. And then go out from there and it will be on those customers – boy, the softball analogy is going to do me well, today. So back to that inner core. I was trying to think of like a mountain where you water brush and the clay falls of easy making hard clay, but I settled on the softball.
So question was the EMV, so we will serve the EMV chips up on the cards that go to those hard core customers. It would be very, very wasteful to put an EMV chip on a card that hangs on the rack, that would be preposterous or to put an EMV chip on a one-and-done reloader, but clearly for high value customers, direct deposit customers, reloading customers, there is a number of ways we can segment our active base. And we've actually done the analysis and we do believe it will save us net some losses of person-to-person card transactions and you'll see those rolling out towards the end of 2017.
And so, that's one of the ways we're going to both control the cost of that and, at the same time, make sure it's a net positive by only putting the chip on those cards where the fraud risk is higher and where the loss of charge-offs is higher.
Bob P. Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC
Makes sense. How much revenue did you have from TPG in the quarter?
Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
I don't know that we disclosed it. What you can do is, you can look at the segment called Processing and Settlement and you'll see a segment number and that's comprised of our cash transfer business, reloads at retailers and TPG, and there is probably some metrics in there – I know there is metrics in there as it relates to the numbers of taxes, refunds they've processed in the quarter and that type of thing. And that's probably your best disclosure.
Bob P. Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC
Is that a big effect on the 2Q to 3Q EBITDA mix shift?
Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
It is when you think of margins because TPG generates no revenue and all or very tiny revenue in the second half of the year. But they still have the same staff, right? So you have – if you will, your fixed expenses are evenly divided over the course of the year, you have some higher variable expenses of call center or whatnot in the first part.
But over the full year, they have their fixed expenses evenly divided, but all the revenue front loaded primarily in the Q1, straggling revenue into Q2, and then tiny revenue three and four, so it does affect your margins where you're going to have big fat margin margins in Q1, which is not sustainable clearly for the whole year. And then you're going to see in the back half compressed margins as a result of having to pay for that company's existence even though you're only generating revenue from your prepaid card business lines
Bob P. Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC
Okay. And you're doing – you have a lot of initiatives going on and of those initiatives which – what would be the top one or two that are going to have the biggest effect – could have the biggest effect on your business over the next few years?

Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, if you call the new cards and the Cash-Back cards and so forth, an initiative, clearly those are the drivers of our business. It's our core business, right. So those would be big, if you look at some of, what I'll call, the ancillary initiatives or more of the side initiatives that could be high potential, Green Dot Money, on paper, should do really well if we can get lenders to say yes. I know that sounds trite. But if you think about the lending market, the biggest issue people have in the lending market is the cost of acquisition, right. And the ability to get that in there because you have to pay, what is it, you probably track it better than I do, but as much as $400 to $500 for a funded loan for a lender.
At Green Dot, we have so many millions of customers coming in that we're paying nothing for applicants; the problem is we've got to figure out a way to get better applicants and to give that appended data to the underwriters so that they can have more to work with. But that could be a good one, if we can get that rolling, right. And that's a good one. Uber is going very well, I'm stunned by the numbers of Instant Pay and how fast that's growing, and I gave some statistics on that. But that isn't as profitable or as big clearly as selling a prepaid card account.
So I think that – but if you had to say two, I would say, Uber and Green Dot Money have exciting potential initiatives not only for those companies like with Uber, but others like it. And then as we can have more products, they all work together exponentially. Remember on one of our slide decks, we had the wheel of synergy. And we talk about the fact that as we can build a lending product or as we can build another kind of product, can you sell that through to the Uber driver, can you do this with that?
And these are all the conversations that we're having about how we look at the long-range planning of the company. How we can continue to grow with our existing customer base with new products and services? So that's all part of what we look at, but those are two good ones. And MoneyPak is doing well, which is, in effect for us, free for the price of asking, right, it's already our brand, and already our product, and technology was already built, and – or at least the core technology to process it, and that's doing well.
So I think we have a lot of irons in the fire as you point out, but our focus is always the core business because that's what pays the bills. And so we always want to have the best prepaid products, we always want to have the best and most compelling fee schedules and services and features. We've always want to have the most beautiful packages on the rack. We always want to make sure we are in the best retailers, all that blocking and tackling is something we focus on all the time.
Bob P. Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC
How should we think about revenue from Uber – the Uber relationship?
Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, it's, gosh, I don't know how you'd say that, it's all part of our active cards, right. So I would think of it as me as thinking of it as being incremental and additive, but not generating what a prepaid card would generate in total. Although, the Uber GoBank accounts, if that driver is using it as their core checking account, clearly not all of the 80,000 that we've registered so far are, just like with prepaid cards, you have a lot of people who just want to get paid and they could care less, right. And they get their money off the card at their nearest ATM. You have others who say, oh, this is a cool checking account, I'll use this. And those guys will do very well. So – but they're all part of that active card portfolio in the Account Services segment.

Bob P. Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC
And last question. And this is – obviously, the board of directors has changed radically over the past few months. And how is that – and how are you working with the new board? And can you give any color into how – how things are going since the changes? That would be helpful.
Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, look, may be a better question for the board, I can give you my perspective as the guy who has been here for a while. I think it's going extremely well. It's painful to see folks like Tim Greenleaf and Mike Moritz. I mean – and I'll say this, Sir Mike, for those of you who are blessed to have met him or know him, he's without question one of the coolest most important guys. Hang on one second, Bob.
Bob P. Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC
Sure.
Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Anyhow. Great guy. And, Tim, of course, did so much work on our committee so well. But the new board is fabulous. Nino has done a great job. George is contributing. Bill Jacobs, as your Chairman, has been spectacular. And Raj Date has been so impressive. Chris Brewster has been amazing. And you would think the board has been together for years. If this were a band, you'd assume we would have been rehearsing the charts for years and it's a new band, if you will.
And so I feel very fortunate. It's functioning, they're learning Green Dot, we're learning them, but I've enjoyed it and there's been – it's gone a lot better than I would have thought. If you would ask me what it was like – what it would be like before all this happened, I would have given you a different comment. Now that it's happened, I feel very fortunate and very pleased. And I think for the most part, I'm sure they'd tell you the same thing.
Bob P. Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC
Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it.
Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
You bet. I think, operator, that's all she wrote from looking at the board, right?
Operator
Absolutely. I'm turning the call back over to management for closing remarks.
Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
The only closing remark is thank you for listening. We appreciate you hearing our message today. And we look forward to talking to you next or seeing you at a conference near you. Have a great day.

Master Entrepreneur: Steven W. Streit, founder and CEO of Green Dot Corp


		Posted on November 18, 2011 

		by Robert W Price 


Ernst & Young Entrepreneur Of The Year® Financial Services
Steve Streit pioneered and heads Green Dot, a leading financial services company. The initial idea was to get suburban kids on the internet their own credit cards so they could make purchases. But when Streit finally got the product to market, he found that kids weren’t buying the cards. Adults were. Green Dot quickly changed its marketing and messaging and has since enjoyed great success. The company was the pioneer and remains the leader in the prepaid debit card market. Income continues to grow: 2010 sales were up 40% year-over-year, and in July 2010, Green Dot enjoyed a highly successful IPO.

The former disc jockey and radio executive created the nation’s largest provider of prepaid debit cards, catering to credit-challenged people trying to make ends meet.
Steven W. Streit is founder and chief executive of Monrovia-based Green Dot Corp., the nation’s largest provider of prepaid debit cards. Customers, mostly people without bank accounts, buy the cards at retail outlets, load them with cash or direct-deposit paychecks and use them like bank-issued plastic. They are branded under the Green Dot name and also branded for Wal-Mart Stores.
About Green Dot
Green Dot Corporation, a prepaid financial services company, together with its subsidiaries, provides money management solutions in the United States. The company offers general purpose reloadable prepaid debit cards, and cash loading and transfer services. Its products include Green Dot MasterCard and Visa-branded prepaid debit cards and various co-branded reloadable prepaid card programs; Visa-branded gift cards; and MoneyPak and swipe reload proprietary products, which enable cash loading and transfer services through its Green Dot Network. The Green Dot Network enables consumers to use cash to reload its prepaid debit cards or to transfer cash to any of the company’s Green Dot Network acceptance members, including competing prepaid card programs, and other online accounts. The company markets its cards and financial services to banked, underbanked, and unbanked consumers. It offers its products and services through retail distributors, including mass merchandisers, drug store and convenience store chains, and supermarket chains; the Internet; and relationships with other businesses. The company was formerly known as Next Estate Communications, Inc. and changed its name to Green Dot Corporation in October 2005. Green Dot Corporation was founded in 1999 and is headquartered in Monrovia, California.

Good day, and welcome to the Green Dot Corporation Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Please note that the contents of this call are being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Derra Stark (00:17), Investor Relations for Green Dot.
Unverified Participant
Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. On today's call, we will discuss 2015's fourth quarter performance and thoughts about 2016. Following these remarks, we will open the call for questions. For those of you who have not yet accessed the earnings press release that accompanies this call and webcast, it can be found at www.ir.greendot.com. Additional operational data has been provided in the supplemental table within our press release.
As a reminder, our comments include forward-looking statements about, among other things, our expectations regarding future results and performance. Please refer to the cautionary language in the earnings release and in Green Dot's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the most recent Form 10-Q that we filed on November 9, 2015, for additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.
During the call, we will make reference to financial measures that do not conform to generally accepted accounting principles. This information may be calculated differently than similar non-GAAP data presented by other companies. Quantitative reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial information to their most directly comparable GAAP financial information appears in today's press release. The content of this call is property of the Green Dot Corporation and is subject to copyright protection.
Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve.
Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Derra (01:50), and welcome, everyone, to our fourth quarter earnings call. For the call today, I will cover the highlights of the quarter and the year and review our long-term strategic roadmap. We'll also talk about our six-step plan to drive material EPS growth so that you know what we're planning and you can track our progress along the way. Then, Mark will share some additional financial detail and provide our financial outlook for 2016 with some preliminary thoughts on 2017.
Today, we also want to acknowledge the feedback we recently received from one of our largest stockholders, Harvest Capital Strategies. Our investors are customers of Green Dot, and disappointing one of our customers is something our company, our board and I as Founder and Chairman take very seriously.
I can assure you we want to make Harvest a fan, and we are taking their feedback into careful consideration. We intend to engage with Harvest in an effort to resolve the situation peacefully and respectfully. At the same time, we're committed to doing what's in the best interest of all of Green Dot shareholders.
Most importantly, what's better than talking about performance is actually performing and delivering shareholder value. Mark and I and the amazingly talented Green Dot worldwide team is dedicated to growing our business and driving EPS.
So, with that, let's get into the call. We performed as expected in Q4, with our acquisitions keeping us essentially even in year-over-year non-GAAP revenue at $151 million, despite the declining revenue from our legacy business line.

Flow through to profit and EPS was materially lower in the quarter because of two reasons, primarily. One, we paid higher commissions to Walmart in the quarter than in the prior year period; and, two, the legacy revenue we lost was of much higher margin than the acquired revenue we gained in this particular quarter.
On a full year consolidated basis, 2015 was a very strong year for Green Dot, with double-digit growth in non-GAAP revenue and adjusted EBITDA, again driven by acquisitions. The standalone revenue and adjusted EBITDA run rates of our acquired entities plus the extra profit delivered from integration synergies made a huge positive impact on the year and allowed us to stay flat in non-GAAP EPS at $1.35 despite a significant year-over-year revenue decline related to the discontinuation of MoneyPak and a lower revenue from the private label portfolio.
With everyone's great efforts, our acquisitions were able to fill in the large void caused by the declines in our legacy business lines and serve to maintain and even grow our year-over-year financial results while we continue to invest in all the cool new things that are designed to get our private label program and our cash transfer businesses back on track.
Now with those new products rolling out as we speak and all the new cost saving initiatives and new products being deployed now and through the rest of the year, we believe we're in really good shape to have all the pots boiling at the same time as we exit 2016, both legacy business lines and acquired entities delivering revenue, and our platform and processing investments delivering expense savings allowing the consolidated Green Dot to deliver material EPS growth.
My thanks to our leadership teams at TPG and AccountNow, in particular, for their terrific efforts. I also want to call out Renee Opell who is an operations leader in our Enterprise Product Delivery office, who spearheaded the integration efforts for AccountNow and AchieveCard.
The integration efforts on just those acquisitions alone delivered an additional approximate $13 million of adjusted EBITDA through the end of the fourth quarter of the year, starting within just a few months of closing those deals. I think that result is a testament to not only the strength of our operating team, but also to the efficiency of the Green Dot operating platform which we believe has a lot more efficiency still to come.
Now I'd like to talk about Green Dot's six-step plan to get to $1.75 or better of EPS in 2017. As background, Green Dot's card business is based on portfolio economics. We have millions of cardholders in different vintages within the portfolio. So when something happens, good or bad, it takes time for that event to unfold and the results to be seen, so when you roll out lower fee cards for example, it might take six months or more for those lower fee cards to become a large enough mix of the portfolio to start actually pushing overall portfolio revenue lower. The reverse is also true. When you do something good like replace the older lower fee cards with new more profitable cards, like we just got done doing on Walmart and like we are about to do everywhere else, it also takes some time, about six months or so, from launch for those new cards to become a big enough part of the mix to start pushing revenue higher and then build upward momentum from there.
So with that in mind, here's our simple six-step plan. Number one, launch new, more appealing prepaid products with materially better unit economics at all 100,000 Green Dot retailers. This is already completed at Walmart with all remaining major retailers completed by April. Number two, bring back MoneyPak with new risk controls. The new MoneyPak is expected to be on sale in the first half of the year. Number three, launch high-potential initiatives that map to our strategic roadmap. An example would be the Green Dot Money project or the secured credit card project.

Number four, launch major platform initiatives that drive around $11 million or more in expense reductions in 2016. For example, the new risk and call center platforms and further integrations of our acquisitions. Number five, make opportunistic and accretive acquisitions using cash or debt. For example, there're still a handful of attractive prepaid assets that remain in the market. And last but certainly not least, number six, continue to buy back stock at a rate of $50 million annually.
So with that plan in mind, let's talk about what's already well in process to achieve that goal of $1.75 in 2017. There's not enough time to go into detail on all the things we're doing, but I would like to share a few of the bigger news items on the call today and then encourage you to review the investor deck for more detailed information.
First, Green Dot Bank received regulatory approval in late January to use its bank charter to engage in consumer lending. The ability to engage in certain lending activities enables the bank to increase its profit contribution to the consolidated Green Dot over time and can help increase our brands' relevance and importance to our customer segment. Green Dot Bank's first lending product on a national scale will be the Green Dot Bank secured credit card.
Next, Green Dot's new lending marketplace initiative, Green Dot Money, is in development with plans to launch in summer. While it's in the early stages of development, we believe this initiative has the potential to generate increased customer loyalty and high margin revenue from placement fees paid to Green Dot by the marketplace lenders who are successfully paired with borrowers. We also think the lending marketplace concept is a really smart way for us to provide unsecured credit to our customer base without putting our company and our bank at risk. Unsecured lending, especially to consumers with low FICO scores, is very risky business.
Both Green Dot Money, the loans, both the upside and the downside belong to the marketplace lenders who are experienced and confident in their ability to underwrite low income consumer. Green Dot's role would simply be the matchmaker – no capital at risk.
Next, we have some distribution partners to announce. First, Green Dot is pleased to welcome OneMain Financial to our family of Green Dot partners. OneMain customers will soon be given the option to place their loan proceeds on a co-branded prepaid card in lieu of getting the loan on a check or traditional bank deposit.
Taking the loan proceeds on a Green Dot card allows the customer to access their loan proceeds more quickly and conveniently and free of charge at any of our free ATMs and elsewhere. OneMain issues a lot of loans with a lot of GDV annually, and so this has the potential to become a nice sized program for us. OneMain is a great company and a highly pro consumer lender, and I want to thank Dave Hogan and Jay Levine for their partnership.
Next, since last quarter, Green Dot signed a number of new retail stores and new check cashing locations. In particular, I'd like to welcome AAFES, the Army and Air Force Exchange Service, to the list of Green Dot retail locations. America's military service men and women represent a large customer segment for Green Dot's products and services, and we are so proud to now be available on base for America's military personnel and their families.
On the product front, we have completed the launch of the new Walmart MoneyCard product and the new Green Dot Everyday Visa product at all Walmart stores nationwide. Both prepaid products launched on time and on budget and offer superior features for customers and superior unit economics for Green Dot compared to all previous MoneyCard and Green Dot card versions in the past.

The rollouts of the new Green Dot Everyday prepaid cards, both MasterCard and Visa, and the new Green Dot 5% Cash Back Debit Card will be at Green Dot's remaining 90,000 or so retail locations on schedule and on budget with substantially all retailer stock in the new products by the end of April.
The rollout of the new MoneyPak product is on schedule to launch in the first half of the year. The new MoneyPak with mobile and web-based risk controls is designed to help us safely win back former users of the original MoneyPak product.
And TPG, Green Dot's tax refund processing subsidiary, rolled out a new Green Dot prepaid card integration where customers of EROs using TPG's refund processing services are offered the opportunity to receive their tax refund on a Green Dot prepaid card. Additionally, select customers can receive up to a $750 advance of their tax refund amount loaded to that Green Dot prepaid card. The program rolled out in January to a select group of independent tax preparers nationwide.
In Q4, Green Dot completed the first wave of account conversions from its legacy TSYS processing platform to its new MasterCard PTS processing platform. This wave consisted of approximately 33 million consumer records or approximately 30% of all accounts on file.
Migrating so many millions of customers with so many billions of dollars in deposits is not something you do with haste. Green Dot's customer size makes it a top 20 debit card issuer. So we've definitely taken our time to make sure we get it right. Nevertheless, we're on track to complete the remaining conversion waves over the course of 2016. Once completed, starting in 2017 on a full-year basis, the net savings, in other words what we'll save annually versus what we spend cumulatively on development and the portion we'll depreciate annually, is expected to generate a positive $0.09 of incremental non-GAAP EPS in 2017, growing as volumes grow in future years.
And lastly, but not certainly least, since Q4, Green Dot completed an additional $10 million in share buybacks as part of the company's previously announced $150 million repurchase authorization. So far in the first six months since the buyback program received regulatory approval, Green Dot has repurchased $50 million of its shares. The company is committed to executing the remaining $100 million over the next 24 months.
On the topic of capital, as a general rule, we haven't talked a lot about Green Dot Bank. But it's probably a good time to give you some insight into why we feel our bank is such an important and strategic part of Green Dot. A bank is the entire regulatory underpinning of any prepaid program. Relying on a small third-party bank to run your entire company is very risky as evidenced by the challenges at the prepaid industry's largest (12:55) rental banks.
Next, by being our own bank, we get to set our own risk policies and product roadmaps in accordance with regulation of course and good common sense. All the stuff we've done and plan to be doing with GoBank and all the new features on our prepaid cards and our ability to issue a secured credit card or the ability to legally operate Green Dot Money nationwide without spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on obtaining additional licenses is all an advantage of owning a bank.
Lastly, the bank saves Green Dot a lot of money every year. In 2015, Green Dot Bank contributed $21 million in pre-tax profit contribution to Green Dot Corporation through cost savings and interest income. This is money that our competitors pay to another bank that we get to pay to ourselves. On a tax-adjusted basis, this means the bank contributed around $0.25 per share in non-GAAP EPS to Green Dot in 2015, and we can expect it to contribute more in 2016 should volumes grow. In fact, our bank is a big reason why we believe our operating platform is so much more efficient than anyone else in our industry.

Now, of course, we do need to keep around $150 million in restricted cash tied up as Tier 1 capital. That's money we could use to buy back shares or otherwise invest. So let's look at that. If we sold the bank, we'd still need to hold around $50 million in restricted cash to hold as a security deposit for the third-party issuing bank and for certain state security bonds that non-banks typically need to carry. So, that would free up only $100 million.
Then, we need to pay that other bank the annual issuing fees that we currently pay to ourselves. So, on a purely financial comparison, putting aside all the risk and strategic benefit, we would either earn at least $21 million in pre-tax earnings every year and growing as volumes grow from that $100 million in freed up capital just to break even. So unless we think we could consistently generate an annual risk-free return of, say, $20 million to $30 million pre-tax or better on $100 million of capital, then perhaps we can feel justified in keeping that level of restricted cash in the bank.
Nevertheless, we do think our Tier 1 capital requirements are high and could come down over time. And we do believe the bank will have the opportunity to earn more money over time on new programs like lending, higher interest earnings on float and the like.
Green Dot's long-term strategic roadmap, the summary of which is in the IR deck that accompanies this call, has been a remarkably prophetic and resilient document over the years since we first started formulating the key concepts in preparation for becoming a bank holding company. It predicted the need for Green Dot to develop deep mobile expertise and become a fintech leader if it intended to be relevant to consumers in the future, with new key agreements and close high-value new opportunity.
It predicted the changing regulatory landscape and predicted the risk of relying on small third-party banks as the foundation for our business. It predicted the consolidation of the prepaid industry and the needs of reserve cash to make strategic acquisitions to grow and diversify as competition intensifies. It anticipated the need to invest in national marketing of the Green Dot brand name so that our products could have brand appeal and pricing power as the industry matured and the product itself became more commoditized.
Of course, we didn't get everything right. While we anticipated competition, we missed the timing and fortitude of that competition. In 2009 and 2010, as our plan was first being developed, who could have guessed that American Express would spend an estimated $1 billion trying to beat Green Dot.
We also missed the MoneyPak issue. In those days, victim-assisted fraud was not a defined term or a common activity. Luckily, our long-term strategic plan did predict two strategic outcomes exactly right. At number one, if we stuck to our plan and focused on long-term outcomes, when all the dust settled, Green Dot would reign supreme as the absolute hands-down undisputed champion of the prepaid wars; the best brand, the best products, the most customers, the most revenue, and the most profit.
And when the hard work was done, like recruiting the best team, buying a bank, becoming a fintech leader, creating the best products, building a great brand, diversifying revenue, renewing Walmart under a long-term agreement, that we would then be in a position to materially grow EPS.
While the 2013 private label fee changes and the 2015 MoneyPak discontinuation created a revenue Detour on our road to growth, make no mistake that with the launch of our new prepaid products and the many new initiatives underway, we are now back on the main highway and we absolutely intend to arrive in style at our destination of material EPS growth in future years. More than half of all American households have an annual income of less than $50,000 with this population segment getting bigger every year. This is Green Dot's customer base and we want to be their bank for prepaid cards, debit cards, checking accounts and now secured credit cards and, through our online lending market place, unsecured loans and perhaps even more over time.

Because of our team's collective long-term focus, strategic prowess, and operational discipline, we believe Green Dot has made it through the jungles of uncertainty and is now free to pursue its destiny as the bank of this America. Green Dot isn't a prepaid card marketer nor a prepaid card program manager. Green Dot is a big, growing, ubiquitously distributed and increasingly famous fintech-powered branchless bank. As Green Dot's largest shareholder, I believe our ability to now monetize all our hard work and drive material EPS growth is clear, obvious and well within reach.
And with that, I'll hand it over to Mark Shifke. Mark?
Mark L. Shifke - Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Steve. For the quarter, Green Dot posted $151 million in non-GAAP total operating revenue, $13 million in adjusted EBITDA, and $0.06 in non-GAAP earnings per share. The quarter ended up consistent with our financial guidance. In today's supplemental slides and earnings release, we provided select metrics, including the number of active cards, revenue per active card, processing and settlement revenue, and the number of processing and settlement transactions. As we manage the company today, we really focus on these metrics as primary drivers of revenue and profitability.
So, as you can derive from that data, our portfolio of active cards declined by 200,000 cards from the prior year period to 4.5 million cards in the fourth quarter this year. But as forecasted, fourth quarter actives were flat with the third quarter, reflecting signs of portfolio stabilization.
You will also notice that processing and settlement services revenue and total transactions also showed sequential stabilization from Q3 to Q4. So, between those two metrics – active cards and reloads – we believe that our customer base has now settled into a more stable position after all the noise from MoneyPak's removal last year.
We believe the revenue from those active cards is up on a consolidated basis, because the customers we lost were mostly casual users and the customers that remain are more committed customers who drive more GDV, spend in other revenue-generating activities.
Revenue in the quarter was essentially flat year-over-year, but the margin on that revenue was materially lower than a year ago, delivering just $13 million in adjusted EBITDA. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.06 for the quarter. These results were consistent with the guidance we provided on the third quarter earnings call.
There are two primary reasons for the lower margins in the quarter. First, this year, we had the additional expense of the higher commissions on the MoneyCard program. Second, the composition of the revenue this year is different than last, because our acquisitions accounted for approximately the same amount of revenue that our legacy business lost. So that's how we stayed even on the top line. While the acquired revenue from companies like AccountNow and Achieve (sic) [AchieveCard] (20:46) have good margins, consistent with our overall average margins across the company, the revenue we lost on our legacy business was high incremental margin delivered from our large legacy scale platform.
So the top line remained roughly flat, but the margin of the revenue we lost was much higher than the margin of the revenue that replaced it. When you lose incremental revenue on an at-scale platform, aside from variable cost, it comes right off the bottom line.
The good news is that the reverse is also true. So as our new cards with better unit economics begin flowing through our active card base this year and next, and as MoneyPak returns and generate sales, we would expect to see that incremental revenue, aside from the associated variable cost, also drop right to the bottom line.

Now, let's discuss our 2016 and some preliminary views on 2017 expectations. We entered 2016 with 4.5 million actives versus 4.7 million actives last year, and with a run rate of 9.7 million cash transfers versus 12.5 million cash transfers last year. Together, this creates a revenue headwind this year in the range of 5%.
So while we believe that the breadth and scale of our new organic initiatives, which are already underway can enable us to stop the declines in our legacy business, turn the corner and begin to grow over the course of 2016, we are not expecting very much absolute revenue growth in the aggregate this year, because we first need to grow enough to make up for that headwind.
In preparing our guidance, we believe we have made modest assumptions related to the key drivers in our consolidated business that you can review on page 11 of the investor deck. I also want to call out that this year we are incurring an unusual incremental launch expense of approximately $11 million for incremental packaging, production and merchandising costs.
These expenses are above and beyond normal product merchandising levels, because it includes a complete removal and destruction of old product as well as the placement of new product at nearly all 100,000 Green Dot retail locations. This expense does not repeat in 2017. Given the nature of these expenses, we will provide guidance both with and without those expenses included in adjusted EBITDA.
Given all of this, we are providing the following guidance for 2016: For full year total non-GAAP operating revenues to be between $700 million and $705 million. Adjusted EBITDA is forecast to be between $154 million and $158 million. Adjusted EPS is forecast to be between $1.35 and $1.40 per share. Both of these include the $11 million in expenses I just described. Excluding the one-time and unusual launch expenses, adjusted EBITDA is forecast to be between $165 million and $169 million and non-GAAP EPS to be between $1.48 and $1.53 a share.
In terms of capital management, we have already repurchased an additional $10 million of stocks since Q4, in addition to having completed our $40 million ASR last year. We anticipate completing another $50 million of purchases this year. Any future share repurchase activity is not included in our EPS guidance. We are assuming approximately 52 million average diluted shares outstanding in our adjusted EPS forecast.
For 2017, we expect to build on the momentum from 2016. As you'll see in the supplemental slides that accompany this presentation, we've identified a six-step plan to drive earnings per share growth to achieve $1.75 in non-GAAP EPS in 2017. We expect revenue growth in 2017 will benefit from a full year of all the new products being in market. We expect also to benefit from $20 million in cost savings that flow from a full year of actions we're taking in 2016, as well as a new processor relationship, ongoing savings from the GoBank technology platform, efficiencies from new risk and call center technologies, and further integration of previously acquired entities.
To sum it up, we believe 2016 represents the end of Detour. While the headwinds still weigh on our legacy business throughout 2016, we can see a recovery in sight, if all goes as planned with material EPS growth in 2017.
As we think about Q1 expectations, tax season plays a big part in our Q1 results, both because of the way tax refunds impact card sales and interchange from the GDV provided by tax refunds to our customers, but also because the tax season is the bread and butter of our tax refund processing subsidiary, TPG.
Nearly, all of that division's revenue and earnings happens between January and April. This year, as you have no doubt read in the news, the IRS has intentionally slowed down refund disbursements and checks sent out and as of earlier this week with about 30% behind the same date last year in disbursements.

So our year-over-year comps to-date at TPG and for the prepaid sales related to tax season are a bit hard to read. Ultimately, all the tax refunds get processed and all the refunds get disbursed, but the timing this year is clearly way different than last. So it could be that some checks and disbursements to cards flows into the year more in March and April than it did last year.
In any event, based on IRS disbursement trendings to-date and our understanding of how checks and refunds will flow out of the IRS over the next 45 days, we are estimating that we will end up delivering around 30% of our full year mid-point revenue expectation of $703 million to come in Q1, with any timing difference on tax refund-related revenue being pushed into April.
Now, let's go to the phones for Q&A.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. As a courtesy, we please ask that you limit yourself to one question and a single follow-up. If you have further questions, you may reenter the question queue. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. And our first question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. Please go ahead.
Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Hi, Sanjay. Hello?
Operator
Hi, Mr. Sakhrani. Are you there? Your phone may be muted.
Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yeah, I'm sorry. Can you hear me now?
Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Hi, Sanjay.
Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Right. Okay. Thanks for all the color. I guess, I'm just trying to figure out how we should think about the core growth going forward. I understand 2016 has some headwinds, but maybe as we look out to 2017, how should we think about your revenue growth profile and kind of the EBITDA margins you could achieve?
Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
You mean on the legacy business or the consolidated enterprise?
Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Consolidated enterprise.
Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, so I'll give you our aspirational growth. It's always hard for any CEO to come up with guidance for the long term that's taken specifically. So let me give you our aspiration. The double-digit number, that 10% growth, is what we aspire to. We hit it and exceeded it, as you know, this year despite our legacy business having some challenges, a lot of challenges, but that was through acquisitions.
Our macro prepaid our core heritage Green Dot, that macro is not growing as fast as it used to grow. So that means for us to hit that 10% number we have to have other products and services. That's why Green Dot Money is so important. That's why the ability to have credit is so important and some of the other new tactics that we have out there, better merchandising or promotions or marketing. But aspirationally, that 10% number is what we stuck to. We've hit it many years. Some other years we've not. But that still is our aspiration long term.
Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
When we think about the margins of the business?
Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, I've said this for many, many years and I'll say it again because it's true. Anything without a 2 before it is not appropriate for a business. Three of the past four years had a 2 in front of it. 2013 maybe did not. Maybe that was 17% or 18%. But in every other year over the past four years, we've hit it. We hit it again in 2015. We are forecast to easily hit it again in this year for our company in 2017. So we're always looking at that number as a guide and a gauge of our success. We want it to be in the 20%s; and how big in the 20%s, how far up can we go in the 20%s depends on our ability to continue to create efficiencies and grow revenue on our scale platform.

Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
(29:46)
Mark L. Shifke - Chief Financial Officer
Hey, Sanjay. It's Mark. I just was going to echo and just further step up (29:51) what Steve has said. I think we have some tailwinds pushing us in the direction of nice margin. As we're going into the year, our products have higher unit economics both on card and cash transfer. And we're realizing the benefits of our investments in technology. So we are looking over time to seeing increasingly greater gross margins.
Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay, great. And just my follow-up on a unit economic increase that you guys are seeing. It looks like AMEX is retrenching from prepaid and I noticed some of the slides at the back of your deck kind of speak to their spacing relative to yours. Is that allowing you to take up the unit cost and how do you compare relative to your peers in terms of cost for card?
Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
One of the biggest – great question and one that is fun to answer, because I think we've done such a great job here. One of the biggest early strategic concepts we had, going back years ago on the strategic roadmap, was that every business – look, we invented the product, right, but every business at some point commoditizes. Nobody is special forever.
So we have to invest in the brand, give Green Dot some star power, make it important so you're not just a piece of plastic hanging on the shelf. We've done that really, really quite well. I don't think anybody questions the power of the brand. And that means, when people go up to the rack, they see value in the Green Dot brand beyond the fact that it's a prepaid card just like you think Kellogg's brand Frosted Flakes may be a better quality than Uncle John's (31:25) Frosted Flakes or something else.
So, for that reason, we've done a really good job with being able to have pricing power. And if you look at the slide deck, that goes along with this call, we have photographs front and back. All of our fees are always on the back of the package. So consumers can easily see them, and you can easily see them as an investor. And if you take a look at the fees, what you'll notice is that they are higher than our old products but still below the market.
In other words, if you think of the high watermark as net spend, so that'd be the highest price on the market, it used to be that we are way rock-bottomed than the other (31:55) people in the middle. We're now sort of in the middle, and that's been still on top and nobody is really less at this point except for our own products, which would be the Walmart MoneyCard, which is still the lowest priced product in the market.
So we've been able to increase pricing power, and we think that that's going to be really helpful and beneficial to us over time. At the same time, I want to be clear about this, we've added a lot of value to the card. So this isn't like we raised pricing and said, hey, that's the end of that. A Green Dot prepaid card today or a Walmart MoneyCard could be, Sanjay, your checking account. It has all the same features better because frankly our mobile apps are better likely than the bank you're using, unless you're using Chase which has a really good mobile app, but our mobile app is really, really good.
And the features on it, the ability to deposit checks and look at your budget and use an embedded FDIC-insured savings account and all the ATMs and everything else, it's a really great product that increasingly has more value for our consumer. So, yes, the pricing has come up aligned with some more margin, but the features and the value have also come up for the consumer as well.
Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.

Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question will come from Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi. Thanks for all the details. I guess, my question, kind of, building on what Sanjay was asking about. Just the visibility into some of these things. I guess the cost side, I think it sounds like you have some good visibility there, but just with the price changes and I don't know if the elasticity has changed and then you got MoneyPak 2.0 coming out, a lot of new stuff coming up on the rack (33:30) where do you have high visibility versus low visibility? Can you write that (33:34) maybe for us and give us an idea on the range of outcomes?
Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I think so. Whenever you're launching so many new products, you really have to be thoughtful and careful. Nothing at Green Dot is on a whim or pulled out of your left pocket or something like that, because we're highly regulated enterprise. Everything's got to be thoughtfully worked out. Have a lot of research behind it, a lot of operational dress rehearsal, if you will. And that's no different with these cards. So we've actually been in the market undercover for some time at a large number of 7-Eleven stores and CVS stores with a higher price card to see what would happen.
In those cases, we're actually charging a higher fee than we ended up charging, just to see what is the elasticity, how would those play out. We also did a price increase some time ago for other services with a large segment of customers about a year and a half ago. So we've been planning this for a very long time. And we wanted to see what would happen over the course of the year or year and a half if we took the fee from $5.95 to $7 95 and we researched that. So between our actual in-market test for the last number of months and the fee changes we did about a year and a half ago, we have a good sense for what happens with the behavior which the answer is, nothing. It stays exactly the way it is. And so we think we are in good shape there. We've been on sale for about 20 days, something like that at Walmart. And that's been going well also. So we think we have good visibility into what the fee collection will be, how the early acquisition rates will be for these cards.
Now, what don't we know? Behavioral curves and retention happens over time. It's just been (35:08). You have to build your cohorts. So it's going to take us some months to get to a six-month cohort or a nine-month cohort to see how these cards are performing in relation to other cards. The only data we have is what we did with the fee changes we did a year and a half ago. So there is some risk there. It could be that there's something about these cards that in a year look different, a year in rears than what we think. But so far so good and they've been fairly well researched. So we think we are pretty good on that. That we have the most visibility in, so I'd rank that, Tien-Tsin, number one, most visibility.
MoneyPak, we are budgeting and thinking very little about because we just don't know. There's an example where the visibility is not clear. We know that people still look for the product. We know that everybody knows the name of the product. We know there's still a market for the product. How quickly will people come back? How will it be adopted? We don't know so that we've sort of weighed down in our modeling, right?
And then the initiatives with the least amount of visibility meaning the ones that we have to wait to find out would be Green Dot Money and the secured credit card. It makes incredible sense on paper, right? We have so many millions of people who come to our websites every month, who call our call centers every month and we know that through research and actually trying it, we have a credit pilot that's been going on for about three months. We know that when people see the opportunity to apply for credit, our customers will do that quickly. So we don't have a lot of risk on how many folks are filling out an application. That we feel pretty good about.

What we don't know is, with our marketplace lenders, the average approval rate in other channels is about 20%. So that's in fact what the approval rate is in real life. In our marketplace, will there be something about our customer base that is less underwritable than other low income populations or is there something about the use of the Internet where you'll get a lot of garbage applications that are not able to be translated to something underwritable? That you don't know, right?
So we need to figure out the underwriting approval rate and how that model plays out. So I think that would be the one that is most speculative but a really safe bet, I guess, you'd say, and then the one that we're most sure about as are the ones that we're rolling out right now, which is our card products, because we know how they perform. They're in the market. We know what the fees are. And after 15 years of experience, we understand how to model the monthly fees.
Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's good to know. Just a quick follow-up there. Just on the sales and marketing front then, just to make sure these things get out there and the education as such, is that budgeted in there and how much flex is there on your sales and marketing for advertising?
Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
So any marketing expense we plan on spending is part of that adjusted EBITDA forecast that Mark just gave you. And, again, at this point, the company is large enough and our marketing program's flexible enough where there is no incremental marketing needed for it in terms of spend. I mean, Tien-Tsin, to give you a sense and I remember, I think, I had this stat at the investor conference we did together back in December, we have 10 million consumers who come to one of our website properties every month. Whether we want them to or not, they come for various reasons. They saw a TV ad. They're buying the card. They're checking their balance, whatever the case may be.
You have 13 million who call our worldwide call centers every year – every month, I'm sorry. So every month, you have 13 million people talking to hopefully an IVR machine, a computer. If they go to a desktop and talk to an operator, they're talking to somebody in the Philippines or one of our remote facilities. And there's an opportunity to inform those people automatedly, in other words on the IVR, interested in a loan, go to greendotmoney.com. So we think that we have plenty of opportunity to get consumers to try our products just with that.
And lastly, we have this awesome relationship with Steve Harvey, who has really been a fabulous spokesperson for us in terms of the scores, how it's working, the notoriety. He does a great job with our product. And so there's always an opportunity to have him mention this product or any other. So, between all of our web properties and the size of our company and our installed customer base, we're feeling pretty good that there's no incremental marketing needed.
Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's good to know. Thanks Steve for the update.

Our next question will come from Ramsey El-Assal from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC
Sure. I guess my first question has to do with Harvest Capital's activist campaign to put new directors on the board. How have you responded to them?
Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Well, it's a good question and I appreciate it, and I guess here – well, let me think how to describe it. Firstly, I'm quite sincere in saying that we appreciate Harvest's activism in our stock and that's not to say I agree with all of Jeff Osher's points or his conclusions. But I suppose the job of the activist is to say and write sensational things of solicited reaction and I actually don't take it personally.

Will the Harvest filing make us a better company, will it make me a better CEO? I actually think it will. We're certainly all paying attention, that's for sure. And being open to a wide variety of input, criticism, opinions and perspectives is a really good thing and I've taken the underlying meaning of every one of Harvest comments seriously even if I don't take Jeff's actual words or conclusion seriously.
So it any event, Green Dot has a good board. We have some very seasoned folks on the board as you know. And we've talked about the most appropriate things we can do. And here is what we decided. First and foremost, we all agreed that the best thing we can do for ourselves and our shareholders is to continue to execute our plan and grow EPS because nothing succeeds like success. We feel we've done a very good job of strategically guiding our company to a great place over many years and now we are in a position to show Harvest and all of our investors what we can do.
Next, from a tactical perspective, we think it's a fair statement that we could benefit from expanding our board and seeking to invite different perspectives. People may not realize this, but we have new faces on the board. In fact, four out of the seven board members besides me are new to the company in just past few years. So it's not an all boys or actually we have a lot of women on the board, so not an all girls club or anything like that.
But we do like the idea of having some fresh faces and new perspectives to help guide the ship. And to that end, it's a good time to tell you that we have decided to increase the size of our board and expand its membership. Mary Dent from our non-gov committee did in fact call Jeff Osher at Harvest and then our board also sent Harvest a letter, letting them know that we are expanding our board and that would very much like Harvest to help us recruit new members and for them to suggest some names of candidates who they feel would be great additions to our board. In other words, whether or not there's a proxy fight down the road, if there is great people, let us have the names, we can put them on without a proxy fight and save everyone a lot of money and we can make that as part of a committee selection process.
But we also think that many of our top 10 shareholders would also have great ideas for superstar board members for Green Dot. Green Dot is such a cool and important company that I'm sure many talented people would love to serve on our board and so to that end, Mark and I and others from Green Dot's Board will be calling and meeting with our top 10 shareholders to get their thoughts on all of this and to see if they can introduce us to some great board members who would be rock stars and who could add value. So that's sort of where we left it. And beyond that, we're hoping that our performance over time will speak for itself.
Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC
This is kind of a related question. There was some press out recently about you guys potentially exploring strategic alternatives. I guess, I know this is a tough thing to comment on and I have a feeling of what you might say. But can you comment on the validity of reports and is there any kind of formal process in place to look at strategic alternatives for the company?
Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, I kept leaving – I keep leaving post-it notes in Jamie Dimon's bathroom saying, when you get time, call please (42:47), but he hasn't responded yet. The answer is, clearly I can't comment on rumors in the press. We'll look at what can I say. Let me say it this way. The answer is, no. We've not hired a banker to explore options to sell the company. We're working with a banker as part of what you do when you have a 13B filing, and that's part of the normal protocol but not for the purpose of selling the company.

But at the same time, look, I'm the largest shareholder of the company by far. I've bought shares over the years, about $4.5 million of extra shares personally, and on top of that, I haven't sold shares since November of 2010. So it's five years. So, clearly, I, like every other investor, has an obligation and a desire to maximize their value. So, I guess, what I'm trying to say is, while we're not preparing coffee cake and tea for the open house or anything like that at Green Dot, of course, as Chairman of the Board and largest shareholder, of course, as a board with heavyweight people like we have on the Green Dot Board, would we be open to offers, would we have conversations, are we open-minded to that topic? Of course. It'd be silly to say we're not. Is it something that we're pursuing? No.
Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC
Okay, great. I appreciate your responses.
Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Sure. You bet.

Our next question will come from Ashish Sabadra from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Steve, thanks for the incremental color. Just quickly, Mark, you talked about revenue for the first quarter, but just as we think about the cadence for the full year, I understand you don't want to give quarterly guidance. But just thinking about the cadence as the headwinds anniversary and new products come on, how should we think about the cadence on the revenue growth side?
Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
On the revenue growth side?
Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Yeah.
Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
You mean how we grow through the quarters, you mean?
Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Yeah.
Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Oh, gosh, we're so seasonal. Well, (44:41) I don't mean to step on it, but...
Mark L. Shifke - Chief Financial Officer
Look, I think the way we have thought about this is, we were really focusing a little bit on where is the first quarter likely to come out relative to where it did last year and thinking about how tax season is somewhat off this year than it was last year. I think last year, something – a little over 30% of our overall revenue showed up in Q1, and something – over 50% of our EBITDA was in Q1 as well. And I think this year we're seeing, with the delay of tax, that it's going to be more like 30% or less of our revenue and probably 40% to 45% of our EBITDA will be in Q1. And what's not showing up in Q1, we are expecting to show up in Q2.
And then, during the course of the year, as Steve was – earlier alluded to, as you see a portfolio build, what you're looking at is a combination of old cards are trading, new cards coming on, the new cards coming on at higher unit economics and the more they season, the greater the revenue and the greater the EBITDA. So you would see that growing and we would expect our exit rate at the end of 2016 to be above our entrance rate.
Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
That's sort of why 2017, the sort of overview color that Mark gave comes together fairly easily when you build your own models and we try to give you all enough information on this call to build your model and follow along at home and this way you can see where we are. At the end of the year, we're cutting expenses, but at the same time increasing the revenue being delivered from the portfolio, so revenue is going up as the year goes on, expenses coming down as the year goes on.
During the Detour periods at Green Dot, it was exactly opposite of that and that is expenses are going up as we invested in technology and did all these cool things, but at the same time revenue is going down so we had the worst of both worlds and now we are going back into a more normalized rhythm. If you check in your page, you just (46:41) find helpful I think, it's page 18 of our investor deck, is a chart. It only shows our legacy business. It doesn't show the consolidated entity, but this is I think really what you're talking about. That's our cards business – our retail cards business. And it shows you what happened to our legacy revenue when we discontinued MoneyPak. It goes all the way down. It shows that it bottoms out in Q4 2015. Because of the seasonality of tax, it comes a little bit up and then you start having our new products sell and populate the portfolio with higher fee cards and then we are forecast to hit the end of the Detour in Q2 2016. In other words, we think we will still have pain as you have the old cards in our portfolio and then the reverse course has started going up in Q2 2016. So that's sort of the plan of how the year shapes up because of the new initiatives and the new cards. Does that make sense?

Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Yeah, no. It does and thanks. That's very helpful. Maybe just a quick follow-up would be the comments on 2017. When you talked about the EPS of $1.75, what were your revenue assumptions around to get to that EPS number? And then if there were any delays in the product launches or anything, could you still make it up through margin expansion? So a two-point question around what's the revenue assumption and then if there is any delays, could you still make up that number?
Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. That's a great question. I think the way we're thinking about this is looking at things as if we had a 24-month year in front of us and that 2017 was just a natural progression of where we are exiting 2016 and continuing. So we actually will say, look, to get to $1.75, we're not going to assume anything special happens just because we changed to a new year, but instead we would just continue, as the portfolio ramps.
And then, on the margin side, we already have visibility into $20 million of efficiencies in part. We had one-time costs for supply chain launch, and we've paid for that already. We're not looking to pay for that out of future profitability. But as a management team, we've come together and figured out the way to drive efficiencies on the front-end and then realized the benefit, as revenue grows over time.
Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
No. That's helpful. And maybe then a final question would be on the buyback. You mentioned $50 million of potential buyback this year. Just in terms of the buyback, is it going to be more opportunistic or expecting to spread it out through the year?
Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. That's a great question. We intentionally have left our EPS guidance without effect for the buyback, because, of course, you know EPS would be impacted by both the timing of when we bought back shares and the price at which we bought back shares. All things being equal, we would prefer to buy sooner rather than later to have more of an impact on this year and next.
Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Thanks. Thanks for the color.
Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Sure.

Our next question will come from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Great. Thanks. So, I guess, the question I had for you was, you have a number of these new initiatives with regards to what the bank side of the enterprise can do. Can you talk a little bit about the capital requirements as well as the cash flow expectations this year and next?
Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Sure. You mean at the bank itself or the consolidated business?
Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Both. I was just kind of wondering with regards to what sort of investments you would need to make in order to launch all of these products and then on (50:36)
Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, so, the great news is, any CapEx, and we have Jess Unruh here, who is our Chief Accounting Officer, CapEx peaks, as we start rolling out just these – the process and the other things that have been driving a lot of that. So we already have built into that CapEx the cost of anything we'd need to build for all of our products. And it's very, very little, because that's what we've been doing over the past three years.
So we've been working on the processor, the GoBank Product Technology Platform. By the way, let me talk about that, because nobody asked about it, but it's kind of important. The word GoBank is a product. In other words, you sell a product under the GoBank brand name. But it's also the underpinning guts, if you will, the technology platform that allows you to deposit a check or to do person-to-person payments or host an embedded savings account and sweep money back and forth. All of that, right?

Now, all of our prepay products sit on that same GoBank platform. If you were to buy a Walmart MoneyCard and download the mobile app, you would be shocked to see the similarities of GoBank, but that's allowed us to shutter, if you will, over time to shutter our old code that's 10 years plus old and retire those legacy processes, so we are saving a lot of money as opposed to spending money in investments. It sort of the opposite of what you think. In other words as we roll out new products, we are saving money, not spending money on the new products. The past three years were the spending years and now we are able to get to some of that money back in terms of ROI.
So whatever you see in the plan is already paid for. There is not a lot of incremental spending. We have a lot of technologists. We're able to do Green Dot Money in-house. If we need to bring in an occasional surge resource from a contractor, we do. But I don't think there's anything remarkable. Mark, what...
Mark L. Shifke - Chief Financial Officer
In fact – and consistent with that, I think we would expect for next year, our depreciation and amortization will actually be lower than it is for this year, so...
Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, (52:28).
Mark L. Shifke - Chief Financial Officer
I think that's consistent with the fact that we met our spend as we need to and we are not looking for incremental this year.
Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, the last two years has been just so punishing for a number of reasons. We are in this long-term strategic plan. You invest in this technology, you can't stop nor would it be smart to stop halfway through, you assemble teams and you are writing code and you are hitting certain timelines. And then the legacy business hits the skids with MoneyPak coming off the shelf and the private label portfolio with lower fees. So you have your highest level of CapEx spending in history for the company at the same time that you have the lowest level of revenue generation from the legacy business. So it was just the combination of those. We didn't plan it that way. It isn't what we thought would happen, but if you look in rears factually, that's what happened.
And so now it's just such a joy to be able to look forward and say, wow, the process will roll out over the next number of months. The new products are all in real life on the GoBank platform. They live, they exist, you can buy them and use them. That's been done. Green Dot Money is under deployment, and people are working at it. I was at our Shanghai tech facility a few weeks back going through what I'd call stack reviews, with all of our leaders out there who were showing me the various products and how it's coming along. So I think we're in better shape than we've been. No guarantees. You never know. I mean, anything can happen, I suppose. But this is certainly one of the better times we've felt in quite a while about the company.
Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
And when you think of entering into or engaging in consumer lending, a secured credit card seems like an interesting product. What is the risk profile of the consumer that you're targeting? And why would they choose to use Green Dot as opposed to – there are a number of bank and non-bank choices available nowadays. Any thoughts on just the competitive landscape within lending, which seems to be very busy?
Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yo, yeah. Well, so, look, as it relates to unsecured lending now, I'll tell you about the secured card in a minute. Unsecured lending, that we don't have plans to do. Look, there is no question that our customers who we love – I mean our customers are our family, but just like maybe your crazy Uncle Bob at home or whatever, everyone (54:51). You have to know your customers like you know your family. And there is no question that a large percentage of our customers would love unsecured credit. There is also no question that they wouldn't pay us back oftentimes. So you have to be very careful with unsecured credit.

And so I think we have – we're under a great idea with Green Dot Money, because it's a lending marketplace that does not use Green Dot Bank's capital or the holding company's capital. It's experienced lenders who have been doing lending to low FICO score consumers in many cases for 30 years, 40 years, 50 years. They know how to do that in a way that is risk-free for Green Dot. They know how to make money out of it. We know how to introduce to the customers, but there's no risk. So that's how we think about the unsecured part of our world.
On the secured card side of our word, just like the name implies, the customer actually makes a deposit in Green Dot Bank, a collateral deposit – a security deposit and their credit line on that card is equal to whatever they have deposited in the bank. The reason why Green Dot is such a natural fit for the product is, number one, people who are new to credit or people who have damaged credit are the people who are interested in a secured card. It helps build your credit. It helps establish a credit file if you're a young person. Let's say you turned 18 or 19, you're going to school. It's a great opportunity to build a credit file in a responsible way. But you always spend on the card equal to the collateral deposit you put into the bank. So there's no risk to the bank.
Now, what happens is, over time, every six months, we're going to evaluate that behavior. If the customer has paid as agreed, if they're staying within their credit line, if the transaction types are appropriate and all the other things you look at in the risk model, well, then you gradually raise their credit line so that it ultimately becomes an unsecured credit card. But it has training wheels for the first six months or so or maybe longer, so the bank has a really good understanding of who they're lending money to. That's how the product works.
For us at Green Dot, it's ideal because we also happen to own this massive Green Dot network location of 100,000 retailers where you can swipe a card, give money to the cashier, and that money magically appears in Green Dot Bank, right, or any other bank that's part of our network. That means that today, the way you get a secured credit card from a major bank and all of them sell it or most of them sell it, would have a secured card, you have to go to the branch. You have to somehow give them money, write a check, mom and dad has to write a check, if you've low income you have to get a check, we don't have a check. It's just not a great match for that kind of a product.
At Green Dot, our customers know how to load money on their prepaid card. I mean even with the MoneyPak issues, we have 39 million reloads at retail in 2015. So it's very logical to say the consumer, look, thank you for applying, you are automatically approved, here is your card, go to any Green Dot retailer, swipe it at the register and put however much money in your Green Dot Bank collateral account as you want and that will be a credit line and then perform well, we'll raise it, you will develop a credit history. So it's a very logical match. How big that is? How many consumers will have the discipline to put money away and perform? The answer is a lot will. A lot more will say they will, but won't. But ultimately we think it's a great add-on opportunity that's very consistent with our brand and our core products.
Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Great. One last quick question. When I look at the Harvest Capital presentation, right, and they obviously – they believe that EPS can get to $2.56 by 2018, which is basically something like $2.5 (58:13) on a ratable basis by 2017 and your counter is $1.75 (58:19). And so I am kind of looking at that and thinking is there – are they being overly aggressive in some of their assumptions? Are there things that they feel that should be done that you feel shouldn't be other than same bank capital. So trying to figure out the gap between – it's not often that you see an activist comes out with a number and management comes back and says here's a lower number.

Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Oh gosh, how do I say this because I want to be respectful and polite. Look, I think if you're the activist and I don't know I've never been an activist, we've been out this 15 years and I've never had anything like had happened, so I can't tell you I'm experienced at it. But my sense is that Harvest's job or any activist is to create excitement and thought around that process. But look, a lot of the things in the bridge slide that they have that shows the way to get to that EPS number, you just can't do. You can't loan 80%, even if you wanted to. You can't loan 80% of your customers unsecured credit without driving the company into insolvency in six months. You can't do that even if your regulators will let you do it, which they never let you do it anyhow. You can't lever up the balance sheet to do things that are not otherwise safe and secure in that way.
There's also other math that you'd have to look at and try to figure out the math is accurate. But I think – look, I think directionally what Harvest is saying is a fair point and that is, hey, look at, if you grow revenue and you cut expenses, that you should be able to do a better job at EPS than what you've done so far. And the answer is, they're right. We couldn't necessarily do it in previous years while you're rolling out new technology products and while your legacy business is melting like an ice cube. So you may not be able to do it then, but directionally they are right. But when you see some of the points they make, I'm actually in violent agreement with many of them. And that is roll out new products with better fee schedules, check, they're right. Cut expenses, check, they're right. Use the bank for other kinds of uses besides issuing prepaid cards, and now again, that's a regulated activity and we were lucky and fortunate to get approved by our regulars to lend, but we just can't go off and do that, right?
So I don't know what the difference is and it's probably not a great use or an appropriate use of my time to go through and I don't have the deck in front of me, so I forget what they have in there, but many of the objectives were just not things you can do credibly or easily, but forgetting about their number versus our number, the concept that should we be able to make more money and cut more money and therefore cut expenses and therefore deliver wider EPS, the answer is, yes, we should. Yes, we will. And that point is well taken even if the actual recommendations are not plausible. I guess, is that a fair way to answer it?
Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Yeah, yeah, I appreciate the detail. Thank you for that.
Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Sure.
Steven W. Streit - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Okay. Folks, I think we're done for the day. I don't have a watch in front of me, but my cell phone says we're done. Thank you all for listening. We appreciate it.

Green Dot’s Steven Streit: The prepaid card king | Fortune.comManagementSearchSearchKatie CouricIt’s the End of the Katie Couric Era at YahooDivorceAnthony Scaramucci’s Wife Has Reportedly Filed for DivorceCOMPARECARDSSPONSOREDFortune 500Amazon Has a New Way For You To Pick Up PackagesGreen DotGreen Dot’s Steven Streit: The prepaid card kingCharles P. WallaceSep 02, 2011Fast-growing Green Dot has Wal-Mart as an investor. But its stock keeps falling. FORTUNE -- Not many fledgling entrepreneurs could survive the discovery that their brainchild was a flop. But Steven W. Streit, 49, had a eureka moment that turned his fortunes around. In 1999, Streit, a former adult-contemporary radio programmer, started a business called iGen in the bedroom of his Monrovia, Calif., apartment. The goal: to give teenagers a debit card loaded with prepaid cash so that they could shop online.When the card was rolled out, kids didn't show much interest but adults who couldn't get checking accounts or credit bought the cards in droves, using them for such prosaic tasks as paying household bills. "I thought, 'We have the right product, just the wrong target market,' so we retooled," Streit recalls.Streit rechristened the company Green Dot (gdot), got backing from Silicon Valley venture firm Sequoia Capital, and now is the largest provider of prepaid debit cards to the "underbanked" in America, a class estimated at 73 million people. Green Dot went public in 2010: Sequoia's original $5.8 million stake is now worth around $270 million.Its breakthrough came in 2005 when Wal-Mart (wmt) partnered with it for the Walmart MoneyCard, which customers load with money when they cash a paycheck or tax refund at a Wal-Mart. The retailer now accounts for 60% of Green Dot's revenue, which hit $117 million in 2011's first quarter, up 26% over 2010. With 4.3 million cards outstanding, it is far ahead of its closest rival, netSpend (ntsp), with 2.3 million. Wal-Mart was so impressed that it bought 9% of the company last year. Even the U.S. Treasury has started a pilot program to issue tax refunds on Green Dot cards.Yet Green Dot is facing some strong headwinds. Competition is heating up: American Express (axp) is introducing its own prepaid card and commercial banks are hinting they will join the fray. Although the AmEx card appears aimed at a niche market a way for people with normal checking accounts to give money to college kids, for example it is charging minimal fees. That could mean trouble for Green Dot, which charges to buy the cards and reload them, then adds a monthly maintenance fee. Now Florida's attorney general is investigating prepaid firms to see whether they fully disclose their charges. Green Dot insists it does.Legislative changes are another uncertainty. The Durbin Amendment tucked into the Dodd-Frank Act specifically excluded prepaid cards from its limits on how much banks can charge for processing debit card transactions, because they serve the low-income market. That could change if prepaid cards become more widely accepted.All those doubts have had a dampening effect on Green Dot's stock, which is selling at $27, about 24% below its IPO price of $36. That's down from $65 just a few months ago. "There is a lot of controversy over the stock because of doubts about future growth," says Tien-tsin Huang, a banking analyst at J.P. Morgan, who nonetheless has an overweight on the company. Streit says he welcomes new competitors because he believes they will expand the category. But the pressure may force him to conjure up yet another eureka moment.This article is from the September 5, 2011 issue of Fortune.Customer ServiceSite MapPrivacy PolicyAdvertisingAd ChoicesTerms of UseYour California Privacy RightsCareers© 2017 Time Inc.

Executive Spotlight






Steven W. Streit
   	 			Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President


Executive Profile Series with Steven W. Streit from Green Dot
Steven W. Streit is Green Dot's founder, and has served as the President and a director since October 1999, as Chief Executive Officer since January 2001 and as Chairman since February 2010. He also served as our Secretary from October 1999 to April 2000 and as our Treasurer from October 1999 to April 2004. Streit recently spoke with PaymentsJournal regarding Green Dot's current view on the market.PJ: How has Green Dot’s role in the prepaid market evolved over the years? SS: Back in 2001, Green Dot’s GPR card was originally introduced to provide teens, who did not have access to a credit card, the ability to shop online. When we began selling the cards at retail, we quickly learned that the product was instead being sought out by individuals who were looking for the benefits of plastic but didn’t qualify for credit cards or checking accounts. Over the past 11 years, we have seen the product evolve into an everyday financial solution for many of our customers who are seeking a reliable “portable” bank account that suits their everyday needs. We have seen evidence of that through the increased use of direct deposit, as well as the number of individuals who are benefitting each month by meeting one of our usage-based fee waiving criteria. As we continue to evolve as a company, we continue to stay true to Green Dot’s core belief that financial products should be convenient, transparent and easy to use. PJ: More players are entering the prepaid market such as American Express and Chase. U.S. Bank has been pushing its general purpose reloadable product for some time. With that said, will the market see contraction or consolidation among providers in the near future?SS: We see the interest from mainstream banks as a benefit to the industry, as it lends additional credibility to the industry and raises awareness of the product category to an even wider segment of consumers. We believe there is significant demand for prepaid financial services, particularly in households making less than $75,000 annually, and that this growing market can support the need for various competing products in the marketplace. That being said, we do expect to see tougher times for smaller providers, whether that be consolidation or elimination. We believe that Green Dot’s reputation for low-fee financial solutions and its strong brand and retail distribution network position us well to compete with newer players in the space and we continue to see an opportunity to grow our business over time. PJ: With Green Dot as a vertically integrated supplier (bank for issuing, processor for payments), what advantage does that give the company in the marketplace. SS: The acquisition of Green Dot Bank is a key part of our ability to provide better products at lower costs to our customers. The ability to issue cards from Green Dot Bank, sell those cards through our retail distribution network of more than 60,000 retailers and offer reload services via our Green Dot Network, provides us with a uniquely differentiated model that allows us to better control our cost structure, improve our speed to market, and better control our compliance obligations. PJ: Where does Green Dot see the opportunities to expand its customer base?SS: We believe that many of our recently announced programs—such as AARP (older Americans), RushCard (those who identify w/ Russell Simmons) and Sallie Mae (college students)—expand our reach into new segments of consumers within our target demographic. We are also in the process of developing a mobile-centric checking account that we believe will address many of the key pain points felt by a very large customer base of individuals who are frustrated with big banks. We believe Green Dot has a unique opportunity to be that financial solution for these consumers.PJ: Given the focus of consumer groups and regulators around cardholder complaints, what can Green Dot and/or the industry do to address systemic issues such as ACH clearance and address such complaints that are now visible to the public thanks to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau?SS: Green Dot has always had a robust complaint resolution process and we take customer input- good and bad- very seriously. With social media so prominent, I think it’s fair to say that complaints on any product or service have already been public for some time. We’re pleased to have an A+ BBB rating and very strong customer satisfaction scores and the ongoing monitoring and reporting of complaints will help us improve even more. PJ: What mobile initiatives is Green Dot pursuing at the moment that it can share? When do you think mobile remote deposit capture will be generally available to cardholders?SS: We believe mobile banking will play an increasingly important role for consumers’ everyday banking needs. We have seen very encouraging adoption and usage trends for the mobile apps we have launched for our GPR platform. Since we have become a bank holding company, we have been working on a mobile-centric checking account product and we expect to launch the product commercially sometime in 2013. PJ: Economic conditions, increased marketing and strong consumer adoption has pushed GPR into a mainstream product. However, is the industry still faced with challenges around retention? SS: Retention is an important puzzle that no company in GPR has really figured out yet. Part of the challenge is that many customers like the “no-commitment” nature of the prepaid card and many others intentionally purchase the product for a single need or purpose. So, retention for these customer segments is likely to be somewhat elusive. However, fortunately, there are many other GPR customers who use the card as a checking account substitute and become long term users of the product. We believe that the right mix of pricing and features will continue to help grow this “retaining” segment of customers over time. PJ: Looking forward, what are your expectations for consumer-based prepaid products?SS: Our expectation is that the product will become increasingly mainstream and more broadly distributed in many different channels. Over time, this means products will likely have lower prices, more features and higher utility for customers. We believe Green Dot is well positioned for the future and are excited to be the leader in such an exciting and dynamic segment of financial services.About Steven W. StreitMr. Streit created the pricing, packaging, and technology strategies for the sales and marketing of prepaid association-branded cards that today serves as the industry standard at Green Dot. He served as Chief Executive Officer of Green Dot Bank. Prior to Green Dot, Mr. Streit was in the radio broadcasting business and served as a programming executive at a number of radio groups, most notably AMFM radio.
