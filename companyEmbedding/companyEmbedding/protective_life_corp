When do I need life insurance?

Major life events affect your life insurance needs. You might consider layering policies to have more coverage at certain times - such as when you have children at home or when you’re starting a business.  






























Life Insurance Trigger Events to Consider 


























 

New Job 

   

Employer-provided life insurance can't always go with you, but a personal policy will not be dependent upon your employment status.  
























 

Home Purchase 

   

Taking on a mortgage means you need to evaluate whether you have enough coverage to offset this new debt.  
























 

Marriage/ Divorce 

   

From reviewing the amount of coverage to changing beneficiaries, marriage or divorce is a critical time to reevaluate your life insurance needs.  




























 

Baby 

   

More kids likely means you need more coverage. You'll want to plan for your child's future financial needs.  
























 

New Business 

   

Covering a business owner can allow for a smooth transition if the worst happens.  
























 

Retirement 

   

You may find that life insurance becomes less about insuring your income and more about protecting assets as you near retirement.

History[edit]
In 1907, former Alabama governor William Dorsey Jelks founded Protective Life Insurance Company, and in 1909, Protective Life paid its first death claim.[3] In 1927, Protective merged with Alabama National Insurance Company, and Alabama National’s president, Samuel Clabaugh, became the president of the combined companies, which continued to do business as Protective.[3] In 1937, Clabaugh turned over the leadership of the company to Col. William J. Rushton, and in 1969, Col. Rushton’s son, William “Billy” J. Rushton III, became president of Protective.[3] The younger Rushton then presided over a series of acquisitions that led Protective into all 50 states.[3] As part of this push, Drayton Nabers Jr. became CEO in 1992 and in 1993, Protective Life Corporation was listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol PL.[3] In 1997, Protective Life acquired West Coast Life. Nabers retired in 2002 and Harvard Business School graduate John D. Johns was then named president and CEO of Protective Life.[3] John D. Johns has served as president and chief executive officer since 2002 and has been chairman of the board since January 2003. Johns has been a director since May 1997 and an employee of the company and its subsidiaries since 1993. In 2007, Protective Life celebrated its 100th anniversary, just one year after its acquisition of Chase Insurance Group in 2006.[4] In 2013, Protective’s principal subsidiary, Protective Life Insurance Company completed the acquisition of MONY Life Insurance Company and reinsured certain policies of MONY Life Insurance Company of America.[5] The total transaction price was $1.06 billion.[5] Protective Life has offices in Alabama, California, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio and Tennessee.[1] Protective Life Corporation was acquired by The Dai-ichi Life Insurance Company, Limited (Tokyo, Japan) on February 15, 2015.

Long, JD (EVP, Chief Legal Officer and secretary), Mike Temple (EVP, Finance and Risk and CRO), Carl S. Thigpen (EVP and CIO), and Steven G. Walker (EVP, CFO, and Controller).[6]

Annuities, including fixed and variable annuity products sold through broker-dealers, financial institutions and brokers.

Awards and recognition[edit]
Protective Life was awarded the 2010 Optimas Award from Workforce Management Magazine and honored in the Partnership category by the Virgin HealthMiles employee wellness program.

History[edit]
In 1907, former Alabama governor William Dorsey Jelks founded Protective Life Insurance Company, and in 1909, Protective Life paid its first death claim.[3] In 1927, Protective merged with Alabama National Insurance Company, and Alabama National’s president, Samuel Clabaugh, became the president of the combined companies, which continued to do business as Protective.[3] In 1937, Clabaugh turned over the leadership of the company to Col. William J. Rushton, and in 1969, Col. Rushton’s son, William “Billy” J. Rushton III, became president of Protective.[3] The younger Rushton then presided over a series of acquisitions that led Protective into all 50 states.[3] As part of this push, Drayton Nabers Jr. became CEO in 1992 and in 1993, Protective Life Corporation was listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol PL.[3] In 1997, Protective Life acquired West Coast Life. Nabers retired in 2002 and Harvard Business School graduate John D. Johns was then named president and CEO of Protective Life.[3] John D. Johns has served as president and chief executive officer since 2002 and has been chairman of the board since January 2003. Johns has been a director since May 1997 and an employee of the company and its subsidiaries since 1993. In 2007, Protective Life celebrated its 100th anniversary, just one year after its acquisition of Chase Insurance Group in 2006.[4] In 2013, Protective’s principal subsidiary, Protective Life Insurance Company completed the acquisition of MONY Life Insurance Company and reinsured certain policies of MONY Life Insurance Company of America.[5] The total transaction price was $1.06 billion.[5] Protective Life has offices in Alabama, California, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio and Tennessee.[1] Protective Life Corporation was acquired by The Dai-ichi Life Insurance Company, Limited (Tokyo, Japan) on February 15, 2015.

					Full Description



Protective Life Corporation, incorporated on February 3, 1981, is a holding company. The Company along with subsidiaries provides financial services in the United States through the production, distribution, and administration of insurance and investment products. Protective Life Insurance Company (PLICO) is the Company's largest operating subsidiary. The Company operates several operating segments, each distinguished by products, channels of distribution, and/or other strategic distinctions. The Company's operating segments are Life Marketing, Acquisitions, Annuities, Stable Value Products, and Asset Protection. The Company has an additional segment referred to as Corporate and Other which consists of net investment income not assigned to the segments and expenses not attributable to the segments. This segment also includes earnings from several non-strategic or runoff lines of business, various investment-related transactions, the operations of small subsidiaries, and the repurchase of non-recourse funding obligations. The Company evaluates operating segments, as prescribed in the Accounting Standard Codification (ASC or Codification) Segment Reporting Topic, and makes adjustments to its segment reporting as needed.Life MarketingThe Life Marketing segment markets universal life (UL), variable universal life (VUL), bank-owned life insurance (BOLI), and level premium term insurance (traditional) products on a national basis. It markets through networks of independent insurance agents and brokers, stockbrokers, and independent marketing organizations.AcquisitionsThe Acquisitions segment focuses on acquiring, converting, and servicing policies from other insurance companies. The segment's focuses on life insurance policies and annuity products that were sold to individuals. The level of the segment's acquisition activity is predicated upon many factors, including available capital, operating capacity, potential return on capital, and market dynamics. The Company expects acquisition opportunities to continue to be available; however, the Company believes it may face increased competition and evolving capital requirements that may affect the environment and the form of future acquisitions. The Company focused and disciplined approach to the acquisition process and its experience in the assimilation, conservation, and servicing of acquired policies provides a significant competitive advantage. The Company's other operating segments have acquired companies and/or blocks of policies.AnnuitiesThe Annuities segment markets fixed and variable annuity (VA) products. These products are sold through broker-dealers, financial institutions, and independent agents and brokers. The Company's fixed annuities include modified guaranteed annuities which guarantee an interest rate for a fixed period. Contract values for these annuities are market-value adjusted upon surrender prior to maturity. In certain interest rate environments, these products afford the Company with a measure of protection from the effects of changes in interest rates. The Company's fixed annuities also include single premium deferred annuities, single premium immediate annuities, and indexed annuities. The Company's variable annuities offer the policyholder the opportunity to invest in various investment accounts and offer optional features that guarantee the death and withdrawal benefits of the underlying annuity. The demand for annuity products is related to the level of interest rates, performance of the equity markets, and perceived risk of insurance companies.Stable Value ProductsThe Stable Value Products segment sells fixed and floating rate funding agreements directly to the trustees of municipal bond proceeds, money market funds, bank trust departments, and other institutional investors. The segment also issues funding agreements to the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB), and markets guaranteed investment contracts (GICs) to 401(k) and other qualified retirement savings plans. GICs are contracts which specify a return on funds for a specified period and often provide flexibility for withdrawals at book value in keeping with the benefits provided by the plan. The demand for GICs is related to the relative attractiveness of the fixed rate investment option in a 401(k) plan compared to the equity-based investment options available to plan participants. The segment's products complement the Company's overall asset/liability management in that the terms may be tailored to the needs of PLICO as the seller of the contracts. The Company's emphasis is on a consistent and disciplined approach to product pricing and asset/liability management, careful underwriting of early withdrawal risks, and maintaining low distribution and administration costs.Asset ProtectionThe Asset Protection segment markets extended service contracts and credit life and disability insurance to protect consumers' investments in automobiles, watercraft, and recreational vehicles (RV). In addition, the segment markets a guaranteed asset protection (GAP) product. GAP coverage covers the difference between the loan pay-off amount and an asset's actual cash value in the case of a total loss. The segment's products are marketed through a national network of approximately 8,000 automobile, marine, and RV dealers. A network of direct employee sales representatives and general agents distribute these products to the dealer market. In 2013, approximately 98% of the segment's sales were through the automobile, marine, and RV dealer distribution channel and approximately 79% of the segment's sales were extended service contracts. A portion of the sales and resulting premiums are reinsured with producer-affiliated reinsurers.Corporate and OtherThe Corporate and Other segment consists of net investment income not assigned to the segments and expenses not attributable to the segments (including interest on certain corporate debt). This segment includes earnings from several non-strategic or runoff lines of business, various investment-related transactions, the operations of several small subsidiaries, and the repurchase of non-recourse funding obligations.The Company invests a portion of its investment portfolio in commercial mortgage loans. As of December 31, 2013, the Company's mortgage loan holdings were approximately $5.5 billion. The Company has specialized in making loans on either credit-oriented commercial properties or credit-anchored strip shopping centers and apartments. The Company's underwriting procedures relative to its commercial loan portfolio are based, in the Company's view, on a conservative and disciplined approach. The Company concentrates on a small number of commercial real estate asset types associated with the necessities of life (retail, multi-family, professional office buildings, and warehouses). The majority of the Company's mortgage loan portfolio was underwritten and funded by the Company.

BIRMINGHAM, Ala.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Protective Life Corporation (“Protective”) has reached an agreement 
      through its wholly owned subsidiary, Protective Life Insurance Company, 
      to acquire the Pompano Beach, Florida-based USWC Holding Company and its 
      affiliated operating subsidiaries (“USWC” or “Company”) via a stock 
      purchase agreement (the “Acquisition”). The Acquisition is subject to 
      receipt of standard regulatory approvals and satisfaction of customary 
      closing conditions.
    

      USWC, whose primary operating subsidiary is United 
      States Warranty Corp. currently markets vehicle service contracts, 
      GAP coverage and a suite of ancillary automotive maintenance and 
      protection products nationwide. The Company’s marketing footprint and 
      product suite complement Protective’s Asset Protection line of business. 
      The Acquisition is expected to provide the combined entities with 
      expanded market reach, enhanced product and operational capabilities, 
      and higher collective growth potential. USWC will continue to operate 
      from its current Pompano Beach, Florida location and the existing 
      Company leadership and employees will join Protective and continue to 
      manage USWC as part of the transaction.
    

      Richard J. Bielen, Protective’s President and Chief Operating Officer 
      commented, “Under the leadership of Scott Karchunas, our Asset 
      Protection line of business has been performing well and this 
      transaction is a great way to grow the line of business. The two 
      companies both have a history of quality and success, so putting them 
      together creates the potential for the business to grow even stronger 
      and serve more dealerships with these important products. We are pleased 
      to have the USWC team become part of Protective.”
    

      Closing is anticipated to occur on or after November 1, 2016. Upon 
      closing, the acquisition will be counted among a very long and 
      successful track record of acquisitions by Protective that includes 48 
      life insurance acquisitions and six previous acquisitions in the Asset 
      Protection business segment.

History[edit]
In 1907, former Alabama governor William Dorsey Jelks founded Protective Life Insurance Company, and in 1909, Protective Life paid its first death claim.[3] In 1927, Protective merged with Alabama National Insurance Company, and Alabama National’s president, Samuel Clabaugh, became the president of the combined companies, which continued to do business as Protective.[3] In 1937, Clabaugh turned over the leadership of the company to Col. William J. Rushton, and in 1969, Col. Rushton’s son, William “Billy” J. Rushton III, became president of Protective.[3] The younger Rushton then presided over a series of acquisitions that led Protective into all 50 states.[3] As part of this push, Drayton Nabers Jr. became CEO in 1992 and in 1993, Protective Life Corporation was listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol PL.[3] In 1997, Protective Life acquired West Coast Life. Nabers retired in 2002 and Harvard Business School graduate John D. Johns was then named president and CEO of Protective Life.[3] John D. Johns has served as president and chief executive officer since 2002 and has been chairman of the board since January 2003. Johns has been a director since May 1997 and an employee of the company and its subsidiaries since 1993. In 2007, Protective Life celebrated its 100th anniversary, just one year after its acquisition of Chase Insurance Group in 2006.[4] In 2013, Protective’s principal subsidiary, Protective Life Insurance Company completed the acquisition of MONY Life Insurance Company and reinsured certain policies of MONY Life Insurance Company of America.[5] The total transaction price was $1.06 billion.[5] Protective Life has offices in Alabama, California, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio and Tennessee.[1] Protective Life Corporation was acquired by The Dai-ichi Life Insurance Company, Limited (Tokyo, Japan) on February 15, 2015.
Leadership and board of directors[edit]
Protective Life Corporation leadership includes John D. Johns (chairman and CEO), Richard J. Bielen (president and COO), Scott Adams (EVP, Chief Administrative Officer), Deborah J. Long, JD (EVP, Chief Legal Officer and secretary), Mike Temple (EVP, Finance and Risk and CRO), Carl S. Thigpen (EVP and CIO), and Steven G. Walker (EVP, CFO, and Controller).[6]
The company’s board of directors include John D. Johns, Richard J. Bielen, John J. McMahon, Jr. Jesse J. Spikes, Shigeo Tsuyuki, Shinichi Aizawa, Vanessa Leonard, Ungyong (Inkyo) Shu, William A. Terry, and W. Michael Warren, Jr.[7]
Operations[edit]
The company offers plans in:[4]

Life insurance, including universal life, variable universal life, and bank-owned life insurance products offered through a network of brokers, stockbrokers and independent marketing organizations.
Annuities, including fixed and variable annuity products sold through broker-dealers, financial institutions and brokers.
Stable value products, including fixed and floating-rate funding agreements sold to the trustees of municipal bond proceeds, institutional investors, bank trust departments and money market funds.
Asset protection, marketing extended service contracts and credit life and disability insurance to protect consumers’ investments in automobiles, watercraft and recreational vehicles.
Acquisitions, consisting of policies originated by other companies and later acquired by Protective. The segment’s primary focus is on life insurance policies and annuity products that were sold to individuals.

Awards and recognition[edit]
Protective Life was awarded the 2010 Optimas Award from Workforce Management Magazine and honored in the Partnership category by the Virgin HealthMiles employee wellness program.
Philanthropy[edit]
The company established the Protective Life Foundation, which supports education and healthy development of at-risk youth.[3] In addition, the foundation engages charitable activities to cultural organizations, civic and community initiatives, human services groups, and the United Way.[3]

History[edit]
In 1907, former Alabama governor William Dorsey Jelks founded Protective Life Insurance Company, and in 1909, Protective Life paid its first death claim.[3] In 1927, Protective merged with Alabama National Insurance Company, and Alabama National’s president, Samuel Clabaugh, became the president of the combined companies, which continued to do business as Protective.[3] In 1937, Clabaugh turned over the leadership of the company to Col. William J. Rushton, and in 1969, Col. Rushton’s son, William “Billy” J. Rushton III, became president of Protective.[3] The younger Rushton then presided over a series of acquisitions that led Protective into all 50 states.[3] As part of this push, Drayton Nabers Jr. became CEO in 1992 and in 1993, Protective Life Corporation was listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol PL.[3] In 1997, Protective Life acquired West Coast Life. Nabers retired in 2002 and Harvard Business School graduate John D. Johns was then named president and CEO of Protective Life.[3] John D. Johns has served as president and chief executive officer since 2002 and has been chairman of the board since January 2003. Johns has been a director since May 1997 and an employee of the company and its subsidiaries since 1993. In 2007, Protective Life celebrated its 100th anniversary, just one year after its acquisition of Chase Insurance Group in 2006.[4] In 2013, Protective’s principal subsidiary, Protective Life Insurance Company completed the acquisition of MONY Life Insurance Company and reinsured certain policies of MONY Life Insurance Company of America.[5] The total transaction price was $1.06 billion.[5] Protective Life has offices in Alabama, California, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio and Tennessee.[1] Protective Life Corporation was acquired by The Dai-ichi Life Insurance Company, Limited (Tokyo, Japan) on February 15, 2015.
Leadership and board of directors[edit]
Protective Life Corporation leadership includes John D. Johns (chairman and CEO), Richard J. Bielen (president and COO), Scott Adams (EVP, Chief Administrative Officer), Deborah J. Long, JD (EVP, Chief Legal Officer and secretary), Mike Temple (EVP, Finance and Risk and CRO), Carl S. Thigpen (EVP and CIO), and Steven G. Walker (EVP, CFO, and Controller).[6]
The company’s board of directors include John D. Johns, Richard J. Bielen, John J. McMahon, Jr. Jesse J. Spikes, Shigeo Tsuyuki, Shinichi Aizawa, Vanessa Leonard, Ungyong (Inkyo) Shu, William A. Terry, and W. Michael Warren, Jr.[7]
Operations[edit]
The company offers plans in:[4]

Life insurance, including universal life, variable universal life, and bank-owned life insurance products offered through a network of brokers, stockbrokers and independent marketing organizations.
Annuities, including fixed and variable annuity products sold through broker-dealers, financial institutions and brokers.
Stable value products, including fixed and floating-rate funding agreements sold to the trustees of municipal bond proceeds, institutional investors, bank trust departments and money market funds.
Asset protection, marketing extended service contracts and credit life and disability insurance to protect consumers’ investments in automobiles, watercraft and recreational vehicles.
Acquisitions, consisting of policies originated by other companies and later acquired by Protective. The segment’s primary focus is on life insurance policies and annuity products that were sold to individuals.

Awards and recognition[edit]
Protective Life was awarded the 2010 Optimas Award from Workforce Management Magazine and honored in the Partnership category by the Virgin HealthMiles employee wellness program.
Philanthropy[edit]
The company established the Protective Life Foundation, which supports education and healthy development of at-risk youth.[3] In addition, the foundation engages charitable activities to cultural organizations, civic and community initiatives, human services groups, and the United Way.[3]

History[edit]
In 1907, former Alabama governor William Dorsey Jelks founded Protective Life Insurance Company, and in 1909, Protective Life paid its first death claim.[3] In 1927, Protective merged with Alabama National Insurance Company, and Alabama National’s president, Samuel Clabaugh, became the president of the combined companies, which continued to do business as Protective.[3] In 1937, Clabaugh turned over the leadership of the company to Col. William J. Rushton, and in 1969, Col. Rushton’s son, William “Billy” J. Rushton III, became president of Protective.[3] The younger Rushton then presided over a series of acquisitions that led Protective into all 50 states.[3] As part of this push, Drayton Nabers Jr. became CEO in 1992 and in 1993, Protective Life Corporation was listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol PL.[3] In 1997, Protective Life acquired West Coast Life. Nabers retired in 2002 and Harvard Business School graduate John D. Johns was then named president and CEO of Protective Life.[3] John D. Johns has served as president and chief executive officer since 2002 and has been chairman of the board since January 2003. Johns has been a director since May 1997 and an employee of the company and its subsidiaries since 1993. In 2007, Protective Life celebrated its 100th anniversary, just one year after its acquisition of Chase Insurance Group in 2006.[4] In 2013, Protective’s principal subsidiary, Protective Life Insurance Company completed the acquisition of MONY Life Insurance Company and reinsured certain policies of MONY Life Insurance Company of America.[5] The total transaction price was $1.06 billion.[5] Protective Life has offices in Alabama, California, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio and Tennessee.[1] Protective Life Corporation was acquired by The Dai-ichi Life Insurance Company, Limited (Tokyo, Japan) on February 15, 2015.
Leadership and board of directors[edit]
Protective Life Corporation leadership includes John D. Johns (chairman and CEO), Richard J. Bielen (president and COO), Scott Adams (EVP, Chief Administrative Officer), Deborah J. Long, JD (EVP, Chief Legal Officer and secretary), Mike Temple (EVP, Finance and Risk and CRO), Carl S. Thigpen (EVP and CIO), and Steven G. Walker (EVP, CFO, and Controller).[6]
The company’s board of directors include John D. Johns, Richard J. Bielen, John J. McMahon, Jr. Jesse J. Spikes, Shigeo Tsuyuki, Shinichi Aizawa, Vanessa Leonard, Ungyong (Inkyo) Shu, William A. Terry, and W. Michael Warren, Jr.[7]
Operations[edit]
The company offers plans in:[4]

Life insurance, including universal life, variable universal life, and bank-owned life insurance products offered through a network of brokers, stockbrokers and independent marketing organizations.
Annuities, including fixed and variable annuity products sold through broker-dealers, financial institutions and brokers.
Stable value products, including fixed and floating-rate funding agreements sold to the trustees of municipal bond proceeds, institutional investors, bank trust departments and money market funds.
Asset protection, marketing extended service contracts and credit life and disability insurance to protect consumers’ investments in automobiles, watercraft and recreational vehicles.
Acquisitions, consisting of policies originated by other companies and later acquired by Protective. The segment’s primary focus is on life insurance policies and annuity products that were sold to individuals.

Awards and recognition[edit]
Protective Life was awarded the 2010 Optimas Award from Workforce Management Magazine and honored in the Partnership category by the Virgin HealthMiles employee wellness program.
Philanthropy[edit]
The company established the Protective Life Foundation, which supports education and healthy development of at-risk youth.[3] In addition, the foundation engages charitable activities to cultural organizations, civic and community initiatives, human services groups, and the United Way.[3]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
