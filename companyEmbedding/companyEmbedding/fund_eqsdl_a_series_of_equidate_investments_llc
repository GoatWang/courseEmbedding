Getting started


 What is Equidate?


Equidate is an online trading platform that facilitates and brokers investments in shares of large private technology companies (so-called “pre-IPO” companies).The majority of our focus is on well-established companies, with strong business models and market penetration, typically valued at more than $2 billion. We also regularly facilitate transactions in smaller companies (valued at $200 million - $2 billion).

 What investor tools, products and services does Equidate offer?


Equidate provides a number of tools for investors, for free to the public with no obligations:• We provide publicly available data such as capitalization information, financing history, valuation information from venture financing rounds, and discovery tools for private and public technology companies.• We provide information, data, news, and analysis of public and private tech companies and their securities — if you want to know company valuations, how much they have raised, or the latest news across a wide variety of publications, Equidate is the place to find it.• Our site allows investors to create, view, and track a listing of private company shares in their portfolio.• We plan to soon publish and manage the Equidex™ an index of privately-held technology companies.

 Who can invest?


Accredited investors* who meet suitability and compliance standards are eligible to invest on our platform; we frequently also work with family offices, institutions, funds, etc. Our investors are located around the world. You should be comfortable with the risk, lack of liquidity and limited information inherent to private securities.* As of June 2017, the current requirements for individual accreditation are:A) $200,000 Gross Annual Income ($300,000 if married), orB) $1,000,000 in net worth minus the value of your principle place of residencePlease be aware that the SEC may change the accreditation requirements in the future and thus should be verified at this link, prior to investing.

 I am located abroad (or my entity is located abroad); can I invest?


Certainly; as long as the required compliance checks are completed (accreditation, background and ID checks for regulation, Anti-Money Laundering and Office of Foreign Assets Control list, etc.), from a U.S. perspective, you are eligible to invest. These are required for all customers, whether domestic or international. There may be additional regulations in your home country, particularly if you do not work through a U.S. regulated investment company.

Haven't found the answer you're looking for? Contact Support





 Can I invest through an IRA / special purpose vehicle / other entity?


Yes; we just would need additional documentation to prove your ownership or authority to transact on behalf of such a vehicle. Again, standard compliance requirements.

Haven't found the answer you're looking for? Contact Support





 	What are the legal and compliance aspects of this?


We conduct all transactions through a licensed broker-dealer, executed by General Securities Principals and Representatives, licensed by the SEC and registered by FINRA to engage in broker-dealer activities, as required by securities regulation.Our outside securities counsel is Lowenstein Sandler, one of the premier securities firms in the world. They and other leading firms developed the fund structure that underlies Equidate Investments LLC, and worked extensively to make sure that our structure and contracts are compliant with regulation. We also engage topic experts and other law firms for matters like broker-dealer compliance, fund implementation, document review, etc. Our co-founder and Chief Legal Officer is a 20-year startup law veteran.Please note that we do not provide legal counsel to shareholders or investors – all parties are responsible for making sure they understand the benefits and risks of this asset class and these transactions.

Why should I consider an Equidate investment?


 Why should I consider this asset class?


Diversification and exposure.The private tech market is quickly becoming a meaningful portion of the suite of asset classes available in today’s financial markets. Assuming you already have a sufficiently diversified portfolio across a range of safe and moderately safe securities, it is certainly worth considering for inclusion in a balanced portfolio.Of course, each investor's situation is different, and suitability is a case-by-case conversation. But for many accredited investors, late-stage private market investments can certainly offer compelling investment opportunities while the companies are in the rapid value creation phase.

Haven't found the answer you're looking for? Contact Support





 I am an accredited individual or family office. Why is Equidate a good fit?


In public and liquid markets, strategic advantages and inefficiencies have been squeezed out through greater automation, high-frequency trading, and increasing correlation between asset classes.However, there is still opportunity available for private technology investors.Currently, this asset class is only available to very large institutional investors (hedge funds, private equity firms, venture capital funds).  We’re bringing access to accredited and sophisticated investors. We’re putting the control and access back in the hands of the check-writers, at a variety of bite sizes.

 I run a portfolio of venture investments already (or I’m an angel investor). Why is Equidate a good fit?


Given you are already familiar with private, rapidly growing companies, you may be unique advantaged in judging private technology investments. What is the total addressable market? Does it feel like they’ve reached product-market fit? Are they in a scalable business with strong unit economics? Familiarity with these topics may provide an advantage on our platform.Many funds we’ve spoken and worked with think of us as part of a barbell approach. They allocate their capital primarily to early stage investments, but are expanding into growth-stage investments to balance risk and reward.Finally, a venture fund that is new or based outside Silicon Valley may find it challenging to access an allocation in the most sought-after primary issuances. Even when it is available, minimum check sizes for a $10 billion company may be $10-20 million, which may not be the right bite size for smaller or medium sized funds. We help provide access to the underlying company's stock in such situations.

Haven't found the answer you're looking for? Contact Support





 I run a long-term, conservative fund, such as an endowment, pension fund or sovereign wealth fund. Why is Equidate a good fit?


For a sufficiently large pool of capital, exposure to as many asset classes as possible is crucial. As one of our advisors reminds us, diversification is the most conservative strategy of all. This is especially true when that asset class is uncorrelated to the rest of your portfolio.Private technology investments are compelling because:• Diversification amongst conventional asset classes is rapidly rising; equity markets, commodities, corporate debt, are all moving in lock step• Private tech companies are growing rapidly by disrupting massive addressable markets (while traditional industries have stagnated)• Their eccentric growth produces compelling returns that are frequently orthogonal to conventional assets                                       Source: Charles Schwab Investment Advisory, Inc., with data from Morningstar Direct.Most large funds already have an allocation to VC and PE. Equidate helps focus on growth equity (rather than VC) investments with greater precision, and by providing access with a compelling fee structure (no management fee or carry).

Haven't found the answer you're looking for? Contact Support





 I am an accredited investor, but I don’t really understand the startup or tech market. Why is Equidate a good fit?


This asset class is intended for sophisticated investors who pass the accreditation threshold. We ensure each investor also passes suitability requirement for each specific investment before closing, and we may decline to complete the transaction it does not seem appropriate for that investor’s situation (income, net worth, investment experience, or other circumstance).If you are a potential investor, it’s important to understand the key characteristics and risks of private market investments before deciding to move forward with even a small allocation, including:• They are illiquid investments, and your capital may be locked up for long periods of time• They are risky investments and you may lose some or all of your principal• There is often little information available on potential investors, since access is limited by companies• There may be legal, regulatory, and tax risks associated with each investmentWe strongly recommend consulting with your financial advisor, legal counsel, tax accountant, or others when considering an investment. If you’re still not sure at the end, it is likely that the Equidate platform is not a good fit for you.

Preparing for the transaction


 What companies are available for investment on Equidate?


We provide investments in equity for nearly 300 private technology companies on our platform, at ticket sizes ranging from $50,000 to $100 million – especially in the largest growth-stage companies. Just sign up for our platform, certify your accreditation, and you'll be able to access the full list.

Haven't found the answer you're looking for? Contact Support





 How do you price this?


Valuations vary from company to company based on funding stage, time since last raise, performance, growth potential, etc.We provide specifics on investment opportunities when known (in our frequently transacted companies), based on recent investments, demand and supply on the platform, and external market events such as financings. Ultimately, demand and supply set the price.For most mature companies that have recently had a venture financing event, we commonly find that transactions close at a slight discount to the known valuation.If you are seeking a price below our estimated investment terms, please feel free to submit it, and we’ll be happy to notify you if/when it’s reached; however, other interest at higher prices would be filled first, and it’s possible that your price may never be reached.

Haven't found the answer you're looking for? Contact Support





 Do I get access to information about the company?


Usually, detailed information such as financials, projections, strategy, etc. are not made available to investors; private companies are typically not required to disseminate such information.We provide estimated capitalization of companies – this is a summary of each company’s financing history. Since those valuations were established by venture capital firms on the basis of extensive due diligence, investors on our platform have logically found that a good anchor point to begin.Where available, we also direct investors to other information regarding the company’s performance – third-party reports, press articles, and other publicly available information. We encourage investors to conduct independent research, to build comfort and understanding of the potential investment thesis, opportunities and risks of a potential investment, and also ensure that they have enough to make an informed decision.In certain cases, for large institutional transactions ($10 million+, usually), the seller or company are able to make a data room, management conversations, and other diligence information available. This is handled on a case-by-case basis.

 At what point am I committed? Can I change my mind after clicking 'invest?'


Clicking ‘invest’ is a non-binding action, a good-faith expression of your intent to complete the investment. Please note, though, that we rely on our users to follow through once they express interest, and consistent failure to close may result in a restriction of access to our platform.Your commitment is only binding after you sign the relevant transaction documents (subscription agreement, stock purchase agreement, etc.) and the funds transfer process is completed. The transaction is considered complete at this point and cannot be reversed, except in a short list of extraordinary circumstances.

Haven't found the answer you're looking for? Contact Support





 What fees do you charge?


Each side of transaction incurs a fee of 5% on the transaction amount, paid to our affiliated, licensed broker-dealer. This funds our rigorous review process, servicing, legal and compliance overhead, marginal transaction costs, and our efforts to grow the platform and bring more products and services to our clients and platform users.We currently do not charge any ongoing management fees or carried interest.We are happy to consider reduced fees for larger transactions; this usually begins at $5 million.

 Does Equidate work with brokers, fund managers, and other financial professionals? 


Yes, Equidate’s services include bringing together buyers, sellers, RIA’s, investment advisors and brokers of private company securities — including funds that may buy and sell shares. If you are not the actual investor or shareholder, we ask that you contact us directly before entering any transaction information online.

Haven't found the answer you're looking for? Contact Support











Transaction mechanics and process


 How do I make an investment?


Once you express interest in an investment, the fund documentation is triggered for execution (along with certain documents and information for first-time clients to ensure suitability and compliance). Once the transaction is reviewed for completeness and compliance, we work with you to execute the funds transfer and closing.Usually, the whole process takes 1-2 weeks. If your particular investment happens to take longer for some reason, we’ll certainly keep you notified of the stages in the process.

Haven't found the answer you're looking for? Contact Support





 How do you structure the investment?


You (our investors) become a limited partner in a fund that we establish, advise, and manage, to secure a secondary market investment on your behalf.Investors can participate in funds that are either:• Dedicated to individual companies, organized by Equidate.• A pre-selected set of companies, which are not actively managed but provide diversified exposure to a number of growth stage private tech companiesThe above suite of products is designed to provides access for investments of $50,000 up to $5 million. We can place larger investments as well; please contact [email protected]

 What happens behind the scenes once I complete my investment?


Once investors express interest in a given asset, our investment entity (Equidate Investments LLC) or our partner affiliated broker-dealer, secures the investment These securities are held in an asset-specific fund for the benefit of the investors (you and our other clients) until the shares are freely transferable, whether due to a liquidity event such as a company acquisition or IPO, or any other reason the the shares become transferable.Our structure brings greater speed, reliability and efficiency to the secondary market.

 What if I only want to buy shares outright (and get on the cap table) while a startup is private?


Realistically, direct transfers typically cannot happen below a minimum check size of $10 million for our target companies (which, as mentioned, are often valued at more than $2 billion), since boards and management of private companies are naturally protective.If you’d like more information on case-by-case details with transactions above this size, please email us at [email protected]

 Are your investments in Preferred or Common shares?


We work with everyone from global asset managers to angel investors to employees who are looking for liquidity and diversification, and our funds reflect this through a mix of preferred and common shares. There’s no single answer to this because the funds are constantly executing additional investments.It’s worth noting that some of our investors view common shares and early round preferred shares as being quite similar in behavior and economic outcome. Recent preferred investors don’t usually liquidate so soon after their investment, and if they do, it will likely be treated as a separate asset (in a separate fund, with different pricing to account for different economic outcome from Common), or may be handled as a direct transfer.

After the transaction


 In cases where the shares are purchased for deferred delivery (under a forward contract), how do you secure the investment? 


We run identity verification and background checks to ensure the shareholders on the other side are legitimate. We acquire credit information, and place caps on how much each shareholder can liquidate to limit risk.We conduct a thorough legal review of every shareholder's document set, with our partner-level venture law team assessing whether they own the shares, and the compliance with transfer restrictions.We’ve put in place various backup enforcement provisions – with multiple recourses and protections for the investor in the unlikely case of a default (e.g., power of attorney to enforce the contracts). We further diversify investors' exposure across the whole pool of a number of shareholders.And finally, Equidate's investment funds are insured, through a strategic partnership we've entered into with Munich Re (one of the world's leading reinsurers, with $250B in assets). If shareholder default, fraud, bankruptcy, etc., causes the fund to fall below the investment amount, Munich Re will pay a claim to make the fund whole. Even after this, Equidate, Munich Re and other relevant affiliates will pursue enforcement of the contract through the legal process. For more information, please see our partnership announcement and the insurance overview document.Equidate has had a 100% follow-through rate to date on such transactions.

 What happens once the company goes public or gets acquired?


Our investment entity distributes the shares in each fund to investors once it determines that the shares become freely, practically, and feasibly transferable for any reason. A typical case is that the company has gone public or been acquired in exchange for cash and/or transferable shares in another company, after any lockup or holdback periods.

 What happens if the company doesn’t go public?


Our platform typically offers investments in late-stage companies in the so-called “pre-IPO” phase. These companies often face expectations from employees and investors, that they will go public, sell, or otherwise find liquidity within a reasonable timeframe. If not, there may be other occasions for company shares to become transferable.Our funds are set up to operate for 10 years. We expect that to be sufficient. In the event that there is no event leading to company share transferability (and subsequent distribution of shares) in that time, there is a provision for a liquidation trust similar to the provision in other private equity or venture capital funds, through which we would take commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that investors’ interests in the fund are redeemable as expected.

Shareholders



Getting started


 What is Equidate? 


In an environment when companies are staying private indefinitely, employees and early investors suffer from a lack of liquidity, diversification, and transparency. We help fix this by providing an online trading and information platform for brokering the offering, sale, and purchase of private company securities, in addition to providing tools to help you learn about, track, and manage your equity.We collect asks from shareholders such as yourselves, who are expressing good faith interest in liquidity. These are non-binding, private offers to sell your shares (your name and details are not tied to the listing). This helps us get an accurate picture of price and volume in each company. We gather appropriate investor interest, and help put together a transaction. Our goal at every stage is to do this in a company – and shareholder – friendly manner.

 Which companies’ shares do you work with?


Here are a few conditions that indicate a high likelihood that we’ll be able to help:• Venture-backed technology companies• Late-stage companies (typically Series E or later, $2 billion valuation or higher), or mid-stage companies (typically Series B through Series D, $200 million – $1 billion valuation). As a general rule of thumb, the later the company and closer to IPO, the more likely investors are to be interested• Rapidly growing companies and/or business models with proven unit economics; with sufficient presence in the press, so that investors are able to make a more informed investing decision• Incorporated in the U.S., or one of a handful of international companies that are proactive in facilitating secondary transactionsResource constraints prevent us from doing full justice to more companies at the moment; but we are continually expanding further into the mid-stage space, and working on adding international companies. Please feel free to express interest by placing an ask, and we’ll be happy to contact you once we’re able to help.

 What kinds of equity do you work with?


We work with owners of shares in mid- and late-stage private companies. In the case of employees and advisors, this is typically common stock. For investors, this is preferred stock purchased in a prior funding round.Some examples we of equity we have worked with: common stock acquired through a stock grant, stock acquired through exercise of vested options, advisor shares, preferred shares purchased in an equity financing round, etc.Some examples of (usually) ineligible equity: unexercised options, unvested options, unvested stock, convertible debt, restricted stock units (RSUs).

 I’m located abroad; can you help with my shares?


Sure! As long as your company is one we can work with, and various compliance requirements can be fulfilled (e.g., background checks), your location should not be an issue.

Preparing for the transaction


 I’ve submitted my documents for review. What are the next steps?


The document review only happens when the transaction is ready for a match, and entering the closing process. If you have placed an ask along with the documents, please rest assured that you are in our system, and investors are able to express interest in shares of your company.As soon as we're able to include you in our next round, we’ll definitely follow up with you.

Haven't found the answer you're looking for? Contact Support





 How often do you hold rounds/how long will it be until I get liquidity?


For mature, late-stage private tech companies, we typically hold a closing a few times a month. However, please note that the frequency of closings for any given company does depend on investor demand.We assemble the participants for each closing on the basis of asking price, date of the ask, and the volume we expect to execute. If there is a deadline you are facing (option exercise deadline, tax payments, etc.), please let us know and we will do our best to accommodate you in the next closing.

Haven't found the answer you're looking for? Contact Support





 How can I increase my chances of receiving liquidity as soon as possible?


We bring together both the buyers and sellers of securities on price and volume to determine who will participate in each closing, and then we confirm the go-ahead. Generally speaking, lower asking prices, flexibility on volume, and expressing interest with an early ask, all make it more likely we can include you sooner.

Haven't found the answer you're looking for? Contact Support





 At what point am I committed? Can I change my asking price or number of shares?


Early steps in the process are just indicators of interest, and aren’t binding. However, if there is something we should know, please let us know so that we can manage the pipeline accordingly. Unlike other platforms, we don’t impose exclusive engagements or restrictions on our clients; we simply function on the basis of transparent and open communication, and we ask that you do the same.By the point the transaction documents or ROFR (Right of First Refusal) notice are triggered (or if we’ve had conversations and we are ready to move forward), the interest becomes a good faith commitment, even if you haven’t signed it yet. Please note that during the ROFR/Transfer process there may also be relevant clauses within your company’s agreements to consider. If you back out at this stage, there are no legal obligations to Equidate; but it puts us in an awkward position since there are usually other investors and shareholders involved in the same round, which creates significant process and relationship issues for us. If someone backs out of their good faith commitments, we may decide it is not prudent to work with them in the future, and may restrict access to the platform altogether.Your commitment is binding after you sign the relevant transaction documents (stock transfer agreement, forward agreement, etc.) and the funds transfer process is completed. The transaction is considered complete at this point and cannot be reversed, except in a short list of extraordinary circumstances.

 How do I price this?


We believe in free, fair and open markets. Equidate relies on market pricing established by investors and shareholders. The end prices vary from company to company based on funding stage, time since last raise, performance, growth potential, etc. We are happy to provide the estimated closing price where known, based on recent transactions, demand and supply, market events such as financing rounds, etc. But ultimately, demand and supply set the price.As of mid-2016, for late-stage companies that recently raised a financing round, we have recently seen shares transacting at a slight discount to the known valuation.

 My company is growing rapidly and I’m bullish on our stock. What if I think it’s worth more than the estimated price?


If you are seeking a price above the current estimated round price, please feel free to submit it, and we’ll notify you if/when it’s reached; however, other interest at lower prices would be filled first, and it’s possible that your price will never be reached.It’s not a surprise that you’re bullish on the company. Most of our shareholders are. But a few factors are worth considering as you think about an appropriate price:• Venture capital valuations are based on the most recent price for preferred stock, which carry significant additional protections and more favorable economic outcomes – liquidation preference, anti-dilution protections, access to company information, etc. Common stock, and early stage preferred stock, often merit a discount from the current valuation.• Funding rounds are usually forward looking, and factor in expected future growth over the short term; so, for example, a company whose metrics have 2xed since a financing event wouldn’t justify a 2x price, since that financing probably already priced in significant growth.We’ve had many, many conversations where shareholders expected a high price, even for a small fraction of their shares, which would have helped them pay off debt, or cover tax bills. In some cases, this worked out, but in other cases we saw the market change (for example in late 2015 and early 2016), and there was no longer enough investor interest around the company to sustain the earlier price, much less a premium.It is, of course, ultimately your decision, and past market experience is no guarantee of future performance; but we recommend you consult with a financial advisor if you’re mulling over such a decision.

 What fees do you charge?


Each side of the transaction incurs a fee of 5% on the transaction amount, paid to our affiliated, licensed broker-dealer. This funds our rigorous review process, servicing, legal and compliance overhead, marginal transaction costs, and our efforts to grow and make this an even more efficient platform.We are happy to consider reduced fees on larger transactions, usually beginning at $5 million and above.

 What are the legal and compliance aspects of this? 


We conduct all transactions through a licensed broker-dealer, executed by General Securities Principals and Representatives, licensed by the SEC and registered by FINRA to engage in broker-dealer activities, as required by securities regulation.Our outside securities counsel is Lowenstein Sandler, one of the premier securities firms in the world. They and other leading firms developed the fund structure that underlies Equidate Investments LLC, and worked extensively to make sure that our structure and contracts are compliant with regulation. We also engage topic experts and other law firms for matters like broker-dealer compliance, fund implementation, document review, etc. Our co-founder and Chief Legal Officer is a 20-year startup law veteran.Please note that we do not provide legal counsel to shareholders or investors – all parties are responsible for making sure they understand the benefits and risks of this asset class and these transactions.

Transaction mechanics and process


 How does the transaction work?


We review each shareholder’s individual documentation to determine the best path forward – a direct sale, a forward contract, some other transaction structure, or in some cases, a decision that a transaction is not feasible.1. With a direct sale, we would follow on the company’s established processes for transferring ownership from you to the buyer (usually our holding company). This process is usually known as the Right of First Refusal (ROFR) process for Common Stock, or Transfer process for Preferred Stock. Please note that we would first get your explicit permission before contacting the company, beginning this process, or disclosing any of your information or indications of interest.2. With a forward contract, Equidate’s holding company would sign a forward purchase agreement with you, where the contract, terms and liquidity occur immediately but the delivery of shares occurs in the future, after the shares become freely transferable (which would happen in an IPO, certain forms of acquisition, or any instance of liquidity for the shares). The company’s cap table is not affected, any voting and information rights stay with you as the shareholder of record, and the process is greatly expedited (1-2 weeks from confirming terms, rather than 6-10 weeks for the ROFR/transfer process).3. There are some special cases from time to time, for example if you own an interest in a fund, or a holding company, that owns company shares. Depending on circumstances, or your relationship with the company, we may be able to tailor a special liquidity solution, so please contact us with details of your specific situation.4. In other cases, the stockholder documentation prevents any of the above approaches. In such situations, unfortunately, we usually cannot help.

 What if I have transfer restrictions on my stock?


We are completely committed to ensuring that we are compliant with transfer restrictions for every transaction that we facilitate.In each case, once we have the terms of a transaction agreed upon in principle, we conduct a comprehensive review of all relevant documents, before confirmation or execution. We do this whether it’s a former employee or investor, even when we’ve worked with the company’s shares before, since transfer restrictions for a given company do change over time. We want to pursue the smartest and most prudent decision in every case.In the majority of cases we have encountered, we have been able to help with either a direct sale or forward contract. In the minority of cases where the restrictions are too onerous, and prevent a transaction, we regret that we cannot proceed.

Haven't found the answer you're looking for? Contact Support





 What is the typical process for a direct sale?


The first step is to gather and confirm investor interest. Depending on the company, this can take just days (for commonly transacted companies) or several weeks (for companies where we have infrequent transactions, or when there happens to be a dip in investor interest in the company).After terms are confirmed, the process usually takes 6-8 weeks:• We’ll work with you and your company’s lawyers to gather and finalize the required documents (relevant shareholder documents, ROFR template, and any template stock transfer agreement).• You would submit the Notice of ROFR/Transfer with the transaction terms to the company.• At the end of the required period (if applicable, often 30 days or longer) the company would notify you whether the ROFR is waived, or the ROFR is exercised.a. If waived (or if it’s a Transfer with no ROFR), then we would sign a Stock Transfer Agreement, accepted and acknowledged by the company; once our broker-dealer reviews the details for compliance and completeness, the transaction would enter closing, and you would receive the wire with the appropriate amount.b. If exercised, you would receive the proceeds from the sale from the company instead.

 What is the typical process for a forward contract transaction?


The first step is to gather and confirm investor interest. Depending on the company, this can take just days (for commonly transacted companies) or several weeks (when there is a dip in investor interest in the company, or for companies where we have infrequent transactions).After terms are confirmed, the process usually takes 1-2 weeks:1. We’ll review your shareholder documents to make sure our documents are compliant. Please submit all the documents requested on the platform that you have, and any others that are relevant as well. We need to complete a thorough review for compliance and risk purposes, and incomplete document sets can be a significant bottleneck in the process.2. Assuming the documents have been reviewed and approved by our legal team, we will trigger the transaction documents on the platform.3. Shortly after the signatures are completed, our broker-dealer reviews the details of the transaction for compliance and completeness.4. We confirm receipt of the funds from the investors, and deposit them in your account to close the forward contract transaction.5. Finally, once we learn or you inform us that the shares have become transferable (for example, if there is news of an IPO or acquisition), we and our independent fund administrator-servicer will contact you towards the end of any lockup process to facilitate the delivery of the shares. This is relatively quick, and will complete the process.

After the transaction


 If we have a forward contract, what happens once the company goes public or gets acquired?


Your obligation to deliver shares is based on the transferability of the shares themselves, without regard to events affecting the company. Two of the most common things that result in transferability are a company’s first public offering (after a lockup period, typically 6 months), or else acquisition for cash or by a public company. Once your shares become transferable, our operations team will reach out to you to facilitate the transfer of your shares to fulfill the forward contract. This is a relatively simple process, and we'll be happy to help you navigate it.

Haven't found the answer you're looking for? Contact Support





 If we have a forward contract, what happens there is no IPO or other liquidity event?


Our forward contracts are executed for a 10-year term, which is designed to be sufficiently long for a typical venture-backed company. Our agreements renew one year at a time after that, if the shares are not yet transferrable.

Haven't found the answer you're looking for? Contact Support





 If we have a forward contract, am I liable for compensating the investor if the shares decrease in value by IPO?


No, you are only responsible for delivery of the agreed-upon number of shares to conclude the transaction. Our investors understand that investments in private companies can be risky, and an equity investment can rise or fall in value based on the underlying company’s performance.

Haven't found the answer you're looking for? Contact Support





 If we have a forward contract, what happens if I have the opportunity to participate in an internal tender offer/buyback at the company?


The agreement requires you to transfer an agreed-upon number of shares in the future, so you will have to own at least that many shares on the date in question to fulfill the agreement. Please make sure you’re in a position to fulfill this obligation.

All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
