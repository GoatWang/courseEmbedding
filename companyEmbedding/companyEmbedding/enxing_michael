Vertiflex, Inc. Appoints Michael Enxing to Vice President, Chief 
      Commercial Officer






July 13, 2017 08:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



CARLSBAD, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Vertiflex, Inc., a leading innovator of advanced, minimally invasive 
      interventions for spinal stenosis, today announced the appointment of 
      Michael Enxing as Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer. Mr. 
      Enxing will be responsible for leading all aspects of the company’s 
      Sales, Marketing, Health Economics/Reimbursement and Professional 
      Education strategies, related to the already successful launch of the 
      Superion® Indirect Decompression System for the treatment of lumbar 
      spinal stenosis.
    

      Mr. Enxing brings over 20 years of successful global leadership 
      experience in product commercialization in the medical device, spinal 
      and chronic pain fields. Most recently, Michael served as Vice President 
      of Sales at Nevro Corporation where he led the company to impressive 
      growth both internationally and domestically over the previous four 
      years. Prior to Nevro, he served as Vice President of Sales and 
      Marketing for Vertos Medical, and has held various executive positions 
      at Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. (f/k/a Cardio Vascular Solutions CSI); 
      Advanced Neuromodulation Systems, Inc. (acquired by St. Jude Medical, 
      Inc.); Stryker Corporation; and Tecnol Medical Products, Inc. (acquired 
      by Kimberly Clark) . Michael is a graduate of Iowa State University with 
      a B.S. in Communications and focus in Business Administration.
    

      Earl R. Fender, President & Chief Executive Officer of Vertiflex, said 
      “We are very pleased to have attracted an executive of Michael’s caliber 
      into our organization. Michael is a visionary leader who understands 
      sales and marketing execution, market dynamics, critical organizational 
      metrics, and cultural drivers that deliver team success and ensures the 
      best customer engagement experiences possible. We are confident that 
      Michael’s track record of significantly scaling businesses, will add 
      considerable value to Vertiflex, our investors, physician providers, and 
      most of all to patients, who will benefit from Superion’s demonstrated 
      and durable clinical and safety profile.”
    

      Mr. Enxing said, “I’m proud to join the Vertiflex team. As a result of 
      the company’s achievements in product development, Level I clinical 
      evidence generation, earning a PMA approval and Category I reimbursement 
      for Superion, the stage is set to build a large, high growth, new 
      category in spine that is focused on compelling clinical outcomes for 
      patients and their physicians. Based on my prior experience in 
      commercializing an early generation product for lumbar spinal stenosis, 
      I believe Superion, having significant published peer-reviewed data, is 
      positioned as the best-in-class minimally invasive solution for lumbar 
      spinal stenosis that will also compare well to open surgical 
      decompression in treating patients suffering from LSS.”
    

About Vertiflex

      advancement of minimally invasive solutions for the treatment of lumbar 
      spinal stenosis, which is the leading cause of spinal surgery in the

      has developed proprietary, minimally invasive technologies for 
      performing both indirect and direct decompressions of the lumbar spine. 
      These procedures fill the gap in the stenosis treatment continuum 
      between conservative care and traditional spine surgery. To date, 
      Vertiflex has compiled the largest, most rigorous body of device 
      clinical evidence related to lumbar spinal stenosis. For more
