Clear in ContentOur client portfolios are free of unnecessary influence from creators and distributors of complex or sophisticated financial products.  We only invest in individual stocks and bonds.  This transparency allows our clients to easily understand how their money is working for them.    Small By DesignWe believe that bigger does not mean better.  North Point consists of three portfolio managers and four assistants.  We limit the number of client relationships in order to best serve each and every client.       Copyright © North Point Portfolio Managers    All rights reserved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       5910   Landerbrook  Drive, Suite  160   Mayfield Heights, OH 44124    Phone: (440) 720-1100                                     Fax: (440) 720-1101                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    View on MobileFAQ's  HomeWhy North Point?Working With YouFAQ'sAbout UsContact        How do we get started?The best way to begin is a conversation.  This will allow us to better understand your needs and how we might be able to help.  Call Dan Dreiling(440-720-1104)  to set up an appointment for a more in-depth consultation.      Can you help with other questions besides investments?​Our clients feel comfortable asking us questions on a myriad of issues!  Our goal is to become our clients' trusted adviser, helping them make better decisions on more than just their investments.  We are not experts in all situations, but can reach out to other professionals to obtain information as needed.  We encourage our clients to bring their concerns to us and do our best to develop solutions as appropriate.  Why should I trust you with my money?​Your assets are held by a well known independent custodian.  We have discretionary authority only over how the portfolio is invested.  The custodian also provides you with independent monthly statements itemizing all transactions in your account. Our firm and our employees are not engaged in other financial industry activities and have no other industry affiliations.Our own accounts, including our retirement plan, are invested in the same stocks as those in our clients' portfolios.In support of our fiduciary responsibility to our clients, our firm's Code of Ethics sets forth high standards of business conduct that we require from our employees.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

Learn More About Professional Property Management



Do I need a property manager?
As the owner of a small-scale rental property, you may be on the fence about whether or not to use a property management company. Especially if you've never managed an income property, it can be tempting to assume that property management duties amount to "find tenants, sign lease, receive rent check," along with handling some minor maintenance issues from time to time. 
In reality, managing tenant relations, staying on the right side of the law, being on call for any emergencies that come up, staying on top of home maintenance, conducting periodic property inspections, and handling the accounting and taxes can be a time-consuming effort.
Professional property managers have developed systems that allow them to manage all of the above with maximum efficiency. Their expertise allows them to prevent problems before they arise, as well as handle any issues that do come up with minimum disruption to your revenue stream.

Is property management affordable for single-family rental owners?
Not only is property management affordable, using a property manager can actually increase your property's overall profitability. Most property managers charge a small percentage of your monthly rent in exchange for comprehensive services that range from finding and screening tenants, to handling emergency maintenance, to keeping the books and preparing year-end taxes. 
For what usually amounts to $100.00-$200.00 per month, you can outsource all of the responsibilities related to managing your rental property. When you weigh that fee against the 10-15 hours per month you'd likely spend managing the property yourself, not to mention being constantly on-call in case of emergency, the tradeoff becomes pretty clear.
You should also consider that property management companies are experts at preventing vacancies and turnover costs, the two factors that can sink your profit margins almost instantly. As the owner of a single-family rental home, keeping your property filled is especially important---your total revenue is likely generated by a single set of tenants.

How can I find the right property management company for me?
You can take the first step toward finding the right property management company by using All Property Management's search feature to locate the property managers in your area who manage single family homes. We recommend that you speak with two or three companies to determine which company's services, strengths, and fee structure best suit your needs.

What should I look for in a professional HOA manager?
The most effective attributes a successful HOA Property Management Company can have are: 1.) the ability to handle day-to-day issues without supervision 2.) guide the Board's decision-making processes and 3.) be responsive to homeowners. 
Naturally, a successful HOA manager should be professionally compentent in all aspects of Association Management and have the requisite certifications and track record to perform their required duties. But there are other attributes that are important to be a successful HOA service provider.
Homeowners have more permanence than renters, so effective HOA Management must consider the long-term implications of its actions differently than a typical property management firm. Consistency, longevity and proven experience are important considerations, as are the interpersonal skills of the firm's managers in dealing with conflicts, emergencies and the expressed interests of the Board in improving their community.
With this in mind, it's important to hire an HOA management company that has proven methods for managing group politics and negotiating agreements among members with conflicting points of view. As you interview potential HOA managers, be sure to focus a significant portion of your discussions on understanding each manager's typical communication methods and tactics for conflict resolution.

What Does an Apartment Manager Do?



An apartment or duplex building manager handles the day-to-day operations of an apartment complex, whether big or small. While the responsibilities will vary based on the specific needs of the complex’s owners and the agreed upon employment terms with the management company, their duties can include any or all of the following:

Rental Payment: A manager plays two roles, 1) rent enforcer and 2) payment. They will manage collecting rent and use their local knowledge to set the right rental payment levels to attract tenants and get you the most from your investment.
Manage Tenants: From finding tenants to dealing with complaints and evictions, an apartment complex manager handles it all. In addition they screen tenants, negotiate leases, facilitate move-in and move-out inspections and more.
Maintenance & Repair: a building manager handles the physical management of the property, including regular and preventative maintenance, as well as repairs.
Legal Issues: Professional managers know local, state and national laws for screening tenants, handling security deposits, terminating a lease, evicting a tenant, and complying with safety standards.
Budget & Records: The manager must maintain thorough records, including income and expenses, inspections, leases, maintenance requests, complaints, repairs, rent collection, insurance and can help with taxes for the property.


Any tips on hiring the RIGHT property manager?
Here is a great checklist for finding a capable apartment or duplex complex manager:

Proven Profit: A track record of profitably managing complexes
Reviews: A strong background in customer service and former tenant reviews
Assistance: A crew of maintenance professionals or relationships with local vendors
Planning: Detailed, computerized accounting and seasonal maintenance tracking systems
Licensed: Professional certifications or licenses from trade organizations such as: the Institute of Real Estate Management, National Apartment Association, National Association of Residential Property Managers and the Community Associations Institute.



Do I really need an apartment building management company?
The more tenants you have the higher volume of complaints, maintenance issues, and vacancies you will need to deal with. It is in your best interest to employ a manager to quickly respond to emergencies and collect the rent on time.
Apartment building managers have professional knowledge to assist you with hiring and managing local vendors, keeping current with local, state and federal housing laws, maintaining low vacancy rates, and dealing with sensitive tenant issues such as evictions. 

How can I easily find a property manager?
At All Property Management, we make it easy to find the right apartment complex manager for your rental property, whether you’re looking for someone to manage a few apartments and townhomes, a large apartment complex, commercial property – or a portfolio that includes all these and more. Just select the property type and fill in your rental’s zip code to generate an instant list of apartment building managers in your area. For best results, we recommend interviewing at least two or three companies to find the one that is best suited for your needs.
