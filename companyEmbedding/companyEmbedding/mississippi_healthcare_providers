(Provider Taxonomy codes indicating group practices; MDB and CSV formats) 
Gnum
The source data (NPPES) permits group codes to be reported in up to 15 fields in this section. CarePrecise creates a 1-to-many table, listing each of a provider's reported txonomy group codes in a separate record. The Gnum is the NPPES Group Taxonomy field number in which the code was reported, allowing the code be matched with the specific group specialty in the tTaxo table. For instance, a code in tTaxoGroup field Gnum 3 indicates a group practice of the specialty reported in Tnum 3 in the tTaxo table. 
 
This is the newest of the data released by CMS in the NPPES file. This is where the group taxonomy codes are reported.  CMS does not report the codes in the taxonomy section (which appear in our tTaxo table) because they represent an additional layer of information on any one or more of the tTaxo codes. 
     
  


 
TaxoGroup

tCoLoCode
NPI
National Provider Identifier
Relational Key 


(MDB and CSV formats)
CoLoCode
Provider co-location code (algorithmically derived*). The NPI and CoLoCode comprise the dual relational key for this table. The NPI identifies the provider record, and the CoLoCode identifies the co-located group. The CoLoCode is an up to 40-character string that stands in for detailed location data, and is not intended to be sensical to the human viewer.
 
This code is an algorithmically derived conformation of the provider's practice location, permitting identification of providers who practice at the same location, for instance, physician groups, dental groups, radiology groups, etc. By using this table in conjunction with the tTaxoGroups table, it is possible to visualize the group entity (generally an organization) and its provider members.
Although each provider should have only one primary practice location in our database, technically, the tCoLoCode table is 1-to-many, because our system may not be able to resolve a single practice location per provider. There may be up to two distinct CoLoCodes for some providers. 
 


Count
Count of providers matching this co-location (algorithmically derived conformation of the provider's practice location; see tCoLoCodes above). Indicates the number of providers practicing at this co-location.

* Algorithmically derived data in the CPAC dataset includes data that is extracted/mined from the source databases, but which has a margin of error and should not be relied upon as conclusive. Record linking algorithms are used to enrich our data when direct correlation (via a unique identifier field) is not available, using available information in name, address, phone, taxonomy, and other fields. In particular, the data on providers excluded from billing Medicare (from the HHS Office of Inspector General's excluded providers database) can only be linked to NPI records by this means. Please note that when matches are found, there may be instances where an individual or firm has the same or similar name and location information as an excluded provider but is actually a different party. Therefore, it is important that you verify a potential match with the debarring agency identified in the record information. In like manner, the available federal data does not provide information on an individual provider's practice group(s); using record-linkage technology, we extract the group information by matching providers sharing the same practice location, and these group data can be corroborated or enriched with the group practice codes provided by CMS.

Mississippi health insurance marketplace: history and news of the state’s exchange
Two insurers in 2017; Humana leaving for 2018, but Magnolia staying 



By Louise Norris 
healthinsurance.org contributor
April 29, 2017 








Mississippi uses the federally-run exchange for individual market plans, so residents who buy their own health insurance enroll through Healthcare.gov. But the state runs One Mississippi, which is the SHOP exchange for small businesses.
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Mississippi has a strong presence in the Mississippi individual market, but they do not participate in the exchange.
One insurer will offer plans in 2018
Two carriers are offering plans in the Mississippi exchange for 2017: Magnolia/Ambetter offers plans in all 82 counties. Humana offers plans in 32 counties. Humana is exiting the individual market at the end of 2017, however, which means Mississippi is currently slated to have just one insurer in the exchange in 2018. And the Trump Administration’s continued uncertainty over federal funding for insurers could further destabilize the markets between now and the start of open enrollment.
But in late April, Centene (Magnolia/Ambetter in Mississippi) announced that they’re planning to remain in the exchanges in 2018 in the states where they currently participate. According to Centene Chairman and CEO, Michael Neidorff, “Centene’s exchange experience continues to be favorable, and we are achieving margins at the higher end of our targeted range.” This is certainly good news for Mississippi, as a Centene exit would have meant no insurers in the exchange anywhere in the state in 2018. That now appears now to be unlikely.
For insurers that wish to offer 2018 plans, form filings in Mississippi are due May 3, 2017, and rate filings are due June 2.
2017 enrollment nearly 19 percent lower than 2016
88,483 people enrolled in private individual market plans through the Mississippi exchange (via HealthCare.gov) during the 2017 open enrollment period, which ended January 31, 2017. For perspective, 108,672 people enrolled during the 2016 open enrollment period, so enrollment for 2017 was almost 19 percent lower.
But a significant number of the 2016 enrollees didn’t pay for their coverage or dropped it early in the year (about double the nationwide percentage). By March 2016, total effectuated enrollment in individual market plans through the Mississippi exchange stood at 77,747.
Health insurance in Mississippi under the Trump Administration
In December 2016, HHS reported that 161,000 people had gained coverage in Mississippi from 2010 to 2015, as a result of the ACA. If Republican lawmakers continue to push for passage of the American Health Care Act, many of those people are at risk of losing their coverage. The Center for American Progress, a left-leaning organization, estimates that 289,500 people in Mississippi would lose coverage under the AHCA (they used the CBO’s analysis, and broke it down by congressional district).
Despite the prospect of those coverage losses, Mississippi Governor, Phil Bryant, endorsed the American Health Care Act.
Mississippi is one of the least-healthy states in the country. It’s one of 11 states where three of every ten non-elderly adults residents has a pre-existing condition that would make it difficult or impossible to get new individual market health insurance if the ACA and its guaranteed-issue provision are repealed. The AHCA calls for pre-existing condition protections to technically remain in place, but lawmakers added an amendment in late April that gives states the option to allow insurers to charge higher premiums when people have pre-existing conditions and a gap in coverage, and to also offer plans that don’t cover the ACA’s essential health benefits. Those changes would essentially gut the ACA’s protections for people with pre-existing conditions, although it would be up to the state to decide whether to seek a waiver.
Because Mississippi hasn’t accepted federal funding under the ACA to expand Medicaid, the impact of ACA repeal wouldn’t be as significant as it would be in other states. That’s because Mississippi’s poorest residents are already suffering in the coverage gap, unable to realistically obtain any sort of health insurance. Repealing the ACA won’t change their situation, but it will continue to be dire.
However, it could end up being worse than just keeping the status quo in Mississippi with regards to Medicaid. The AHCA would switch Medicaid from its current open-ended federal matching to a per-capita allotment system of federal funding. This would result in less federal funding over the long run, and some of the almost 680,000 people who are already covered by Medicaid in Mississippi might be in danger of losing their coverage.
Mississippi residents already struggle with the cost of care, and 40 percent of the under-65 population in state owes money to hospitals or doctors.
UnitedHealthcare exited individual market, Humana following them out the door
Mississippi is one of 31 states where UnitedHealthcare exited the individual health insurance market at the end of 2016. That left Humana and Magnolia/Ambetter as the only carriers offering plans in the exchange.
Although Humana exited the exchanges in several states at the end of 2016, they stayed in Mississippi. That decision was short-lived, however, as Humana announced in February 2017 that they would no longer offer individual market plans in any state after 2017.
United was the only carrier in the Mississippi exchange that offered coverage in all 82 counties in the state in 2016, although Magnolia has expanded statewide in 2017. For 2018, Magnolia is currently the only insurer slated to offer coverage in Mississippi’s exchange.
2017 rates and carriers
Two carriers are offering plans in the Mississippi exchange in 2017. In late August 2016, Mississippi Insurance Commissioner Mike Chaney reported that a third health insurer had proposed joining the exchange state-wide, but had been rejected by HHS due to “lack of an adequate network and specialists in each county.”
In 2016, Humana offered exchange plans in 46 counties in Mississippi, but but has reduced their coverage area to 32 counties in 2017. Magnolia/Ambetter offered plans in 52 counties in 2016, but has expanded state-wide for 2017. So 32 counties have two carrier options, while 50 counties have just one carrier in the exchange in 2017.
The following rate increases were proposed and approved for the Mississippi exchange in 2017, although they apply to unsubsidized premiums, and subsidies offset the rate hikes as long as enrollees were willing to be flexible about possibly needing to switch plans in order to get the best rate (94 percent of Mississippi exchange enrollees received subsidies in 2016 — the highest percentage in the country):

Humana: 43 percent (Humana had about 13,000 exchange enrollees in 2016)
Magnolia/Ambetter: 7 percent (Magnolia had about 40,000 exchange enrollees in 2016)

Blue Cross Blue Shield of Mississippi is a major carrier in the state, but they have thus far not participated in the exchange (more details below). They had an average rate increase of 16.12 percent for 2017, for their off-exchange plans. At ACA Signups, Charles Gaba calculated an average rate increase of 15.82 percent for the two exchange carriers, which is very similar to the rate hike for BCBSMS off-exchange plans.
2016 enrollment
During the 2016 open enrollment period, private plan enrollment in Mississippi’s exchange reached 108,672 people. This included renewals and new enrollees, and also accounted for early attrition through February 1. For perspective, 103,600 people enrolled in coverage through the Mississippi exchange during the 2015 open enrollment period.
Effectuated enrollment stood at 77,747 by March 31, 2016. That’s an attrition rate of 28 percent, which is more than double the national average rate of attrition during the first quarter.
Effectuated enrollment in Mississippi stood at 80,011 on March 31, 2015. Nationwide, effectuated enrollment was almost 9 percent higher in March 2016 than it had been in March 2015, but there are a handful of states where enrollment declined, including Mississippi (to clarify, enrollment at the end of the 2016 open enrollment period was higher in Mississippi than it had been at the end of the 2015 open enrollment period, but a larger number of people cancelled or didn’t pay for their coverage in 2016, resulting in a lower effectuated enrollment by March).
At the end of open enrollment, 90 percent of Mississippi exchange enrollees were receiving premium subsidies. By the end of March, however, 94.2 percent of the enrollees with effectuated coverage were receiving premium subsidies; the people who weren’t receiving subsidies dropped their coverage (or never paid for it in the first place) at a higher rate than those who were receiving subsidies. The average premium subsidy as of March was $306 per month in Mississippi.
Open enrollment for 2016 is now over. You can still enroll in a plan for 2016 if you experience a qualifying event, and Native Americans can enroll year-round. In addition, Medicaid and CHIP enrollment continue year-round. Open enrollment for 2017 is tentatively scheduled to begin November 1, 2016.
Legislation introduced to block Obamacare
On February 8, Republican State Senator Michael D. Watson Jr. introduced SB2543, which would effectively block all Mississippi agencies and employees from having any part in enforcement or implementation of the ACA. The legislation would also prohibit the state from creating a state-based exchange or expanding Medicaid. Neither of those have been done in Mississippi, but legislation blocking them would make it more difficult for a future governor to set a new course for Mississippi.
SB2543 was referred to the Senate’s Medicaid committee as soon as it was introduced, and ultimately died in committee. The legislation did not include any language in terms of how Obamacare should be replaced or any sort of alternate structure to make health insurance affordable and accessible to the people of Mississippi; it would merely have blocked the state from taking any part in the continued implementation of the law.
2016 rates: lower than they were in 2015
Once all of the plan selections for 2016 had been finalized, 90 percent of Mississippi exchange enrollees qualified for premium subsidies. Their average pre-subsidy premium is $388 per month (a little lower than the $396/month average across all states that use Healthcare.gov), and their average after-subsidy premium is $91/month (the average after-subsidy premium across all Healthcare.gov states is $106/month).
In 2015, 93 percent of Mississippi exchange enrollees qualified for subsidies; their average pre-subsidy premium was $405/month, and their average after-subsidy premium was $52/month.
So while average pre-subsidy premiums declined in Mississippi from 2015 to 2016, average after-subsidy premiums increased. That could be a result of more people with higher average incomes enrolling in 2016, or it could be a result of enrollees selecting more robust – and more expensive – coverage.
Three carriers offer plans through the Mississippi exchange: Humana, Ambetter/Magnolia, and UnitedHealthcare. According to the Mississippi Business Journal, average rate changes for 2016 were:

Magnolia Health/Ambetter: average decrease of 2.9 percent (18,000 enrollees as of November 1, 2015)
Humana: average decrease of 0.2 percent (16,915 enrollees as of November 1)
UnitedHealthCare: average increase of 6.6 percent (26,000 enrollees as of November 1)

But only Humana’s rate filing (which was approved as-proposed) was displayed on Healthcare.gov’s rate review tool. For 2016, average rate changes for Humana plans in the Mississippi exchange ranged from a 2.5 percent decrease to a 2.4 percent increase. Rate filings for Magnolia/Ambetter and UnitedHealthcare don’t show up on Healthcare.gov’s rate review tool, even after the data was adjusted to show all rates, as opposed to only rate increases of ten percent or more (as was the case from June through October).
The Mississippi Business Journal obtained the above enrollment numbers from the Mississippi Insurance Department. They indicate significant attrition from July 2015 through October, as the exchange had 73,223 people with in-force private plan coverage at the end of June, and the total as of November 1 was only about 61,000.
Based on the enrollment as of November 1, the weighted average rate change in the Mississippi exchange was only about 1.9 percent for 2016 – and that came on the heels of an average rate decrease in 2015.
Statewide, the average benchmark (second-lowest-cost Silver) plan premium is 8.2 percent less expensive in 2016 than it was in 2015. Out of the 37 states that used Healthcare.gov in 2015, only four have lower average benchmark premiums in 2016, and Mississippi is one of them. In Jackson, the average benchmark premium for a 30 year old decreased by 9.2 percent – from $305/month to $277/month. Those are unsubsidized premiums; for people who qualify for subsidies, the after-subsidy monthly premium is lower. And as of mid-2015, more than 95 percent of Mississippi’s exchange enrollees were receiving premium subsidies – the highest percentage in the nation (unsurprising, since subsidy eligibility is based on income, and Mississippi has the lowest average household income in the US).
The benchmark plan isn’t necessarily the same plan from one year to the next, so the changes in benchmark premiums don’t really tell us much about how premiums on specific plans are changing. But premium subsidies are tied to benchark premiums, so average subsidies in Mississippi are lower in 2016 than they were in 2015, highlighting the importance of shopping around during open enrollment as opposed to letting plans auto-renew.
Off-exchange carriers — 2016
Outside the exchange, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Mississippi requested an average rate increase of more than 25 percent, but their final approved rate increase was 16.5 percent. Also off-exchange, Enterprise Live and Freedom Life both ended up with average rate increases of 9.9 percent. UnitedHealthcare was also listed in the rate review tool with a rate increase of 21.1 percent, but only for off-exchange plans that have a total of 513 enrollees.
Blue Cross Blue Shield had the lion’s share of the market in Mississippi prior to 2014 (roughly 80 percent), but they have not participated in the exchange. Their substantial rate increase for 2016 may have been a driving factor in the increase in enrollments for the Mississippi exchange, since premium subsidies are only available through the exchange. For a 50 year-old non-smoker in Hinds County (Jackson), the cheapest plan available from BCBS of Mississippi was $436/month in 2016. The plan had a $5,000 deductible, $6,500 maximum out-of-pocket, and no subsidies were available since it was only sold outside the exchange.
That same applicant – with an annual income of $40,000 and no dependents – could get a plan through the exchange in 2016 for $285/month with a $6,800 deductible. For a plan with a $5,500 deductible, $6,500 maximum out-of-pocket, and copays for office visits and prescriptions (which the BCBS plan did not offer), the price was $330/month through the exchange. And it’s important to note that if the person’s income was lower than $40,000, the premium was lower as well. As opposed to a plan outside the exchange, which doesn’t include any premium relief, regardless of how little the applicant earns.
2015 rates
According to an analysis published by The Commonwealth Fund, average premiums in Mississippi were 19 percent lower in 2015 than in 2014. The weighted analysis looked at premium amounts, differences in premiums between urban/suburban/rural areas within states, and insurer participation. But a similar analysis from PricewaterhouseCoopers found an average rate decrease of 9.3 percent from 2014 to 2015 – still a significant rate decrease, but not as substantial as the Commonwealth Fund’s result.
In 2014, Mississippi’s pre-subsidy average premium was $438/month – the fifth-highest among the 36 states that used Healthcare.gov.
2015 enrollment data
About 103,600 Mississippi residents selected health plans through HealthCare.gov during 2015 open enrollment. While that’s 42,000 more signups than during 2014 open enrollment, it is still just 37 percent of those eligible to enroll according to Kaiser Family Foundation estimates.
And attrition was particularly high in Mississippi in 2015. By the end of March, just 80,011 people had effectuated exchange coverage in place, and that had dropped to 73,223 by the end of June. That’s 71 percent of initial enrollments; nationwide, 85 percent of enrollees had effectuated coverage by the end of June, so Mississippi was well below average in that regard.
The Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that 28 percent of Mississippi’s eligible population had enrolled in coverage through the exchange by the end of March – a little lower than the national average of 36 percent, but higher than twelve other states.
Mississippi’s exchange population tended to be relatively low-income, with 89 percent having incomes under 250 percent of the poverty level.  Those enrollees were eligible for cost-sharing subsidies, and 85 percent of them selected silver plans, meaning that they obtained coverage that included the cost-sharing subsidies (cost sharing subsidies are only available if you purchase a silver plan). In all, more than 77 percent of the 73,223 people who had coverage at the end of June were enrolled in plans that included cost-sharing subsidies.
Participating insurers – a timeline
UnitedHealthcare joined the Mississippi marketplace for 2015, bringing the total number of insurers on the individual exchange to three in the state. Humana and Magnolia Health Plan were part of the marketplace in 2014 and returned for 2015. All three insurers continued to participate in 2016, but for 2017, United has left the state, and Mississippi’s exchange is back to just Humana and Magnolia.
United’s entry brought welcome competition to Mississippi in 2015 and 2016. In 2014, residents of some counties had access to just a single insurer’s plans through the exchange. In 2011 and 2012 – back when Mississippi was in the process of creating it’s own State-run exchange – Blue Cross Blue Shield of Mississippi (which had more than 80 percent of the market share in Mississippi) had told Insurance Commissioner Mike Chaney that they would participate in the exchange. But due to conflicts among the state’s leadership, HHS rejected Mississippi’s exchange application (more details below), and at that point, BCBS of Mississippi pulled out.
That left Humana and Magnolia Health Plan as the only two carriers for 2014. But leading up to the federally-run exchange’s fall 2013 debut, Mississippi had a problem. The two carriers had selected the counties in which they wanted to operate, and 36 of the state’s 82 counties had no participating carriers at all. Humana ultimately decided to go ahead and offer coverage state-wide in 2014, but only four of the state’s counties had plans available from both carriers in 2014.
In 2015, when UnitedHealthcare joined the exchange, every county in Mississippi had at least two participating carriers, and 13 counties had coverage options available from all three carriers.
For 2016, Humana’s plans were not available in all areas of the state. But UnitedHealthcare expanded to offer coverage state-wide, so every county in the state still had at least two carriers from which to choose, and 32 counties had plans available from all three carriers.
In 2017, there are 32 counties that have two carriers, and 50 counties where the only carrier offering plans in the exchange is Magnolia. For 2018, Magnolia is the only insurer with plans to participate in the Mississippi exchange. Unless something changes over the summer, all residents in Mississippi will have only Magnolia as an option in the exchange.
King v. Burwell: Chaney had a plan in case SCOTUS ruling had been different
In June 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that subsidies are legal in every state, regardless of whether the exchange is run by the state or the federal government. That was great news for Mississippi residents, insurers, and healthcare providers; 95 percent of the people who are enrolled in private plans through the Mississippi exchange are receiving premium subsidies.
The Mississippi Business Journal reported that Insurance Commissioner Mike Chaney had a contingency plan to protect subsidies for state residents if the Supreme Court had eliminated them.  Rather than creating a state-run exchange, “it would entail funneling federal money through the existing Mississippi Comprehensive Health Insurance Risk Pool Association to private insurers.”  But the Journal noted that the plan would be contingent upon approval from the Governor, Lt. Governor, and the Speaker of the House (Chaney had worked to establish a state-run exchange back in 2011 – 2012, but was foiled by the Governor and the legislature).
Politico also reported that the state had a back-up plan, but they explained that Chaney wanted “Mississippi to use existing private health insurance exchanges to enroll people, qualifying for subsidies while avoiding the federal government’s technology.”
The Mississippi Comprehensive Health Insurance Risk Pool is the state-run high-risk pool that pre-dates the ACA. Private health insurance exchanges are not run by the government – rather, they’re set up by health insurance carriers, brokers and benefits managers to provide a platform for people to shop for coverage. Mississippi’s Insurance Department did not return phone calls to clear up the discrepancy, but it did appear that in early 2015, the state was working on a back-up plan that could have been put in place if the Supreme Court had eliminated subsidies. In many states, there were no such contingency plans, and enrollees would have had few options but to terminate their coverage if subsidies had been eliminated.
Enrollment assistance
The University of Mississippi Medical Center got the majority of the Navigator grants that were awarded by the federal government in August 2013 to fund enrollment efforts in Mississippi for 2014. Of $1.1 million that Mississippi received, $832,000 went to UMMC. Oak Hill Baptist Church got the remaining Navigator funding that year, but by 2015, Oak Hill had become the primary Navigator grant recipient in Mississippi, receiving $547,867 to assist with enrollment efforts for 2016 (another $415,224 was awarded to the University of Southern Mississippi in September 2015).
Small business marketplace
Mississippi began operating its own Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) exchange — which is called One, Mississippi — in May 2014. One, Mississippi is open to employers with 50 or fewer full-time employees.
How many Mississippians enrolled in 2014?
Mississippi was 33rd in terms of the percentage of eligible individuals who enrolled in a qualified health plan (QHP) through the marketplace in 2014. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 61,494 people signed up for health plans, and another 13,779 people qualified for either Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) under existing eligibility criteria.
Among Mississippi residents enrolling in QHPs, 94 percent qualified for financial assistance, compared to 85 percent nationally. A report released in June by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services showed the average monthly premium, after tax credits, for Mississippi consumers was just $23. That’s the lowest average in the nation.
Eight percent of Mississippi residents selected a bronze plan (20 percent nationally), 79 percent selected a silver plan (65 percent nationally), 5 percent selected a gold plan (9 percent nationally), 7 percent selected a platinum plan (5 percent nationally) and 1 percent selected a catastrophic plan (2 percent nationally). Thirty-one percent of Mississippi enrollees were between the ages of 18 and 34.
40,000 of the state’s 61,000 exchange enrollees in 2014 selected a plan from Humana (in all but four counties, Humana was the only carrier available in 2014).
Exchange creation battle in Mississippi
State Commissioner of Insurance Mike Chaney clashed with two governors as to what form a health insurance exchange should take in Mississippi. Chaney, current Gov. Phil Bryant, and former Gov. Haley Barbour are all Republicans and on record as opposing the Affordable Care Act. However, Chaney consistently maintained that the state would be better off running its own exchange.
Chaney pushed hard for a state-run exchange. In 2011, he announced that the Mississippi Comprehensive Health Insurance Risk Pool Association would operate an exchange. The Risk Pool Association developed a plan in which the exchange would be developed in four phases, with work outsourced.
Early exchange planning was carried out by the board of directors of the Risk Pool Association and an advisory board appointed by Chaney. The Risk Pool Association, the advisory board, and the insurance department continued working throughout 2012, and in November, Chaney notified the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that Mississippi intended to implement a state-run exchange. However, Bryant told HHS in December 2012 that Chaney had overstepped his authority.
It was also in 2012 that anti-ACA influences from outside Mississippi (including the Koch Brothers and the Cato Institute) began pressuring Cheney to give up his push for a state-run exchange. But OneMississippi, the state-run exchange that Cheney created, opened in October 2012, a year before the ACA-sanctioned exchanges nationwide. OneMississippi didn’t have any premium subsidies (those wouldn’t be available until the first ACA open enrollment period began in October 2013), but it did have coverage for sale. The task at that point switched to obtaining federal approval to have OneMississippi be the state’s official ACA exchange.
But ultimately, Governor Bryant’s opposition to the exchange was its downfall. In February 2013, HHS rejected Mississippi’s exchange blueprint, telling Chaney that it simply wouldn’t work without the Governor’s support. The exchange would have needed to work with the Mississippi Medicaid program – overseen by a Bryant appointee – and there were too many concerns that Bryant would be able to derail the exchange via funding or hiring decisions. The federal government said at the time that they “didn’t feel that [they] should get involved in a battle between two elected state officials.”
Mississippi was the only state whose exchange blueprint was rejected by the federal government, and in February 2013, OneMississippi shut down. The federal government runs the individual exchange in Mississippi, but OneMississippi opened back up as the state-run SHOP exchange in the spring of 2014, offering health insurance options for small businesses.
Several factors constrain marketplace enrollment in the Magnolia State. Political opposition to the Affordable Care Act is very strong, many residents are distrustful of government assistance, and outreach efforts are limited. In a state with a 22 percent poverty rate, many people find premiums too expensive — even with subsidies factored in. And the Medicaid coverage gap is significant in Mississippi: Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that 108,000 of Mississippi’s 359,000 uninsured residents are in the coverage gap – ineligible for Medicaid (because the state has refused federal funding to expand Medicaid) and ineligible for subsidies in the exchange because their income is under the poverty level.

Mississippi health insurance
Advocates to MS: ‘there’s literally money on the table' for health plans



By Jenifer Dorsey 
healthinsurance.org Contributor
July 5, 2016 








As the federal government reports that health insurance premiums will rise by an average of 25 percent nationwide in 2017, Mississippi is among five states that have been granted increases of 30 percent or more. Alabama, Delaware, Hawaii, Kansas and Texas are the others.
Although 94 percent of Mississippians enrolled in plans state’s federally facilitated exchange receive subsidies – the highest percentage in the country – advocates are trying to ensure more Mississippi residents know about them during 2017 open enrollment. An estimated 80,000 Mississippians are not taking advantage of the ACA tax credits.
The Magnolia state has seen some improvements in its uninsured rate since the Affordable Care Act too effect; however, it still sees some of the nation’s highest uninsured rates and poorest health rankings.
Mississippi health ratings
Again in 2015, Mississippi maintained its bottom of the barrel ranking of 51st among the states and the District of Columbia in overall health. The ranking comes from The Commonwealth Fund’s most recent Scorecard on State Health System Performance. The Magnolia state came in last in the categories of Avoidable Hospital Use & Cost, as well as Healthy Lives.
An estimated 308,717 uninsured adults ages 19 to 64 and 30,309 uninsured children ages 0 to 18 would gain coverage and be more likely to receive needed healthcare if Mississippi improved its performance to the level of the best-performing state for those indicators. Review Mississippi’s individual scorecard for additional details on all measures evaluated.
After placing last in the United Health Foundation’s America’s Health Rankings for 2014, Mississippi improved to 49th in 2015. The state saw improvements in physical inactivity and the disparity in health status by education. However, the state still faces challenges related to physical inactivity, a high premature death rate and low immunization coverage among children and adolescents.
To learn more about Mississippi’s health as a state, see Key Health Data About Mississippi from the 2016 edition of Trust for America’s Health. Data from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Population Health Institute at the University of Wisconsin allow you to compare the health of counties within Mississippi.
Has Obamacare helped Mississippi?
Mississippi is among the 10 states with the largest reductions in percentage of uninsured since the ACA’s individual mandate took effect.
From 2013 to 2015, the state’s uninsured rate decreased 7.7 percentage points—a tie with Rhode Island. Nationwide, the uninsured rate dropped 5.6 percentage points from 17.3 percent to 11.7 percent.
However, at 14.7 percent, Mississippi’s uninsured rate remains above the national average. Seven of the 10 states whose uninsured rates have fallen most have both expanded Medicaid and implemented a state-run marketplace. Mississippi. Mississippi runs its own Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) exchange, which is called One, Mississippi, but uses the federally facilitated exchange for individual plans. The state has not expanded Medicaid.
MS enrollment in qualified health plans
During the ACA’s 2014 open enrollment period, 61,494 Mississippians enrolled in qualified health plans (QHPs). Ninety-four percent of those selecting QHPs qualified for financial assistance, and the average premium after tax subsidies was $23 a month.
During the 2016 open enrollment period, 108,672 Mississippians selected private health plans through Mississippi’s federally facilitated health insurance exchange. However, the state saw high attrition rates. As of June 30, about 77,747 still had their coverage. Of these enrollees, 94.2 percent were in health plans with an advanced premium tax credit and 77.6 percent were receiving cost-sharing subsidies.
For the 2017 open enrollment period, none of Mississippi’s two remaining exchange carriers — Humana and Magnolia Health Plan — requested and were granted rate increases. Humana, which has the state’s most exchange enrollees, saw approved rate increases averaging 43 percent. Magnolia/Ambetter’s approved rates reflect a 7 percent increase.
2017 Mississippi health insurance rates
UnitedHealthcare will exit Mississippi’s individual health insurance market at the end of 2016. The state’s individual exchange will have two remaining carriers: Magnolia/Ambetter and Humana.
Insurers that plan to raise premium rates 10 percent or more must submit them to the state or federal government for review. Rate and form filings for 2017 coverage were due June 10, 2016. As of early July, Mississippi was not among the states proposing increases of 10 percent or more.
Mississippi and the Affordable Care Act
At the federal level, both Sens. Thad Cochran and Roger Wicker voted against the ACA in 2010. Cochran and Wicker are both Republicans and remain in office. Cochran ran for reelection against Rep. Travis Childers in November 2014 and was elected for another term.
Breaking with a strong majority of their party, two Democratic representatives from Mississippi voted against the ACA in 2010, as did Rep. Gene Taylor. Rep. Bennie Thompson, a Democrat, was the sole Mississippi vote for the ACA. Republicans now hold three of Mississippi’s four seats in the U.S. House.
At the state level, State Commissioner of Insurance Mike Chaney clashed with two governors in an effort to establish a state-run insurance exchange. Chaney, current Gov. Phil Bryant, and former Gov. Haley Barbour are all Republicans and on record as opposing the Affordable Care Act. However, Chaney insisted that a state-run exchange was a better option for the state.
Chaney went so far as notifying the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that Mississippi intended to implement a state-run exchange. However, Bryant told HHS that Chaney didn’t have the authority to make that decision, and HHS rejected Mississippi’s exchange blueprint.
Mississippi defaulted to the federally facilitated exchange, and the state also declined to expand Medicaid.
Mississippi Medicaid and CHIP eligibility
Mississippi did not expand Medicaid through the Affordable Care Act. The state’s decision leaves 108,200 individuals in what is known as the coverage gap – about 30 percent of the state’s uninsured population.
Without Mississippi Medicaid expansion, non-elderly, non-disabled adults without children are not eligible for Medicaid. Adults with dependent children qualify for Medicaid only if the family’s income is 29 percent or less of the federal poverty level (FPL). Medicaid eligibility for Mississippi children varies by age and ranges from 133 percent to 194 percent of FPL.
Children in Mississippi up to age 19 qualify for the Children’s Health Insurance Program if not eligible for Medicaid and the family income level is 209 percent or less of FPL.
Despite the state’s decision not to expand, average monthly Medicaid enrollment has increased 9 percent since 2013 – the state’s percent change in Medicaid enrollment since the ACA’s individual mandate took effect is in the bottom third.
Enrollment for Medicaid and CHIP is open throughout the year. Visit the Mississippi Division of Medicaid to learn how to apply for Medicaid or CHIP.
Other ACA reform provisions
The Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan (CO-OP) Program is a federal loan program established through the ACA. CO-OPs are directed by their customers and intended to offer consumers more choice in medical insurance options.
CO-OPs operated in 23 states in 2014, and three are expanding into neighboring states in 2015. See where CO-OPs were launched and where they have closed.
No CO-OP was created in Mississippi.
Does Mississippi have a high-risk pool?
Before the ACA’s reforms to the individual health insurance market, eligibility for private coverage was contingent on medical history.  People with pre-existing conditions were often unable to purchase private plans, or could only buy policies that excluded their pre-existing conditions.
The Mississippi Comprehensive Health Insurance Risk Pool (the “Association”) was established in 1992 as a means of providing coverage for people who were unable to purchase comprehensive plans in the private market because of pre-existing conditions.
Now that the ACA has brought guaranteed issue coverage to the private individual market, high risk pools are largely obsolete. But the Association has remained operational, and has a message on its homepage reassuring members that the ACA is not bringing any immediate changes to their existing coverage.
Medicare enrollment in the state of Mississippi
Mississippi Medicare enrollment reached 560,344 in 2015, which is 19 percent of its total population. Nationwide, 17 percent of the population is enrolled in Medicare.
About 76 percent of the state’s Medicare beneficiaries qualify for coverage based on age alone, and 24 percent qualify due to disability – the third highest percentage in the country. Medicare spends about $10,005 annually per enrollee in Mississippi. In 2009, the state ranked 29th in terms of overall Medicare spending with $5.2 billion per year.
In 2015, about 14 percent of Mississippi Medicare recipients selected a Medicare Advantage plan instead of Original Medicare, compared with 31 percent of total U.S. Medicare beneficiaries. About 57 percent of Mississippi Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in stand-alone prescription drug coverage through a Medicare Part D plan in 2015.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
