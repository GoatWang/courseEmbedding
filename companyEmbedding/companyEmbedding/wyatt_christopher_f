Welcome 

















✕HomeWelcome MenuContact Us Hair by WyattPartnerships Testimonials Special Offers Welcome Hi I'm WYATTA Houston native who learned my love of the art of hair from my grandmother.  My grandmother stood by my side from childhood all the way through my Cosmetology License and High School Diploma from Barbara Jordan High School for Careers.  In 2011 I became a Network Educator with Bumble&Bumble where I developed a passion for fashion forward hair styling.  Soon after I began working with local photographers, stylists, and models to develop the skills needed for backstage hair.  In 2013 I became a GOLD.KEY.EDUCATOR with KEVIN.MURPHY, and have taken the skill work I mastered to educate salons around Texas about KEVIN.MURPHY product knowledge and styling trends. As of 2016, I am certified in Brazilian Blowout, Keratin Complex, and Hot Heads. I was also accepted as a CUTTING.KEY with the KEVIN.MURPHY lovemark/brand.  I have had the great opportunity to work in several top salons in Houston, but with the support of my clients and a leap of faith, I have branched out and started my own salon to continue preserving the integrity of hair and delivering top notch service to all clients.  I am currently part of many dynamic organizations such as Human Rights Campaign Diversity Committee, Fresh Start Community Haven, and others that exist to improve the well being of our global economy. Green Circle Salon and WYATT CHRISTOPHER SALON has partnered together to recycle all waste in the salon.  My career thus far has empowered me to give back all that I received with hopes of empowering another to do more. Long-term, my professional career goals are to graduate from the Keller Graduate School of Management online with my MBA, build a successful book of clientele, become a leader in my community through philanthropy, and become a Editorial Hair Stylist.   Copyright © 2017 WYATT CHRISTOPHER SALON - All Rights Reserved.Powered by GoDaddy GoCentral Website Builder

HCA Healthcare, Inc.


                  At its founding in 1968, Nashville-based HCA was one of the nation's first hospital companies. Today, we are the nation's leading provider of healthcare services, a company comprised of locally managed facilities that includes about 163 hospitals and 110 freestanding surgery centers in 20 states and England and employing approximately 199,000 people. Approximately four to five percent of all inpatient care delivered in the country today is provided by HCA facilities. Richard M. Bracken serves as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of HCA, and R. Milton Johnson is the company’s President and Chief Financial Officer.

HCA is committed to the care and improvement of human life and strives to deliver high quality, cost effective healthcare in the communities we serve. Building on the foundation provided by our Mission & Values, HCA puts patients first and works to constantly improve the care we give them by implementing measures that support our caregivers, help ensure patient safety and provide the highest possible quality. Investing in our communities is important to us. HCA typically invests about $1.5 billion annually to keep our facilities modern and up-to-date technologically and to expand and add services where needed. Focusing primarily on communities where the company is a leading healthcare provider, HCA selectively adds new facilities in order to better serve our communities.

And because two HCA founders were physicians, we value highly the strong relationships we've created with local physicians. We endeavor to provide them with a wide array of services and modern facilities in order to help them deliver the best possible care.
