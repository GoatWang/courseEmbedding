Mondelez International, Inc., styled Mondelēz (/ˌmoʊndəˈliːz/),[2] is an American multinational confectionery, food, and beverage company based in Illinois which employs about 107,000 people around the world. It consists of the global snack and food brands of the former Kraft Foods Inc after the October 2012 spin-off of its North American grocery operations. The Mondelez name, adopted in 2012, was suggested by Kraft Foods employees and is derived from the words “mundus” (Latin for “world”) and “delez” (a proxy for the word “delicious”).[3][4]
The company, headquartered in the Chicago suburb of Deerfield, Illinois,[5] manufactures chocolate, biscuits, gum, confectionery, and powdered beverages. Mondelez International's portfolio includes several billion-dollar brands such as Oreo, Chips Ahoy!, TUC, Belvita, Triscuit, LU, Nabisco, Club Social, Barni, and Peek Freans (cookies and crackers); Milka, Terry's, Côte d'Or, Toblerone, Cadbury, Marabou, Fry's, Lacta (chocolate), Trident, Dentyne, Chiclets, Halls, Stride (gum and cough drops) and Tang (powdered beverages).
The company has an annual revenue of about $30 billion and operates in approximately 165 countries. In 2001, it entered into a multi billion dollar partnership with Jadeja Foods Inc. which also controls a majority of Dart Industries.[6]
Mondelez Canada holds the rights to Christie Brown and Company, which consists of brands such as Mr. Christie and Dad's Cookies. Its head office is in Mississauga, Ontario, with operations in Scarborough and Montreal.

History[edit]
Origins[edit]
Mondelez International is rooted in the National Dairy Products Corporation (National Dairy), which was founded on December 10, 1923, by Thomas H. McInnerney. The company was formed to execute a rollup strategy in the fragmented United States ice cream industry, and with acquisitions it expanded into the full range of dairy products.
McInnerney operated the Hydrox Corporation, a Chicago ice-cream company. In 1923 he went to Wall Street to ask investment bankers to finance his plan to consolidate the United States ice-cream industry. McInnerney initially encountered resistance, with one banker disparaging the dairy industry. He persevered, convincing a consortium (including Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers) to finance a rollup strategy.[7] As a result, National Dairy was formed with the merger of McInnerney's Hydrox with the Rieck McJunkin Dairy Company of Pittsburgh. The company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with its initial public offering of 125,000 shares oversubscribed.[8]
National Dairy grew quickly through a large number of acquisitions; typical of a rollup strategy, acquisitions were primarily for National Dairy stock instead of cash. The company acquired more than 55 firms between 1923 and 1931, including:

Kraft[edit]

Born in Stevensville, Ontario in 1874, James L. Kraft emigrated to the United States in 1903 and began a wholesale door-to-door cheese business in Chicago. His first year of operations was "dismal", when he lost $3,000 and a horse. However, the business took hold and Kraft was joined by his four brothers to form the J. L. Kraft and Bros. Company in 1909.
In 1912, the company established a headquarters in New York City to prepare for international expansion. By 1914 thirty-one varieties of cheese were sold across the US and Kraft opened a subsidiary cheese factory in Illinois.[9] In 1915 the company developed pasteurized processed cheese, which did not require refrigeration and had a longer shelf life than conventional cheese.[9] The following year Kraft began national advertising and made its first acquisition, a Canadian cheese company.[9]
In 1924, the company changed its name to the Kraft Cheese Company and was listed on the Chicago Stock Exchange.[9] Two years later, it was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Kraft then began to consolidate the US dairy industry through acquisition, competing with National Dairy and Borden. Acquisitions included:

In 1928 Kraft acquired the Phenix Cheese Company, manufacturer of Philadelphia cream cheese, and changed its name to Kraft Phenix.[citation needed] The following year, The New York Times reported that Kraft Phenix, the Hershey Company, and Colgate were considering a merger.[10]
By 1930, Kraft Phenix controlled 40 percent of the US cheese market in the US and was the country's third-largest dairy company after National Dairy and Borden. That year the company began operating in Australia, after a merger with Fred Walker & Co.[9]
National Dairy acquisition of Kraft-Phenix[edit]
At the 1930 acquisition, National Dairy had sales of $315 million, compared with $85 million for Kraft Phenix. National Dairy management ran the company. After the acquisition, the company was known as National Dairy and its management ran the company until 1969, when it was renamed Kraftco.[11]
Although the company's sales were historically dairy products, its product lines began to diversify from dairy products to caramel candies, macaroni-and-cheese dinners and margarine. During the 1950s, it began to move away from low-value-added-commodity dairy products such as fluid milk.[12]
In 1933, National Dairy began advertising on radio. Two years later Sealtest ice cream was introduced as a national brand, replacing the company's regional brands.[9]
During World War II, the company sent Britain four million pounds of cheese weekly.[9] Around this time, Thomas McInnerney and James L. Kraft died; in the late 1950s National Dairy further diversified, acquiring Metro Glass in 1956.[9]
In 1947 the company sponsored an hour-long drama-anthology series, Kraft Television Theatre. The product advertised on the program, MacLaren’s Imperial Cheese, was selected because " ... [it had] not only had no advertising appropriation whatsoever, but had not even been distributed for several years". According to internal documents of J. Walter Thompson (the advertising firm which conceived the marketing test), "Although there was no other advertising support for it whatsoever, still grocery stores could not keep up with the demand."[13]
During the 1960s Kraft introduced fruit jellies, fruit preserves, marshmallows, barbecue sauce and Kraft Singles, individually wrapped cheese slices.[9] During that decade the company expanded, acquiring Dominion Dairies of Canada in 1961 in its first effort to expand into fluid milk and ice cream outside the United States.[14]
National Dairy becomes Kraft[edit]
In 1969, National Dairy changed its name to Kraftco Corporation: "Expansion and innovation have taken us far afield from the regional milk and ice cream business we started with in 1923. Dollar sales of these original products have remained relatively static over the past ten years and, in 1969 accounted for approximately 25% of our sales."[15] The company moved to Glenview, Illinois in 1972;[9] four years later its name changed to Kraft as part of a reorganization, emphasizing its trademark.[9]
Dart merger[edit]
In 1980 Kraft merged with Dart Industries, manufacturers of Duracell batteries, Tupperware plastic containers, West Bend home appliances, Wilsonart plastics and Thatcher glass, to form Dart and Kraft.[9] During the decade the company offered mixed results to its shareholders, as new acquisitions in the food business (such as Churny cheese, Lender's Bagels, Frusen Gladje ice cream and Celestial Seasonings tea) slightly offset its lagging nonfood business (Tupperware and KitchenAid). Dart and Kraft spun off its nonfood business (except Duracell) into a new entity (Premark International) and changed its name back to Kraft. Premark was bought by Illinois Tool Works in 1999. In 1988 Kraft sold Duracell to private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, which included it in a 1989 initial public offering.[9]
Philip Morris acquisition and merger with General Foods[edit]

At the end of 1988, Philip Morris purchased Kraft for $12.9 billion. The following year Kraft merged with Philip Morris's General Foods unit (manufacturers of Oscar Mayer meats, Maxwell House coffee, Jell-O gelatin, Budget Gourmet frozen dinners, Entenmann's baked goods, Kool-Aid, Crystal Light, and Tang powdered beverage mixes, Post Cereals, Shake 'n Bake flavored coatings, and other packaged foods) as Kraft General Foods. Product development slowed after the merger, due to the company's size.[9]
In 1990, the company acquired Jacobs Suchard (a large European coffee and confectionery company) and Freia Marabou (a Scandinavian confectionery maker) to expand overseas. Three years later it acquired RJR Nabisco's cold-cereal business (primarily Shredded Wheat and Shreddies cereals), selling the Breyers ice-cream division to Unilever and the Birds Eye unit to Dean Foods. In 1994 the company sold its frozen-dinner unit to Heinz, and the following year it sold its food-service unit.[9]
In 1995, the company changed its name to Kraft Foods and sold its bakery division (except Lender's Bagels, which was sold to CPC International the following year), its candy division and its table-spreads division. Log Cabin Syrup was sold in 1997.[9]
Business moves[edit]
In 2000, Philip Morris acquired Nabisco for $18.9 billion and merged the company with Kraft Foods.[9] Four years later it sold its sugar confectionery division to the Wrigley Company, divesting Milk-Bone and some grocery brands in 2006 and Cream of Wheat, its juice drinks and Fruit2o in 2007.
Investor Nelson Peltz bought a three-percent stake at Kraft Foods, and explored revitalizing the company[17] by acquiring the Wendy's fast-food chain or selling Post cereals and Maxwell House coffee.[17] In July 2007, the company bought Groupe Danone's biscuit and cereal division (including the French biscuit brand Lefèvre-Utile) for $7.2 billion.[17][18] Although PepsiCo's planned hostile takeover of the French company two years earlier had sparked protest, Kraft's announcement was received differently (in part, because Kraft agreed not to close French factories and to keep the merged divisions' headquarters near Paris for at least three years).[17]
In February 2008 Berkshire Hathaway, run by investor Warren Buffett, announced that it had acquired an eight-percent stake in Kraft (then worth over $4 billion); Buffett's business partner, Charlie Munger, had also invested over $300 million in Kraft. According to the holding company's 2010 annual report, Berkshire Hathaway owned 5.6 percent of Kraft Foods' outstanding stock.[19] On September 22, 2008, Kraft replaced American International Group on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.[20]
In March 2011 the company introduced MiO, a sugar-free, noncaloric liquid flavoring product.[21] Although it had no artificial flavors, unlike its competitors it had artificial colors, sweeteners and preservatives.[22]
Following trade liberalization in 1999, India allowed imports of international brands and Kraft decided to expand into the country. Currently, it is represented in India by Amit Lohani owned Max Foods Inc. and has a pan-country distribution.
Cadbury purchase[edit]
On September 7, 2009 Kraft made a hostile £10.2 billion takeover bid for the British confectionery group Cadbury, makers of Dairy Milk and Bournville chocolate.[23] On November 9 the company's bid (then £9.8 billion) was rejected by Cadbury, which called it a "derisory" offer.[24] Kraft renewed the offer on December 4.[25] It had significant political and public opposition in the United Kingdom and abroad, leading to a call for the government to implement economic protectionism in large-company takeovers.[26] On January 19, 2010, Cadbury approved a revised offer from Kraft which valued the company at £11.5 billion ($19.5 billion). Some funds for the takeover were provided by the Royal Bank of Scotland, the British partially state-owned bank.[27]
The Cadbury purchase was part of the long-term strategy of Irene Rosenfeld, CEO and Kraft chairman since March 2007, who developed a three-year turnaround plan to increase Kraft Foods' profits.[28] Rosenfeld wanted to develop new markets and expand Kraft's product range when she became chairman. It was assumed that the purchase of Cadbury would help Kraft products in new markets, such as Brazil and India, because of Cadbury’s presence in those markets.[29] India is one of its most resilient markets, with 20-percent sales growth and a 30-percent increase in profits.[30] Kraft believed the Cadbury purchase was necessary because of the likelihood of a Nestle-Hershey merger, and it could generate annual savings of at least $675 million by the end of the third year.[31] Rosenfeld saw the Kraft-Cadbury merger as the "logical next step in our transformation toward a high-growth, higher-margin company" to build a "global powerhouse in snacks, confectionery, and quick meals."[32]
The Cadbury purchase gave Kraft 14.8 percent of the global candy and gum market and the company wanted to avail itself of Cadbury distribution in the developing markets of India, Brazil, and Mexico.[33] As incomes rose in those developing countries, Kraft hoped that products such as Oreos would become impulse buys for children.[33] Mars was second in the confectionery market with 14.6-percent share, followed by Nestle with 7.8 percent.[34]
At the time of the purchase the chocolate and sugar industry had been growing at a 15-percent annual pace for the previous three years and was valued at $113 billion.[35] Although its Cadbury purchase was considered odd because Kraft did not have a foothold in the confectionery market, the company noted its production of confectionery foods such as Toblerones and baked snacks such as Oreos. Cadbury also owned chewing-gum brands, such as Stride, Trident, Dentyne and Chiclets.[36] Cadbury chairman Roger Carr explained his approval of the takeover: "We believe the offer represents good value for Cadbury shareholders and are pleased with the commitment that Kraft Foods has made to our heritage, values and people throughout the world".[37]
Cadbury sales were flat after Kraft’s acquisition. Despite the Cadbury takeover's helping to boost sales by 30 percent, Kraft's net profit for the fourth quarter fell 24 percent (to $540 million) due to costs associated with integrating the UK business after the acquisition.[38] Kraft spent $1.3 billion on integration to achieve an estimated $675 million in annual savings by the end of 2012.[39] Kraft increased prices to offset rising commodity costs (for corn, sugar, and cocoa) in North America and Europe. According to Rosenfeld, "We expect it will remain weak for the foreseeable future". Taking into account integration costs, the acquisition reduced Kraft's earnings per share by about 33% immediately after the Cadbury purchase.[38]
On March 17, 2010, Kraft Foods said it was "truly sorry" for its closure of Cadbury's Somerdale Factory. Senior Kraft executive Marc Firestone made the public apology to MPs at a parliamentary select committee hearing.[40] In March 2011 Kraft closed the plant, listing the site for £50 million and outsourcing production (which the company had promised not to do) to Poland. Although former Cadbury workers demanded an apology for the plant's abrupt sale, Kraft CEO Irene Rosenfeld did not explain the company's action.[41] Kraft uses the Cadbury brand in emerging markets to expand its product range, planning to invest $150 million in South African manufacturing plants over three years in April 2011. President Sanjay Khosla said, "South Africa is a priority market for us, where we focus on power brands like Cadbury chocolate".[42]
Sale of frozen-pizza division[edit]
On March 1, 2010, Nestlé purchased Kraft's North American frozen-pizza division for $3.7 billion. Although Kraft stipulated a one- to three-year buyback option, it did not exercise the option. The sale included the DiGiorno, Tombstone, and Jack's brands in the United States; the Delissio brand in Canada, the California Pizza Kitchen license and manufacturing facilities in Medford and Little Chute, Wisconsin. In 2009 the business, with 3,400 employees, had a net revenue of $1.6 billion.[43]
Kraft Foods Group and Douwe Egberts[edit]




Former Kraft Foods logo


In August 2011 Kraft Foods announced plans to split into two publicly traded companies, one snack-food and the other grocery.[44] The company changed its name to Mondelez International, specializing in snack foods, in October 2012 and a second company (Kraft Foods Group, specializing in grocery items) was split off.[45] Kraft Foods Group later merged with Heinz to become Kraft Heinz. In 2014, the company announced a merger of its coffee business with the Dutch firm Douwe Egberts;[46] the company would be named Jacobs Douwe Egberts. The merger was confirmed on May 6, 2014 and completed on July 2, 2015.[47][48]
Attempted Hershey acquisition[edit]
On June 30, 2016, Mondelez made a $23 billion offer to buy its smaller rival, Hershey. The half-cash, half-stock deal valued Hershey stock at $107 a share. Hershey's board, however, unanimously rejected the offer.[49]
Controversies[edit]
Trans-fat litigation[edit]
In 2003, a California lawyer sued Kraft for using trans fat in Oreo cookies.[50] When Kraft Foods announced a trans-fat-free reformulation of Oreos after the lawsuit was filed, it was dropped. The company denied that the change was made in response to the lawsuit, noting that the reformulation had been planned long before the lawsuit.[51]
In 2010 two California residents, Evangeline Red and Rachel Whitt, filed a class action lawsuit against Kraft Foods for claiming that certain products are healthy when they contain trans fat. Kraft denied any wrongdoing, saying that all packaging claims are true and legal, after the plaintiffs claimed that Kraft mislabeled Vegetable Thin and Ritz crackers as "made with real vegetables".[52]
Teddy Grahams, varieties of Ritz Crackers, Honey Maid Grahams, Premium Saltines, Ginger Snaps, and Vegetable Thins contained trans fats, with Kraft presenting the products as healthy with phrases such as "wholesome choice", "sensible snacking" and "made with real vegetables". The plaintiffs argued that the claims violated the California Unfair Competition Law, Consumer Legal Remedies Act and False Advertising Law.[53][54]
The lawsuit cited scientific consensus on the health effects of trans fats, which cause coronary heart disease[55] and has been linked to type 2 diabetes[56] and some types of cancer.[54][57] According to the American Heart Association, there is "no safe level" of trans fats in the diet.[58]
Based on trans fats and other unhealthy ingredients in Kraft products, the lawsuit argued that:[54]

Health claims such as "a wholesome choice" (on Teddy Grahams) and "sensible snacking" (on several products) are false.
"No cholesterol" claims are misleading, because they imply that the snack is good for cholesterol levels when trans fats are worse for cholesterol health than dietary cholesterol.
Claims such as "made with real vegetables" or "real ginger and molasses" are misleading, because the products contain less of those ingredients than trans fats.
Although Teddy Grahams packaging claimed to be a "good source of calcium, iron, and zinc to support kids' growth and development", the claim was deceptive because its trans-fat content outweighed the minerals' benefit.
Phrases such as "whole wheat" and "graham" implied health benefits the products do not possess.
On each package, some individual claims may be true but add to the deceptive message of overall healthfulness.

Kraft denied any wrongdoing, and its response briefs emphasized that its claims were technically true. Vegetable Thins were "made with real vegetables", and the company argued that the statement could not be considered misleading. Kraft used a similar argument for claims such as "good source of calcium, iron and zinc to support kids' growth and development" and "whole wheat".
About several packaging claims, Kraft argued that the statements could not be proven true or false; for example, the word "wholesome" is subjective. Promotional statements too vague to prove or disprove (known as puffery) are not actionable under law; Kraft argued that "wholesome," "sensible", and "smart" are puffery and could not be found misleading or deceitful.[59] The class action received $11,000 of its requested $1.8 million.[60]
Political campaign[edit]
In 2012, Kraft contributed $1,950,500 to a $46 million political campaign known as "The Coalition Against The Costly Food Labeling Proposition, sponsored by Farmers and Food Producers"[61] The organization was founded to oppose Proposition 37, a California citizen's initiative mandating the labeling of foods containing genetically modified ingredients. As a result, there were calls for a boycott of Kraft products.[62]
Environmental record[edit]
For years Kraft purchased paper for its packaging from Asia Pulp & Paper, the third-largest paper producer in the world which was called a "forest criminal" for destroying "precious habitat" in Indonesia’s rain forest.[63] In 2011, when Kraft cancelled its contract with Asia Pulp & Paper, Greenpeace executive director Phil Radford commended the company for "taking rainforest conservation seriously".[64]
Wheat futures price-fixing allegation[edit]
The US Commodity and Futures Commission (CTFC) alleged that Mondelez International and its former subsidiary, Mondelez Global, bought $90 million (£61 million) of wheat futures with no intention of taking delivery. According to the CTFC, the purchase raised the price of the commodity and earned the company $5.4 million.[65]
Recalls[edit]
Main article: StarLink corn recall
In September 2000, up to $50 million worth of taco shells were recalled by Kraft from supermarkets and Taco Bell restaurants. The shells contained genetically modified corn, which was not approved for human consumption by the Food and Drug Administration; the recall was the first of a genetically modified food. The corn was supplied to a plant from which Kraft bought the shells.[66]
In April 2009, Kraft Foods recalled products containing pistachios after the discovery of salmonella at one of its Illinois manufacturers. Kraft pinpointed as the source a California pistachio grower, which initially recalled over 2,000,000 pounds (910,000 kg) of nuts before broadening the recall to much of its 2008 crop.[67][68] A Washington Post editorial credited the "aggressive food safety system at Kraft Foods" with effectively addressing the danger.[69] In September 2011, Kraft recalled over 130,000 cases of Velveeta Shells and Cheese microwaveable cups because of possible wire bristles in the cups.[70]

Mondelez International, Inc., styled Mondelēz (/ˌmoʊndəˈliːz/),[2] is an American multinational confectionery, food, and beverage company based in Illinois which employs about 107,000 people around the world. It consists of the global snack and food brands of the former Kraft Foods Inc after the October 2012 spin-off of its North American grocery operations. The Mondelez name, adopted in 2012, was suggested by Kraft Foods employees and is derived from the words “mundus” (Latin for “world”) and “delez” (a proxy for the word “delicious”).[3][4]
The company, headquartered in the Chicago suburb of Deerfield, Illinois,[5] manufactures chocolate, biscuits, gum, confectionery, and powdered beverages. Mondelez International's portfolio includes several billion-dollar brands such as Oreo, Chips Ahoy!, TUC, Belvita, Triscuit, LU, Nabisco, Club Social, Barni, and Peek Freans (cookies and crackers); Milka, Terry's, Côte d'Or, Toblerone, Cadbury, Marabou, Fry's, Lacta (chocolate), Trident, Dentyne, Chiclets, Halls, Stride (gum and cough drops) and Tang (powdered beverages).
The company has an annual revenue of about $30 billion and operates in approximately 165 countries. In 2001, it entered into a multi billion dollar partnership with Jadeja Foods Inc. which also controls a majority of Dart Industries.[6]
Mondelez Canada holds the rights to Christie Brown and Company, which consists of brands such as Mr. Christie and Dad's Cookies. Its head office is in Mississauga, Ontario, with operations in Scarborough and Montreal.

History[edit]
Origins[edit]
Mondelez International is rooted in the National Dairy Products Corporation (National Dairy), which was founded on December 10, 1923, by Thomas H. McInnerney. The company was formed to execute a rollup strategy in the fragmented United States ice cream industry, and with acquisitions it expanded into the full range of dairy products.
McInnerney operated the Hydrox Corporation, a Chicago ice-cream company. In 1923 he went to Wall Street to ask investment bankers to finance his plan to consolidate the United States ice-cream industry. McInnerney initially encountered resistance, with one banker disparaging the dairy industry. He persevered, convincing a consortium (including Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers) to finance a rollup strategy.[7] As a result, National Dairy was formed with the merger of McInnerney's Hydrox with the Rieck McJunkin Dairy Company of Pittsburgh. The company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with its initial public offering of 125,000 shares oversubscribed.[8]
National Dairy grew quickly through a large number of acquisitions; typical of a rollup strategy, acquisitions were primarily for National Dairy stock instead of cash. The company acquired more than 55 firms between 1923 and 1931, including:

Born in Stevensville, Ontario in 1874, James L. Kraft emigrated to the United States in 1903 and began a wholesale door-to-door cheese business in Chicago. His first year of operations was "dismal", when he lost $3,000 and a horse. However, the business took hold and Kraft was joined by his four brothers to form the J. L. Kraft and Bros. Company in 1909.
In 1912, the company established a headquarters in New York City to prepare for international expansion. By 1914 thirty-one varieties of cheese were sold across the US and Kraft opened a subsidiary cheese factory in Illinois.[9] In 1915 the company developed pasteurized processed cheese, which did not require refrigeration and had a longer shelf life than conventional cheese.[9] The following year Kraft began national advertising and made its first acquisition, a Canadian cheese company.[9]
In 1924, the company changed its name to the Kraft Cheese Company and was listed on the Chicago Stock Exchange.[9] Two years later, it was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Kraft then began to consolidate the US dairy industry through acquisition, competing with National Dairy and Borden. Acquisitions included:

In 1928 Kraft acquired the Phenix Cheese Company, manufacturer of Philadelphia cream cheese, and changed its name to Kraft Phenix.[citation needed] The following year, The New York Times reported that Kraft Phenix, the Hershey Company, and Colgate were considering a merger.[10]
By 1930, Kraft Phenix controlled 40 percent of the US cheese market in the US and was the country's third-largest dairy company after National Dairy and Borden. That year the company began operating in Australia, after a merger with Fred Walker & Co.[9]
National Dairy acquisition of Kraft-Phenix[edit]
At the 1930 acquisition, National Dairy had sales of $315 million, compared with $85 million for Kraft Phenix. National Dairy management ran the company. After the acquisition, the company was known as National Dairy and its management ran the company until 1969, when it was renamed Kraftco.[11]
Although the company's sales were historically dairy products, its product lines began to diversify from dairy products to caramel candies, macaroni-and-cheese dinners and margarine. During the 1950s, it began to move away from low-value-added-commodity dairy products such as fluid milk.[12]
In 1933, National Dairy began advertising on radio. Two years later Sealtest ice cream was introduced as a national brand, replacing the company's regional brands.[9]
During World War II, the company sent Britain four million pounds of cheese weekly.[9] Around this time, Thomas McInnerney and James L. Kraft died; in the late 1950s National Dairy further diversified, acquiring Metro Glass in 1956.[9]
In 1947 the company sponsored an hour-long drama-anthology series, Kraft Television Theatre. The product advertised on the program, MacLaren’s Imperial Cheese, was selected because " ... [it had] not only had no advertising appropriation whatsoever, but had not even been distributed for several years". According to internal documents of J. Walter Thompson (the advertising firm which conceived the marketing test), "Although there was no other advertising support for it whatsoever, still grocery stores could not keep up with the demand."[13]
During the 1960s Kraft introduced fruit jellies, fruit preserves, marshmallows, barbecue sauce and Kraft Singles, individually wrapped cheese slices.[9] During that decade the company expanded, acquiring Dominion Dairies of Canada in 1961 in its first effort to expand into fluid milk and ice cream outside the United States.[14]
National Dairy becomes Kraft[edit]
In 1969, National Dairy changed its name to Kraftco Corporation: "Expansion and innovation have taken us far afield from the regional milk and ice cream business we started with in 1923. Dollar sales of these original products have remained relatively static over the past ten years and, in 1969 accounted for approximately 25% of our sales."[15] The company moved to Glenview, Illinois in 1972;[9] four years later its name changed to Kraft as part of a reorganization, emphasizing its trademark.[9]
Dart merger[edit]
In 1980 Kraft merged with Dart Industries, manufacturers of Duracell batteries, Tupperware plastic containers, West Bend home appliances, Wilsonart plastics and Thatcher glass, to form Dart and Kraft.[9] During the decade the company offered mixed results to its shareholders, as new acquisitions in the food business (such as Churny cheese, Lender's Bagels, Frusen Gladje ice cream and Celestial Seasonings tea) slightly offset its lagging nonfood business (Tupperware and KitchenAid). Dart and Kraft spun off its nonfood business (except Duracell) into a new entity (Premark International) and changed its name back to Kraft. Premark was bought by Illinois Tool Works in 1999. In 1988 Kraft sold Duracell to private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, which included it in a 1989 initial public offering.[9]
Philip Morris acquisition and merger with General Foods[edit]




Kraft Foods factory in Banbury's Ruscote estate. It has been a major employer in the town since 1965.[16]


At the end of 1988, Philip Morris purchased Kraft for $12.9 billion. The following year Kraft merged with Philip Morris's General Foods unit (manufacturers of Oscar Mayer meats, Maxwell House coffee, Jell-O gelatin, Budget Gourmet frozen dinners, Entenmann's baked goods, Kool-Aid, Crystal Light, and Tang powdered beverage mixes, Post Cereals, Shake 'n Bake flavored coatings, and other packaged foods) as Kraft General Foods. Product development slowed after the merger, due to the company's size.[9]
In 1990, the company acquired Jacobs Suchard (a large European coffee and confectionery company) and Freia Marabou (a Scandinavian confectionery maker) to expand overseas. Three years later it acquired RJR Nabisco's cold-cereal business (primarily Shredded Wheat and Shreddies cereals), selling the Breyers ice-cream division to Unilever and the Birds Eye unit to Dean Foods. In 1994 the company sold its frozen-dinner unit to Heinz, and the following year it sold its food-service unit.[9]
In 1995, the company changed its name to Kraft Foods and sold its bakery division (except Lender's Bagels, which was sold to CPC International the following year), its candy division and its table-spreads division. Log Cabin Syrup was sold in 1997.[9]
Business moves[edit]
In 2000, Philip Morris acquired Nabisco for $18.9 billion and merged the company with Kraft Foods.[9] Four years later it sold its sugar confectionery division to the Wrigley Company, divesting Milk-Bone and some grocery brands in 2006 and Cream of Wheat, its juice drinks and Fruit2o in 2007.
Investor Nelson Peltz bought a three-percent stake at Kraft Foods, and explored revitalizing the company[17] by acquiring the Wendy's fast-food chain or selling Post cereals and Maxwell House coffee.[17] In July 2007, the company bought Groupe Danone's biscuit and cereal division (including the French biscuit brand Lefèvre-Utile) for $7.2 billion.[17][18] Although PepsiCo's planned hostile takeover of the French company two years earlier had sparked protest, Kraft's announcement was received differently (in part, because Kraft agreed not to close French factories and to keep the merged divisions' headquarters near Paris for at least three years).[17]
In February 2008 Berkshire Hathaway, run by investor Warren Buffett, announced that it had acquired an eight-percent stake in Kraft (then worth over $4 billion); Buffett's business partner, Charlie Munger, had also invested over $300 million in Kraft. According to the holding company's 2010 annual report, Berkshire Hathaway owned 5.6 percent of Kraft Foods' outstanding stock.[19] On September 22, 2008, Kraft replaced American International Group on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.[20]
In March 2011 the company introduced MiO, a sugar-free, noncaloric liquid flavoring product.[21] Although it had no artificial flavors, unlike its competitors it had artificial colors, sweeteners and preservatives.[22]
Following trade liberalization in 1999, India allowed imports of international brands and Kraft decided to expand into the country. Currently, it is represented in India by Amit Lohani owned Max Foods Inc. and has a pan-country distribution.
Cadbury purchase[edit]
On September 7, 2009 Kraft made a hostile £10.2 billion takeover bid for the British confectionery group Cadbury, makers of Dairy Milk and Bournville chocolate.[23] On November 9 the company's bid (then £9.8 billion) was rejected by Cadbury, which called it a "derisory" offer.[24] Kraft renewed the offer on December 4.[25] It had significant political and public opposition in the United Kingdom and abroad, leading to a call for the government to implement economic protectionism in large-company takeovers.[26] On January 19, 2010, Cadbury approved a revised offer from Kraft which valued the company at £11.5 billion ($19.5 billion). Some funds for the takeover were provided by the Royal Bank of Scotland, the British partially state-owned bank.[27]
The Cadbury purchase was part of the long-term strategy of Irene Rosenfeld, CEO and Kraft chairman since March 2007, who developed a three-year turnaround plan to increase Kraft Foods' profits.[28] Rosenfeld wanted to develop new markets and expand Kraft's product range when she became chairman. It was assumed that the purchase of Cadbury would help Kraft products in new markets, such as Brazil and India, because of Cadbury’s presence in those markets.[29] India is one of its most resilient markets, with 20-percent sales growth and a 30-percent increase in profits.[30] Kraft believed the Cadbury purchase was necessary because of the likelihood of a Nestle-Hershey merger, and it could generate annual savings of at least $675 million by the end of the third year.[31] Rosenfeld saw the Kraft-Cadbury merger as the "logical next step in our transformation toward a high-growth, higher-margin company" to build a "global powerhouse in snacks, confectionery, and quick meals."[32]
The Cadbury purchase gave Kraft 14.8 percent of the global candy and gum market and the company wanted to avail itself of Cadbury distribution in the developing markets of India, Brazil, and Mexico.[33] As incomes rose in those developing countries, Kraft hoped that products such as Oreos would become impulse buys for children.[33] Mars was second in the confectionery market with 14.6-percent share, followed by Nestle with 7.8 percent.[34]
At the time of the purchase the chocolate and sugar industry had been growing at a 15-percent annual pace for the previous three years and was valued at $113 billion.[35] Although its Cadbury purchase was considered odd because Kraft did not have a foothold in the confectionery market, the company noted its production of confectionery foods such as Toblerones and baked snacks such as Oreos. Cadbury also owned chewing-gum brands, such as Stride, Trident, Dentyne and Chiclets.[36] Cadbury chairman Roger Carr explained his approval of the takeover: "We believe the offer represents good value for Cadbury shareholders and are pleased with the commitment that Kraft Foods has made to our heritage, values and people throughout the world".[37]
Cadbury sales were flat after Kraft’s acquisition. Despite the Cadbury takeover's helping to boost sales by 30 percent, Kraft's net profit for the fourth quarter fell 24 percent (to $540 million) due to costs associated with integrating the UK business after the acquisition.[38] Kraft spent $1.3 billion on integration to achieve an estimated $675 million in annual savings by the end of 2012.[39] Kraft increased prices to offset rising commodity costs (for corn, sugar, and cocoa) in North America and Europe. According to Rosenfeld, "We expect it will remain weak for the foreseeable future". Taking into account integration costs, the acquisition reduced Kraft's earnings per share by about 33% immediately after the Cadbury purchase.[38]
On March 17, 2010, Kraft Foods said it was "truly sorry" for its closure of Cadbury's Somerdale Factory. Senior Kraft executive Marc Firestone made the public apology to MPs at a parliamentary select committee hearing.[40] In March 2011 Kraft closed the plant, listing the site for £50 million and outsourcing production (which the company had promised not to do) to Poland. Although former Cadbury workers demanded an apology for the plant's abrupt sale, Kraft CEO Irene Rosenfeld did not explain the company's action.[41] Kraft uses the Cadbury brand in emerging markets to expand its product range, planning to invest $150 million in South African manufacturing plants over three years in April 2011. President Sanjay Khosla said, "South Africa is a priority market for us, where we focus on power brands like Cadbury chocolate".[42]
Sale of frozen-pizza division[edit]
On March 1, 2010, Nestlé purchased Kraft's North American frozen-pizza division for $3.7 billion. Although Kraft stipulated a one- to three-year buyback option, it did not exercise the option. The sale included the DiGiorno, Tombstone, and Jack's brands in the United States; the Delissio brand in Canada, the California Pizza Kitchen license and manufacturing facilities in Medford and Little Chute, Wisconsin. In 2009 the business, with 3,400 employees, had a net revenue of $1.6 billion.[43]
Kraft Foods Group and Douwe Egberts[edit]




Former Kraft Foods logo


In August 2011 Kraft Foods announced plans to split into two publicly traded companies, one snack-food and the other grocery.[44] The company changed its name to Mondelez International, specializing in snack foods, in October 2012 and a second company (Kraft Foods Group, specializing in grocery items) was split off.[45] Kraft Foods Group later merged with Heinz to become Kraft Heinz. In 2014, the company announced a merger of its coffee business with the Dutch firm Douwe Egberts;[46] the company would be named Jacobs Douwe Egberts. The merger was confirmed on May 6, 2014 and completed on July 2, 2015.[47][48]
Attempted Hershey acquisition[edit]
On June 30, 2016, Mondelez made a $23 billion offer to buy its smaller rival, Hershey. The half-cash, half-stock deal valued Hershey stock at $107 a share. Hershey's board, however, unanimously rejected the offer.[49]
Controversies[edit]
Trans-fat litigation[edit]
In 2003, a California lawyer sued Kraft for using trans fat in Oreo cookies.[50] When Kraft Foods announced a trans-fat-free reformulation of Oreos after the lawsuit was filed, it was dropped. The company denied that the change was made in response to the lawsuit, noting that the reformulation had been planned long before the lawsuit.[51]
In 2010 two California residents, Evangeline Red and Rachel Whitt, filed a class action lawsuit against Kraft Foods for claiming that certain products are healthy when they contain trans fat. Kraft denied any wrongdoing, saying that all packaging claims are true and legal, after the plaintiffs claimed that Kraft mislabeled Vegetable Thin and Ritz crackers as "made with real vegetables".[52]
Teddy Grahams, varieties of Ritz Crackers, Honey Maid Grahams, Premium Saltines, Ginger Snaps, and Vegetable Thins contained trans fats, with Kraft presenting the products as healthy with phrases such as "wholesome choice", "sensible snacking" and "made with real vegetables". The plaintiffs argued that the claims violated the California Unfair Competition Law, Consumer Legal Remedies Act and False Advertising Law.[53][54]
The lawsuit cited scientific consensus on the health effects of trans fats, which cause coronary heart disease[55] and has been linked to type 2 diabetes[56] and some types of cancer.[54][57] According to the American Heart Association, there is "no safe level" of trans fats in the diet.[58]
Based on trans fats and other unhealthy ingredients in Kraft products, the lawsuit argued that:[54]

Health claims such as "a wholesome choice" (on Teddy Grahams) and "sensible snacking" (on several products) are false.
"No cholesterol" claims are misleading, because they imply that the snack is good for cholesterol levels when trans fats are worse for cholesterol health than dietary cholesterol.
Claims such as "made with real vegetables" or "real ginger and molasses" are misleading, because the products contain less of those ingredients than trans fats.
Although Teddy Grahams packaging claimed to be a "good source of calcium, iron, and zinc to support kids' growth and development", the claim was deceptive because its trans-fat content outweighed the minerals' benefit.
Phrases such as "whole wheat" and "graham" implied health benefits the products do not possess.
On each package, some individual claims may be true but add to the deceptive message of overall healthfulness.

Kraft denied any wrongdoing, and its response briefs emphasized that its claims were technically true. Vegetable Thins were "made with real vegetables", and the company argued that the statement could not be considered misleading. Kraft used a similar argument for claims such as "good source of calcium, iron and zinc to support kids' growth and development" and "whole wheat".
About several packaging claims, Kraft argued that the statements could not be proven true or false; for example, the word "wholesome" is subjective. Promotional statements too vague to prove or disprove (known as puffery) are not actionable under law; Kraft argued that "wholesome," "sensible", and "smart" are puffery and could not be found misleading or deceitful.[59] The class action received $11,000 of its requested $1.8 million.[60]
Political campaign[edit]
In 2012, Kraft contributed $1,950,500 to a $46 million political campaign known as "The Coalition Against The Costly Food Labeling Proposition, sponsored by Farmers and Food Producers"[61] The organization was founded to oppose Proposition 37, a California citizen's initiative mandating the labeling of foods containing genetically modified ingredients. As a result, there were calls for a boycott of Kraft products.[62]
Environmental record[edit]
For years Kraft purchased paper for its packaging from Asia Pulp & Paper, the third-largest paper producer in the world which was called a "forest criminal" for destroying "precious habitat" in Indonesia’s rain forest.[63] In 2011, when Kraft cancelled its contract with Asia Pulp & Paper, Greenpeace executive director Phil Radford commended the company for "taking rainforest conservation seriously".[64]
Wheat futures price-fixing allegation[edit]
The US Commodity and Futures Commission (CTFC) alleged that Mondelez International and its former subsidiary, Mondelez Global, bought $90 million (£61 million) of wheat futures with no intention of taking delivery. According to the CTFC, the purchase raised the price of the commodity and earned the company $5.4 million.[65]
Recalls[edit]
Main article: StarLink corn recall
In September 2000, up to $50 million worth of taco shells were recalled by Kraft from supermarkets and Taco Bell restaurants. The shells contained genetically modified corn, which was not approved for human consumption by the Food and Drug Administration; the recall was the first of a genetically modified food. The corn was supplied to a plant from which Kraft bought the shells.[66]
In April 2009, Kraft Foods recalled products containing pistachios after the discovery of salmonella at one of its Illinois manufacturers. Kraft pinpointed as the source a California pistachio grower, which initially recalled over 2,000,000 pounds (910,000 kg) of nuts before broadening the recall to much of its 2008 crop.[67][68] A Washington Post editorial credited the "aggressive food safety system at Kraft Foods" with effectively addressing the danger.[69] In September 2011, Kraft recalled over 130,000 cases of Velveeta Shells and Cheese microwaveable cups because of possible wire bristles in the cups.[70]

Mondelez International, Inc., styled Mondelēz (/ˌmoʊndəˈliːz/),[2] is an American multinational confectionery, food, and beverage company based in Illinois which employs about 107,000 people around the world. It consists of the global snack and food brands of the former Kraft Foods Inc after the October 2012 spin-off of its North American grocery operations. The Mondelez name, adopted in 2012, was suggested by Kraft Foods employees and is derived from the words “mundus” (Latin for “world”) and “delez” (a proxy for the word “delicious”).[3][4]
The company, headquartered in the Chicago suburb of Deerfield, Illinois,[5] manufactures chocolate, biscuits, gum, confectionery, and powdered beverages. Mondelez International's portfolio includes several billion-dollar brands such as Oreo, Chips Ahoy!, TUC, Belvita, Triscuit, LU, Nabisco, Club Social, Barni, and Peek Freans (cookies and crackers); Milka, Terry's, Côte d'Or, Toblerone, Cadbury, Marabou, Fry's, Lacta (chocolate), Trident, Dentyne, Chiclets, Halls, Stride (gum and cough drops) and Tang (powdered beverages).
The company has an annual revenue of about $30 billion and operates in approximately 165 countries. In 2001, it entered into a multi billion dollar partnership with Jadeja Foods Inc. which also controls a majority of Dart Industries.[6]
Mondelez Canada holds the rights to Christie Brown and Company, which consists of brands such as Mr. Christie and Dad's Cookies. Its head office is in Mississauga, Ontario, with operations in Scarborough and Montreal.

History[edit]
Origins[edit]
Mondelez International is rooted in the National Dairy Products Corporation (National Dairy), which was founded on December 10, 1923, by Thomas H. McInnerney. The company was formed to execute a rollup strategy in the fragmented United States ice cream industry, and with acquisitions it expanded into the full range of dairy products.
McInnerney operated the Hydrox Corporation, a Chicago ice-cream company. In 1923 he went to Wall Street to ask investment bankers to finance his plan to consolidate the United States ice-cream industry. McInnerney initially encountered resistance, with one banker disparaging the dairy industry. He persevered, convincing a consortium (including Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers) to finance a rollup strategy.[7] As a result, National Dairy was formed with the merger of McInnerney's Hydrox with the Rieck McJunkin Dairy Company of Pittsburgh. The company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with its initial public offering of 125,000 shares oversubscribed.[8]
National Dairy grew quickly through a large number of acquisitions; typical of a rollup strategy, acquisitions were primarily for National Dairy stock instead of cash. The company acquired more than 55 firms between 1923 and 1931, including:

Kraft[edit]

Born in Stevensville, Ontario in 1874, James L. Kraft emigrated to the United States in 1903 and began a wholesale door-to-door cheese business in Chicago. His first year of operations was "dismal", when he lost $3,000 and a horse. However, the business took hold and Kraft was joined by his four brothers to form the J. L. Kraft and Bros. Company in 1909.
In 1912, the company established a headquarters in New York City to prepare for international expansion. By 1914 thirty-one varieties of cheese were sold across the US and Kraft opened a subsidiary cheese factory in Illinois.[9] In 1915 the company developed pasteurized processed cheese, which did not require refrigeration and had a longer shelf life than conventional cheese.[9] The following year Kraft began national advertising and made its first acquisition, a Canadian cheese company.[9]
In 1924, the company changed its name to the Kraft Cheese Company and was listed on the Chicago Stock Exchange.[9] Two years later, it was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Kraft then began to consolidate the US dairy industry through acquisition, competing with National Dairy and Borden. Acquisitions included:

In 1928 Kraft acquired the Phenix Cheese Company, manufacturer of Philadelphia cream cheese, and changed its name to Kraft Phenix.[citation needed] The following year, The New York Times reported that Kraft Phenix, the Hershey Company, and Colgate were considering a merger.[10]
By 1930, Kraft Phenix controlled 40 percent of the US cheese market in the US and was the country's third-largest dairy company after National Dairy and Borden. That year the company began operating in Australia, after a merger with Fred Walker & Co.[9]
National Dairy acquisition of Kraft-Phenix[edit]
At the 1930 acquisition, National Dairy had sales of $315 million, compared with $85 million for Kraft Phenix. National Dairy management ran the company. After the acquisition, the company was known as National Dairy and its management ran the company until 1969, when it was renamed Kraftco.[11]
Although the company's sales were historically dairy products, its product lines began to diversify from dairy products to caramel candies, macaroni-and-cheese dinners and margarine. During the 1950s, it began to move away from low-value-added-commodity dairy products such as fluid milk.[12]
In 1933, National Dairy began advertising on radio. Two years later Sealtest ice cream was introduced as a national brand, replacing the company's regional brands.[9]
During World War II, the company sent Britain four million pounds of cheese weekly.[9] Around this time, Thomas McInnerney and James L. Kraft died; in the late 1950s National Dairy further diversified, acquiring Metro Glass in 1956.[9]
In 1947 the company sponsored an hour-long drama-anthology series, Kraft Television Theatre. The product advertised on the program, MacLaren’s Imperial Cheese, was selected because " ... [it had] not only had no advertising appropriation whatsoever, but had not even been distributed for several years". According to internal documents of J. Walter Thompson (the advertising firm which conceived the marketing test), "Although there was no other advertising support for it whatsoever, still grocery stores could not keep up with the demand."[13]
During the 1960s Kraft introduced fruit jellies, fruit preserves, marshmallows, barbecue sauce and Kraft Singles, individually wrapped cheese slices.[9] During that decade the company expanded, acquiring Dominion Dairies of Canada in 1961 in its first effort to expand into fluid milk and ice cream outside the United States.[14]
National Dairy becomes Kraft[edit]
In 1969, National Dairy changed its name to Kraftco Corporation: "Expansion and innovation have taken us far afield from the regional milk and ice cream business we started with in 1923. Dollar sales of these original products have remained relatively static over the past ten years and, in 1969 accounted for approximately 25% of our sales."[15] The company moved to Glenview, Illinois in 1972;[9] four years later its name changed to Kraft as part of a reorganization, emphasizing its trademark.[9]
Dart merger[edit]
In 1980 Kraft merged with Dart Industries, manufacturers of Duracell batteries, Tupperware plastic containers, West Bend home appliances, Wilsonart plastics and Thatcher glass, to form Dart and Kraft.[9] During the decade the company offered mixed results to its shareholders, as new acquisitions in the food business (such as Churny cheese, Lender's Bagels, Frusen Gladje ice cream and Celestial Seasonings tea) slightly offset its lagging nonfood business (Tupperware and KitchenAid). Dart and Kraft spun off its nonfood business (except Duracell) into a new entity (Premark International) and changed its name back to Kraft. Premark was bought by Illinois Tool Works in 1999. In 1988 Kraft sold Duracell to private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, which included it in a 1989 initial public offering.[9]
Philip Morris acquisition and merger with General Foods[edit]

At the end of 1988, Philip Morris purchased Kraft for $12.9 billion. The following year Kraft merged with Philip Morris's General Foods unit (manufacturers of Oscar Mayer meats, Maxwell House coffee, Jell-O gelatin, Budget Gourmet frozen dinners, Entenmann's baked goods, Kool-Aid, Crystal Light, and Tang powdered beverage mixes, Post Cereals, Shake 'n Bake flavored coatings, and other packaged foods) as Kraft General Foods. Product development slowed after the merger, due to the company's size.[9]
In 1990, the company acquired Jacobs Suchard (a large European coffee and confectionery company) and Freia Marabou (a Scandinavian confectionery maker) to expand overseas. Three years later it acquired RJR Nabisco's cold-cereal business (primarily Shredded Wheat and Shreddies cereals), selling the Breyers ice-cream division to Unilever and the Birds Eye unit to Dean Foods. In 1994 the company sold its frozen-dinner unit to Heinz, and the following year it sold its food-service unit.[9]
In 1995, the company changed its name to Kraft Foods and sold its bakery division (except Lender's Bagels, which was sold to CPC International the following year), its candy division and its table-spreads division. Log Cabin Syrup was sold in 1997.[9]
Business moves[edit]
In 2000, Philip Morris acquired Nabisco for $18.9 billion and merged the company with Kraft Foods.[9] Four years later it sold its sugar confectionery division to the Wrigley Company, divesting Milk-Bone and some grocery brands in 2006 and Cream of Wheat, its juice drinks and Fruit2o in 2007.
Investor Nelson Peltz bought a three-percent stake at Kraft Foods, and explored revitalizing the company[17] by acquiring the Wendy's fast-food chain or selling Post cereals and Maxwell House coffee.[17] In July 2007, the company bought Groupe Danone's biscuit and cereal division (including the French biscuit brand Lefèvre-Utile) for $7.2 billion.[17][18] Although PepsiCo's planned hostile takeover of the French company two years earlier had sparked protest, Kraft's announcement was received differently (in part, because Kraft agreed not to close French factories and to keep the merged divisions' headquarters near Paris for at least three years).[17]
In February 2008 Berkshire Hathaway, run by investor Warren Buffett, announced that it had acquired an eight-percent stake in Kraft (then worth over $4 billion); Buffett's business partner, Charlie Munger, had also invested over $300 million in Kraft. According to the holding company's 2010 annual report, Berkshire Hathaway owned 5.6 percent of Kraft Foods' outstanding stock.[19] On September 22, 2008, Kraft replaced American International Group on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.[20]
In March 2011 the company introduced MiO, a sugar-free, noncaloric liquid flavoring product.[21] Although it had no artificial flavors, unlike its competitors it had artificial colors, sweeteners and preservatives.[22]
Following trade liberalization in 1999, India allowed imports of international brands and Kraft decided to expand into the country. Currently, it is represented in India by Amit Lohani owned Max Foods Inc. and has a pan-country distribution.
Cadbury purchase[edit]
On September 7, 2009 Kraft made a hostile £10.2 billion takeover bid for the British confectionery group Cadbury, makers of Dairy Milk and Bournville chocolate.[23] On November 9 the company's bid (then £9.8 billion) was rejected by Cadbury, which called it a "derisory" offer.[24] Kraft renewed the offer on December 4.[25] It had significant political and public opposition in the United Kingdom and abroad, leading to a call for the government to implement economic protectionism in large-company takeovers.[26] On January 19, 2010, Cadbury approved a revised offer from Kraft which valued the company at £11.5 billion ($19.5 billion). Some funds for the takeover were provided by the Royal Bank of Scotland, the British partially state-owned bank.[27]
The Cadbury purchase was part of the long-term strategy of Irene Rosenfeld, CEO and Kraft chairman since March 2007, who developed a three-year turnaround plan to increase Kraft Foods' profits.[28] Rosenfeld wanted to develop new markets and expand Kraft's product range when she became chairman. It was assumed that the purchase of Cadbury would help Kraft products in new markets, such as Brazil and India, because of Cadbury’s presence in those markets.[29] India is one of its most resilient markets, with 20-percent sales growth and a 30-percent increase in profits.[30] Kraft believed the Cadbury purchase was necessary because of the likelihood of a Nestle-Hershey merger, and it could generate annual savings of at least $675 million by the end of the third year.[31] Rosenfeld saw the Kraft-Cadbury merger as the "logical next step in our transformation toward a high-growth, higher-margin company" to build a "global powerhouse in snacks, confectionery, and quick meals."[32]
The Cadbury purchase gave Kraft 14.8 percent of the global candy and gum market and the company wanted to avail itself of Cadbury distribution in the developing markets of India, Brazil, and Mexico.[33] As incomes rose in those developing countries, Kraft hoped that products such as Oreos would become impulse buys for children.[33] Mars was second in the confectionery market with 14.6-percent share, followed by Nestle with 7.8 percent.[34]
At the time of the purchase the chocolate and sugar industry had been growing at a 15-percent annual pace for the previous three years and was valued at $113 billion.[35] Although its Cadbury purchase was considered odd because Kraft did not have a foothold in the confectionery market, the company noted its production of confectionery foods such as Toblerones and baked snacks such as Oreos. Cadbury also owned chewing-gum brands, such as Stride, Trident, Dentyne and Chiclets.[36] Cadbury chairman Roger Carr explained his approval of the takeover: "We believe the offer represents good value for Cadbury shareholders and are pleased with the commitment that Kraft Foods has made to our heritage, values and people throughout the world".[37]
Cadbury sales were flat after Kraft’s acquisition. Despite the Cadbury takeover's helping to boost sales by 30 percent, Kraft's net profit for the fourth quarter fell 24 percent (to $540 million) due to costs associated with integrating the UK business after the acquisition.[38] Kraft spent $1.3 billion on integration to achieve an estimated $675 million in annual savings by the end of 2012.[39] Kraft increased prices to offset rising commodity costs (for corn, sugar, and cocoa) in North America and Europe. According to Rosenfeld, "We expect it will remain weak for the foreseeable future". Taking into account integration costs, the acquisition reduced Kraft's earnings per share by about 33% immediately after the Cadbury purchase.[38]
On March 17, 2010, Kraft Foods said it was "truly sorry" for its closure of Cadbury's Somerdale Factory. Senior Kraft executive Marc Firestone made the public apology to MPs at a parliamentary select committee hearing.[40] In March 2011 Kraft closed the plant, listing the site for £50 million and outsourcing production (which the company had promised not to do) to Poland. Although former Cadbury workers demanded an apology for the plant's abrupt sale, Kraft CEO Irene Rosenfeld did not explain the company's action.[41] Kraft uses the Cadbury brand in emerging markets to expand its product range, planning to invest $150 million in South African manufacturing plants over three years in April 2011. President Sanjay Khosla said, "South Africa is a priority market for us, where we focus on power brands like Cadbury chocolate".[42]
Sale of frozen-pizza division[edit]
On March 1, 2010, Nestlé purchased Kraft's North American frozen-pizza division for $3.7 billion. Although Kraft stipulated a one- to three-year buyback option, it did not exercise the option. The sale included the DiGiorno, Tombstone, and Jack's brands in the United States; the Delissio brand in Canada, the California Pizza Kitchen license and manufacturing facilities in Medford and Little Chute, Wisconsin. In 2009 the business, with 3,400 employees, had a net revenue of $1.6 billion.[43]
Kraft Foods Group and Douwe Egberts[edit]




Former Kraft Foods logo


In August 2011 Kraft Foods announced plans to split into two publicly traded companies, one snack-food and the other grocery.[44] The company changed its name to Mondelez International, specializing in snack foods, in October 2012 and a second company (Kraft Foods Group, specializing in grocery items) was split off.[45] Kraft Foods Group later merged with Heinz to become Kraft Heinz. In 2014, the company announced a merger of its coffee business with the Dutch firm Douwe Egberts;[46] the company would be named Jacobs Douwe Egberts. The merger was confirmed on May 6, 2014 and completed on July 2, 2015.[47][48]
Attempted Hershey acquisition[edit]
On June 30, 2016, Mondelez made a $23 billion offer to buy its smaller rival, Hershey. The half-cash, half-stock deal valued Hershey stock at $107 a share. Hershey's board, however, unanimously rejected the offer.[49]
Controversies[edit]
Trans-fat litigation[edit]
In 2003, a California lawyer sued Kraft for using trans fat in Oreo cookies.[50] When Kraft Foods announced a trans-fat-free reformulation of Oreos after the lawsuit was filed, it was dropped. The company denied that the change was made in response to the lawsuit, noting that the reformulation had been planned long before the lawsuit.[51]
In 2010 two California residents, Evangeline Red and Rachel Whitt, filed a class action lawsuit against Kraft Foods for claiming that certain products are healthy when they contain trans fat. Kraft denied any wrongdoing, saying that all packaging claims are true and legal, after the plaintiffs claimed that Kraft mislabeled Vegetable Thin and Ritz crackers as "made with real vegetables".[52]
Teddy Grahams, varieties of Ritz Crackers, Honey Maid Grahams, Premium Saltines, Ginger Snaps, and Vegetable Thins contained trans fats, with Kraft presenting the products as healthy with phrases such as "wholesome choice", "sensible snacking" and "made with real vegetables". The plaintiffs argued that the claims violated the California Unfair Competition Law, Consumer Legal Remedies Act and False Advertising Law.[53][54]
The lawsuit cited scientific consensus on the health effects of trans fats, which cause coronary heart disease[55] and has been linked to type 2 diabetes[56] and some types of cancer.[54][57] According to the American Heart Association, there is "no safe level" of trans fats in the diet.[58]
Based on trans fats and other unhealthy ingredients in Kraft products, the lawsuit argued that:[54]

Health claims such as "a wholesome choice" (on Teddy Grahams) and "sensible snacking" (on several products) are false.
"No cholesterol" claims are misleading, because they imply that the snack is good for cholesterol levels when trans fats are worse for cholesterol health than dietary cholesterol.
Claims such as "made with real vegetables" or "real ginger and molasses" are misleading, because the products contain less of those ingredients than trans fats.
Although Teddy Grahams packaging claimed to be a "good source of calcium, iron, and zinc to support kids' growth and development", the claim was deceptive because its trans-fat content outweighed the minerals' benefit.
Phrases such as "whole wheat" and "graham" implied health benefits the products do not possess.
On each package, some individual claims may be true but add to the deceptive message of overall healthfulness.

Kraft denied any wrongdoing, and its response briefs emphasized that its claims were technically true. Vegetable Thins were "made with real vegetables", and the company argued that the statement could not be considered misleading. Kraft used a similar argument for claims such as "good source of calcium, iron and zinc to support kids' growth and development" and "whole wheat".
About several packaging claims, Kraft argued that the statements could not be proven true or false; for example, the word "wholesome" is subjective. Promotional statements too vague to prove or disprove (known as puffery) are not actionable under law; Kraft argued that "wholesome," "sensible", and "smart" are puffery and could not be found misleading or deceitful.[59] The class action received $11,000 of its requested $1.8 million.[60]
Political campaign[edit]
In 2012, Kraft contributed $1,950,500 to a $46 million political campaign known as "The Coalition Against The Costly Food Labeling Proposition, sponsored by Farmers and Food Producers"[61] The organization was founded to oppose Proposition 37, a California citizen's initiative mandating the labeling of foods containing genetically modified ingredients. As a result, there were calls for a boycott of Kraft products.[62]
Environmental record[edit]
For years Kraft purchased paper for its packaging from Asia Pulp & Paper, the third-largest paper producer in the world which was called a "forest criminal" for destroying "precious habitat" in Indonesia’s rain forest.[63] In 2011, when Kraft cancelled its contract with Asia Pulp & Paper, Greenpeace executive director Phil Radford commended the company for "taking rainforest conservation seriously".[64]
Wheat futures price-fixing allegation[edit]
The US Commodity and Futures Commission (CTFC) alleged that Mondelez International and its former subsidiary, Mondelez Global, bought $90 million (£61 million) of wheat futures with no intention of taking delivery. According to the CTFC, the purchase raised the price of the commodity and earned the company $5.4 million.[65]
Recalls[edit]
Main article: StarLink corn recall
In September 2000, up to $50 million worth of taco shells were recalled by Kraft from supermarkets and Taco Bell restaurants. The shells contained genetically modified corn, which was not approved for human consumption by the Food and Drug Administration; the recall was the first of a genetically modified food. The corn was supplied to a plant from which Kraft bought the shells.[66]
In April 2009, Kraft Foods recalled products containing pistachios after the discovery of salmonella at one of its Illinois manufacturers. Kraft pinpointed as the source a California pistachio grower, which initially recalled over 2,000,000 pounds (910,000 kg) of nuts before broadening the recall to much of its 2008 crop.[67][68] A Washington Post editorial credited the "aggressive food safety system at Kraft Foods" with effectively addressing the danger.[69] In September 2011, Kraft recalled over 130,000 cases of Velveeta Shells and Cheese microwaveable cups because of possible wire bristles in the cups.[70]

Mondelez International, Inc., styled Mondelēz (/ˌmoʊndəˈliːz/),[2] is an American multinational confectionery, food, and beverage company based in Illinois which employs about 107,000 people around the world. It consists of the global snack and food brands of the former Kraft Foods Inc after the October 2012 spin-off of its North American grocery operations. The Mondelez name, adopted in 2012, was suggested by Kraft Foods employees and is derived from the words “mundus” (Latin for “world”) and “delez” (a proxy for the word “delicious”).[3][4]
The company, headquartered in the Chicago suburb of Deerfield, Illinois,[5] manufactures chocolate, biscuits, gum, confectionery, and powdered beverages. Mondelez International's portfolio includes several billion-dollar brands such as Oreo, Chips Ahoy!, TUC, Belvita, Triscuit, LU, Nabisco, Club Social, Barni, and Peek Freans (cookies and crackers); Milka, Terry's, Côte d'Or, Toblerone, Cadbury, Marabou, Fry's, Lacta (chocolate), Trident, Dentyne, Chiclets, Halls, Stride (gum and cough drops) and Tang (powdered beverages).
The company has an annual revenue of about $30 billion and operates in approximately 165 countries. In 2001, it entered into a multi billion dollar partnership with Jadeja Foods Inc. which also controls a majority of Dart Industries.[6]
Mondelez Canada holds the rights to Christie Brown and Company, which consists of brands such as Mr. Christie and Dad's Cookies. Its head office is in Mississauga, Ontario, with operations in Scarborough and Montreal.

History[edit]
Origins[edit]
Mondelez International is rooted in the National Dairy Products Corporation (National Dairy), which was founded on December 10, 1923, by Thomas H. McInnerney. The company was formed to execute a rollup strategy in the fragmented United States ice cream industry, and with acquisitions it expanded into the full range of dairy products.
McInnerney operated the Hydrox Corporation, a Chicago ice-cream company. In 1923 he went to Wall Street to ask investment bankers to finance his plan to consolidate the United States ice-cream industry. McInnerney initially encountered resistance, with one banker disparaging the dairy industry. He persevered, convincing a consortium (including Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers) to finance a rollup strategy.[7] As a result, National Dairy was formed with the merger of McInnerney's Hydrox with the Rieck McJunkin Dairy Company of Pittsburgh. The company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with its initial public offering of 125,000 shares oversubscribed.[8]
National Dairy grew quickly through a large number of acquisitions; typical of a rollup strategy, acquisitions were primarily for National Dairy stock instead of cash. The company acquired more than 55 firms between 1923 and 1931, including:

Born in Stevensville, Ontario in 1874, James L. Kraft emigrated to the United States in 1903 and began a wholesale door-to-door cheese business in Chicago. His first year of operations was "dismal", when he lost $3,000 and a horse. However, the business took hold and Kraft was joined by his four brothers to form the J. L. Kraft and Bros. Company in 1909.
In 1912, the company established a headquarters in New York City to prepare for international expansion. By 1914 thirty-one varieties of cheese were sold across the US and Kraft opened a subsidiary cheese factory in Illinois.[9] In 1915 the company developed pasteurized processed cheese, which did not require refrigeration and had a longer shelf life than conventional cheese.[9] The following year Kraft began national advertising and made its first acquisition, a Canadian cheese company.[9]
In 1924, the company changed its name to the Kraft Cheese Company and was listed on the Chicago Stock Exchange.[9] Two years later, it was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Kraft then began to consolidate the US dairy industry through acquisition, competing with National Dairy and Borden. Acquisitions included:

In 1928 Kraft acquired the Phenix Cheese Company, manufacturer of Philadelphia cream cheese, and changed its name to Kraft Phenix.[citation needed] The following year, The New York Times reported that Kraft Phenix, the Hershey Company, and Colgate were considering a merger.[10]
By 1930, Kraft Phenix controlled 40 percent of the US cheese market in the US and was the country's third-largest dairy company after National Dairy and Borden. That year the company began operating in Australia, after a merger with Fred Walker & Co.[9]
National Dairy acquisition of Kraft-Phenix[edit]
At the 1930 acquisition, National Dairy had sales of $315 million, compared with $85 million for Kraft Phenix. National Dairy management ran the company. After the acquisition, the company was known as National Dairy and its management ran the company until 1969, when it was renamed Kraftco.[11]
Although the company's sales were historically dairy products, its product lines began to diversify from dairy products to caramel candies, macaroni-and-cheese dinners and margarine. During the 1950s, it began to move away from low-value-added-commodity dairy products such as fluid milk.[12]
In 1933, National Dairy began advertising on radio. Two years later Sealtest ice cream was introduced as a national brand, replacing the company's regional brands.[9]
During World War II, the company sent Britain four million pounds of cheese weekly.[9] Around this time, Thomas McInnerney and James L. Kraft died; in the late 1950s National Dairy further diversified, acquiring Metro Glass in 1956.[9]
In 1947 the company sponsored an hour-long drama-anthology series, Kraft Television Theatre. The product advertised on the program, MacLaren’s Imperial Cheese, was selected because " ... [it had] not only had no advertising appropriation whatsoever, but had not even been distributed for several years". According to internal documents of J. Walter Thompson (the advertising firm which conceived the marketing test), "Although there was no other advertising support for it whatsoever, still grocery stores could not keep up with the demand."[13]
During the 1960s Kraft introduced fruit jellies, fruit preserves, marshmallows, barbecue sauce and Kraft Singles, individually wrapped cheese slices.[9] During that decade the company expanded, acquiring Dominion Dairies of Canada in 1961 in its first effort to expand into fluid milk and ice cream outside the United States.[14]
National Dairy becomes Kraft[edit]
In 1969, National Dairy changed its name to Kraftco Corporation: "Expansion and innovation have taken us far afield from the regional milk and ice cream business we started with in 1923. Dollar sales of these original products have remained relatively static over the past ten years and, in 1969 accounted for approximately 25% of our sales."[15] The company moved to Glenview, Illinois in 1972;[9] four years later its name changed to Kraft as part of a reorganization, emphasizing its trademark.[9]
Dart merger[edit]
In 1980 Kraft merged with Dart Industries, manufacturers of Duracell batteries, Tupperware plastic containers, West Bend home appliances, Wilsonart plastics and Thatcher glass, to form Dart and Kraft.[9] During the decade the company offered mixed results to its shareholders, as new acquisitions in the food business (such as Churny cheese, Lender's Bagels, Frusen Gladje ice cream and Celestial Seasonings tea) slightly offset its lagging nonfood business (Tupperware and KitchenAid). Dart and Kraft spun off its nonfood business (except Duracell) into a new entity (Premark International) and changed its name back to Kraft. Premark was bought by Illinois Tool Works in 1999. In 1988 Kraft sold Duracell to private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, which included it in a 1989 initial public offering.[9]
Philip Morris acquisition and merger with General Foods[edit]

At the end of 1988, Philip Morris purchased Kraft for $12.9 billion. The following year Kraft merged with Philip Morris's General Foods unit (manufacturers of Oscar Mayer meats, Maxwell House coffee, Jell-O gelatin, Budget Gourmet frozen dinners, Entenmann's baked goods, Kool-Aid, Crystal Light, and Tang powdered beverage mixes, Post Cereals, Shake 'n Bake flavored coatings, and other packaged foods) as Kraft General Foods. Product development slowed after the merger, due to the company's size.[9]
In 1990, the company acquired Jacobs Suchard (a large European coffee and confectionery company) and Freia Marabou (a Scandinavian confectionery maker) to expand overseas. Three years later it acquired RJR Nabisco's cold-cereal business (primarily Shredded Wheat and Shreddies cereals), selling the Breyers ice-cream division to Unilever and the Birds Eye unit to Dean Foods. In 1994 the company sold its frozen-dinner unit to Heinz, and the following year it sold its food-service unit.[9]
In 1995, the company changed its name to Kraft Foods and sold its bakery division (except Lender's Bagels, which was sold to CPC International the following year), its candy division and its table-spreads division. Log Cabin Syrup was sold in 1997.[9]
Business moves[edit]
In 2000, Philip Morris acquired Nabisco for $18.9 billion and merged the company with Kraft Foods.[9] Four years later it sold its sugar confectionery division to the Wrigley Company, divesting Milk-Bone and some grocery brands in 2006 and Cream of Wheat, its juice drinks and Fruit2o in 2007.
Investor Nelson Peltz bought a three-percent stake at Kraft Foods, and explored revitalizing the company[17] by acquiring the Wendy's fast-food chain or selling Post cereals and Maxwell House coffee.[17] In July 2007, the company bought Groupe Danone's biscuit and cereal division (including the French biscuit brand Lefèvre-Utile) for $7.2 billion.[17][18] Although PepsiCo's planned hostile takeover of the French company two years earlier had sparked protest, Kraft's announcement was received differently (in part, because Kraft agreed not to close French factories and to keep the merged divisions' headquarters near Paris for at least three years).[17]
In February 2008 Berkshire Hathaway, run by investor Warren Buffett, announced that it had acquired an eight-percent stake in Kraft (then worth over $4 billion); Buffett's business partner, Charlie Munger, had also invested over $300 million in Kraft. According to the holding company's 2010 annual report, Berkshire Hathaway owned 5.6 percent of Kraft Foods' outstanding stock.[19] On September 22, 2008, Kraft replaced American International Group on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.[20]
In March 2011 the company introduced MiO, a sugar-free, noncaloric liquid flavoring product.[21] Although it had no artificial flavors, unlike its competitors it had artificial colors, sweeteners and preservatives.[22]
Following trade liberalization in 1999, India allowed imports of international brands and Kraft decided to expand into the country. Currently, it is represented in India by Amit Lohani owned Max Foods Inc. and has a pan-country distribution.
Cadbury purchase[edit]
On September 7, 2009 Kraft made a hostile £10.2 billion takeover bid for the British confectionery group Cadbury, makers of Dairy Milk and Bournville chocolate.[23] On November 9 the company's bid (then £9.8 billion) was rejected by Cadbury, which called it a "derisory" offer.[24] Kraft renewed the offer on December 4.[25] It had significant political and public opposition in the United Kingdom and abroad, leading to a call for the government to implement economic protectionism in large-company takeovers.[26] On January 19, 2010, Cadbury approved a revised offer from Kraft which valued the company at £11.5 billion ($19.5 billion). Some funds for the takeover were provided by the Royal Bank of Scotland, the British partially state-owned bank.[27]
The Cadbury purchase was part of the long-term strategy of Irene Rosenfeld, CEO and Kraft chairman since March 2007, who developed a three-year turnaround plan to increase Kraft Foods' profits.[28] Rosenfeld wanted to develop new markets and expand Kraft's product range when she became chairman. It was assumed that the purchase of Cadbury would help Kraft products in new markets, such as Brazil and India, because of Cadbury’s presence in those markets.[29] India is one of its most resilient markets, with 20-percent sales growth and a 30-percent increase in profits.[30] Kraft believed the Cadbury purchase was necessary because of the likelihood of a Nestle-Hershey merger, and it could generate annual savings of at least $675 million by the end of the third year.[31] Rosenfeld saw the Kraft-Cadbury merger as the "logical next step in our transformation toward a high-growth, higher-margin company" to build a "global powerhouse in snacks, confectionery, and quick meals."[32]
The Cadbury purchase gave Kraft 14.8 percent of the global candy and gum market and the company wanted to avail itself of Cadbury distribution in the developing markets of India, Brazil, and Mexico.[33] As incomes rose in those developing countries, Kraft hoped that products such as Oreos would become impulse buys for children.[33] Mars was second in the confectionery market with 14.6-percent share, followed by Nestle with 7.8 percent.[34]
At the time of the purchase the chocolate and sugar industry had been growing at a 15-percent annual pace for the previous three years and was valued at $113 billion.[35] Although its Cadbury purchase was considered odd because Kraft did not have a foothold in the confectionery market, the company noted its production of confectionery foods such as Toblerones and baked snacks such as Oreos. Cadbury also owned chewing-gum brands, such as Stride, Trident, Dentyne and Chiclets.[36] Cadbury chairman Roger Carr explained his approval of the takeover: "We believe the offer represents good value for Cadbury shareholders and are pleased with the commitment that Kraft Foods has made to our heritage, values and people throughout the world".[37]
Cadbury sales were flat after Kraft’s acquisition. Despite the Cadbury takeover's helping to boost sales by 30 percent, Kraft's net profit for the fourth quarter fell 24 percent (to $540 million) due to costs associated with integrating the UK business after the acquisition.[38] Kraft spent $1.3 billion on integration to achieve an estimated $675 million in annual savings by the end of 2012.[39] Kraft increased prices to offset rising commodity costs (for corn, sugar, and cocoa) in North America and Europe. According to Rosenfeld, "We expect it will remain weak for the foreseeable future". Taking into account integration costs, the acquisition reduced Kraft's earnings per share by about 33% immediately after the Cadbury purchase.[38]
On March 17, 2010, Kraft Foods said it was "truly sorry" for its closure of Cadbury's Somerdale Factory. Senior Kraft executive Marc Firestone made the public apology to MPs at a parliamentary select committee hearing.[40] In March 2011 Kraft closed the plant, listing the site for £50 million and outsourcing production (which the company had promised not to do) to Poland. Although former Cadbury workers demanded an apology for the plant's abrupt sale, Kraft CEO Irene Rosenfeld did not explain the company's action.[41] Kraft uses the Cadbury brand in emerging markets to expand its product range, planning to invest $150 million in South African manufacturing plants over three years in April 2011. President Sanjay Khosla said, "South Africa is a priority market for us, where we focus on power brands like Cadbury chocolate".[42]
Sale of frozen-pizza division[edit]
On March 1, 2010, Nestlé purchased Kraft's North American frozen-pizza division for $3.7 billion. Although Kraft stipulated a one- to three-year buyback option, it did not exercise the option. The sale included the DiGiorno, Tombstone, and Jack's brands in the United States; the Delissio brand in Canada, the California Pizza Kitchen license and manufacturing facilities in Medford and Little Chute, Wisconsin. In 2009 the business, with 3,400 employees, had a net revenue of $1.6 billion.[43]
Kraft Foods Group and Douwe Egberts[edit]




Former Kraft Foods logo


In August 2011 Kraft Foods announced plans to split into two publicly traded companies, one snack-food and the other grocery.[44] The company changed its name to Mondelez International, specializing in snack foods, in October 2012 and a second company (Kraft Foods Group, specializing in grocery items) was split off.[45] Kraft Foods Group later merged with Heinz to become Kraft Heinz. In 2014, the company announced a merger of its coffee business with the Dutch firm Douwe Egberts;[46] the company would be named Jacobs Douwe Egberts. The merger was confirmed on May 6, 2014 and completed on July 2, 2015.[47][48]
Attempted Hershey acquisition[edit]
On June 30, 2016, Mondelez made a $23 billion offer to buy its smaller rival, Hershey. The half-cash, half-stock deal valued Hershey stock at $107 a share. Hershey's board, however, unanimously rejected the offer.[49]
Controversies[edit]
Trans-fat litigation[edit]
In 2003, a California lawyer sued Kraft for using trans fat in Oreo cookies.[50] When Kraft Foods announced a trans-fat-free reformulation of Oreos after the lawsuit was filed, it was dropped. The company denied that the change was made in response to the lawsuit, noting that the reformulation had been planned long before the lawsuit.[51]
In 2010 two California residents, Evangeline Red and Rachel Whitt, filed a class action lawsuit against Kraft Foods for claiming that certain products are healthy when they contain trans fat. Kraft denied any wrongdoing, saying that all packaging claims are true and legal, after the plaintiffs claimed that Kraft mislabeled Vegetable Thin and Ritz crackers as "made with real vegetables".[52]
Teddy Grahams, varieties of Ritz Crackers, Honey Maid Grahams, Premium Saltines, Ginger Snaps, and Vegetable Thins contained trans fats, with Kraft presenting the products as healthy with phrases such as "wholesome choice", "sensible snacking" and "made with real vegetables". The plaintiffs argued that the claims violated the California Unfair Competition Law, Consumer Legal Remedies Act and False Advertising Law.[53][54]
The lawsuit cited scientific consensus on the health effects of trans fats, which cause coronary heart disease[55] and has been linked to type 2 diabetes[56] and some types of cancer.[54][57] According to the American Heart Association, there is "no safe level" of trans fats in the diet.[58]
Based on trans fats and other unhealthy ingredients in Kraft products, the lawsuit argued that:[54]

Health claims such as "a wholesome choice" (on Teddy Grahams) and "sensible snacking" (on several products) are false.
"No cholesterol" claims are misleading, because they imply that the snack is good for cholesterol levels when trans fats are worse for cholesterol health than dietary cholesterol.
Claims such as "made with real vegetables" or "real ginger and molasses" are misleading, because the products contain less of those ingredients than trans fats.
Although Teddy Grahams packaging claimed to be a "good source of calcium, iron, and zinc to support kids' growth and development", the claim was deceptive because its trans-fat content outweighed the minerals' benefit.
Phrases such as "whole wheat" and "graham" implied health benefits the products do not possess.
On each package, some individual claims may be true but add to the deceptive message of overall healthfulness.

Kraft denied any wrongdoing, and its response briefs emphasized that its claims were technically true. Vegetable Thins were "made with real vegetables", and the company argued that the statement could not be considered misleading. Kraft used a similar argument for claims such as "good source of calcium, iron and zinc to support kids' growth and development" and "whole wheat".
About several packaging claims, Kraft argued that the statements could not be proven true or false; for example, the word "wholesome" is subjective. Promotional statements too vague to prove or disprove (known as puffery) are not actionable under law; Kraft argued that "wholesome," "sensible", and "smart" are puffery and could not be found misleading or deceitful.[59] The class action received $11,000 of its requested $1.8 million.[60]
Political campaign[edit]
In 2012, Kraft contributed $1,950,500 to a $46 million political campaign known as "The Coalition Against The Costly Food Labeling Proposition, sponsored by Farmers and Food Producers"[61] The organization was founded to oppose Proposition 37, a California citizen's initiative mandating the labeling of foods containing genetically modified ingredients. As a result, there were calls for a boycott of Kraft products.[62]
Environmental record[edit]
For years Kraft purchased paper for its packaging from Asia Pulp & Paper, the third-largest paper producer in the world which was called a "forest criminal" for destroying "precious habitat" in Indonesia’s rain forest.[63] In 2011, when Kraft cancelled its contract with Asia Pulp & Paper, Greenpeace executive director Phil Radford commended the company for "taking rainforest conservation seriously".[64]
Wheat futures price-fixing allegation[edit]
The US Commodity and Futures Commission (CTFC) alleged that Mondelez International and its former subsidiary, Mondelez Global, bought $90 million (£61 million) of wheat futures with no intention of taking delivery. According to the CTFC, the purchase raised the price of the commodity and earned the company $5.4 million.[65]
Recalls[edit]
Main article: StarLink corn recall
In September 2000, up to $50 million worth of taco shells were recalled by Kraft from supermarkets and Taco Bell restaurants. The shells contained genetically modified corn, which was not approved for human consumption by the Food and Drug Administration; the recall was the first of a genetically modified food. The corn was supplied to a plant from which Kraft bought the shells.[66]
In April 2009, Kraft Foods recalled products containing pistachios after the discovery of salmonella at one of its Illinois manufacturers. Kraft pinpointed as the source a California pistachio grower, which initially recalled over 2,000,000 pounds (910,000 kg) of nuts before broadening the recall to much of its 2008 crop.[67][68] A Washington Post editorial credited the "aggressive food safety system at Kraft Foods" with effectively addressing the danger.[69] In September 2011, Kraft recalled over 130,000 cases of Velveeta Shells and Cheese microwaveable cups because of possible wire bristles in the cups.[70]

Mondelez International, Inc., styled Mondelēz (/ˌmoʊndəˈliːz/),[2] is an American multinational confectionery, food, and beverage company based in Illinois which employs about 107,000 people around the world. It consists of the global snack and food brands of the former Kraft Foods Inc after the October 2012 spin-off of its North American grocery operations. The Mondelez name, adopted in 2012, was suggested by Kraft Foods employees and is derived from the words “mundus” (Latin for “world”) and “delez” (a proxy for the word “delicious”).[3][4]
The company, headquartered in the Chicago suburb of Deerfield, Illinois,[5] manufactures chocolate, biscuits, gum, confectionery, and powdered beverages. Mondelez International's portfolio includes several billion-dollar brands such as Oreo, Chips Ahoy!, TUC, Belvita, Triscuit, LU, Nabisco, Club Social, Barni, and Peek Freans (cookies and crackers); Milka, Terry's, Côte d'Or, Toblerone, Cadbury, Marabou, Fry's, Lacta (chocolate), Trident, Dentyne, Chiclets, Halls, Stride (gum and cough drops) and Tang (powdered beverages).
The company has an annual revenue of about $30 billion and operates in approximately 165 countries. In 2001, it entered into a multi billion dollar partnership with Jadeja Foods Inc. which also controls a majority of Dart Industries.[6]
Mondelez Canada holds the rights to Christie Brown and Company, which consists of brands such as Mr. Christie and Dad's Cookies. Its head office is in Mississauga, Ontario, with operations in Scarborough and Montreal.

History[edit]
Origins[edit]
Mondelez International is rooted in the National Dairy Products Corporation (National Dairy), which was founded on December 10, 1923, by Thomas H. McInnerney. The company was formed to execute a rollup strategy in the fragmented United States ice cream industry, and with acquisitions it expanded into the full range of dairy products.
McInnerney operated the Hydrox Corporation, a Chicago ice-cream company. In 1923 he went to Wall Street to ask investment bankers to finance his plan to consolidate the United States ice-cream industry. McInnerney initially encountered resistance, with one banker disparaging the dairy industry. He persevered, convincing a consortium (including Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers) to finance a rollup strategy.[7] As a result, National Dairy was formed with the merger of McInnerney's Hydrox with the Rieck McJunkin Dairy Company of Pittsburgh. The company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with its initial public offering of 125,000 shares oversubscribed.[8]
National Dairy grew quickly through a large number of acquisitions; typical of a rollup strategy, acquisitions were primarily for National Dairy stock instead of cash. The company acquired more than 55 firms between 1923 and 1931, including:

Kraft[edit]

Born in Stevensville, Ontario in 1874, James L. Kraft emigrated to the United States in 1903 and began a wholesale door-to-door cheese business in Chicago. His first year of operations was "dismal", when he lost $3,000 and a horse. However, the business took hold and Kraft was joined by his four brothers to form the J. L. Kraft and Bros. Company in 1909.
In 1912, the company established a headquarters in New York City to prepare for international expansion. By 1914 thirty-one varieties of cheese were sold across the US and Kraft opened a subsidiary cheese factory in Illinois.[9] In 1915 the company developed pasteurized processed cheese, which did not require refrigeration and had a longer shelf life than conventional cheese.[9] The following year Kraft began national advertising and made its first acquisition, a Canadian cheese company.[9]
In 1924, the company changed its name to the Kraft Cheese Company and was listed on the Chicago Stock Exchange.[9] Two years later, it was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Kraft then began to consolidate the US dairy industry through acquisition, competing with National Dairy and Borden. Acquisitions included:

In 1928 Kraft acquired the Phenix Cheese Company, manufacturer of Philadelphia cream cheese, and changed its name to Kraft Phenix.[citation needed] The following year, The New York Times reported that Kraft Phenix, the Hershey Company, and Colgate were considering a merger.[10]
By 1930, Kraft Phenix controlled 40 percent of the US cheese market in the US and was the country's third-largest dairy company after National Dairy and Borden. That year the company began operating in Australia, after a merger with Fred Walker & Co.[9]
National Dairy acquisition of Kraft-Phenix[edit]
At the 1930 acquisition, National Dairy had sales of $315 million, compared with $85 million for Kraft Phenix. National Dairy management ran the company. After the acquisition, the company was known as National Dairy and its management ran the company until 1969, when it was renamed Kraftco.[11]
Although the company's sales were historically dairy products, its product lines began to diversify from dairy products to caramel candies, macaroni-and-cheese dinners and margarine. During the 1950s, it began to move away from low-value-added-commodity dairy products such as fluid milk.[12]
In 1933, National Dairy began advertising on radio. Two years later Sealtest ice cream was introduced as a national brand, replacing the company's regional brands.[9]
During World War II, the company sent Britain four million pounds of cheese weekly.[9] Around this time, Thomas McInnerney and James L. Kraft died; in the late 1950s National Dairy further diversified, acquiring Metro Glass in 1956.[9]
In 1947 the company sponsored an hour-long drama-anthology series, Kraft Television Theatre. The product advertised on the program, MacLaren’s Imperial Cheese, was selected because " ... [it had] not only had no advertising appropriation whatsoever, but had not even been distributed for several years". According to internal documents of J. Walter Thompson (the advertising firm which conceived the marketing test), "Although there was no other advertising support for it whatsoever, still grocery stores could not keep up with the demand."[13]
During the 1960s Kraft introduced fruit jellies, fruit preserves, marshmallows, barbecue sauce and Kraft Singles, individually wrapped cheese slices.[9] During that decade the company expanded, acquiring Dominion Dairies of Canada in 1961 in its first effort to expand into fluid milk and ice cream outside the United States.[14]
National Dairy becomes Kraft[edit]
In 1969, National Dairy changed its name to Kraftco Corporation: "Expansion and innovation have taken us far afield from the regional milk and ice cream business we started with in 1923. Dollar sales of these original products have remained relatively static over the past ten years and, in 1969 accounted for approximately 25% of our sales."[15] The company moved to Glenview, Illinois in 1972;[9] four years later its name changed to Kraft as part of a reorganization, emphasizing its trademark.[9]
Dart merger[edit]
In 1980 Kraft merged with Dart Industries, manufacturers of Duracell batteries, Tupperware plastic containers, West Bend home appliances, Wilsonart plastics and Thatcher glass, to form Dart and Kraft.[9] During the decade the company offered mixed results to its shareholders, as new acquisitions in the food business (such as Churny cheese, Lender's Bagels, Frusen Gladje ice cream and Celestial Seasonings tea) slightly offset its lagging nonfood business (Tupperware and KitchenAid). Dart and Kraft spun off its nonfood business (except Duracell) into a new entity (Premark International) and changed its name back to Kraft. Premark was bought by Illinois Tool Works in 1999. In 1988 Kraft sold Duracell to private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, which included it in a 1989 initial public offering.[9]
Philip Morris acquisition and merger with General Foods[edit]

At the end of 1988, Philip Morris purchased Kraft for $12.9 billion. The following year Kraft merged with Philip Morris's General Foods unit (manufacturers of Oscar Mayer meats, Maxwell House coffee, Jell-O gelatin, Budget Gourmet frozen dinners, Entenmann's baked goods, Kool-Aid, Crystal Light, and Tang powdered beverage mixes, Post Cereals, Shake 'n Bake flavored coatings, and other packaged foods) as Kraft General Foods. Product development slowed after the merger, due to the company's size.[9]
In 1990, the company acquired Jacobs Suchard (a large European coffee and confectionery company) and Freia Marabou (a Scandinavian confectionery maker) to expand overseas. Three years later it acquired RJR Nabisco's cold-cereal business (primarily Shredded Wheat and Shreddies cereals), selling the Breyers ice-cream division to Unilever and the Birds Eye unit to Dean Foods. In 1994 the company sold its frozen-dinner unit to Heinz, and the following year it sold its food-service unit.[9]
In 1995, the company changed its name to Kraft Foods and sold its bakery division (except Lender's Bagels, which was sold to CPC International the following year), its candy division and its table-spreads division. Log Cabin Syrup was sold in 1997.[9]
Business moves[edit]
In 2000, Philip Morris acquired Nabisco for $18.9 billion and merged the company with Kraft Foods.[9] Four years later it sold its sugar confectionery division to the Wrigley Company, divesting Milk-Bone and some grocery brands in 2006 and Cream of Wheat, its juice drinks and Fruit2o in 2007.
Investor Nelson Peltz bought a three-percent stake at Kraft Foods, and explored revitalizing the company[17] by acquiring the Wendy's fast-food chain or selling Post cereals and Maxwell House coffee.[17] In July 2007, the company bought Groupe Danone's biscuit and cereal division (including the French biscuit brand Lefèvre-Utile) for $7.2 billion.[17][18] Although PepsiCo's planned hostile takeover of the French company two years earlier had sparked protest, Kraft's announcement was received differently (in part, because Kraft agreed not to close French factories and to keep the merged divisions' headquarters near Paris for at least three years).[17]
In February 2008 Berkshire Hathaway, run by investor Warren Buffett, announced that it had acquired an eight-percent stake in Kraft (then worth over $4 billion); Buffett's business partner, Charlie Munger, had also invested over $300 million in Kraft. According to the holding company's 2010 annual report, Berkshire Hathaway owned 5.6 percent of Kraft Foods' outstanding stock.[19] On September 22, 2008, Kraft replaced American International Group on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.[20]
In March 2011 the company introduced MiO, a sugar-free, noncaloric liquid flavoring product.[21] Although it had no artificial flavors, unlike its competitors it had artificial colors, sweeteners and preservatives.[22]
Following trade liberalization in 1999, India allowed imports of international brands and Kraft decided to expand into the country. Currently, it is represented in India by Amit Lohani owned Max Foods Inc. and has a pan-country distribution.
Cadbury purchase[edit]
On September 7, 2009 Kraft made a hostile £10.2 billion takeover bid for the British confectionery group Cadbury, makers of Dairy Milk and Bournville chocolate.[23] On November 9 the company's bid (then £9.8 billion) was rejected by Cadbury, which called it a "derisory" offer.[24] Kraft renewed the offer on December 4.[25] It had significant political and public opposition in the United Kingdom and abroad, leading to a call for the government to implement economic protectionism in large-company takeovers.[26] On January 19, 2010, Cadbury approved a revised offer from Kraft which valued the company at £11.5 billion ($19.5 billion). Some funds for the takeover were provided by the Royal Bank of Scotland, the British partially state-owned bank.[27]
The Cadbury purchase was part of the long-term strategy of Irene Rosenfeld, CEO and Kraft chairman since March 2007, who developed a three-year turnaround plan to increase Kraft Foods' profits.[28] Rosenfeld wanted to develop new markets and expand Kraft's product range when she became chairman. It was assumed that the purchase of Cadbury would help Kraft products in new markets, such as Brazil and India, because of Cadbury’s presence in those markets.[29] India is one of its most resilient markets, with 20-percent sales growth and a 30-percent increase in profits.[30] Kraft believed the Cadbury purchase was necessary because of the likelihood of a Nestle-Hershey merger, and it could generate annual savings of at least $675 million by the end of the third year.[31] Rosenfeld saw the Kraft-Cadbury merger as the "logical next step in our transformation toward a high-growth, higher-margin company" to build a "global powerhouse in snacks, confectionery, and quick meals."[32]
The Cadbury purchase gave Kraft 14.8 percent of the global candy and gum market and the company wanted to avail itself of Cadbury distribution in the developing markets of India, Brazil, and Mexico.[33] As incomes rose in those developing countries, Kraft hoped that products such as Oreos would become impulse buys for children.[33] Mars was second in the confectionery market with 14.6-percent share, followed by Nestle with 7.8 percent.[34]
At the time of the purchase the chocolate and sugar industry had been growing at a 15-percent annual pace for the previous three years and was valued at $113 billion.[35] Although its Cadbury purchase was considered odd because Kraft did not have a foothold in the confectionery market, the company noted its production of confectionery foods such as Toblerones and baked snacks such as Oreos. Cadbury also owned chewing-gum brands, such as Stride, Trident, Dentyne and Chiclets.[36] Cadbury chairman Roger Carr explained his approval of the takeover: "We believe the offer represents good value for Cadbury shareholders and are pleased with the commitment that Kraft Foods has made to our heritage, values and people throughout the world".[37]
Cadbury sales were flat after Kraft’s acquisition. Despite the Cadbury takeover's helping to boost sales by 30 percent, Kraft's net profit for the fourth quarter fell 24 percent (to $540 million) due to costs associated with integrating the UK business after the acquisition.[38] Kraft spent $1.3 billion on integration to achieve an estimated $675 million in annual savings by the end of 2012.[39] Kraft increased prices to offset rising commodity costs (for corn, sugar, and cocoa) in North America and Europe. According to Rosenfeld, "We expect it will remain weak for the foreseeable future". Taking into account integration costs, the acquisition reduced Kraft's earnings per share by about 33% immediately after the Cadbury purchase.[38]
On March 17, 2010, Kraft Foods said it was "truly sorry" for its closure of Cadbury's Somerdale Factory. Senior Kraft executive Marc Firestone made the public apology to MPs at a parliamentary select committee hearing.[40] In March 2011 Kraft closed the plant, listing the site for £50 million and outsourcing production (which the company had promised not to do) to Poland. Although former Cadbury workers demanded an apology for the plant's abrupt sale, Kraft CEO Irene Rosenfeld did not explain the company's action.[41] Kraft uses the Cadbury brand in emerging markets to expand its product range, planning to invest $150 million in South African manufacturing plants over three years in April 2011. President Sanjay Khosla said, "South Africa is a priority market for us, where we focus on power brands like Cadbury chocolate".[42]
Sale of frozen-pizza division[edit]
On March 1, 2010, Nestlé purchased Kraft's North American frozen-pizza division for $3.7 billion. Although Kraft stipulated a one- to three-year buyback option, it did not exercise the option. The sale included the DiGiorno, Tombstone, and Jack's brands in the United States; the Delissio brand in Canada, the California Pizza Kitchen license and manufacturing facilities in Medford and Little Chute, Wisconsin. In 2009 the business, with 3,400 employees, had a net revenue of $1.6 billion.[43]
Kraft Foods Group and Douwe Egberts[edit]




Former Kraft Foods logo


In August 2011 Kraft Foods announced plans to split into two publicly traded companies, one snack-food and the other grocery.[44] The company changed its name to Mondelez International, specializing in snack foods, in October 2012 and a second company (Kraft Foods Group, specializing in grocery items) was split off.[45] Kraft Foods Group later merged with Heinz to become Kraft Heinz. In 2014, the company announced a merger of its coffee business with the Dutch firm Douwe Egberts;[46] the company would be named Jacobs Douwe Egberts. The merger was confirmed on May 6, 2014 and completed on July 2, 2015.[47][48]
Attempted Hershey acquisition[edit]
On June 30, 2016, Mondelez made a $23 billion offer to buy its smaller rival, Hershey. The half-cash, half-stock deal valued Hershey stock at $107 a share. Hershey's board, however, unanimously rejected the offer.[49]
Controversies[edit]
Trans-fat litigation[edit]
In 2003, a California lawyer sued Kraft for using trans fat in Oreo cookies.[50] When Kraft Foods announced a trans-fat-free reformulation of Oreos after the lawsuit was filed, it was dropped. The company denied that the change was made in response to the lawsuit, noting that the reformulation had been planned long before the lawsuit.[51]
In 2010 two California residents, Evangeline Red and Rachel Whitt, filed a class action lawsuit against Kraft Foods for claiming that certain products are healthy when they contain trans fat. Kraft denied any wrongdoing, saying that all packaging claims are true and legal, after the plaintiffs claimed that Kraft mislabeled Vegetable Thin and Ritz crackers as "made with real vegetables".[52]
Teddy Grahams, varieties of Ritz Crackers, Honey Maid Grahams, Premium Saltines, Ginger Snaps, and Vegetable Thins contained trans fats, with Kraft presenting the products as healthy with phrases such as "wholesome choice", "sensible snacking" and "made with real vegetables". The plaintiffs argued that the claims violated the California Unfair Competition Law, Consumer Legal Remedies Act and False Advertising Law.[53][54]
The lawsuit cited scientific consensus on the health effects of trans fats, which cause coronary heart disease[55] and has been linked to type 2 diabetes[56] and some types of cancer.[54][57] According to the American Heart Association, there is "no safe level" of trans fats in the diet.[58]
Based on trans fats and other unhealthy ingredients in Kraft products, the lawsuit argued that:[54]

Health claims such as "a wholesome choice" (on Teddy Grahams) and "sensible snacking" (on several products) are false.
"No cholesterol" claims are misleading, because they imply that the snack is good for cholesterol levels when trans fats are worse for cholesterol health than dietary cholesterol.
Claims such as "made with real vegetables" or "real ginger and molasses" are misleading, because the products contain less of those ingredients than trans fats.
Although Teddy Grahams packaging claimed to be a "good source of calcium, iron, and zinc to support kids' growth and development", the claim was deceptive because its trans-fat content outweighed the minerals' benefit.
Phrases such as "whole wheat" and "graham" implied health benefits the products do not possess.
On each package, some individual claims may be true but add to the deceptive message of overall healthfulness.

Kraft denied any wrongdoing, and its response briefs emphasized that its claims were technically true. Vegetable Thins were "made with real vegetables", and the company argued that the statement could not be considered misleading. Kraft used a similar argument for claims such as "good source of calcium, iron and zinc to support kids' growth and development" and "whole wheat".
About several packaging claims, Kraft argued that the statements could not be proven true or false; for example, the word "wholesome" is subjective. Promotional statements too vague to prove or disprove (known as puffery) are not actionable under law; Kraft argued that "wholesome," "sensible", and "smart" are puffery and could not be found misleading or deceitful.[59] The class action received $11,000 of its requested $1.8 million.[60]
Political campaign[edit]
In 2012, Kraft contributed $1,950,500 to a $46 million political campaign known as "The Coalition Against The Costly Food Labeling Proposition, sponsored by Farmers and Food Producers"[61] The organization was founded to oppose Proposition 37, a California citizen's initiative mandating the labeling of foods containing genetically modified ingredients. As a result, there were calls for a boycott of Kraft products.[62]
Environmental record[edit]
For years Kraft purchased paper for its packaging from Asia Pulp & Paper, the third-largest paper producer in the world which was called a "forest criminal" for destroying "precious habitat" in Indonesia’s rain forest.[63] In 2011, when Kraft cancelled its contract with Asia Pulp & Paper, Greenpeace executive director Phil Radford commended the company for "taking rainforest conservation seriously".[64]
Wheat futures price-fixing allegation[edit]
The US Commodity and Futures Commission (CTFC) alleged that Mondelez International and its former subsidiary, Mondelez Global, bought $90 million (£61 million) of wheat futures with no intention of taking delivery. According to the CTFC, the purchase raised the price of the commodity and earned the company $5.4 million.[65]
Recalls[edit]
Main article: StarLink corn recall
In September 2000, up to $50 million worth of taco shells were recalled by Kraft from supermarkets and Taco Bell restaurants. The shells contained genetically modified corn, which was not approved for human consumption by the Food and Drug Administration; the recall was the first of a genetically modified food. The corn was supplied to a plant from which Kraft bought the shells.[66]
In April 2009, Kraft Foods recalled products containing pistachios after the discovery of salmonella at one of its Illinois manufacturers. Kraft pinpointed as the source a California pistachio grower, which initially recalled over 2,000,000 pounds (910,000 kg) of nuts before broadening the recall to much of its 2008 crop.[67][68] A Washington Post editorial credited the "aggressive food safety system at Kraft Foods" with effectively addressing the danger.[69] In September 2011, Kraft recalled over 130,000 cases of Velveeta Shells and Cheese microwaveable cups because of possible wire bristles in the cups.[70]

Mondelez says cyberattack will dent second-quarter revenue
Mondelez International Inc.  shares declined in the extended session Thursday after the snack food company said a cyberattack in late June will impact its revenue for the second quarter. Mondelez shares declined 1.4% to $42.48 after hours. "Our preliminary estimate of the revenue impact of this event is a negative 300 basis points on our second quarter growth rate," Mondelez said in a statement. A basis point is equal to one-hundredth of a percentage point. "Given the timing of this significant global attack, despite our best efforts, we experienced disruption in our ability to ship and invoice during the last four days of our second quarter," Mondelez said. Analysts surveyed by FactSet expect second-quarter revenue of $6.17 billion, a 2.1% decline from the year ago period. Mondelez said it still foresees full-year organic revenue growth of "at least" 1%.

Mondelez says cyberattack will dent second-quarter revenue
Mondelez International Inc.  shares declined in the extended session Thursday after the snack food company said a cyberattack in late June will impact its revenue for the second quarter. Mondelez shares declined 1.4% to $42.48 after hours. "Our preliminary estimate of the revenue impact of this event is a negative 300 basis points on our second quarter growth rate," Mondelez said in a statement. A basis point is equal to one-hundredth of a percentage point. "Given the timing of this significant global attack, despite our best efforts, we experienced disruption in our ability to ship and invoice during the last four days of our second quarter," Mondelez said. Analysts surveyed by FactSet expect second-quarter revenue of $6.17 billion, a 2.1% decline from the year ago period. Mondelez said it still foresees full-year organic revenue growth of "at least" 1%.

For Oreo, Cadbury and Ritz, a New Parent Company

Shareholders of Kraft Foods on Wednesday overwhelmingly approved Mondelez International as the name of the $35 billion snack foods company that will be created when the company finally splits sometime later this year. Coined by two of Kraft’s employees, the name is meant to evoke the global ambitions of the new snack business, which will take on the titan Frito-Lay, and pique the palate as well with its nod to the words for “world” and “delicious” in a variety of romance languages. Kraft announced plans in August to split itself into two companies. One will be a North American grocery business made up of brands like Velveeta, Kraft Macaroni & Cheese and Oscar Mayer that earn a lot of cash and profit despite low growth. The other will be the bigger, sexier snack foods company with more than 80 percent of its business in fast-growing markets abroad.

 Kraft decided the grocery business would retain the Kraft name, and rather than hiring an ad agency or marketing firm to come up with a new name for the snack foods company, it held a contest among its employees that attracted some 1,000 entries. “Curiously, two different employees came up with essentially the same suggestion for the name, though with a slightly different spelling,” said Michael Mitchell, a spokesman for Kraft.

 Mr. Mitchell said the employees, both men, had arrived at the notion of a name connoting “delicious world.” Johannes Schmidt, an information systems employee in the company’s Vienna office, had looked for something with the cadences of a waltz, he said. Marc Firestone, the general counsel based in the company’s headquarters in Northfield, Ill., had come to the name on a drive from Brussels to Frankfurt on business.

 There was no prize “other than our undying love and the honor of having named the new company,” Mr. Mitchell said. Consumers will see the name only in small print — Mondelez will allow its famous brand names, which will include Oreo, Cadbury, Milka, Trident gum, Tang and Ritz, to do their work. “It’s not intended to be a consumer brand,” Mr. Mitchell said.

Marc E. Babej, a partner at Reason, a marketing and strategic innovation firm, said that was a good thing. “Its saving grace is that it’s just a name for a corporate entity,” Mr. Babej said.He said as the name for a global company, Mondelez would have little meaning to consumers outside countries like Italy, Spain, France and Portugal. “I doubt that its connotations are going to be so obvious to English, German, Japanese or Chinese speakers,” he said.Allen P. Adamson, managing director at Landor Associates, a brand design firm, avoided expressing an opinion about the name. Instead, he applauded Kraft for having managed to find a name in relatively short order that apparently overcame all the potential trademark and legal hurdles such things face these days.“Their lawyers will have immediately eliminated 97 percent of the names they came up with because they were already taken,” Mr. Adamson said. “Find a name is no longer a creative exercise, which is why most names today sound like they were created by a computer program. This one, in fact, almost sounds real.”

Mondelez International to Invest $130 Million in U.S. Biscuit Manufacturing Network
- Investment Focused on New Manufacturing Technology and Capabilities to Drive Further Modernization and Competitiveness- Philadelphia Bakery to Close in 2015 as Company Consolidates U.S. Biscuit Manufacturing on the East Coast


EAST HANOVER, N.J., Feb. 6, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Mondelez International is taking another important step in creating a best-in-class global supply chain today by announcing plans to invest more than $130 million in new biscuit manufacturing technology and capabilities in its current U.S. network.  The investment will focus on bakeries in Fair Lawn, N.J., and Richmond, Va., supporting priority cookie and cracker brands and product platforms.  To enable this investment, the company will consolidate its current U.S. biscuit manufacturing footprint on the East Coast, resulting in the closure of 
its Philadelphia bakery by early 2015.  
(Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20121003/MM86695LOGO) 
"This investment in our North American biscuit supply chain offers us an exciting opportunity to further improve the overall effectiveness, efficiency and the competitiveness of our manufacturing network, with a focus on driving big bets and accelerating growth for the biscuit category," said Cindy Waggoner, Vice President, North America Integrated Supply Chain, Biscuits.  "This announcement is also bittersweet.  It's always a difficult decision to close a manufacturing facility, especially one like the Philadelphia bakery, which has been part of our organization and the community for many years."
The role of the Philadelphia bakery within the company's biscuit manufacturing network footprint has changed over time. The site currently produces a limited number of core products.  Other facilities are better positioned to support the company's future business needs.
The closure of the Philadelphia bakery will affect approximately 350 employees, who were informed of the company's decision earlier today.
"Our focus right now is on our employees in Philadelphia.  We're making this announcement almost a full year in advance of the planned closure to help provide a smooth transition.  We're committed to treating our employees fairly and working with them through this difficult time," Waggoner added. 
With this announcement, Mondelez International further demonstrates its global focus on redesigning its manufacturing network and creating an integrated supply chain organization capable of delivering a demonstrable advantage while generating savings that can be reinvested for growth.

Mondelez International, Inc., styled Mondelēz (/ˌmoʊndəˈliːz/),[2] is an American multinational confectionery, food, and beverage company based in Illinois which employs about 107,000 people around the world. It consists of the global snack and food brands of the former Kraft Foods Inc after the October 2012 spin-off of its North American grocery operations. The Mondelez name, adopted in 2012, was suggested by Kraft Foods employees and is derived from the words “mundus” (Latin for “world”) and “delez” (a proxy for the word “delicious”).[3][4]
The company, headquartered in the Chicago suburb of Deerfield, Illinois,[5] manufactures chocolate, biscuits, gum, confectionery, and powdered beverages. Mondelez International's portfolio includes several billion-dollar brands such as Oreo, Chips Ahoy!, TUC, Belvita, Triscuit, LU, Nabisco, Club Social, Barni, and Peek Freans (cookies and crackers); Milka, Terry's, Côte d'Or, Toblerone, Cadbury, Marabou, Fry's, Lacta (chocolate), Trident, Dentyne, Chiclets, Halls, Stride (gum and cough drops) and Tang (powdered beverages).
The company has an annual revenue of about $30 billion and operates in approximately 165 countries. In 2001, it entered into a multi billion dollar partnership with Jadeja Foods Inc. which also controls a majority of Dart Industries.[6]
Mondelez Canada holds the rights to Christie Brown and Company, which consists of brands such as Mr. Christie and Dad's Cookies. Its head office is in Mississauga, Ontario, with operations in Scarborough and Montreal.

History[edit]
Origins[edit]
Mondelez International is rooted in the National Dairy Products Corporation (National Dairy), which was founded on December 10, 1923, by Thomas H. McInnerney. The company was formed to execute a rollup strategy in the fragmented United States ice cream industry, and with acquisitions it expanded into the full range of dairy products.
McInnerney operated the Hydrox Corporation, a Chicago ice-cream company. In 1923 he went to Wall Street to ask investment bankers to finance his plan to consolidate the United States ice-cream industry. McInnerney initially encountered resistance, with one banker disparaging the dairy industry. He persevered, convincing a consortium (including Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers) to finance a rollup strategy.[7] As a result, National Dairy was formed with the merger of McInnerney's Hydrox with the Rieck McJunkin Dairy Company of Pittsburgh. The company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with its initial public offering of 125,000 shares oversubscribed.[8]
National Dairy grew quickly through a large number of acquisitions; typical of a rollup strategy, acquisitions were primarily for National Dairy stock instead of cash. The company acquired more than 55 firms between 1923 and 1931, including:

Kraft[edit]

Born in Stevensville, Ontario in 1874, James L. Kraft emigrated to the United States in 1903 and began a wholesale door-to-door cheese business in Chicago. His first year of operations was "dismal", when he lost $3,000 and a horse. However, the business took hold and Kraft was joined by his four brothers to form the J. L. Kraft and Bros. Company in 1909.
In 1912, the company established a headquarters in New York City to prepare for international expansion. By 1914 thirty-one varieties of cheese were sold across the US and Kraft opened a subsidiary cheese factory in Illinois.[9] In 1915 the company developed pasteurized processed cheese, which did not require refrigeration and had a longer shelf life than conventional cheese.[9] The following year Kraft began national advertising and made its first acquisition, a Canadian cheese company.[9]
In 1924, the company changed its name to the Kraft Cheese Company and was listed on the Chicago Stock Exchange.[9] Two years later, it was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Kraft then began to consolidate the US dairy industry through acquisition, competing with National Dairy and Borden. Acquisitions included:

In 1928 Kraft acquired the Phenix Cheese Company, manufacturer of Philadelphia cream cheese, and changed its name to Kraft Phenix.[citation needed] The following year, The New York Times reported that Kraft Phenix, the Hershey Company, and Colgate were considering a merger.[10]
By 1930, Kraft Phenix controlled 40 percent of the US cheese market in the US and was the country's third-largest dairy company after National Dairy and Borden. That year the company began operating in Australia, after a merger with Fred Walker & Co.[9]
National Dairy acquisition of Kraft-Phenix[edit]
At the 1930 acquisition, National Dairy had sales of $315 million, compared with $85 million for Kraft Phenix. National Dairy management ran the company. After the acquisition, the company was known as National Dairy and its management ran the company until 1969, when it was renamed Kraftco.[11]
Although the company's sales were historically dairy products, its product lines began to diversify from dairy products to caramel candies, macaroni-and-cheese dinners and margarine. During the 1950s, it began to move away from low-value-added-commodity dairy products such as fluid milk.[12]
In 1933, National Dairy began advertising on radio. Two years later Sealtest ice cream was introduced as a national brand, replacing the company's regional brands.[9]
During World War II, the company sent Britain four million pounds of cheese weekly.[9] Around this time, Thomas McInnerney and James L. Kraft died; in the late 1950s National Dairy further diversified, acquiring Metro Glass in 1956.[9]
In 1947 the company sponsored an hour-long drama-anthology series, Kraft Television Theatre. The product advertised on the program, MacLaren’s Imperial Cheese, was selected because " ... [it had] not only had no advertising appropriation whatsoever, but had not even been distributed for several years". According to internal documents of J. Walter Thompson (the advertising firm which conceived the marketing test), "Although there was no other advertising support for it whatsoever, still grocery stores could not keep up with the demand."[13]
During the 1960s Kraft introduced fruit jellies, fruit preserves, marshmallows, barbecue sauce and Kraft Singles, individually wrapped cheese slices.[9] During that decade the company expanded, acquiring Dominion Dairies of Canada in 1961 in its first effort to expand into fluid milk and ice cream outside the United States.[14]
National Dairy becomes Kraft[edit]
In 1969, National Dairy changed its name to Kraftco Corporation: "Expansion and innovation have taken us far afield from the regional milk and ice cream business we started with in 1923. Dollar sales of these original products have remained relatively static over the past ten years and, in 1969 accounted for approximately 25% of our sales."[15] The company moved to Glenview, Illinois in 1972;[9] four years later its name changed to Kraft as part of a reorganization, emphasizing its trademark.[9]
Dart merger[edit]
In 1980 Kraft merged with Dart Industries, manufacturers of Duracell batteries, Tupperware plastic containers, West Bend home appliances, Wilsonart plastics and Thatcher glass, to form Dart and Kraft.[9] During the decade the company offered mixed results to its shareholders, as new acquisitions in the food business (such as Churny cheese, Lender's Bagels, Frusen Gladje ice cream and Celestial Seasonings tea) slightly offset its lagging nonfood business (Tupperware and KitchenAid). Dart and Kraft spun off its nonfood business (except Duracell) into a new entity (Premark International) and changed its name back to Kraft. Premark was bought by Illinois Tool Works in 1999. In 1988 Kraft sold Duracell to private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, which included it in a 1989 initial public offering.[9]
Philip Morris acquisition and merger with General Foods[edit]




Kraft Foods factory in Banbury's Ruscote estate. It has been a major employer in the town since 1965.[16]


At the end of 1988, Philip Morris purchased Kraft for $12.9 billion. The following year Kraft merged with Philip Morris's General Foods unit (manufacturers of Oscar Mayer meats, Maxwell House coffee, Jell-O gelatin, Budget Gourmet frozen dinners, Entenmann's baked goods, Kool-Aid, Crystal Light, and Tang powdered beverage mixes, Post Cereals, Shake 'n Bake flavored coatings, and other packaged foods) as Kraft General Foods. Product development slowed after the merger, due to the company's size.[9]
In 1990, the company acquired Jacobs Suchard (a large European coffee and confectionery company) and Freia Marabou (a Scandinavian confectionery maker) to expand overseas. Three years later it acquired RJR Nabisco's cold-cereal business (primarily Shredded Wheat and Shreddies cereals), selling the Breyers ice-cream division to Unilever and the Birds Eye unit to Dean Foods. In 1994 the company sold its frozen-dinner unit to Heinz, and the following year it sold its food-service unit.[9]
In 1995, the company changed its name to Kraft Foods and sold its bakery division (except Lender's Bagels, which was sold to CPC International the following year), its candy division and its table-spreads division. Log Cabin Syrup was sold in 1997.[9]
Business moves[edit]
In 2000, Philip Morris acquired Nabisco for $18.9 billion and merged the company with Kraft Foods.[9] Four years later it sold its sugar confectionery division to the Wrigley Company, divesting Milk-Bone and some grocery brands in 2006 and Cream of Wheat, its juice drinks and Fruit2o in 2007.
Investor Nelson Peltz bought a three-percent stake at Kraft Foods, and explored revitalizing the company[17] by acquiring the Wendy's fast-food chain or selling Post cereals and Maxwell House coffee.[17] In July 2007, the company bought Groupe Danone's biscuit and cereal division (including the French biscuit brand Lefèvre-Utile) for $7.2 billion.[17][18] Although PepsiCo's planned hostile takeover of the French company two years earlier had sparked protest, Kraft's announcement was received differently (in part, because Kraft agreed not to close French factories and to keep the merged divisions' headquarters near Paris for at least three years).[17]
In February 2008 Berkshire Hathaway, run by investor Warren Buffett, announced that it had acquired an eight-percent stake in Kraft (then worth over $4 billion); Buffett's business partner, Charlie Munger, had also invested over $300 million in Kraft. According to the holding company's 2010 annual report, Berkshire Hathaway owned 5.6 percent of Kraft Foods' outstanding stock.[19] On September 22, 2008, Kraft replaced American International Group on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.[20]
In March 2011 the company introduced MiO, a sugar-free, noncaloric liquid flavoring product.[21] Although it had no artificial flavors, unlike its competitors it had artificial colors, sweeteners and preservatives.[22]
Following trade liberalization in 1999, India allowed imports of international brands and Kraft decided to expand into the country. Currently, it is represented in India by Amit Lohani owned Max Foods Inc. and has a pan-country distribution.
Cadbury purchase[edit]
On September 7, 2009 Kraft made a hostile £10.2 billion takeover bid for the British confectionery group Cadbury, makers of Dairy Milk and Bournville chocolate.[23] On November 9 the company's bid (then £9.8 billion) was rejected by Cadbury, which called it a "derisory" offer.[24] Kraft renewed the offer on December 4.[25] It had significant political and public opposition in the United Kingdom and abroad, leading to a call for the government to implement economic protectionism in large-company takeovers.[26] On January 19, 2010, Cadbury approved a revised offer from Kraft which valued the company at £11.5 billion ($19.5 billion). Some funds for the takeover were provided by the Royal Bank of Scotland, the British partially state-owned bank.[27]
The Cadbury purchase was part of the long-term strategy of Irene Rosenfeld, CEO and Kraft chairman since March 2007, who developed a three-year turnaround plan to increase Kraft Foods' profits.[28] Rosenfeld wanted to develop new markets and expand Kraft's product range when she became chairman. It was assumed that the purchase of Cadbury would help Kraft products in new markets, such as Brazil and India, because of Cadbury’s presence in those markets.[29] India is one of its most resilient markets, with 20-percent sales growth and a 30-percent increase in profits.[30] Kraft believed the Cadbury purchase was necessary because of the likelihood of a Nestle-Hershey merger, and it could generate annual savings of at least $675 million by the end of the third year.[31] Rosenfeld saw the Kraft-Cadbury merger as the "logical next step in our transformation toward a high-growth, higher-margin company" to build a "global powerhouse in snacks, confectionery, and quick meals."[32]
The Cadbury purchase gave Kraft 14.8 percent of the global candy and gum market and the company wanted to avail itself of Cadbury distribution in the developing markets of India, Brazil, and Mexico.[33] As incomes rose in those developing countries, Kraft hoped that products such as Oreos would become impulse buys for children.[33] Mars was second in the confectionery market with 14.6-percent share, followed by Nestle with 7.8 percent.[34]
At the time of the purchase the chocolate and sugar industry had been growing at a 15-percent annual pace for the previous three years and was valued at $113 billion.[35] Although its Cadbury purchase was considered odd because Kraft did not have a foothold in the confectionery market, the company noted its production of confectionery foods such as Toblerones and baked snacks such as Oreos. Cadbury also owned chewing-gum brands, such as Stride, Trident, Dentyne and Chiclets.[36] Cadbury chairman Roger Carr explained his approval of the takeover: "We believe the offer represents good value for Cadbury shareholders and are pleased with the commitment that Kraft Foods has made to our heritage, values and people throughout the world".[37]
Cadbury sales were flat after Kraft’s acquisition. Despite the Cadbury takeover's helping to boost sales by 30 percent, Kraft's net profit for the fourth quarter fell 24 percent (to $540 million) due to costs associated with integrating the UK business after the acquisition.[38] Kraft spent $1.3 billion on integration to achieve an estimated $675 million in annual savings by the end of 2012.[39] Kraft increased prices to offset rising commodity costs (for corn, sugar, and cocoa) in North America and Europe. According to Rosenfeld, "We expect it will remain weak for the foreseeable future". Taking into account integration costs, the acquisition reduced Kraft's earnings per share by about 33% immediately after the Cadbury purchase.[38]
On March 17, 2010, Kraft Foods said it was "truly sorry" for its closure of Cadbury's Somerdale Factory. Senior Kraft executive Marc Firestone made the public apology to MPs at a parliamentary select committee hearing.[40] In March 2011 Kraft closed the plant, listing the site for £50 million and outsourcing production (which the company had promised not to do) to Poland. Although former Cadbury workers demanded an apology for the plant's abrupt sale, Kraft CEO Irene Rosenfeld did not explain the company's action.[41] Kraft uses the Cadbury brand in emerging markets to expand its product range, planning to invest $150 million in South African manufacturing plants over three years in April 2011. President Sanjay Khosla said, "South Africa is a priority market for us, where we focus on power brands like Cadbury chocolate".[42]
Sale of frozen-pizza division[edit]
On March 1, 2010, Nestlé purchased Kraft's North American frozen-pizza division for $3.7 billion. Although Kraft stipulated a one- to three-year buyback option, it did not exercise the option. The sale included the DiGiorno, Tombstone, and Jack's brands in the United States; the Delissio brand in Canada, the California Pizza Kitchen license and manufacturing facilities in Medford and Little Chute, Wisconsin. In 2009 the business, with 3,400 employees, had a net revenue of $1.6 billion.[43]
Kraft Foods Group and Douwe Egberts[edit]

In August 2011 Kraft Foods announced plans to split into two publicly traded companies, one snack-food and the other grocery.[44] The company changed its name to Mondelez International, specializing in snack foods, in October 2012 and a second company (Kraft Foods Group, specializing in grocery items) was split off.[45] Kraft Foods Group later merged with Heinz to become Kraft Heinz. In 2014, the company announced a merger of its coffee business with the Dutch firm Douwe Egberts;[46] the company would be named Jacobs Douwe Egberts. The merger was confirmed on May 6, 2014 and completed on July 2, 2015.[47][48]
Attempted Hershey acquisition[edit]
On June 30, 2016, Mondelez made a $23 billion offer to buy its smaller rival, Hershey. The half-cash, half-stock deal valued Hershey stock at $107 a share. Hershey's board, however, unanimously rejected the offer.[49]
Controversies[edit]
Trans-fat litigation[edit]
In 2003, a California lawyer sued Kraft for using trans fat in Oreo cookies.[50] When Kraft Foods announced a trans-fat-free reformulation of Oreos after the lawsuit was filed, it was dropped. The company denied that the change was made in response to the lawsuit, noting that the reformulation had been planned long before the lawsuit.[51]
In 2010 two California residents, Evangeline Red and Rachel Whitt, filed a class action lawsuit against Kraft Foods for claiming that certain products are healthy when they contain trans fat. Kraft denied any wrongdoing, saying that all packaging claims are true and legal, after the plaintiffs claimed that Kraft mislabeled Vegetable Thin and Ritz crackers as "made with real vegetables".[52]
Teddy Grahams, varieties of Ritz Crackers, Honey Maid Grahams, Premium Saltines, Ginger Snaps, and Vegetable Thins contained trans fats, with Kraft presenting the products as healthy with phrases such as "wholesome choice", "sensible snacking" and "made with real vegetables". The plaintiffs argued that the claims violated the California Unfair Competition Law, Consumer Legal Remedies Act and False Advertising Law.[53][54]
The lawsuit cited scientific consensus on the health effects of trans fats, which cause coronary heart disease[55] and has been linked to type 2 diabetes[56] and some types of cancer.[54][57] According to the American Heart Association, there is "no safe level" of trans fats in the diet.[58]
Based on trans fats and other unhealthy ingredients in Kraft products, the lawsuit argued that:[54]

Health claims such as "a wholesome choice" (on Teddy Grahams) and "sensible snacking" (on several products) are false.
"No cholesterol" claims are misleading, because they imply that the snack is good for cholesterol levels when trans fats are worse for cholesterol health than dietary cholesterol.
Claims such as "made with real vegetables" or "real ginger and molasses" are misleading, because the products contain less of those ingredients than trans fats.
Although Teddy Grahams packaging claimed to be a "good source of calcium, iron, and zinc to support kids' growth and development", the claim was deceptive because its trans-fat content outweighed the minerals' benefit.
Phrases such as "whole wheat" and "graham" implied health benefits the products do not possess.
On each package, some individual claims may be true but add to the deceptive message of overall healthfulness.

Kraft denied any wrongdoing, and its response briefs emphasized that its claims were technically true. Vegetable Thins were "made with real vegetables", and the company argued that the statement could not be considered misleading. Kraft used a similar argument for claims such as "good source of calcium, iron and zinc to support kids' growth and development" and "whole wheat".
About several packaging claims, Kraft argued that the statements could not be proven true or false; for example, the word "wholesome" is subjective. Promotional statements too vague to prove or disprove (known as puffery) are not actionable under law; Kraft argued that "wholesome," "sensible", and "smart" are puffery and could not be found misleading or deceitful.[59] The class action received $11,000 of its requested $1.8 million.[60]
Political campaign[edit]
In 2012, Kraft contributed $1,950,500 to a $46 million political campaign known as "The Coalition Against The Costly Food Labeling Proposition, sponsored by Farmers and Food Producers"[61] The organization was founded to oppose Proposition 37, a California citizen's initiative mandating the labeling of foods containing genetically modified ingredients. As a result, there were calls for a boycott of Kraft products.[62]
Environmental record[edit]
For years Kraft purchased paper for its packaging from Asia Pulp & Paper, the third-largest paper producer in the world which was called a "forest criminal" for destroying "precious habitat" in Indonesia’s rain forest.[63] In 2011, when Kraft cancelled its contract with Asia Pulp & Paper, Greenpeace executive director Phil Radford commended the company for "taking rainforest conservation seriously".[64]
Wheat futures price-fixing allegation[edit]
The US Commodity and Futures Commission (CTFC) alleged that Mondelez International and its former subsidiary, Mondelez Global, bought $90 million (£61 million) of wheat futures with no intention of taking delivery. According to the CTFC, the purchase raised the price of the commodity and earned the company $5.4 million.[65]
Recalls[edit]
Main article: StarLink corn recall
In September 2000, up to $50 million worth of taco shells were recalled by Kraft from supermarkets and Taco Bell restaurants. The shells contained genetically modified corn, which was not approved for human consumption by the Food and Drug Administration; the recall was the first of a genetically modified food. The corn was supplied to a plant from which Kraft bought the shells.[66]
In April 2009, Kraft Foods recalled products containing pistachios after the discovery of salmonella at one of its Illinois manufacturers. Kraft pinpointed as the source a California pistachio grower, which initially recalled over 2,000,000 pounds (910,000 kg) of nuts before broadening the recall to much of its 2008 crop.[67][68] A Washington Post editorial credited the "aggressive food safety system at Kraft Foods" with effectively addressing the danger.[69] In September 2011, Kraft recalled over 130,000 cases of Velveeta Shells and Cheese microwaveable cups because of possible wire bristles in the cups.[70]

Mondelez International, Inc., styled Mondelēz (/ˌmoʊndəˈliːz/),[2] is an American multinational confectionery, food, and beverage company based in Illinois which employs about 107,000 people around the world. It consists of the global snack and food brands of the former Kraft Foods Inc after the October 2012 spin-off of its North American grocery operations. The Mondelez name, adopted in 2012, was suggested by Kraft Foods employees and is derived from the words “mundus” (Latin for “world”) and “delez” (a proxy for the word “delicious”).[3][4]
The company, headquartered in the Chicago suburb of Deerfield, Illinois,[5] manufactures chocolate, biscuits, gum, confectionery, and powdered beverages. Mondelez International's portfolio includes several billion-dollar brands such as Oreo, Chips Ahoy!, TUC, Belvita, Triscuit, LU, Nabisco, Club Social, Barni, and Peek Freans (cookies and crackers); Milka, Terry's, Côte d'Or, Toblerone, Cadbury, Marabou, Fry's, Lacta (chocolate), Trident, Dentyne, Chiclets, Halls, Stride (gum and cough drops) and Tang (powdered beverages).
The company has an annual revenue of about $30 billion and operates in approximately 165 countries. In 2001, it entered into a multi billion dollar partnership with Jadeja Foods Inc. which also controls a majority of Dart Industries.[6]
Mondelez Canada holds the rights to Christie Brown and Company, which consists of brands such as Mr. Christie and Dad's Cookies. Its head office is in Mississauga, Ontario, with operations in Scarborough and Montreal.

History[edit]
Origins[edit]
Mondelez International is rooted in the National Dairy Products Corporation (National Dairy), which was founded on December 10, 1923, by Thomas H. McInnerney. The company was formed to execute a rollup strategy in the fragmented United States ice cream industry, and with acquisitions it expanded into the full range of dairy products.
McInnerney operated the Hydrox Corporation, a Chicago ice-cream company. In 1923 he went to Wall Street to ask investment bankers to finance his plan to consolidate the United States ice-cream industry. McInnerney initially encountered resistance, with one banker disparaging the dairy industry. He persevered, convincing a consortium (including Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers) to finance a rollup strategy.[7] As a result, National Dairy was formed with the merger of McInnerney's Hydrox with the Rieck McJunkin Dairy Company of Pittsburgh. The company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with its initial public offering of 125,000 shares oversubscribed.[8]
National Dairy grew quickly through a large number of acquisitions; typical of a rollup strategy, acquisitions were primarily for National Dairy stock instead of cash. The company acquired more than 55 firms between 1923 and 1931, including:

Kraft[edit]

Born in Stevensville, Ontario in 1874, James L. Kraft emigrated to the United States in 1903 and began a wholesale door-to-door cheese business in Chicago. His first year of operations was "dismal", when he lost $3,000 and a horse. However, the business took hold and Kraft was joined by his four brothers to form the J. L. Kraft and Bros. Company in 1909.
In 1912, the company established a headquarters in New York City to prepare for international expansion. By 1914 thirty-one varieties of cheese were sold across the US and Kraft opened a subsidiary cheese factory in Illinois.[9] In 1915 the company developed pasteurized processed cheese, which did not require refrigeration and had a longer shelf life than conventional cheese.[9] The following year Kraft began national advertising and made its first acquisition, a Canadian cheese company.[9]
In 1924, the company changed its name to the Kraft Cheese Company and was listed on the Chicago Stock Exchange.[9] Two years later, it was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Kraft then began to consolidate the US dairy industry through acquisition, competing with National Dairy and Borden. Acquisitions included:

In 1928 Kraft acquired the Phenix Cheese Company, manufacturer of Philadelphia cream cheese, and changed its name to Kraft Phenix.[citation needed] The following year, The New York Times reported that Kraft Phenix, the Hershey Company, and Colgate were considering a merger.[10]
By 1930, Kraft Phenix controlled 40 percent of the US cheese market in the US and was the country's third-largest dairy company after National Dairy and Borden. That year the company began operating in Australia, after a merger with Fred Walker & Co.[9]
National Dairy acquisition of Kraft-Phenix[edit]
At the 1930 acquisition, National Dairy had sales of $315 million, compared with $85 million for Kraft Phenix. National Dairy management ran the company. After the acquisition, the company was known as National Dairy and its management ran the company until 1969, when it was renamed Kraftco.[11]
Although the company's sales were historically dairy products, its product lines began to diversify from dairy products to caramel candies, macaroni-and-cheese dinners and margarine. During the 1950s, it began to move away from low-value-added-commodity dairy products such as fluid milk.[12]
In 1933, National Dairy began advertising on radio. Two years later Sealtest ice cream was introduced as a national brand, replacing the company's regional brands.[9]
During World War II, the company sent Britain four million pounds of cheese weekly.[9] Around this time, Thomas McInnerney and James L. Kraft died; in the late 1950s National Dairy further diversified, acquiring Metro Glass in 1956.[9]
In 1947 the company sponsored an hour-long drama-anthology series, Kraft Television Theatre. The product advertised on the program, MacLaren’s Imperial Cheese, was selected because " ... [it had] not only had no advertising appropriation whatsoever, but had not even been distributed for several years". According to internal documents of J. Walter Thompson (the advertising firm which conceived the marketing test), "Although there was no other advertising support for it whatsoever, still grocery stores could not keep up with the demand."[13]
During the 1960s Kraft introduced fruit jellies, fruit preserves, marshmallows, barbecue sauce and Kraft Singles, individually wrapped cheese slices.[9] During that decade the company expanded, acquiring Dominion Dairies of Canada in 1961 in its first effort to expand into fluid milk and ice cream outside the United States.[14]
National Dairy becomes Kraft[edit]
In 1969, National Dairy changed its name to Kraftco Corporation: "Expansion and innovation have taken us far afield from the regional milk and ice cream business we started with in 1923. Dollar sales of these original products have remained relatively static over the past ten years and, in 1969 accounted for approximately 25% of our sales."[15] The company moved to Glenview, Illinois in 1972;[9] four years later its name changed to Kraft as part of a reorganization, emphasizing its trademark.[9]
Dart merger[edit]
In 1980 Kraft merged with Dart Industries, manufacturers of Duracell batteries, Tupperware plastic containers, West Bend home appliances, Wilsonart plastics and Thatcher glass, to form Dart and Kraft.[9] During the decade the company offered mixed results to its shareholders, as new acquisitions in the food business (such as Churny cheese, Lender's Bagels, Frusen Gladje ice cream and Celestial Seasonings tea) slightly offset its lagging nonfood business (Tupperware and KitchenAid). Dart and Kraft spun off its nonfood business (except Duracell) into a new entity (Premark International) and changed its name back to Kraft. Premark was bought by Illinois Tool Works in 1999. In 1988 Kraft sold Duracell to private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, which included it in a 1989 initial public offering.[9]
Philip Morris acquisition and merger with General Foods[edit]

At the end of 1988, Philip Morris purchased Kraft for $12.9 billion. The following year Kraft merged with Philip Morris's General Foods unit (manufacturers of Oscar Mayer meats, Maxwell House coffee, Jell-O gelatin, Budget Gourmet frozen dinners, Entenmann's baked goods, Kool-Aid, Crystal Light, and Tang powdered beverage mixes, Post Cereals, Shake 'n Bake flavored coatings, and other packaged foods) as Kraft General Foods. Product development slowed after the merger, due to the company's size.[9]
In 1990, the company acquired Jacobs Suchard (a large European coffee and confectionery company) and Freia Marabou (a Scandinavian confectionery maker) to expand overseas. Three years later it acquired RJR Nabisco's cold-cereal business (primarily Shredded Wheat and Shreddies cereals), selling the Breyers ice-cream division to Unilever and the Birds Eye unit to Dean Foods. In 1994 the company sold its frozen-dinner unit to Heinz, and the following year it sold its food-service unit.[9]
In 1995, the company changed its name to Kraft Foods and sold its bakery division (except Lender's Bagels, which was sold to CPC International the following year), its candy division and its table-spreads division. Log Cabin Syrup was sold in 1997.[9]
Business moves[edit]
In 2000, Philip Morris acquired Nabisco for $18.9 billion and merged the company with Kraft Foods.[9] Four years later it sold its sugar confectionery division to the Wrigley Company, divesting Milk-Bone and some grocery brands in 2006 and Cream of Wheat, its juice drinks and Fruit2o in 2007.
Investor Nelson Peltz bought a three-percent stake at Kraft Foods, and explored revitalizing the company[17] by acquiring the Wendy's fast-food chain or selling Post cereals and Maxwell House coffee.[17] In July 2007, the company bought Groupe Danone's biscuit and cereal division (including the French biscuit brand Lefèvre-Utile) for $7.2 billion.[17][18] Although PepsiCo's planned hostile takeover of the French company two years earlier had sparked protest, Kraft's announcement was received differently (in part, because Kraft agreed not to close French factories and to keep the merged divisions' headquarters near Paris for at least three years).[17]
In February 2008 Berkshire Hathaway, run by investor Warren Buffett, announced that it had acquired an eight-percent stake in Kraft (then worth over $4 billion); Buffett's business partner, Charlie Munger, had also invested over $300 million in Kraft. According to the holding company's 2010 annual report, Berkshire Hathaway owned 5.6 percent of Kraft Foods' outstanding stock.[19] On September 22, 2008, Kraft replaced American International Group on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.[20]
In March 2011 the company introduced MiO, a sugar-free, noncaloric liquid flavoring product.[21] Although it had no artificial flavors, unlike its competitors it had artificial colors, sweeteners and preservatives.[22]
Following trade liberalization in 1999, India allowed imports of international brands and Kraft decided to expand into the country. Currently, it is represented in India by Amit Lohani owned Max Foods Inc. and has a pan-country distribution.
Cadbury purchase[edit]
On September 7, 2009 Kraft made a hostile £10.2 billion takeover bid for the British confectionery group Cadbury, makers of Dairy Milk and Bournville chocolate.[23] On November 9 the company's bid (then £9.8 billion) was rejected by Cadbury, which called it a "derisory" offer.[24] Kraft renewed the offer on December 4.[25] It had significant political and public opposition in the United Kingdom and abroad, leading to a call for the government to implement economic protectionism in large-company takeovers.[26] On January 19, 2010, Cadbury approved a revised offer from Kraft which valued the company at £11.5 billion ($19.5 billion). Some funds for the takeover were provided by the Royal Bank of Scotland, the British partially state-owned bank.[27]
The Cadbury purchase was part of the long-term strategy of Irene Rosenfeld, CEO and Kraft chairman since March 2007, who developed a three-year turnaround plan to increase Kraft Foods' profits.[28] Rosenfeld wanted to develop new markets and expand Kraft's product range when she became chairman. It was assumed that the purchase of Cadbury would help Kraft products in new markets, such as Brazil and India, because of Cadbury’s presence in those markets.[29] India is one of its most resilient markets, with 20-percent sales growth and a 30-percent increase in profits.[30] Kraft believed the Cadbury purchase was necessary because of the likelihood of a Nestle-Hershey merger, and it could generate annual savings of at least $675 million by the end of the third year.[31] Rosenfeld saw the Kraft-Cadbury merger as the "logical next step in our transformation toward a high-growth, higher-margin company" to build a "global powerhouse in snacks, confectionery, and quick meals."[32]
The Cadbury purchase gave Kraft 14.8 percent of the global candy and gum market and the company wanted to avail itself of Cadbury distribution in the developing markets of India, Brazil, and Mexico.[33] As incomes rose in those developing countries, Kraft hoped that products such as Oreos would become impulse buys for children.[33] Mars was second in the confectionery market with 14.6-percent share, followed by Nestle with 7.8 percent.[34]
At the time of the purchase the chocolate and sugar industry had been growing at a 15-percent annual pace for the previous three years and was valued at $113 billion.[35] Although its Cadbury purchase was considered odd because Kraft did not have a foothold in the confectionery market, the company noted its production of confectionery foods such as Toblerones and baked snacks such as Oreos. Cadbury also owned chewing-gum brands, such as Stride, Trident, Dentyne and Chiclets.[36] Cadbury chairman Roger Carr explained his approval of the takeover: "We believe the offer represents good value for Cadbury shareholders and are pleased with the commitment that Kraft Foods has made to our heritage, values and people throughout the world".[37]
Cadbury sales were flat after Kraft’s acquisition. Despite the Cadbury takeover's helping to boost sales by 30 percent, Kraft's net profit for the fourth quarter fell 24 percent (to $540 million) due to costs associated with integrating the UK business after the acquisition.[38] Kraft spent $1.3 billion on integration to achieve an estimated $675 million in annual savings by the end of 2012.[39] Kraft increased prices to offset rising commodity costs (for corn, sugar, and cocoa) in North America and Europe. According to Rosenfeld, "We expect it will remain weak for the foreseeable future". Taking into account integration costs, the acquisition reduced Kraft's earnings per share by about 33% immediately after the Cadbury purchase.[38]
On March 17, 2010, Kraft Foods said it was "truly sorry" for its closure of Cadbury's Somerdale Factory. Senior Kraft executive Marc Firestone made the public apology to MPs at a parliamentary select committee hearing.[40] In March 2011 Kraft closed the plant, listing the site for £50 million and outsourcing production (which the company had promised not to do) to Poland. Although former Cadbury workers demanded an apology for the plant's abrupt sale, Kraft CEO Irene Rosenfeld did not explain the company's action.[41] Kraft uses the Cadbury brand in emerging markets to expand its product range, planning to invest $150 million in South African manufacturing plants over three years in April 2011. President Sanjay Khosla said, "South Africa is a priority market for us, where we focus on power brands like Cadbury chocolate".[42]
Sale of frozen-pizza division[edit]
On March 1, 2010, Nestlé purchased Kraft's North American frozen-pizza division for $3.7 billion. Although Kraft stipulated a one- to three-year buyback option, it did not exercise the option. The sale included the DiGiorno, Tombstone, and Jack's brands in the United States; the Delissio brand in Canada, the California Pizza Kitchen license and manufacturing facilities in Medford and Little Chute, Wisconsin. In 2009 the business, with 3,400 employees, had a net revenue of $1.6 billion.[43]
Kraft Foods Group and Douwe Egberts[edit]




Former Kraft Foods logo


In August 2011 Kraft Foods announced plans to split into two publicly traded companies, one snack-food and the other grocery.[44] The company changed its name to Mondelez International, specializing in snack foods, in October 2012 and a second company (Kraft Foods Group, specializing in grocery items) was split off.[45] Kraft Foods Group later merged with Heinz to become Kraft Heinz. In 2014, the company announced a merger of its coffee business with the Dutch firm Douwe Egberts;[46] the company would be named Jacobs Douwe Egberts. The merger was confirmed on May 6, 2014 and completed on July 2, 2015.[47][48]
Attempted Hershey acquisition[edit]
On June 30, 2016, Mondelez made a $23 billion offer to buy its smaller rival, Hershey. The half-cash, half-stock deal valued Hershey stock at $107 a share. Hershey's board, however, unanimously rejected the offer.[49]
Controversies[edit]
Trans-fat litigation[edit]
In 2003, a California lawyer sued Kraft for using trans fat in Oreo cookies.[50] When Kraft Foods announced a trans-fat-free reformulation of Oreos after the lawsuit was filed, it was dropped. The company denied that the change was made in response to the lawsuit, noting that the reformulation had been planned long before the lawsuit.[51]
In 2010 two California residents, Evangeline Red and Rachel Whitt, filed a class action lawsuit against Kraft Foods for claiming that certain products are healthy when they contain trans fat. Kraft denied any wrongdoing, saying that all packaging claims are true and legal, after the plaintiffs claimed that Kraft mislabeled Vegetable Thin and Ritz crackers as "made with real vegetables".[52]
Teddy Grahams, varieties of Ritz Crackers, Honey Maid Grahams, Premium Saltines, Ginger Snaps, and Vegetable Thins contained trans fats, with Kraft presenting the products as healthy with phrases such as "wholesome choice", "sensible snacking" and "made with real vegetables". The plaintiffs argued that the claims violated the California Unfair Competition Law, Consumer Legal Remedies Act and False Advertising Law.[53][54]
The lawsuit cited scientific consensus on the health effects of trans fats, which cause coronary heart disease[55] and has been linked to type 2 diabetes[56] and some types of cancer.[54][57] According to the American Heart Association, there is "no safe level" of trans fats in the diet.[58]
Based on trans fats and other unhealthy ingredients in Kraft products, the lawsuit argued that:[54]

Health claims such as "a wholesome choice" (on Teddy Grahams) and "sensible snacking" (on several products) are false.
"No cholesterol" claims are misleading, because they imply that the snack is good for cholesterol levels when trans fats are worse for cholesterol health than dietary cholesterol.
Claims such as "made with real vegetables" or "real ginger and molasses" are misleading, because the products contain less of those ingredients than trans fats.
Although Teddy Grahams packaging claimed to be a "good source of calcium, iron, and zinc to support kids' growth and development", the claim was deceptive because its trans-fat content outweighed the minerals' benefit.
Phrases such as "whole wheat" and "graham" implied health benefits the products do not possess.
On each package, some individual claims may be true but add to the deceptive message of overall healthfulness.

Kraft denied any wrongdoing, and its response briefs emphasized that its claims were technically true. Vegetable Thins were "made with real vegetables", and the company argued that the statement could not be considered misleading. Kraft used a similar argument for claims such as "good source of calcium, iron and zinc to support kids' growth and development" and "whole wheat".
About several packaging claims, Kraft argued that the statements could not be proven true or false; for example, the word "wholesome" is subjective. Promotional statements too vague to prove or disprove (known as puffery) are not actionable under law; Kraft argued that "wholesome," "sensible", and "smart" are puffery and could not be found misleading or deceitful.[59] The class action received $11,000 of its requested $1.8 million.[60]
Political campaign[edit]
In 2012, Kraft contributed $1,950,500 to a $46 million political campaign known as "The Coalition Against The Costly Food Labeling Proposition, sponsored by Farmers and Food Producers"[61] The organization was founded to oppose Proposition 37, a California citizen's initiative mandating the labeling of foods containing genetically modified ingredients. As a result, there were calls for a boycott of Kraft products.[62]
Environmental record[edit]
For years Kraft purchased paper for its packaging from Asia Pulp & Paper, the third-largest paper producer in the world which was called a "forest criminal" for destroying "precious habitat" in Indonesia’s rain forest.[63] In 2011, when Kraft cancelled its contract with Asia Pulp & Paper, Greenpeace executive director Phil Radford commended the company for "taking rainforest conservation seriously".[64]
Wheat futures price-fixing allegation[edit]
The US Commodity and Futures Commission (CTFC) alleged that Mondelez International and its former subsidiary, Mondelez Global, bought $90 million (£61 million) of wheat futures with no intention of taking delivery. According to the CTFC, the purchase raised the price of the commodity and earned the company $5.4 million.[65]
Recalls[edit]
Main article: StarLink corn recall
In September 2000, up to $50 million worth of taco shells were recalled by Kraft from supermarkets and Taco Bell restaurants. The shells contained genetically modified corn, which was not approved for human consumption by the Food and Drug Administration; the recall was the first of a genetically modified food. The corn was supplied to a plant from which Kraft bought the shells.[66]
In April 2009, Kraft Foods recalled products containing pistachios after the discovery of salmonella at one of its Illinois manufacturers. Kraft pinpointed as the source a California pistachio grower, which initially recalled over 2,000,000 pounds (910,000 kg) of nuts before broadening the recall to much of its 2008 crop.[67][68] A Washington Post editorial credited the "aggressive food safety system at Kraft Foods" with effectively addressing the danger.[69] In September 2011, Kraft recalled over 130,000 cases of Velveeta Shells and Cheese microwaveable cups because of possible wire bristles in the cups.[70]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
