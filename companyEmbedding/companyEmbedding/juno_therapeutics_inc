Juno Therapeutics’ Investigational CAR T Cell Product Candidate JCAR015 Shows High Response Rates in Adults with B-cell ALL | Business Wire
























































Juno Therapeutics’ Investigational CAR T Cell Product Candidate 
      JCAR015 Shows High Response Rates in Adults with B-cell ALL




– Durable responses and survivals observed in subset of patients who 
      do not go to transplant –


– Comparable survival outcomes to transplant patients –


– Lower side effects in patients with minimal disease at time of CAR 
      T cell infusion –






June 04, 2016 05:15 PM Eastern Daylight Time



SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Juno Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: JUNO), a biopharmaceutical company 
      focused on re-engaging the body’s immune system to revolutionize the 
      treatment of cancer, today announced that encouraging clinical data from 
      JCAR015, a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell product candidate, 
      support its strategic approach towards the commercialization of its 
      first CAR T therapy. Updated results will be presented today in an oral 
      presentation at the 52nd Annual Meeting of the American 
      Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) in Chicago (Abstract #7003, Arie 
      Crown Theater, 4:00 p.m. CT).
    


      “The ongoing efficacy and duration of response for a large percentage of 
      patients, specifically those who do not go on to stem cell transplant, 
      continues to be impressive,” said Mark J. Gilbert, M.D., Juno’s Chief 
      Medical Officer. “These findings provide us with further confidence 
      about our development strategy and the ongoing Phase II ROCKET pivotal 
      trial.”
    

      In the Phase I study, presented by lead investigator Jae H. Park, M.D., 
      of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 51 adult patients with 
      relapsed or refractory (r/r) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were 
      treated with either cyclophosphamide or fludarabine/cyclophosphamide 
      followed by an infusion of JCAR015. At the time of treatment, 31 
      patients had morphologic disease burden and 20 patients had minimal 
      disease burden. Median study follow-up was 8.5 months. Key results 
      include:
    


        Complete response (CR) was observed in 23/30 (77%) patients with 
        morphologic disease and in 18/20 (90%) patients with minimal disease.
      

        In patients who achieved a CR and had adequate evaluation for minimal 
        residual disease by flow cytometry or polymerase chain reaction, 
        complete molecular remission was observed in 19/21 (90%) patients with 
        morphologic disease and in 14/18 (78%) patients with minimal disease.
      

        Median overall survival (OS) for patients with minimal disease treated 
        with JCAR015 was not reached, and that for morphologic patients 
        treated with JCAR015 was 9 months; median OS follow-up for all 
        patients was 13 months.
      

        Durable responses and survival observed in patients who received 
        JCAR015 were comparable between groups that received a subsequent stem 
        cell transplant and those that did not.
      

        Severe cytokine release syndrome (sCRS) was observed in 14/51 (27%) 
        patients and Grade 3 or higher neurotoxicity was observed in 15/51 
        (29%) patients. For patients with minimal disease, 1/20 (5%) patients 
        experienced sCRS and 4/20 (20%) patients had Grade 3 or higher 
        neurotoxicity.
      


About Juno’s Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) and T Cell Receptor 
      (TCR) Technologies


      Juno’s CAR and TCR technologies genetically engineer T cells to 
      recognize and kill cancer cells. Juno’s CAR T cell technology inserts a 
      gene for a particular CAR into the T cell, enabling it to recognize 
      cancer cells based on the expression of a specific protein located on 
      the cell surface. Juno’s TCR technology provides the T cells with a 
      specific T cell receptor to recognize protein fragments derived from 
      either the surface or inside the cell. When either type of engineered T 
      cell engages the target protein on the cancer cell, it initiates a 
      cell-killing response against the cancer cell. JCAR015 is an 
      investigational product candidate and its safety and efficacy have not 
      been established.

About the Celgene Corporation and Juno Therapeutics, Inc. 
      Collaboration


      Celgene Corporation and Juno Therapeutics, Inc. are engaged in a 
      ten-year collaboration to advance T cell therapeutic strategies to 
      develop treatments for patients with cancer and autoimmune diseases, 
      with an initial focus on CAR and TCR technologies. In April 2016 Celgene 
      exercised its option under the collaboration to develop and 
      commercialize the Juno CD19 program outside North America and China. The 
      CD19 program includes investigational product candidates and their 
      safety and efficacy have not been established.

Juno Therapeutics, Inc. Key Developments

Juno Therapeutics, Inc. Presents Data from the TRANSCEND Trial of JCAR017
Jun 17 17
Juno Therapeutics, Inc. presented data from the TRANSCEND trial of JCAR017 in relapsed and refractory (r/r) aggressive B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) at the 2017 International Conference on Malignant Lymphoma in Lugano, Switzerland. JCAR017 is Juno’s investigative chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell product candidate that targets CD19, a protein expressed on the surface of almost all B cell malignancies, and uses a defined composition of CD4 to CD8 T cells and a 4-1BB costimulatory domain, which differentiates it from other current CD19-directed CAR T product candidates. JCAR017 has been granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA for treatment of r/r aggressive large B cell NHL and PRIME designation by the European Medicines Agency for treatment of r/r diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), a type of NHL. Data were presented by Jeremy Abramson, M.D., of Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, from the multicenter TRANSCEND trial (ABSTRACT #128), a Phase 1 study that has treated a total of 67 patients with r/r aggressive B cell NHL, including those with DLBCL or follicular lymphoma grade 3B, as of a data cutoff date of May 4, 2017. TRANSCEND NHL 001 is a dose-finding study of JCAR017, which is administered following fludarabine/cyclophosphamide lymphodepletion. Patients received one of two dose levels (50 or 100 million cells). They were then evaluated for pharmacokinetics, disease response, and safety outcomes, including common CAR T side effects such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity (NT). Notably, the TRANSCEND NHL 001 protocol includes patients with forms of B cell NHL that would exclude them from trials of other CAR T product candidates, including those with ECOG 2 performance status, central nervous system (CNS) involvement of their lymphoma, and those relapsed after allogeneic bone marrow transplant. Data for the DLBCL cohort were presented in two groups: core and full. The core analysis group (N=44) includes patients that represent the population that Juno plans to move forward into a pivotal trial in the second half of 2017. The core group includes patients with DLBCL (de novo and transformed from follicular lymphoma) that are ECOG Performance Status 0-1. The full analysis group includes all r/r patients in the DLBCL cohort (N=55), including 11 patients with poor performance status or niche subtypes of aggressive NHL. Both the core and full groups received conforming product, with at least one month follow-up, and with a data cutoff date of May 4, 2017, for this presentation.

Juno Therapeutics, Inc. Updates Data from the TRANSCEND trial of JCAR017 in Relapsed and Refractory (r/r) Aggressive B Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
Jun 5 17
Juno Therapeutics, Inc. announced updated data from the TRANSCEND trial of JCAR017 in relapsed and refractory (r/r) aggressive B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in a presentation at the 2017 Annual Meeting of the American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO). JCAR017 is Juno’s investigative chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell product candidate that targets CD19, a protein expressed on the surface of almost all B cell malignancies, and uses a defined composition of CD4 to CD8 T cells and a 4-1BB costimulatory domain, which differentiates it from other current CD19-directed CAR T product candidates. Combining data across dose levels: Overall response rate (ORR) is 86% (38/44) and the complete response (CR) is 59% (26/44). Three-month ORR is 66% (21/32) and CR is 50% (16/32). Of three-month responders followed up at least six months, 90% (9/10) remain in response. Early data suggest a dose response relationship at three months: Dose level 1 (50 million cells) ORR is 58% (11/19) and CR is 42% (8/19). Dose level 2 (100 million cells) ORR is 78% (7/9) and CR is 56% (5/9). 97% (37/38) of responding patients are alive and in follow up as of May 4, 2017. 
2% (1/44) experienced severe CRS and 18% (8/44) experienced severe NT. 66% (29/44) did not experience any CRS or NT. No deaths were reported from CRS or NT. 
There was one Grade 5 adverse event of diffuse alveolar damage, which the investigator assessed as related to fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and JCAR017 treatment, occurring on day 23 in an 82-year-old subject who refused mechanical ventilation for progressive respiratory failure while neutropenic on growth factors and broad spectrum antibiotics and antifungals. Combining data across dose levels: Best ORR is 76% (41/54) and CR is 52% (28/54). Three-month ORR is 51% (21/41) and CR is 39% (16/41). 
2% (1/55) experienced severe CRS and 16% (9/55) experienced severe NT. 60% (33/55) did not experience any CRS or NT. No deaths reported from CRS or NT. 
Early data do not suggest a dose toxicity relationship at the doses tested: Severe CRS rate is 3% (1/30) at dose level 1 and 0% (0/19) at dose level 2. Severe NT rate is 20% (6/30) at dose level 1 and 11% (2/19) at dose level 2. 11% (6/55) received tocilizumab and 24% (13/55) received dexamethasone. The most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events were neutropenia (35%), CRS (35%), and fatigue (31%).

Three must-own cancer stocks for your biotechnology portfolio

Juno Therapeutics stock drops 5% after BTIG downgrades to sell
Juno Therapeutics Inc.  shares dropped 5.2% in premarket trade Thursday after BTIG downgraded it to sell from neutral, with a $12 price target. Juno shares closed at $23.73 on Wednesday. The company is "trailing" competitors like Kite Pharma Inc.  and Novartis AG  to market and there is "little demonstrative proof" that Juno drugs work better or have fewer life-threatening side effects, BTIG analyst Dane Leone said. The company's lack of progress casts questions about its management, Leone said, who also criticized Juno Chief Executive Hans Bishop. "We do not think the impetus is currently in place (activism) but the company has built out a CAR T infrastructure with backing from Celgene  which could be valuable if managed correctly," he said. Not all analysts agree with Leone's poor assessment of Juno: Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt said on Wednesday that "we think the JUNO weakness on competitive fears is unwarranted and believe JUNO's JCAR017 product looks very competitive to both NVS' and KITE's data... when compared apples to apples." More time is needed to compare the products, he said, with Juno on track to start a pivotal study in the second half of this year. After several patients in a clinical trial for Juno's JCAR015 drug died last year, the company later announced it would discontinue the drug's development. Juno and other companies are developing a similar type of cancer treatment, but rivals have garnered more positive results. Recent clinical trial results from rival Bluebird Bio  prompted a J.P. Morgan analyst to christen the company "the clear winner" at a major cancer conference this past weekend. Juno shares have risen 8.7% over the last three months, compared with a 3% rise in the S&P 500 .

Juno Therapeutics Inc. (JUNO  -  Free Report)	 is expected to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 3. Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 9.09%.Year to date, Juno’s shares have soared 58.9% while the industry recorded an increase of 12%.The company’s poor track record so far shows negative surprises in three of the last four quarters. The average negative earnings surprise for the last four quarters is 7.98%.Juno Therapeutics, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseJuno Therapeutics, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Juno Therapeutics, Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayWith no approved products in its portfolio, Juno does not generate any product revenue yet. Thus, investors’ focus will primarily be on the company’s cash burn and pipeline updates.Juno is developing cell-based cancer immunotherapies based on CAR and high-affinity TCR technologies. This is a hot therapeutic area with huge commercial potential. Presently, the company’s most advanced pipeline candidates include JCAR017 and JCAR014, which use CAR T-cell technology to target CD19.JCAR017 is in a phase I study for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and in a phase I/II study in pediatric and young adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (r/r ALL). A pivotal trial for JCAR017 in r/r DLBCL (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) is expected to start in 2017. The company plans to bring JCAR017 to the market for NHL as early as 2018 and for multiple indications by the end of 2019.Encouraging data from an early-stage study evalauting JCAR014, in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who failed treatment with ibrutinib, was presented in Dec 2016. Insights from studies of JCAR014 are being applied to the development of JCAR017 for the treatment of B-cell malignancies.However, the company faced a major setback last year related to the development of its lead pipeline candidate, JCAR015. In Nov 2016, Juno announced that it is discontinuing the development of JCAR015 for r/r ALL due to the toxicity witnessed in a phase II ROCKET study.We note that at the time of releasing the first-quarter results, Juno has maintained its expectations of cash burn of $270–$300 million for 2017.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Juno is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 74 cents.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Although Juno’s Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) increases the predictive power of ESP, its 0.00% Earnings ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other worth-considering health care stocks which have the right combination of elements per our model, to post an earnings beat this quarter.Zoetis Inc.

Three must-own cancer stocks for your biotechnology portfolio 

Jun. 19, 2017 at 5:37 p.m. ET
by Michael Brush









Juno Therapeutics stock drops 5% after BTIG downgrades to sell
Juno Therapeutics Inc.  shares dropped 5.2% in premarket trade Thursday after BTIG downgraded it to sell from neutral, with a $12 price target. Juno shares closed at $23.73 on Wednesday. The company is "trailing" competitors like Kite Pharma Inc.  and Novartis AG  to market and there is "little demonstrative proof" that Juno drugs work better or have fewer life-threatening side effects, BTIG analyst Dane Leone said. The company's lack of progress casts questions about its management, Leone said, who also criticized Juno Chief Executive Hans Bishop. "We do not think the impetus is currently in place (activism) but the company has built out a CAR T infrastructure with backing from Celgene  which could be valuable if managed correctly," he said. Not all analysts agree with Leone's poor assessment of Juno: Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt said on Wednesday that "we think the JUNO weakness on competitive fears is unwarranted and believe JUNO's JCAR017 product looks very competitive to both NVS' and KITE's data... when compared apples to apples." More time is needed to compare the products, he said, with Juno on track to start a pivotal study in the second half of this year. After several patients in a clinical trial for Juno's JCAR015 drug died last year, the company later announced it would discontinue the drug's development. Juno and other companies are developing a similar type of cancer treatment, but rivals have garnered more positive results. Recent clinical trial results from rival Bluebird Bio  prompted a J.P. Morgan analyst to christen the company "the clear winner" at a major cancer conference this past weekend. Juno shares have risen 8.7% over the last three months, compared with a 3% rise in the S&P 500 .

About Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is not a single disease, but rather a group of several closely related cancers with different patterns of treatment. Over 70,000 cases of NHL are diagnosed in the U.S. each year. NHL is typically divided into aggressive (fast-growing) and indolent (slow-growing) subtypes. Juno is planning to evaluate multiple product candidates in Phase 1 trials for common types of relapsed or refractory (R/R) B cell NHL of both aggressive and indolent subtypes.

About Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) is an uncontrolled proliferation of lymphoblasts, which are immature white blood cells. The lymphoblasts, which are produced in the bone marrow, cause damage and death by inhibiting the production of normal cells.

Approximately 6,000 patients are diagnosed with ALL in the United States each year, and although just over half of the new diagnoses are in adult patients, the vast majority of the approximately 1,400 deaths per year occur in adults. There are two main types of ALL, B cell ALL and T cell ALL. Approximately 80% of cases of ALL are B cell ALL, which we aim to address with our CD19 product candidates.

About Multiple Myeloma
Multiple myeloma is a form of blood cancer that occurs when white blood cells known as plasma cells, which are typically found in the bone marrow, grow out of control and develop into tumors. Approximately 30,000 new cases of multiple myeloma will be diagnosed this year in the U.S. There are few known risk factors for developing this disease and it may not cause signs or symptoms that would lead to a diagnosis until it has advanced to the kidneys and other organs.

About Acute Myeloid Leukemia
Every year about 13,000 people are diagnosed with AML in the United States, with the incidence increasing in the advanced age group. AML is often incurable with standard systemic therapy. Despite the many advances in the field of hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT), relapse after transplantation continues to be a major problem, particularly in patients entering HCT with high risk/poor prognosis diseases.

About Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for up to 85% of all lung cancer diagnoses in the U.S. Within NSCLC, there are many subtypes of the disease depending on the different types of lung cells. Immunotherapy for NSCLC is a newer type of treatment that boosts a person’s immune system to help fight their cancer. (Adapted from American Cancer Society, Cancer A – Z.)
About Mesothelioma
Mesothelioma is a rare and aggressive type of cancer that grows in the lining of the lungs or abdomen, or in the lining around the heart cavity. It most typically is found in the lungs. The most common risk factor for mesothelioma is exposure to asbestos. Often, the disease is not diagnosed until it has advanced and affected many organs. At this time there is no cure for mesothelioma. (Adapted from American Cancer Society, Cancer A – Z.)

About Neuroblastoma
Neuroblastoma is a type of cancer that starts in the early nerve cells, known as neuroblasts, of infants and young children under the age of 10. It accounts for approximately 6 percent of all cancers in children, with about 700 new cases in the U.S. each year. In infants, it is the most common solid cancer.

About Triple-Negative Breast Cancer
Breast cancer is the second most common cancer in American women, with more than 250,000 new cases diagnosed this year. In triple-negative breast cancer, the breast cancer cells test negative for the hormones estrogen (ER-) and progesterone (PR-) and the protein HER2 (HER2-). As a result, this type of cancer does not respond to hormonal therapy or therapies that target HER2. Approximately 10-20% of breast cancers fall into this category and are more common in young women and those who are African-American or Hispanic/Latina. (Adapted from American Cancer Society, Cancer A – Z.)

About Lung Cancer
Lung cancer is the second most common cancer in men and women (after skin cancer) and is typically diagnosed at an advanced stage. Most lung cancer diagnoses are related to smoking or exposure to environmental factors but some occur in people with no known risk factors. Recommended treatments vary depending on the type of lung cancer and the stage of the disease. (Adapted from American Cancer Society, Cancer A – Z.)

Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) Q2 Earnings: Surprise in Store?

Friday, July 28, 2017 Zacks Equity Research News, stream 


Juno Therapeutics Inc. JUNO is expected to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 3. Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 9.09%.
Year to date, Juno’s shares have soared 58.9% while the industry recorded an increase of 12%.

The company’s poor track record so far shows negative surprises in three of the last four quarters. The average negative earnings surprise for the last four quarters is 7.98%.

Juno Therapeutics, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise
 
Juno Therapeutics, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Juno Therapeutics, Inc. Quote

Factors at Play
With no approved products in its portfolio, Juno does not generate any product revenue yet. Thus, investors’ focus will primarily be on the company’s cash burn and pipeline updates.
Juno is developing cell-based cancer immunotherapies based on CAR and high-affinity TCR technologies. This is a hot therapeutic area with huge commercial potential. Presently, the company’s most advanced pipeline candidates include JCAR017 and JCAR014, which use CAR T-cell technology to target CD19.
JCAR017 is in a phase I study for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and in a phase I/II study in pediatric and young adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (r/r ALL). A pivotal trial for JCAR017 in r/r DLBCL (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) is expected to start in 2017. The company plans to bring JCAR017 to the market for NHL as early as 2018 and for multiple indications by the end of 2019.
Encouraging data from an early-stage study evalauting JCAR014, in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who failed treatment with ibrutinib, was presented in Dec 2016. Insights from studies of JCAR014 are being applied to the development of JCAR017 for the treatment of B-cell malignancies.
However, the company faced a major setback last year related to the development of its lead pipeline candidate, JCAR015. In Nov 2016, Juno announced that it is discontinuing the development of JCAR015 for r/r ALL due to the toxicity witnessed in a phase II ROCKET study.
We note that at the time of releasing the first-quarter results, Juno has maintained its expectations of cash burn of $270–$300 million for 2017.
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Juno is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below.
Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 74 cents.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.
Zacks Rank: Although Juno’s Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) increases the predictive power of ESP, its 0.00% Earnings ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.
We caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.
Stocks That Warrant a Look
Here are some other worth-considering health care stocks which have the right combination of elements per our model, to post an earnings beat this quarter.
Zoetis Inc. ZTS is scheduled to release results on Aug 8 with an Earnings ESP of +1.89% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.
Tesaro, Inc. TSRO is scheduled to release results on Aug 8. The company has an Earnings ESP of +16.40% and a Zacks Rank #3.
Esperion Therapeutics, Inc. ESPR is expected to release results on Aug 3. The company has an Earnings ESP of +17.37% and a Zacks Rank #3.

Our proven model does not conclusively show that Juno is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below.
Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 74 cents.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.
Zacks Rank: Although Juno’s Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) increases the predictive power of ESP, its 0.00% Earnings ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.
We caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.
Stocks That Warrant a Look
Here are some other worth-considering health care stocks which have the right combination of elements per our model, to post an earnings beat this quarter.
Zoetis Inc. ZTS is scheduled to release results on Aug 8 with an Earnings ESP of +1.89% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.
Tesaro, Inc. TSRO is scheduled to release results on Aug 8. The company has an Earnings ESP of +16.40% and a Zacks Rank #3.
Esperion Therapeutics, Inc. ESPR is expected to release results on Aug 3. The company has an Earnings ESP of +17.37% and a Zacks Rank #3.

					Full Description



Juno Therapeutics, Inc. (Juno), incorporated on August 5, 2013, is a biopharmaceutical company, which is focused on developing cellular immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer. The Company is developing cell-based cancer immunotherapies based on its chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and T cell receptor (TCR) technologies to genetically engineer T cells to recognize and kill cancer cells. Its product candidates JCAR017, JCAR014, and JCAR015, as well as an additional early stage product candidate incorporating a fully human binding domain, leverage CAR technology to target CD19, a protein expressed on the surface of almost all B cell leukemias and lymphomas. Its CAR product candidate JCAR018 targets CD22, a different protein commonly expressed on the surface of B cell leukemias and lymphomas.The Company has begun a Phase I trial in relapsed or refractory (r/r) multiple myeloma at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) of a CAR product candidate that targets B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) and incorporates a fully human binding domain and a 4-1BB costimulatory domain. It is conducting Phase I trials for four additional product candidates using its CAR technology, directed against L1CAM, Lewis Y, MUC-16, and ROR-1. It is also conducting two Phase I/II clinical trials for a fifth product candidate, using its TCR technology, directed against WT-1. L1CAM, Lewis Y, MUC-16, ROR-1, and WT-1 are proteins that are overexpressed or aberrantly expressed on certain cancer cells. Its MUC-16 directed product candidate is an armored CAR that secretes the cytokine interleukin 12 (IL-12), which may help to overcome the inhibitory effects that the tumor microenvironment can have on T cell activity. MUC-16 is a protein overexpressed in the majority of ovarian cancers.JCAR017 is in development for adults with r/r aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (r/r ALL). JCAR014 is being evaluated at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC) in a Phase I/II trial as a treatment for adults with any of several B cell malignancies, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), NHL, and chronic lymphocyctic leukemia (CLL), in patients relapsed or refractory to standard therapies. JCAR015 is a CD19-directed product candidate that uses a CD28 costimulatory domain and a CD4+ and CD8+ selection step to select out T cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. JCAR018 is designed for the treatment of B cell malignancies. JCAR018 is being tested in a Phase I trial at the NCI in pediatric and young adult patients that have CD22-positive r/r ALL or relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma (r/r NHL).The Company is exploring the potential of its CAR and TCR technologies against targets that have the potential to treat cancers beyond B cell malignancies and multiple myeloma, in particular, difficult-to-treat solid organ tumors, such as certain breast, lung and pancreatic cancers. CD171 is a cell-surface adhesion molecule that plays an important role in the development of a normal nervous system. Lewis Y is expressed in multiple types of cancer, such as lung, leukemia, breast and ovarian cancers. ROR-1 is a protein expressed in the formation of embryos and JCAR024 is its ROR-1-directed CAR T cell product candidate. Its TCR T cell product candidate, JTCR016, targets WT-1, an intracellular protein that is overexpressed in a number of cancers, including adult myeloid leukemia (AML) and non-small cell lung, breast, pancreatic, ovarian and colorectal cancers. It is developing a CAR product candidate that targets a cytokine receptor, IL13ra2, which is overexpressed on glioblastoma.The Company competes with Novartis, Kite, Amgen, National Cancer Institute, Cellectis, Servier, Johnson & Johnson, Transposagen Biopharmaceuticals, bluebird bio, Bellicum, Celyad, Cell Design Labs, NantKwest, Intrexon, ZIOPHARM, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Unum Therapeutics, Adaptimmune, GlaxoSmithKline, ImmunoCellular Therapeutics, Adicet Bio, Autolus, Pfizer, Abbvie, AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers, Incyte, Merck, Roche, Regeneron, Corvus and Macrogenics.

Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 9.09%.Year to date, Juno’s shares have soared 58.9% while the industry recorded an increase of 12%.View photosThe company’s poor track record so far shows negative surprises in three of the last four quarters. The average negative earnings surprise for the last four quarters is 7.98%.Juno Therapeutics, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseView photosJuno Therapeutics, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Juno Therapeutics, Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayWith no approved products in its portfolio, Juno does not generate any product revenue yet. Thus, investors’ focus will primarily be on the company’s cash burn and pipeline updates.Juno is developing cell-based cancer immunotherapies based on CAR and high-affinity TCR technologies. This is a hot therapeutic area with huge commercial potential. Presently, the company’s most advanced pipeline candidates include JCAR017 and JCAR014, which use CAR T-cell technology to target CD19.JCAR017 is in a phase I study for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and in a phase I/II study in pediatric and young adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (r/r ALL). A pivotal trial for JCAR017 in r/r DLBCL (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) is expected to start in 2017. The company plans to bring JCAR017 to the market for NHL as early as 2018 and for multiple indications by the end of 2019.Encouraging data from an early-stage study evalauting JCAR014, in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who failed treatment with ibrutinib, was presented in Dec 2016. Insights from studies of JCAR014 are being applied to the development of JCAR017 for the treatment of B-cell malignancies.However, the company faced a major setback last year related to the development of its lead pipeline candidate, JCAR015. In Nov 2016, Juno announced that it is discontinuing the development of JCAR015 for r/r ALL due to the toxicity witnessed in a phase II ROCKET study.We note that at the time of releasing the first-quarter results, Juno has maintained its expectations of cash burn of $270–$300 million for 2017.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Juno is likely to beat estimates this quarter.
