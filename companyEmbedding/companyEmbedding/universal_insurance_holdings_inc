Company History
Universal Insurance Holdings, Inc. ("UIH" or the "Company") was organized as Universal Heights, Inc. in 1990. The Company changed its name to Universal Insurance Holdings, Inc. on January 12, 2001. In April 1997, the Company organized a subsidiary, Universal Property & Casualty Insurance Company ("UPCIC"), as part of its strategy to take advantage of growth opportunities in the Florida homeowners’ insurance marketplace. UPCIC was formed to participate in the transfer of homeowners' insurance policies from the Florida Residential Property and Casualty Joint Underwriting Association ("JUA"). The Company has since evolved into a vertically integrated insurance holding company, which through its various subsidiaries, covers substantially all aspects of insurance underwriting, distribution, claims processing and exposure management.

General InformationContact InformationTerms of UsePrivacy Statement

Privacy Statement
The affiliates of Universal Insurance Holdings, Inc., strive to provide you with high quality insurance products and efficient customer service.  In the course of doing so, we obtain personal information about you and your family.  We consider this information confidential and have procedures in place to protect the information against unlawful use and disclosure.  We will disclose your information only as necessary to process your requests for insurance, to provide services to you as a policyholder or claimant, and as otherwise allowed or required by law.
The following statements describe how we obtain and use information about you, and how we protect that information.  This statement applies to our affiliates identified below, and applies not only to current customers but also to our former customers.  You do not need to take any action in response to this notice.
Personal Information We Collect
In connection with providing products and services to you, we obtain information from several sources.  Most of the information we obtain comes directly from you, such as through the insurance applications you submit and other interactions you have with us.  From these interactions with you, we learn information such as your name, address, telephone number, existing coverages, desired coverages, and similar information.
We also learn information about you from your transactions with us.  This may include information such as your current or past coverages and related information, your premium levels, your payment history, your claims history, and other information.  Your insurance agent also may provide information to us, such as requested additions or deletions of coverage and updated contact information for you.  Finally, we may receive information from outside parties that has a bearing on your eligibility for products or services in which you are or might be interested.  These parties may include consumer reporting agencies, claims reporting services, motor vehicle records bureaus, or other sources.  Information obtained from these sources may include your prior claims history, information about any prior civil or criminal actions in which you have been involved, financial information, and other information about your background.
If you visit an Internet site that we maintain, we might request certain information about you that will enable us to identify you as a user, including your name, a user name, a password, and password reminders.  We also might obtain information about your web browser, operating system and similar information to improve the performance and operation of our site.
Our Use of Your Personal Information
We do not share the information we collect with other parties, except our affiliates, nonaffiliated parties performing contractual services for us, and as otherwise required or permitted by law.

The companies also may offer other products and services as the Universal Insurance Holdings family grows.

The information we share among affiliates is limited to information about your transactions and experiences with us and to information that we otherwise are permitted to disclose by law.
When we provide information to parties performing contractual services for us (such as marketing and research), we contractually require those parties to preserve the confidentiality of your personal information.  As indicated above, we also might share information that we obtain about you with nonaffiliated parties as allowed or required by law.  This means that we will share information with parties as necessary to effect, administer, or enforce transactions that you request.  In other words, we might provide your information, for example, to a company that prints and mails our insurance policies, or to a company that adjusts claims you report to us.  Finally, we are permitted or required to share information with certain other parties listed in federal law and state rules, such as insurance advisory organizations, our attorneys and accountants, consumer reporting agencies, and civil and regulatory authorities.
How We Protect Your Personal Information
We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to ensure the confidentiality of the personal information we obtain about you.  We restrict access to your personal information to those employees who need to know that information to provide services to you.

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., June 1, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Universal Insurance Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:    UVE) today announced the completion by Universal Property & Casualty Insurance Company ("UPCIC") and American Platinum Property and Casualty Insurance Company ("APPCIC"), the Company's wholly-owned insurance company subsidiaries, of their 2017-2018 reinsurance programs, effective June 1, 2017. The largest private participants in the insurance subsidiaries' reinsurance programs include Nephila Capital (via Allianz Risk Transfer), Everest Re, RenaissanceRe, Chubb Tempest Re and Lloyd's of London syndicates, all of which maintain a rating from S&P Global of A+ or higher.








"We are pleased with the completion and outcome of the 2017-2018 reinsurance programs for both of our insurance companies," said Jon W. Springer, President and Chief Risk Officer of the Company. "With this renewal, we have continued building on the recent trend of adding additional conservatism to our reinsurance programs without increasing the percentage of premium spent on reinsurance.  
"Even with UPCIC's growing business, we have maintained the same $35 million catastrophe retention for a Florida loss and the same $5 million catastrophe retention for a loss involving states other than Florida.  A $35 million loss would now represent just 10.5% of UPCIC's statutory surplus as of March 31, 2017 and less than 9% of UVE's stockholder's equity as of March 31, 2017.
"In addition to adding conservatism by maintaining low first event catastrophe retentions, UPCIC has also added a new contract to reduce its 2nd, 3rd and 4th event retention for a catastrophe loss involving states other than Florida to just $1 million and expanded the top of its reinsurance tower for a single Florida event to $2.65 billion.  To further insulate itself for future years, UPCIC has also now successfully secured over $300 million of catastrophe capacity with contractually agreed limits that extend for two or more years.
"APPCIC was also able to continue the conservatism trend by utilizing the same percentage of premium spent on reinsurance to add coverage for its new commercial lines business to all contracts and also maintain the same $2 million catastrophe retention.
"Another year of growing our business and capital, expanding our reinsurance coverage, maintaining the same Florida retention and further reducing our retention in other states, puts us in the strongest position we've ever been in as we enter the 2017 hurricane season."

Universal Insurance Holdings Becomes Oversold











Universal Insurance Holdings, Inc. Announces Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Release And Conference Call Date













YieldBoost Universal Insurance Holdings From 2.3% To 18.7% Using Options
Shareholders of Universal Insurance Holdings Inc looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 2.3% annualized dividend yield can sell the November covered call at the $25 strike and collect the premium based on the $1.65 bid, which annualizes to an additional 16.4% rate of return against the current stock price (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost), for a total of 18.7% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $25 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but UVE shares would have to climb 2% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 8.8% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.

Universal Insurance Holdings Named Top Dividend Stock With Insider Buying and 3.10% Yield (UVE)
In this series, we look through the most recent Dividend Channel ''DividendRank'' report, and then we cherry pick only those companies that have experienced insider buying within the past six months. The officers and directors of a company tend to have a unique insider's view of the business, and presumably the only reason an insider would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money — maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both.

Mar 11, 2016 2:06 PM EST













UVE: Insiders vs. Shorts
The most recent short interest data was recently released by the NASDAQ for the 02/12/2016 settlement date, and Universal Insurance Holdings Inc is one of the most shorted stocks of the Russell 3000, based on 13.62 "days to cover" versus the median component at 5.27. There are a number of ways to look at short data, but one metric that we find particularly useful is the "days to cover" because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares typically traded.
