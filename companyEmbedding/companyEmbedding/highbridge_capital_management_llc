Risks of Investing in a Fund
When investing in any fund we sponsor or manage (a “Fund”), you are strongly urged to carefully review the risk factors and conflicts of interest disclosures in the offering materials for such fund.  The risks involved in an investment in any Fund, include, but are not limited to, the following:

General/Loss of capital.  An investment in a Fund involves a high degree of risk.  There can be no assurance that a Fund’s return objectives will be realized and investors in a Fund could lose up to the full amount of their invested capital.  A Fund’s fees and expenses may offset a Fund’s profits.  Limited liquidity.  An investment in a Fund provides limited liquidity since withdrawals may be prohibited or limited and interests may not be freely transferable or redeemable.  There will be no secondary market for the interests in any Fund.  Dependence on manager. HCM has total investment authority over a Fund.  Decisions made by HCM may cause a Fund to incur losses or to miss profit opportunities on which it would otherwise have capitalized.  Volatility.  Investment techniques used in a Fund may include the use of leverage and derivative instruments such as futures, options and short sales, which amplify the possibilities for both profits and losses and may add volatility to a Fund’s performance.  Potential conflicts of interest.  The payment of  performance-based compensation to HCM creates an incentive for HCM to cause a Fund to make riskier or more speculative investments than it would in the absence of such compensation.  Valuation. The value at which a Fund’s investments can be liquidated may differ, sometimes significantly, from the interim valuations determined by such Fund.  Non-U.S. securities.  A Fund may invest in non-U.S. securities, which may include exposure to currency fluctuation, reduced access to reliable information, less stringent accounting standards, illiquidity of securities and markets, higher commissions and fees and local economic or political instability.  Absence of regulatory oversight.   A Fund will not register as an investment company under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940 or similar laws or regulations.  Accordingly, the provisions of such laws and regulations will not be applicable.

Privacy Policy
Collection and Disclosure of Information
The Website is not configured in a manner that requires you to provide us with non-public personal information in order to obtain access to certain information or materials. Therefore, HCM does not, in the ordinary course, obtain nonpublic personal information about you via the Website.
However, when you enter and browse the Website, HCM may collect, through technology, information about you that is not personally identifiable. This may include, without limitation, the number and frequency of visits to the Website, the websites accessed before and after you visit the Website, the Internet browsers used by you and your IP addresses. HCM may use this type of non-personally identifiable information for reasonable business purposes, such as the use of your IP address to help diagnose problems with HCM’s server or to administer the Website. This information may also be analyzed so that HCM can serve you in the best manner possible on its Website.
Security of Information
In the event HCM collects any information about you, it will take reasonable precautions to protect your information from loss, misuse or alteration. You should recognize, however, that there is no such thing as “perfect security” on the Internet, and third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications.
Miscellaneous
Limitation of Liability
HCM and its affiliates, officers, directors, shareholders, agents, partners and employees shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special or consequential damages, resulting from the use or the inability to use the Website and services; or resulting from any information or services obtained or messages received or transactions entered into through the Website; or resulting from unauthorized access to or alteration of your transmissions of data, including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, use, data or other intangible losses, even if HCM has been advised of the possibility of such damages. Because certain jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such jurisdictions liability is limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. If you are dissatisfied with any portion of the Website, or with any of these terms of use, your sole and exclusive remedy is to discontinue using this Website.
Applicable Law
This Policy will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to any principles of conflicts of law. You agree that any action at law or in equity that arises out of or relates to any use of the Website will be filed only in the state or federal courts located in New York County and you hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action. EACH OF YOU AND HCM HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS WEBSITE OR THIS POLICY.
Commitment to the UK Stewardship Code
Under Rule 2.2.3R of the FCA’s Conduct of Business Sourcebook, Highbridge Capital Management (UK), Ltd. (the “Firm”) is required to disclose the nature of its commitment to the UK Financial Reporting Council’s Stewardship Code (the “Code”) or, where it does not commit to the Code, its alternative investment strategy.  The Code is a voluntary code and sets out a number of principles relating to engagement by investors with UK equity issuers. Investors that commit to the Code can either comply with it in full or choose not to comply with aspects of the Code, in which case they are required to explain their non-compliance.
The Firm and its affiliates pursue a number of strategies across various jurisdictions and do not take an activist shareholder approach. While the Firm generally supports the objectives that underlie the Code, the Firm does not consider it appropriate for the Firm’s investment strategies. If the Firm’s investment strategies change in such a manner that the provisions of the Code become relevant, the Firm will amend this disclosure accordingly.

Overview of the Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment ETF | Direxion


























 






























Why KNOW? Why now?
Since inception, the Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment Shares ETF (Ticker: KNOW) has outperfomed the major U.S. stock indexes including the: S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400, S&P SmallCap 600 and S&P1500 (source: Morningstar Direct). 
It makes sense. Corporate insiders− top officers, boards of directors, and major shareholders − have a natural edge over retail investors, and even financial analysts, because they typically know their businesses and industries better than anyone. That’s why, no matter how much research you do, or how much financial news you consume, you’re always a step behind those “in the know”.
The Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment Shares (KNOW) is designed to help long term-investors pursue better portfolio outcomes by using insider sentiment to seek alpha relative to S&P 500® Index.
With a net expense ratio of just 0.65%, this strategic index-based ETF provides investors with cost-effective access to stocks that corporate officers, directors, and shareholders who own more than 5% of each company’s stock, are accumulating.
This insider sentiment selection uses a screening methodology based on public-company filings and positive earnings analysis that provides the basis for the funds’ quantitatively-weighted indexes. The ETF is comprised of 100 companies selected from the S&P 1500 Index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.65%. The Fund’s Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with the Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse the Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2017, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.65% other than the following: taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions, expenses incurred in connection with any merger or reorganization and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.

Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
