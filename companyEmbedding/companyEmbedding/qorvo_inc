Breaking            
Tech stocks rally, on pace for its best daily climb in 2 weeks
A popular way to bet on the beleaguered technology sector on Friday was on track to post its best one-day gain in about two weeks. The tech-focused Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF  was trading at near its highest, up 1.4%, which would mark its best daily rally since June 19 when the ETF climbed 1.48%, according to FactSet data. Gains in the exchange-traded fund were led by solid advances in shares of Applied Materials Inc. , Seagate Technology Plc.  and Qorvo Inc. , all up at least 3%. The resurgence in tech names, which have seen fitful trade over the past few weeks as questions about lofty valuations plague the sector, was in part helping the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index  to power higher, up 1.1% on the day. Friday's advance also comes after an upbeat  employment report that showed the U.S. added 222,000 jobs in June, representing the second-best job haul this year. Healthy employment combined with muted levels of inflation are being read as underpinning a continued rise for risk assets, including stocks, with an expectation that the Federal Reserve will lift interest rates, increasing borrowing costs for companies, but at a more subdued pace. The S&P 500 index  was up 0.7% at 2,426, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average  was climbing 0.5% at 21,416.

Dow industrials maintain gap support, Nasdaq presses post-FAANG peak
U.S. stocks are slightly higher early Thursday, rising after crude-oil prices nailed a technical target, and subsequently rallied, punctuating a nearly 19% one-month downdraft.  Against this backdrop, the Nasdaq Composite is pressing notable resistance — the post-FAANG peak of 6,243 — while the S&P 500 and Dow industrials continue to digest an early-week break to record territory.
