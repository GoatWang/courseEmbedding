About SYKES
 Real People. Real Solutions.









  




From the beginning, we’ve been focused on the end result.
In an age of faster technology and expanding communication channels, customers are becoming more and more digitally connected, yet paradoxically distanced from the brands they choose to support.
SYKES has thrived for four decades doing one thing exceptionally well: helping people feel like they truly matter.
Headquartered in Tampa, Florida, with customer contact management centers throughout the world, SYKES is a global leader in providing comprehensive customer contact management solutions and services in the business process outsourcing (BPO) arena to Global 2000 companies, primarily in the communications, financial services, technology, healthcare and transportation & leisure industries.
Our differentiated end-to-end service platform effectively engages consumers at every touch point in their customer lifecycle, starting from digital marketing and acquisition to customer support, technical support, up-sell/cross-sell and retention. We provide services through multiple communication channels encompassing phone, e-mail, web, chat, social media and digital self-service.
Science of Service. 
We are a company of many perspectives unified by one goal: To help people, one caring interaction at a time. We believe everyone and every interaction matters. With an “others first” mentality, we serve with thought and heart, owning every moment, working to quickly, simply, and effectively make things better. We listen with our brain and speak from our heart, creating a spirit of trust with our clients and their customers.





  









This year marks our 40th anniversary. Four decades of helping people, one caring interaction at a time.

SYKES Standards of Conduct


 



  




Our History
A Company of People Serving People
In 1977, John H. Sykes founded Sykes Enterprises, Incorporated. While engineering services were the firm’s initial offering, at the core of the company was a passion for providing clients with the best service possible while giving back to the community. Today, this drive to serve others remains part of our DNA, and we believe it is integral to our company’s success.



  




TAKING OUR SERVICE VIRTUE GLOBAL
Setting out on a new course, in 1992, SYKES acquired a small company in Sterling, Colorado. With the acquisition of Jones Technologies, Inc., we entered into the arena of inbound customer support. Having built a solid foundation with existing clients, we soon became very successful in outsourced customer care.
In 1996, SYKES went public and began trading on NASDAQ. This allowed us to grow globally. While we already had an international presence with the opening of our Amsterdam site in 1994, several other acquisitions expanded our European footprint from 1996-1997. These acquisitions included Datasvar Support AB of Sweden; Telcare of Germany, McQueen International Limited and more. We also entered a joint venture with HealthPlan Services Corporate – forming a new venture called SYKES Assistance Services – which took the company to Canada. Within the next few years, acquisitions and the opening of new customer support centers would cement our presence in Latin America. 
In 2010, SYKES acquired ICT Group, Inc and in 2012, we completed another significant acquisition — Alpine Access, Inc. The Alpine Access acquisition created differentiation for our organization in the categories of quality, speed to market, scalability and flexibility, by the integration of home-based agents.
In 2015, we acquired Qelp, a company whose self-service platform delivery model helps our clients create more of an effortless customer experience by serving customers in their channel of choice. Less than a year later, we acquired Clearlink, moving us deeper into digital marketing and in-bound demand generation. The additions of Qelp and Clearlink provide our clients with a unique and differentiated end-to-end global customer interaction management solution.








DEFINING OUR SUCCESS

Headquartered in Tampa, Florida, SYKES excels in delivering comprehensive inbound customer engagement services to Global 2000 companies, primarily in the communications, financial services, healthcare, technology, transportation and retail industries. Our customer service agents serve thousands of customers every day – via multiple channels – and have been recognized for their service excellence. We’re proud to have received awards such as:

SSPA STAR Hall of Fame, Software Support Professionals Association
Service Leader Award, CRM Magazine
Top 100 Most Trustworthy Companies in America, Audit Integrity

We’ve also been recognized for our innovation with such awards as the Recognized Innovator Award (Technology Services Industry Association – formerly SSPA) and 2011 Product of the Year (Customer Interaction Solution Magazine) for its Online Support Communities solution.
Since 1977, We have held fast to our steadfast client commitments and our passion for providing excellent service. And, while our industry recognitions and steady growth have provided solid benchmarks, our true measure of success lies in holding firm to our core principles of providing exceptional customer service and outstanding client value.

We help people, one caring
interaction at a time



  




We provide value-added solutions that drive innovation, ROI, customer engagement, and loyalty.
What makes us a reliable, trusted, and exceptional partner? That’s easy: operational excellence. We’ve invested in the people, processes, and global delivery platform to provide consistent and exceptional experiences at every “moment of truth” throughout the customer journey. Our infrastructure, people, best practices, scalability, and delivery models enable us to comfortably fulfill your brand promise, so you can confidently focus on growing your business.












  




Outsourcing
Our core competency is to free you up to focus on YOUR core competency, as effortlessly and seamlessly as possible. 





Selecting an outsourcing partner is a big deal, but it’s nothing to sweat. It’s an opportunity to achieve excellence in areas that are not likely your company’s core competencies, but are still vitally important to your success. Higher flexibility, adaptability, and scalability are just a few of the advantages. Choosing a partner with experience in implementing and scaling up or down to service a variety of programs, locations, and languages can help increase your customer satisfaction, reduce costs and build brand loyalty.
We help the world’s largest brands build customer loyalty by creating exceptional customer experiences that drive growth and profitability. Industry leaders have relied on us for nearly four decades because we have remained fiercely committed to delivering exceptional service while constantly exploring opportunities for continuous improvements and operational innovation.

Effortless Experience
We provide value-added solutions that drive innovation, ROI, and above all, customer engagement and loyalty. 





Lifecycle management solutions for the digital consumer are becoming increasingly important. Your customers are connecting with you in more ways than ever before. But are you truly connecting with them?
The reality is that the funnel has flipped. What used to be a one-way-in scenario, via phone, has now broadened to include email, chat, social channels, smart phones and more. And you must be prepared to handle it all.
While more and more customers are appreciating the speed and efficiency of finding answers online versus calling, those who do call need a higher level of engagement (cue our highly trained agents). These calls can strengthen loyalty and increase upsell opportunities.

Service to Sales
We help the world’s largest brands build customer loyalty by creating exceptional customer experiences that drive growth and profitability.





Every interaction is an opportunity to deepen your relationship with customers, driving additional value and revenue potential. But capitalizing on these moments takes care and focus. Our team of customer engagement specialists understand the importance of each interaction and are masters at building and retaining loyalty during key moments of truth. We’re able to better understand consumer profiles and behavior and deliver a selling model that works in a service environment.
By combining data, analytics, and technology to help identify high-value customers, we’re able to strengthen existing customer relationships with up-selling and cross-selling experience. Our proven approach can help you get exactly what you want: boosted conversion rates, superior customer satisfaction, increased customer retention, and ultimately, higher revenue.

Extend Your Brand
We help to deliver an optimal customer experience at each and every service or sales touchpoint. 





So how does customer experience impact brand loyalty? Making customers feel valued, appreciated, and confident drives loyalty and helps you extend your brand.
The challenge: Today’s customers expect to be recognized across every channel. So the company that proactively identifies and utilizes new ideas, trends, insights and technology best, wins.
We specialize in the entire customer journey from piquing initial interest to nurturing leads to making the sale. With fresh insight and strategic advice, we can help you discover opportunities and execute transformation big or small for a greater competitive advantage.

Our Four Key Verticals





In a rapidly changing industry, we deliver peace-of-mind assistance with a human touch. We help our healthcare industry clients reduce costs while advancing patient care.






Healthcare Providers


SYKES helps hospitals centralize practice management to improve patient access to doctors and resources. By rectifying labor shortages, improving resource utilization, and effectively managing the revenue cycle, we focus on patient experience and satisfaction, while enabling health systems to become more efficient and cost-effective. Through careful physician referral, patient registration, and emerging health delivery models, SYKES assists our healthcare clients with providing the right care in the right setting.


Life Sciences


SYKES is a trusted partner for medical-device suppliers, helping manage customer-support operations to their advantage. With decades of experience in providing expert technical support, we offer a wide range of services to manufacturers of ethical, over-the-counter, medical device, and other FDA-regulated medical products. Whether it’s urgent product recalls or fielding frequently asked questions, SYKES improves customer retention by cementing patient confidence in your brands.






Telehealth & Care Management 


Consumers today expect “at the touch of a button” service, and medical care at a distance is included in that expectation. At SYKES, we have been supporting people across many different communications channels for more than 20 years. Starting with registered nurses in call centers and now utilizing nurses, coaches, and other providers on the phone, over the Internet or via email, video, or mobile device, we have helped more than 16 million people to navigate the healthcare system. Our Telehealth services improves patient access, reduces unnecessary visits to physicians’ offices and hospitals, and improves the satisfaction of providers and users alike.


Payers


When it comes to selecting an insurance plan, today’s informed consumers have more options than ever before. Customer satisfaction and administrative efficiency are critical to health insurers who are challenged to create more satisfying member experiences at lower cost. SYKES provides leading health plans with scalable, flexible, high-quality, member-support services that reduce administrative costs. Our friendly service professionals also help increase member retention by providing plan-selection assistance over flexible support channels.






  










Industry Expertise & Key Differentiators





With extensive experience serving Healthcare Providers, Payers, Life Sciences,  and Telehealth clients, we deliver peace-of-mind assistance with a human touch. We focus on reducing client costs while providing advanced population health management solutions.



  





Increased Access
We deliver patient life-cycle engagement solutions across channels to improve patient experience and reduce costs.









Expert Knowledge & Support
Our solutions focus on providing easy access to information, coaching services, and care coordination to improve patient engagement.









Award-Winning Analytics 
Our analytics suite improves CMS star ratings, increases adherence, and utilizes predictive modelling to proactively achieve performance efficiencies.









OUTCOMES-Focused
From quality assurance to population health management, we have re-engineered our processes to focus on  driving better patient outcomes.








  




Increased satisfaction for insurance customers across support channels





Our 24/7 assistance solutions enable our healthcare industry partners to deliver optimal care throughout the entire patient life-cycle.





With the implementation of the healthcare reform mandate, it has become increasingly important for physicians, hospital systems, outpatient centers, and other healthcare providers to deliver improved patient care while reducing wait times and costs.

About SYKES
 Real People. Real Solutions.









  




From the beginning, we’ve been focused on the end result.

We provide services through multiple communication channels encompassing phone, e-mail, web, chat, social media and digital self-service.
Science of Service.

SYKES Standards of Conduct


 



  




Our History
A Company of People Serving People
In 1977, John H. Sykes founded Sykes Enterprises, Incorporated. While engineering services were the firm’s initial offering, at the core of the company was a passion for providing clients with the best service possible while giving back to the community. Today, this drive to serve others remains part of our DNA, and we believe it is integral to our company’s success.



  




TAKING OUR SERVICE VIRTUE GLOBAL
Setting out on a new course, in 1992, SYKES acquired a small company in Sterling, Colorado. With the acquisition of Jones Technologies, Inc., we entered into the arena of inbound customer support. Having built a solid foundation with existing clients, we soon became very successful in outsourced customer care.
In 1996, SYKES went public and began trading on NASDAQ. This allowed us to grow globally. While we already had an international presence with the opening of our Amsterdam site in 1994, several other acquisitions expanded our European footprint from 1996-1997. These acquisitions included Datasvar Support AB of Sweden; Telcare of Germany, McQueen International Limited and more. We also entered a joint venture with HealthPlan Services Corporate – forming a new venture called SYKES Assistance Services – which took the company to Canada. Within the next few years, acquisitions and the opening of new customer support centers would cement our presence in Latin America. 
In 2010, SYKES acquired ICT Group, Inc and in 2012, we completed another significant acquisition — Alpine Access, Inc. The Alpine Access acquisition created differentiation for our organization in the categories of quality, speed to market, scalability and flexibility, by the integration of home-based agents.
In 2015, we acquired Qelp, a company whose self-service platform delivery model helps our clients create more of an effortless customer experience by serving customers in their channel of choice. Less than a year later, we acquired Clearlink, moving us deeper into digital marketing and in-bound demand generation. The additions of Qelp and Clearlink provide our clients with a unique and differentiated end-to-end global customer interaction management solution.








DEFINING OUR SUCCESS

Headquartered in Tampa, Florida, SYKES excels in delivering comprehensive inbound customer engagement services to Global 2000 companies, primarily in the communications, financial services, healthcare, technology, transportation and retail industries. Our customer service agents serve thousands of customers every day – via multiple channels – and have been recognized for their service excellence. We’re proud to have received awards such as:

SSPA STAR Hall of Fame, Software Support Professionals Association
Service Leader Award, CRM Magazine
Top 100 Most Trustworthy Companies in America, Audit Integrity

We’ve also been recognized for our innovation with such awards as the Recognized Innovator Award (Technology Services Industry Association – formerly SSPA) and 2011 Product of the Year (Customer Interaction Solution Magazine) for its Online Support Communities solution.
Since 1977, We have held fast to our steadfast client commitments and our passion for providing excellent service. And, while our industry recognitions and steady growth have provided solid benchmarks, our true measure of success lies in holding firm to our core principles of providing exceptional customer service and outstanding client value.

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in California:













Does Enterprises Inc carry a valid contracting license?



In California, any remodeling or construction project that exceeds $500 (labor and materials), requires a contractor to have an active license with the California Contractor State License Board (CSLB).
Enterprises Inc currently holds license 253591, 446990, 496138 (General Building Contractor, Painting And Decorating, Contractor, General), which was Active when we last checked.











How important is contractor licensing in California?



The CSLB is one of the highest rated licensing boards in the US. Applicants are required to pass a written board exam and prove at least four years of prior, relevant work experience. In addition, the CSLB requires all license holders to maintain at least $2,500 in operating capital and provides you with a range of other consumer protections.











Your liability risk when hiring Enterprises Inc



Contractors in California are required to carry workers' compensation insurance if they have employees and proof of liability insurance with the cumulative limit of $1 million for licensees with five or fewer persons, and an additional 100,000 for each additional member over five, not to exceed $5 million total.











Financial recourse when hiring Enterprises Inc



All licensed contractors in California are required to maintain a bond, which provides you with financial recourse in case they perform defective work or violate license regulations. If you feel as though you have been taken advantage of, you should leave feedback on the contractor's BuildZoom profile and file a complaint with the CSLB.
Enterprises Inc has a $12,500 bond with Old Republic Surety Company. 











What else should I know before hiring Enterprises Inc



California contractors are required to submit their fingerprints to the board, which are then checked against criminal records held by the California Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) prior to obtaining a valid contracting license.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The California State License Board recommends getting at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

BuildZoom = Happy Customers




I used BuildZoom to add solar panels to my house. BuildZoom matched me with two highly rated, experienced
pros. I took the lower bid, and have been extremely happy with the result. I plan to use them for all
future projects.


I used BuildZoom to remodel my bathroom and kitchen, and it was the best contractor experience I've ever
had. They not only find great contractors, but they add an extra layer of accountability that goes a long way.


As a custom home builder who takes pride in his work, I love being on this site. It allows me to more
easily build a trust relationship with potential customers, because they can easily see my work history.
