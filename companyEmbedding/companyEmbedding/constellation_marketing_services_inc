Cognitive Dissonance and Influence Marketing | Constellation Research Inc.

Cognitive Dissonance and Influence Marketing



By Sam Fiorella



 












Despite social proof casting doubt on their veracity, it seems that social scoring platforms continue to be popular in social media marketing. We shouldn’t be surprised; these tools offer a quick, if not effective, means of identifying those who might help brand messages cut through the growing online noise.  Despite this, I’m still rather optimistic on the future of influence marketing. I’ve been pleased with the changes I’ve noted while presenting our book and its methodology to clients and general audiences at conferences this past year.While slow, there’s definitely recognition that audience segmentation and customer decision-making processes are largely ignored by marketers and platforms seeking to use influence marketing as a key business development strategy.The Next Level of Influence – Cognitive DissonanceA premise that seems to resonate well with audiences exploring true influence marketing is the concept of cognitive dissonance, which social scientists explain as a feeling of discomfort that results from holding two conflicting beliefs.In terms of influence marketing we can think of it this way: What transpires in the minds of potential consumers when a product recommendation offered by socially popular personalities or media outlets, conflicts with preconceived notations or previous experiences with that product?Similarly, what occurs in the purchase decision process when online social recommendations conflict with the consumer’s social, political, or religious views?A popular example is cigarette marketing during the 1960s, which positioned smoking as healthy when early medical evidence demonstrated a link between smoking and cancer.This is a good example of cognitive dissonance: Through various media channels, celebrities were used to advocate the smoking of cigarettes, yet consumers were – often subconsciously – aware that cigarettes were bad for their health.  A conflict existed. Similarly, we can look to those advocating boycotts of brands like Chic-fil-A for speaking out against gay rights. The desire to eat at the popular fast food establishment may conflict with moral, social, and political views in many.Which conflicting side wins when consumers make a decision, and how do marketers use influence marketing to sway those decisions?Creating Cognitive DissonanceIt’s important to note that often the dissonance that exists in consumers’ minds is created by conflicting social commentary or opposing recommendations. A prime example is the battle occurring between Android and iOS mobile operating systems.Consumers are faced with conflicting messages from influencers, media, and advertising that promote one over the other. Consumers, whose personal preferences and experiences match those shared by a large online community, find their decision-making process conflicted when faced with overwhelming social advocacy for the alternative.When marketers understand the logistics of cognitive dissonance, it can be used as an effective marketing strategy.For example, Android-based mobile phone manufacturers can use monitoring software and natural language processing to discover online conversations that would indicate which groups of consumers are experiencing cognitive dissonance that would negatively affect purchase decisions to their favor.From this base, marketers can realign both content marketing and influencer identification efforts to support those whose decision to buy an Android-based device is conflicted or to insert conflict into the decision-making process of those whose instinct is to purchase an iOS-based device.Understanding the effects of cognitive dissonance on consumer behavior is a new frontier for influence marketing and can be used offensively as well as defensively.Managing Existing CustomersOf course, this dissonance occurs post-purchase as well, and so it’s critical to apply this thinking to existing customers. Just as prospects experience cognitive dissonance when making a purchase decision, social science and psychology has proven the concept of “buyer’s remorse” in customers.Most consumers experience some cognitive dissonance, even if just momentarily, after purchasing a product.“Did I make the right decision?”“Did I shop around enough?”“Was there a better price available elsewhere?”The existence of this conflict can be damaging towards a brand’s efforts to build repeat business and brand advocates. We discuss this in Influence Marketing:Influence marketing is often relegated to customer acquisition efforts, yet the need to create advocates and social proof around a brand necessitates better engagement with existing customers. Identifying cognitive dissonance in existing customers allows marketers to pinpoint the micro-influencers that may help alleviate the tension and sway their belief towards a feeling of satisfaction with the purchase and possibly even advocacy. Left alone, consumers with these feelings may return the product, or worse, turn to social channels to complain about it. The returns and online negativity can be curbed when true influence marketing techniques are applied to this consumer segment.Be it defensive or offensive sales strategy, or customer satisfaction efforts, the use of influence marketing to offset cognitive dissonance in prospects and customers is a science that marketers must quickly become adept at.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
