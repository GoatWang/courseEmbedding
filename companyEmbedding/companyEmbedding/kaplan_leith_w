WAYS TO SAVE TIME AND MONEY
We offer five ways to lower the cost of tuition and get you to graduation sooner. 


Transfer Credits
Scholarships
Eligible Work, Life, and Military Experience
Testing Out of Courses
Tuition Cap Programs







Maximize the credits you've already earned.
If you’re on a bachelor’s track, you may be able to transfer your entire associate’s degree from qualifying institutions into eligible programs. You could be halfway finished on your first day of class. 

Apply for our Every Credit Counts Scholarship.
If you have at least one prior college credit, you could save $500 per term on your bachelor’s or associate's degree. 

Earn credits for your real-world experience.
Turn your life experiences into college credits with our portfolio development course—and finish your undergraduate degree faster. Kaplan University also recognizes military training as potential college credit. 

Test out of courses in subjects you’ve already mastered.
Don’t repeat what you already know. Demonstrate proficiency through one of our many course assessments to earn college credit. 

Explore our Tuition Cap programs.
For some Kaplan University degrees, we limit your tuition so you never pay more than a set maximum for your education. Once you reach your tuition cap, you no longer have to make payments. You could save up to 33% off full tuition.

WAYS TO SAVE TIME AND MONEY
We offer five ways to lower the cost of tuition and get you to graduation sooner. 


Transfer Credits
Scholarships
Eligible Work, Life, and Military Experience
Testing Out of Courses
Tuition Cap Programs







Maximize the credits you've already earned.
If you’re on a bachelor’s track, you may be able to transfer your entire associate’s degree from qualifying institutions into eligible programs. You could be halfway finished on your first day of class. 

Apply for our Every Credit Counts Scholarship.
If you have at least one prior college credit, you could save $500 per term on your bachelor’s or associate's degree. 

Earn credits for your real-world experience.
Turn your life experiences into college credits with our portfolio development course—and finish your undergraduate degree faster. Kaplan University also recognizes military training as potential college credit. 

Test out of courses in subjects you’ve already mastered.
Don’t repeat what you already know. Demonstrate proficiency through one of our many course assessments to earn college credit. 

Explore our Tuition Cap programs.
For some Kaplan University degrees, we limit your tuition so you never pay more than a set maximum for your education. Once you reach your tuition cap, you no longer have to make payments. You could save up to 33% off full tuition.
