Merchants Bancshares Named Top Dividend Stock With Insider Buying and 3.76% Yield (MBVT)
In this series, we look through the most recent Dividend Channel ''DividendRank'' report, and then we cherry pick only those companies that have experienced insider buying within the past six months. The officers and directors of a company tend to have a unique insider's view of the business, and presumably the only reason an insider would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money — maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both.

Readers should not place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. These forward-looking statements are based on current plans and expectations, which are subject to a number of risk factors and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ materially from historical performance or future expectations. These differences may be the result of various factors, including, among others: (1) costs or difficulties related to the integration of the business following the merger; (2) changes in general, national or regional economic conditions; (3) the anticipated benefits and cost savings from the merger may not be fully realized or may take longer than expected to realize; (4) diversion of management resources to merger-related or integration issues; (5) the reaction to the merger on the part of NUVO customers and the banking public more generally in Western Massachusetts; (6) changes in loan default and charge-off rates; (7) changes in interest rates or credit availability; (8) changes in government regulation; (9) changes in levels of income and expense in non-interest income and expense related activities; and (10) competition and its effect on pricing, spending, third-party relationships and revenues. The foregoing list should not be construed as exhaustive, and Merchants undertakes no obligation to subsequently revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements, or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances.
For additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements, please refer to the filings by Merchants with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including its periodic and current reports, and to the proxy statement/prospectus included in Merchants' Registration Statement on Form S-4 relating to the merger, which are available on the SEC's website, at www.sec.gov.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
