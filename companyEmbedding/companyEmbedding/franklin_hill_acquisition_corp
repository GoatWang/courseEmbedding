FRANKLIN
HILL ACQUISITION CORPORATION 

Notes to
Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements

 

NOTE 1
NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES

 

NATURE OF
OPERATIONS

 

Franklin
Hill Acquisition Corporation (the “Company”) was
incorporated on December 11, 2015 under the laws of the state of
Delaware to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking, including,
but not limited to, selected mergers and acquisitions. The Company
has been in the developmental stage since inception and its
operations to date have been limited to issuing shares to its
original shareholders. The Company will attempt to locate and
negotiate with a business entity for the combination of that target
company with Franklin Hill. The combination will normally take the
form of a merger, stock-for-stock exchange or stock-for-assets
exchange.

 

In most
instances the target company will wish to structure the business
combination to be within the definition of a tax-free
reorganization under Section 351 or Section 368 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. No assurances can be given that
the Company will be successful in locating or negotiating with any
target company. The Company has been formed to provide a method for
a foreign or domestic private company to become a reporting company
with a class of securities registered under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934.

 

BASIS OF
PRESENTATION

 

The
summary of significant accounting policies presented below is
designed to assist in understanding the Company’s unaudited
condensed financial statements. Such unaudited condensed financial
statements and accompanying notes are the representations of the
Company’s management, who are responsible for their integrity
and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(“GAAP”) in all material respects, and have been
consistently applied in preparing the accompanying unaudited
condensed financial statements.

 

Certain
information and footnote disclosures normally present in annual
financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(“U.S. GAAP”) were omitted pursuant to such rules and
regulations. The results for the nine months ended

September
30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results to be
expected for the year ending December 31, 2016.

 

USE OF
ESTIMATES

 

The
preparation of unaudited condensed financial statements in
conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the condensed financial statements, and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

CASH AND
CASH EQUIVALENTS

 

Cash and
cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit at banking
institutions as well as all highly liquid short-term investments
with original maturities of 90 days or less. Cash and cash
equivalents amounted to $50 and $0 as of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015.

 

 

CONCENTRATION
OF RISK

 

Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations
of credit risk consist principally of cash. The Company places its
cash with high quality banking institutions. The Company did not
have cash balances in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation limit as of September 30, 2016.

 

INCOME
TAXES

 

Under ASC
740, “Income Taxes,” deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to temporary differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are
established when it is more likely than not that some or all of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of September 30, 2016
there were no deferred taxes due to the uncertainty of the
realization of net operating loss or carry forward prior to
expiration.

 

LOSS PER
COMMON SHARE

 

Basic loss
per common share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net
loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted loss per common share reflect the
potential dilution that could occur if securities or other
contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into
common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then
shared in the loss of the entity. As of September 30, 2016, there
are no outstanding dilutive securities.

 

FAIR VALUE
OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

 

The
Company follows guidance for accounting for fair value measurements
of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value
measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed
at fair value in the unaudited condensed financial statements on a
recurring basis. Additionally, the Company adopted guidance for
fair value measurement related to nonfinancial items that are
recognized and disclosed at fair value in the unaudited condensed
financial statements on a nonrecurring basis. The guidance
establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to
valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy
gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements)
and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant
unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the
fair value hierarchy are as follows:

 

Level 1
inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to
access at the measurement date.

 

 

 




 



6



 




  

 

Level 2
inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1
that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or
indirectly.

 

Level 3
inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. The
carrying amounts of financial assets such as cash approximate their
fair values because of the short maturity of these
instruments.

 

RECENT
ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

 

On
November 20, 2015, FASB issued ASU-2015-17-Income Taxes. The Board
is issuing this Update as part of its initiative to reduce
complexity in accounting standards (the Simplification Initiative).
The objective of the Simplification Initiative is to identify,
evaluate, and improve areas of generally accepted accounting
principles (GAAP) for which cost and complexity can be reduced
while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information
provided to users of financial statements. Current GAAP requires an
entity to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into
current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of
financial position. To simplify the presentation of deferred income
taxes, the amendments in this Update require that deferred tax
liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified
statement of financial position. The amendments in this Update
apply to all entities that present a classified statement of
financial position. The current requirement that deferred tax
liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of an entity be
offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by the
amendments in this Update. For public business entities, the
amendments in this Update are effective for financial statements
issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and
interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is
permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or
annual reporting period. The Company is still in the process of
evaluating future impact of adopting this standard. Management
believes that the impact of this ASU to the Company’s
financial statements would be insignificant.

 

In August
2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, “Statement of Cash
Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash
Payments, to address diversity in how certain cash receipts and
cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash
flows”. The amendments provide guidance on the following
eight specific cash flow issues: (1) Debt Prepayment or Debt
Extinguishment Costs; (2) Settlement of Zero-Coupon Debt
Instruments or Other Debt Instruments with Coupon Interest Rates
That Are Insignificant in Relation to the Effective Interest Rate
of the Borrowing; (3) Contingent Consideration Payments Made after
a Business Combination; (4)Proceeds from the Settlement of
Insurance Claims; (5) Proceeds from the Settlement of
Corporate-Owned Life Insurance Policies, including Bank-Owned; (6)
Life Insurance Policies; (7) Distributions Received from Equity
Method Investees; (8) Beneficial Interests in Securitization
Transactions; and Separately Identifiable Cash Flows and
Application of the Predominance Principle. The amendments are
effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal
years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an
interim period. The amendments should be applied using a
retrospective transition method to each period presented. If it is
impracticable to apply the amendments retrospectively for some of
the issues, the amendments for those issues would be applied
prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. The Company is
currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on its
consolidated financial statements and related
disclosures.

The Company will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the Shares.


The real estate management and consulting services sector in Southeast Asia is
mature in some regions, relatively new in others, and in general represents a
rapidly evolving industry. If the Company’s business model proves to be
inappropriate or suboptimal, or if barriers to entry in certain regions prove
too high, or if new competitors emerge to better serve the real estate industry,
the Company’s business may be materially and adversely affected. What’s more,
the Company will face competition from a number of property management companies
operating in the Asia Pacific region. Among the most prominent competitors is
Keppel Corporation, a property management firm based in Singapore. Nonetheless,
the Company’s market intelligence will identify specific lucrative new
developments in Asia and utilization of management expertise shall enable the
Company to withstand competition.


Company Description
Franklin Hill Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware Corporation, currently has
minimal operations and as such it is considered a "shell company". At this time
the Company is a global property management company focusing on management of
retail and commercial properties in the Asia Pacific region. The


 Company aims to
increase the value of its retail properties by offering expertise in building
appraisal and advisory services, facilities management, lease administration,
maintenance and related services. The Company’s management believes it holds a
number of advantages in these business channels that will help its clientele
operate in a cost-effective manner and expand in their respective markets.
---

The Company is initially focusing on exploitation of the Southeast Asia markets
and the Pacific Rim. The Company aims to increase the value of retail properties
in this region by offering expertise in building appraisal and advisory
services, facilities management, lease administration, and maintenance services.
The Company believes to hold several advantages in these business channels
relative to existing competition based upon the experience of its management, as
Ms. Khoo has several years of experience leading property management project and
expansion of shopping complexes in Malaysia. In addition, as a Malaysian
national, Ms. Khoo believes to have a better understanding of ASEAN market
demands then some of her competitors.

The Company intends to operate as a one-stop shop to better service its
prospective clients and reduce their fixed costs for hire of a management team,
administration staff, and similar services. The Company intends to service its
clients by absorbing these costs on behalf of their clients, enabling their
prospective clients to purchase lease administration services, facilities
management, and maintenance services from one service provider. The Company will
subsequently outsource certain tasks to third party service providers, depending
upon location and nature of services to be provided. Ms. Khoo intends to utilize
her relationships within the industry and ASEAN markets to to save on these
third party services and pass savings on to the Company’s client base.

For the first twelve months of operation, or until the Company has generated
funds sufficient to hire staff, equipment, and other assets necessary to perform
business services in-house, the Company will at the outset utilize the existing
relationships of its owner, Ms. Khoo, to outsource its projects to third-party
vendors who will offer facilities management, leasing, maintenance and related
services to the Company at a discounted market rate. The Company intends to pass
these savings on to its client base, and generate profit and brand recognition
therefrom. The Company intends to use paid-up capital of its securities to
advance costs associated with this plan, for items including marketing and
travel expenses and other operating expenses. If no such funds are obtained, the
Company will seek out debt financing or other instruments to fund operations
prior to profitability.

Over time the Company intends to hire employees and offer services such as lease
administration, property management and maintenance in-house. The Company
anticipates becoming fully staffed for in-house operations within three years
after consummation of business activities and operations.
---

The Company was incorporated in the State of Delaware in December 2015.

The Company is located at Suite 12A 03-05, Level 12A, Plaza Permata, Jalan
Kampar Off Jalan Tun Razak, 50400 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The Company’s main
phone number is (310) 888-1870.

	PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT




	(To Prospectus Dated October 3, 2014)



	 






	$500,000,000 4.750% Senior Notes due 2021



	 



	 



	This is an offering of $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of our 4.750% senior notes due 2021 (the Notes). The Notes will
	mature on April 1, 2021. We will pay interest on the Notes on April 1 and October 1 of each year, commencing October 1, 2016, and at maturity.


	We may redeem some or all of the Notes at any time (i) prior to the date that is 60 days prior to the scheduled maturity date of the Notes
	at a make-whole price as described in this prospectus supplement under the caption Description of NotesRedemption at Our Option and (ii) on or after the date that is 60 days prior to the scheduled maturity date of
	the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus, in either case, accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes to the redemption date. The Notes will not have the benefit of any sinking fund. The Notes will be our
	senior unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equally with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness, senior to any of our future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, and
	effectively junior to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing that indebtedness. When the Notes are issued, they will be guaranteed by all of our wholly-owned (i.e., directly or indirectly 100% owned)
	subsidiaries (other than our finance company subsidiaries, our foreign subsidiaries and certain other subsidiaries, all as described herein). The guarantees by all subsidiaries that are guaranteeing the Notes at any time are or will be full and
	unconditional and joint and several while they are in effect. The guarantee by any subsidiary may be suspended or released under certain circumstances. See Description of NotesThe Guarantees.


	Upon a Change of Control Triggering Event, we will be required to make an offer to repurchase all the outstanding Notes at a price in cash equal
	to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the repurchase date.


	For a more
	complete description of the Notes, see the Description of Notes section of this prospectus supplement. The Notes are a new issue of securities and there currently is no established trading market for the Notes. We do not intend to apply
	to list the Notes on any securities exchange or to include them in any automated quotation system. It is possible that no active trading market for the Notes will develop, or that if it develops, it will not be maintained.


	 



	 




	Investing in the Notes involves significant risk. See the section entitled 

	Risk Factors

	 in our Annual Report on Form
	10-K for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2015, which is incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement, and the risks described in the other documents incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying
	prospectus. Also see the section entitled 


	Risk Factors


	 beginning on page S-5 of this prospectus supplement.




	Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved these securities or determined
	whether this prospectus supplement is truthful or complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

	SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS



	This prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus, including the documents incorporated herein and therein by reference, contain
	forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements concern expectations, beliefs, projections, plans and strategies, anticipated events or trends and similar
	expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts. These statements are often preceded by or include the words believe, expect, intend, estimate, anticipate, will,
	may, could, should or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements contained herein may include opinions formed based upon general observations, anecdotal evidence and industry experience, but that are not
	supported by specific investigation or analysis. The forward-looking statements in this prospectus supplement and the documents incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement include statements regarding: our belief that the housing market
	will continue its steady and slow recovery, and our belief regarding the drivers of such recovery; our belief that we will continue to see lower margins in 2016 compared to 2015; our belief that we are currently positioned to deliver between 26,500
	and 27,000 homes in fiscal 2016; our expectation that we will continue to identify and invest in unique and enticing land opportunities that we expect will drive our future growth and profitability; our expectation that our ancillary business will
	provide opportunities to enhance shareholder value; our belief that our main driver of earnings will continue to be our Lennar Homebuilding (Homebuilding) and Lennar Financial Services (Financial Services) operations; our
	belief that the Lennar Multifamily segments revenues will continue to grow in the future and our expectation that the Lennar Multifamily business will be profitable in 2016; our belief that we are on track to achieve another year of
	substantial profitability in fiscal 2016; our intent to settle the face value of the 2.75% convertible senior notes due 2020 in cash; our expectation regarding variability in our quarterly results; our expectations regarding the renewal or
	replacement of our warehouse facilities; our belief regarding draws upon our bonds or letters of credit, and our belief regarding the impact to the Company if there were such a draw; our expectation that substantially all homes currently in backlog
	will be delivered in fiscal year 2016; our belief that our operations and borrowing resources will provide for our current and long-term capital requirements at our anticipated levels of activity; our belief regarding legal proceedings in which we
	are involved, and, in particular, our belief that the Courts decision in the Settlers Crossing case (as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year ended November 30, 2015) is contrary to applicable law; and our estimates
	regarding certain tax and accounting matters, including our expectations regarding the result of anticipated settlements with various taxing authorities.


	These forward-looking statements reflect our current views about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. We

	expressed in any forward-looking statement. The most important factors that could prevent us from achieving our goals, and cause the assumptions underlying forward-looking statements and the
	actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by those forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following: our ability to acquire land and pursue real estate opportunities at anticipated prices;
	increases in operating costs, including costs related to real estate taxes, construction materials, labor and insurance, and our ability to manage our cost structure, both in our Homebuilding and Lennar Multifamily businesses; unfavorable outcomes
	in legal proceedings that substantially exceed our expectations, including an unfavorable outcome in the Settlers Crossing case; a slowdown in the recovery of real estate markets across the nation, or any downturn in such markets; changes in general
	economic and financial conditions, and demographic trends, in the U.S. leading to decreased demand for our services and homes, lower profit margins and reduced access to credit; the possibility that we will incur nonrecurring costs that may not have
	a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition, but may have a material adverse effect on our condensed financial statements for a particular reporting period; decreased demand for our Lennar Multifamily rental properties, and our
	ability to successfully sell our rental properties once rents and occupancies have stabilized; the ability of our Financial Services segment to maintain or increase its capture rate and benefit from Lennar home deliveries; increased competition for
	home sales from other sellers of new and resale homes; conditions in the capital, credit and financial markets, including mortgage lending standards, the availability of mortgage financing and mortgage foreclosure rates; changes in interest and
	unemployment rates, and inflation; a decline in the value of the land and home inventories we maintain or possible future write-downs of the carrying value of our real estate assets; our ability to successfully develop multifamily assets in the
	Lennar Multifamily Venture; our inability to maintain anticipated pricing levels and our inability to predict the effect of interest rates on demand; the ability and willingness of the participants in various joint ventures to honor their
	commitments; our ability to successfully and timely obtain land-use entitlements and construction financing, and address issues that arise in connection with the use and development of our land; natural disasters and other unforeseen damage for
	which our insurance may not provide adequate coverage; our inability to successfully grow our ancillary businesses; potential liability under environmental or construction laws, or other laws or regulations affecting our business; regulatory changes
	that adversely affect the profitability of our businesses; our ability to comply with the terms of our debt instruments, our ability to refinance our debt on terms that are acceptable to us; and our ability to successfully estimate the impact of
	certain regulatory, accounting and tax matters.


	The list of risks above is not exhaustive. New risk factors emerge from time to time and
	it is not possible for management to predict all risks that might affect our business or the Notes. Nothing in this prospectus supplement is intended to give assurance regarding our future results or achievements. You should not place undue reliance
	on the forward-looking statements contained or incorporated in this prospectus supplement, which speaks only as of its date.


	Please see

	publicly revise any forward-looking statements in this prospectus supplement or in filings we have made with the SEC to reflect events or circumstances after the date of those statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated
	events, except to the extent we are legally required to disclose certain matters in SEC filings or otherwise.

	Lennar
	Corporation



	We are one of the nations largest homebuilders, a provider of real estate related financial services, a commercial
	real estate investment, investment management and finance company through our Rialto segment (Rialto) and a developer of multifamily rental properties in select U.S. markets primarily through unconsolidated entities. Our homebuilding
	operations include the construction and sale of single-family attached and detached homes, as well as the purchase, development and sale of residential land directly and through unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. We conduct
	homebuilding activities in various states, with our largest homebuilding operations in Florida, Texas and California.


	We also provide
	mortgage financing, title insurance and closing services for both buyers of our homes and others. Substantially all of the residential mortgage loans that we originate are sold within a short period in the secondary mortgage market on a servicing
	released, non-recourse basis. After the loans are sold, we retain potential liability for possible claims by purchasers that we breached certain limited industry-standard representations and warranties in the loan sale agreements. Our financial
	services segment operates generally in the same states as our homebuilding operations, as well as in other states.


	The Rialto segment is
	a commercial real estate investment, investment management, and finance company. Rialtos primary focus is to manage third-party capital and to originate and sell into securitizations commercial mortgage loans. It also has invested its own
	capital in mortgage loans, properties and real estate related securities. Rialto is the sponsor of, and an investor in, several investment funds that invest in real estate related assets. It also has a subsidiary that originates commercial first
	mortgage loans, generally with principal amounts between $2 million and $75 million, and sells them into securitizations.


	Since 2012, we
	have been actively involved, primarily through unconsolidated entities, in the development of multifamily rental properties. The Lennar Multifamily segment focuses on developing a geographically diversified portfolio of institutional quality
	multifamily rental properties in select U.S. markets (Multifamily).


	We also conduct certain operations through our FivePoint
	Communities venture, a consolidated joint venture that was formed to manage master planned mixed use developments.


	For additional
	information, see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2015.


	We are a Delaware corporation founded
	in 1954. Our principal offices are at 700 Northwest 107th Avenue, Miami, Florida 33172. Our telephone number at these offices is (305) 559-4000. Our website address is www.lennar.com. The information on our website is not part of this
	prospectus supplement or the accompanying prospectus.

	The Offering




	The summary below describes the principal terms of the Notes. Certain of the terms and conditions described below are subject to
	limitations and exceptions. The Description of Notes section of this prospectus supplement contains a more detailed description of the terms and conditions of the Notes. You should read the entire prospectus supplement and the
	accompanying prospectus carefully before making an investment in the Notes.




	With respect to the discussion of the terms of the
	Notes on the cover page, in this section and in the section entitled Description of Notes, references to the Company, us, we and our refer only to Lennar Corporation and not to any of its
	subsidiaries.



	 





	Issuer



	Lennar Corporation, a Delaware corporation.




	 





	Securities Offered



	$500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 4.750% senior notes due 2021.




	 







	Maturity Date



	April 1, 2021.




	 





	Interest Rate



	The Notes will bear interest at 4.750% per year (calculated using a

	360-day

	year composed of twelve 30-day months). Interest will accrue from March 4, 2016.




	 





	Interest Payment Dates



	April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on October 1, 2016, payable to holders of record at the close of business on the March 15 or September 15, as the case may be, immediately preceding each interest payment date. Interest will
	also be payable on the Maturity Date.





	 







	Sinking Fund



	None.




	 





	Ranking



	The Notes will be our senior, unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and will rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness that is outstanding from time-to-time, senior to any of our future indebtedness
	that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, and effectively junior to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing that indebtedness. The Notes are structurally subordinated to all existing
	and future obligations (including borrowings and trade payables) of our subsidiaries that are not then guaranteeing the Notes. See Description of NotesThe Guarantees. See also Risk FactorsBecause the Notes are
	structurally subordinated to the obligations of our non-guarantor subsidiaries, your ability to be repaid may be adversely affected to the extent particular subsidiaries are not guaranteeing the Notes at a time when you become entitled to
	repayment and The fact that the Notes are unsecured may increase the possibility that you will not be fully repaid if we become insolvent.





	 




	 


	As of November 30, 2015, our subsidiaries had $1.9 billion of indebtedness, including $1.5 billion of secured indebtedness. Of this amount, $1.6 billion ($1.2 billion of secured indebtedness) was indebtedness of
	subsidiaries that will not be guaranteeing the Notes when they are issued. As of November 30, 2015, the secured debt of our subsidiaries and the unsecured debt of our non guarantor subsidiaries totaled $1.9 billion.

	Guarantees



	All of our existing and future wholly-owned (i.e., directly or indirectly 100% owned) subsidiaries (other than finance company subsidiaries and foreign subsidiaries) that directly or indirectly guarantee at least $75 million of our indebtedness
	will guarantee the Notes. The guarantees by all the subsidiaries that are guaranteeing the Notes at any time are or will be full and unconditional and joint and several. To the extent these guarantees are effective when the Notes are issued, or
	become effective after that, they may subsequently be suspended or released under limited circumstances. At the date of this prospectus supplement, all of our wholly-owned subsidiaries (other than our subsidiaries that (1) engage in the mortgage
	banking business, (2) own, finance, manage or service real estate assets (i.e., the subsidiaries in our Rialto segment), (3) engage in the development, investment and management of commercial or mixed use properties, (4) engage in the development,
	investment and management of multi-family rental properties, (5) engage in the installation, development, ownership, servicing, sale or lease of solar power systems or sale of solar power, (6) are prohibited from delivering a guarantee by law, rule,
	regulation or an agreement, or (7) individually have a net worth of less than $10 million and collectively have an aggregate net worth of not more than $75 million) guarantee our obligations under the Credit Agreement (see Other
	Indebtedness). Accordingly, all of the subsidiaries that guarantee our obligations under the Credit Agreement (except our finance company subsidiaries and our foreign subsidiaries) will guarantee the Notes when they are issued. See
	Description of NotesThe Guarantees.




	 





	Redemption at our Option



	We may redeem the Notes in whole at any time or in part from time to time. If we redeem any of the Notes more than 60 days prior to their scheduled maturity date, the redemption price of those Notes will be equal to the greater of (i) 100% of
	their principal amount; or (ii) the present value of the payments of interest (excluding any interest accrued to the redemption date) and principal (including principal due on redemption) that would be due after the actual redemption date if those
	Notes were redeemed on the day that is 60 days prior to their scheduled maturity date, discounted to the date of the actual redemption, on a semi-annual basis, at the Treasury Rate plus 50 basis points (0.500%). If we redeem any of the Notes on or
	after the date that is 60 days prior to the scheduled maturity date of the Notes, the redemption price of those Notes will be equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes. In any redemption, we will also pay accrued and unpaid interest on the
	Notes being redeemed to the date of redemption. In determining the redemption price and accrued interest, interest will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.




	 





	Offer to Repurchase Upon a Change of Control Triggering Event



	If there is a Change of Control Triggering Event, we will be required to make an offer to repurchase all the outstanding Notes at a price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but
	not including, the repurchase date. See Description of NotesChange of Control Offer.

	Table of Contents










	Certain Indenture Provisions



	The indenture governing the Notes will contain covenants limiting our and some of our subsidiaries ability to create liens securing indebtedness or enter into sale and leaseback transactions. These covenants are subject to important
	exceptions and qualifications. See Description of NotesCertain Covenants.





	 







	Governing Law



	State of New York.




	 





	DTC Eligibility



	The Notes will be issued in fully registered book-entry form and will be represented by permanent global notes. The global notes will be deposited with a custodian for, and registered in the name of a nominee of, The Depository Trust Company
	(DTC). Beneficial interests in global notes will be shown on, and transfers of any of the Notes will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC and its direct and indirect participants, and an interest in any global note may not
	be exchanged for certificated notes, except in limited circumstances. See Book-Entry, Delivery and Settlement.




	 





	Form and Denomination



	The Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of $2,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess of that amount.




	 





	Trading



	The Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange or included in any automated quotation system. The Notes will be new securities for which there is currently no public market.





	 





	Risk Factors



	Investing in the Notes involves significant risks. See the Risk Factors section beginning on page S-5 and other information included or incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus for a
	discussion of factors investors should carefully consider before deciding to invest in the Notes.




	 







	Use of Proceeds



	We expect to receive net proceeds of approximately $495.9 million from the sale of the Notes after deducting the underwriting discount and certain expenses of the offering. We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering for general corporate
	purposes, including the repayment of debt, which may include the repayment or repurchase of our 6.50% senior notes due 2016 in full or in part. The 6.50% senior notes due 2016 mature on April 15, 2016. See Use of Proceeds.




	 





	Conflicts of Interest



	Certain of the underwriters (or their affiliates) may hold some of our 6.50% senior notes due 2016 and would receive a portion of the proceeds from this offering if we use the net proceeds to repay or repurchase those notes. If any one
	underwriter, together with its affiliates, were to receive 5% or more of the net proceeds as a result of the repayment or repurchase, such underwriter would be deemed to have a conflict of interest with us in regard to this offering
	under Rule 5121 of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA). Accordingly, this offering will be conducted in accordance with FINRA Rule 5121. No underwriter with a conflict of interest under FINRA Rule 5121
	will confirm sales to any discretionary accounts without receiving specific written approval from the account holder. A qualified independent underwriter (QIU) is not necessary for this offering pursuant to FINRA Rule 5121(a)(1)(A). See
	Use of Proceeds and Underwriting (Conflicts of Interest).

	RISK FACTORS




	In this section, we describe risks relating to the Notes. Investors considering purchasing Notes should also read the description of risks
	relating to our business included in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended November 30, 2015. If any of those risks develop into actual events, the Notes or our business, financial condition, results of
	operations, cash flows, strategies or properties could be materially adversely affected.




	Risks Relating to the Notes



	The Notes are subject to the normal risks applicable to debt securities, including the possibility that the obligor will not be able to make
	required payments when they are due. In addition, the Notes are subject to the following risks:




	Because the Notes are structurally
	subordinated to the obligations of our non-guarantor subsidiaries, your ability to be repaid may be adversely affected to the extent particular subsidiaries are not guaranteeing the Notes at a time when you become entitled to repayment.




	Substantially all of our operating assets are held by our subsidiaries. Unless a subsidiary is guaranteeing the Notes as described under
	Description of NotesThe Guarantees, holders of any indebtedness or preferred stock of that subsidiary and other creditors of that subsidiary, including trade creditors, will have claims on the assets of that subsidiary that are
	prior to the claims of the holders of the Notes. When the Notes are issued, some, but not all, of our subsidiaries will be guaranteeing the Notes, as described under Description of NotesThe Guarantees. Accordingly, when the Notes
	are issued, they will be structurally subordinated to the debt, preferred stock and other obligations of some of our subsidiaries. The indenture governing the Notes does not prohibit any of our subsidiaries from incurring additional liabilities.


	As of November 30, 2015, our subsidiaries had $1.9 billion of indebtedness, including $1.5 billion of secured indebtedness. Of this
	amount, $1.6 billion ($1.2 billion of secured indebtedness) was indebtedness of subsidiaries that will not be guaranteeing the Notes when they are issued. The indebtedness of our subsidiaries that will not be guaranteeing the Notes when they are
	issued includes $350 million of 7.000% senior notes due 2018 that were issued to investors in November 2013 and March 2014 by the parent entity within the Rialto segment and another subsidiary in that segment and are guaranteed by the principal
	entities, and most of the other entities, in the Rialto segment.




	The fact that the Notes are unsecured may increase the possibility
	that you will not be fully repaid if we become insolvent.




	The Notes will not be secured by any of our assets or our
	subsidiaries assets. Therefore, the Notes will, in effect, be junior to our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing that indebtedness.


	In the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or other winding up, the holders of any secured debt would receive payments from
	the assets securing that debt before you receive any payments from sales of those assets. There may not be sufficient assets remaining after payment of secured debt to pay all or any of the amounts due on the Notes that are then outstanding. The
	indenture governing the Notes does not prohibit us from incurring additional senior debt or secured debt, nor does it prohibit any of our subsidiaries from incurring additional liabilities. Under limited circumstances, if we or a Restricted
	Subsidiary (i.e., an actual or potential guarantor of the Notes) grants a lien securing indebtedness, we or the subsidiary must equally and ratably secure the Notes and, under the indentures relating to our other currently outstanding senior notes,
	we or the subsidiary must also equally and ratably secure those other senior notes. However, we and our subsidiaries are permitted to incur many types of secured debt without our being required to secure the Notes or our other senior notes. The


	 


	S-5






	Table of Contents



	Notes will be effectively subordinated to that secured debt to the extent of the value of the assets securing it. See Description of NotesCertain Covenants.


	As of November 30, 2015, our subsidiaries had $1.5 billion of secured indebtedness. Accordingly, as of November 30, 2015, the
	secured debt of our subsidiaries and the unsecured debt of our non-guarantor subsidiaries totaled $1.9 billion.




	Federal and state
	fraudulent transfer laws may affect the enforceability of the guarantees of the Notes, which could impair your ability to receive payments with regard to the Notes.




	Any time the subsidiary guarantees of the Notes are in effect, those guarantees, under fraudulent conveyance laws, might be subordinated to
	existing or future indebtedness incurred by the guarantor subsidiaries, or might not be enforceable, if a court or a creditors representative, such as a bankruptcy trustee, concluded that those subsidiaries received less than fair
	consideration for the guarantees and:


	 




	 


	


	 


	were rendered insolvent as a result of issuing the guarantees;




	 




	 


	


	 


	at the time they issued the guarantees, were engaged in a business or transaction for which the applicable subsidiaries remaining assets constituted unreasonably small capital;




	 




	 


	


	 


	at the time they issued the guarantees, intended to incur, or believed that we or they would incur, debts beyond our or their ability to pay as those debts matured; or




	 




	 


	


	 


	at the time they issued the guarantees, intended to hinder, delay or defraud our or their creditors.




	The measure of insolvency varies depending upon the law of the relevant jurisdiction. Generally, however, a company is considered insolvent if
	its debts are greater than the fair value of its property, or if the fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount that would be needed to pay its probable liabilities as its existing debts mature and become absolute.


	The subsidiary guarantees of the Notes contain terms that limit the obligations of individual subsidiaries to amounts that would not render
	them insolvent, even if they were required to make payments with regard to the Notes. That might avoid subordination of the guarantees under fraudulent conveyance laws in at least some jurisdictions. See Description of NotesThe
	Guarantees.




	Any guarantees provided by our subsidiaries are subject to possible defenses that may limit your right to receive
	payment from the guarantors with regard to the Notes.




	Although guarantees by many of our wholly-owned (i.e., directly or
	indirectly 100% owned) subsidiaries, when they are in effect, provide the holders of the Notes with a direct claim against the assets of those guarantors, enforcement of the guarantees against any guarantor would be subject to certain
	suretyship defenses available to guarantors generally. Enforcement could also be subject to other defenses available to guarantors in certain circumstances. To the extent that guarantees are not enforceable, you would not be able to
	assert a claim successfully against the guarantors. See Description of NotesThe Guarantees.




	All of our Existing
	Notes contain the same requirement to provide guarantees as the Notes offered by this prospectus supplement and some of the Existing Notes will mature prior to the Notes.




	At November 30, 2015, we had approximately $4.7 billion of outstanding senior notes comprised of our:

	with the Notes and contain requirements to provide guarantees on essentially the same terms and conditions as the Notes. Substantially all of the Existing Notes have maturity dates prior to the maturity of the Notes. Accordingly, we will be required
	to repay or refinance those Existing Notes before the Notes mature. See Other Indebtedness.




	The guarantees of the Notes
	may be suspended or released.




	The principal reason our Restricted Subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes is so holders of the Notes
	will have rights at least as great with regard to those subsidiaries as any other holders of a material amount of unsecured senior debt of Lennar Corporation as a separate entity. Therefore, the guarantee of the Notes by a Restricted Subsidiary will
	be in effect only while that Restricted Subsidiary directly or indirectly guarantees a material amount of the debt of Lennar Corporation, as a separate entity, to others. At present, most of our homebuilding subsidiaries and some of our other
	subsidiaries are guaranteeing our obligations under our principal credit facility (see Other Indebtedness) and therefore are guaranteeing the Existing Notes, and will be guaranteeing the Notes when they are issued.


	The subsidiaries that guarantee the Notes when they are issued may not be guaranteeing Lennar Corporation debt at all times when Notes are
	outstanding. The guarantee of the Notes by any Restricted Subsidiary will be suspended if at any time, and for so long as, that Restricted Subsidiary does not directly or indirectly guarantee at least $75 million principal amount of Lennar
	Corporations debt (other than the Existing Notes, the Notes and any other indebtedness that contains similar guarantee suspension provisions). Therefore, if a Restricted Subsidiary ceases to guarantee directly or indirectly at least $75
	million of Lennar Corporations debt obligations, that Restricted Subsidiarys guarantee of the Notes will be suspended until such time, if any, as it is again directly or indirectly guaranteeing at least $75 million of Lennar
	Corporations debt obligations. If our Restricted Subsidiaries guarantee Lennar Corporation revolving credit lines totaling at least $75 million, we will treat the guarantees of the Notes as remaining in effect even during periods when our
	borrowings under the revolving credit lines are less than $75 million.


	Under the circumstances described under Description of
	NotesThe Guarantees, a guarantor may be released entirely from its obligations to guarantee the Notes and the Existing Notes.




	We may incur substantially more debt or take other actions which would intensify the risks discussed above.




	We and our subsidiaries have the right to incur additional debt in the future, subject to any restrictions contained in any of our instruments
	relating to indebtedness other than the Notes, some or all of which could be secured debt. We will not be restricted under the terms of the indenture governing the Notes from incurring additional unsecured debt (there are restrictions on the secured
	debt we can incur without equally and ratably securing the Notes and our other senior notes), recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on the Notes when they
	are due.

	Some significant restructuring transactions may not constitute Change of Control Triggering
	Events, in which case we would not be obligated to offer to repurchase the Notes.




	If a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs,
	you will have the right to require us to repurchase your Notes. However, the provisions relating to a Change of Control Triggering Event will not afford protection to holders of Notes in the event of some transactions that could adversely affect the
	Notes. For example, transactions such as leveraged recapitalizations, refinancings, restructurings, or acquisitions initiated by us may not constitute Change of Control Triggering Events requiring us to offer to repurchase the Notes. In the event of
	any such transaction, the holders of the Notes would not have the right to require us to repurchase their Notes, even though each of those transactions could increase the amount of our indebtedness, or otherwise adversely affect our capital
	structure or any credit ratings, thereby adversely affecting the holders of Notes.




	There currently is no public market for the
	Notes, so you may be unable to sell your Notes.




	The Notes are new securities for which there is currently no public trading
	market. Consequently, the Notes may be relatively illiquid, and you may be unable to sell your Notes. We do not intend to list the Notes on any securities exchange or to include the Notes in any automated quotation system. We have been informed by
	the underwriters that they intend to make a market in the Notes after the offering is completed. However, the underwriters may cease their market making at any time without notice. In addition, the liquidity of the trading market in the Notes, and
	the market price quoted for the Notes, may be adversely affected by changes in the overall market for this type of security and by changes in our financial performance or prospects or in the prospects for companies in our industry generally. As a
	result, we cannot assure you that an active trading market will develop for the Notes. If any of the Notes are traded after their initial issuance, they may trade at a discount from their initial offering price and you may be unable to resell your
	Notes or may be able to sell them only at a substantial discount. Future trading prices of the Notes will depend on many factors, including prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, general economic conditions and our financial
	condition, performance and prospects.




	An adverse change in the rating of the Notes could cause their trading price to fall.




	If a rating service that rates the Notes were to lower its rating on the Notes below the rating it initially assigns to them, or
	were to announce its intention to put the Notes on credit watch, the trading price of the Notes could decline.




	The Notes are not
	protected by restrictive covenants.




	The indenture governing the Notes does not contain any financial or operating covenants or
	restrictions on the payment of dividends, the incurrence of indebtedness or the issuance or repurchase of securities by us or any of our subsidiaries. The indenture contains no covenants or other provisions to afford protection to holders of the
	Notes in the event of a fundamental change or other corporate transaction involving us except to the extent described under Description of NotesConsolidation, Merger or Sale of Assets and Description of NotesChange of
	Control Offer.




	We may not be able to raise the funds necessary to finance the Change of Control Offers required by the
	indentures governing our senior notes, which would violate the terms of the senior notes.




	Upon a Change of Control Triggering
	Event, we will be required to make an offer to repurchase all the outstanding Notes at a price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the repurchase date. Whenever we
	are required to offer to repurchase the Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, we will have a similar obligation with regard to the Existing Notes and any other senior notes with similar provisions, and we may not have
	sufficient funds to repurchase the Notes, the Existing Notes and such other senior notes for cash at that time. In addition,


	 


	S-8






	Table of Contents



	our ability to repurchase the Notes, the Existing Notes or other of our senior notes for cash may be limited by law or the terms of agreements relating to other of our indebtedness that is
	outstanding at the time. The failure to make a required repurchase of the Notes would result in a default under the indenture governing the Notes. A default under the indenture, or our failure to purchase Existing Notes or other senior notes after a
	Change of Control, would also be a default under other debt securities we have issued and such default or the Change of Control itself could cause other borrowings we have incurred to become due. If the repayment of a substantial amount of
	indebtedness were to be accelerated, we might not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the Notes, the Existing Notes and any other senior notes containing similar provisions. See Description of NotesChange of
	Control Offer.

	For the purpose of calculating the ratio of earnings to fixed charges, earnings consist of income before income taxes plus fixed charges and certain other adjustments. Fixed charges
	consist of interest incurred on all indebtedness and the implied interest component of our rent obligations.




	There was no
	preferred stock outstanding for any of the periods presented. Accordingly, the ratios of earnings to combined fixed charges and preferred stock dividends were identical to the ratios of earnings to fixed charges.





	ABSENCE OF PUBLIC MARKET



	The Notes will be new securities for which there is no established trading market. We currently do not intend to list the Notes on any
	securities exchange or to arrange for the Notes to be quoted on any quotation system. Accordingly, it is possible that no active trading market for the Notes will develop, or if any market does develop, that such market will not provide significant
	liquidity to holders of Notes.








	USE OF PROCEEDS



	We expect to receive net proceeds of approximately $495.9 million from the sale of the Notes after deducting the underwriting discount and
	certain expenses of the offering. We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of debt, which may include the repayment or repurchase of our 6.50% senior notes due 2016 in full or in
	part. The 6.50% senior notes due 2016 mature on April 15, 2016. Certain of the underwriters (or their affiliates) may hold some of our 6.50% senior notes due 2016 and would receive a portion of the proceeds from this offering if we use the net
	proceeds to repay or repurchase those notes. If any one underwriter, together with its affiliates, were to receive 5% or more of the net proceeds as a result of the repayment or repurchase, such underwriter would be deemed to have a conflict
	of interest with us in regard to this offering under FINRA Rule 5121. Accordingly, this offering will be conducted in accordance with FINRA Rule 5121. See Underwriting (Conflicts of Interest).





	OTHER INDEBTEDNESS



	Our indebtedness at November 30, 2015 is listed in the table in the section of this prospectus supplement captioned
	Capitalization. The indenture relating to $350 million principal amount of 7.000% senior notes due 2018 issued and guaranteed by subsidiaries in our Rialto segment includes covenants that limit the ability of those subsidiaries to
	distribute funds to or for the benefit of Lennar Corporation or subsidiaries that are not obligors or guarantors with regard to the Rialto senior notes. With that exception, and with the exception of the Credit Agreement described below, none of the
	indebtedness listed in the Capitalization table, other than as described in this prospectus supplement, or the documents incorporated by reference in it, has any covenants that restrict our, or our subsidiaries, ability to make payments on
	outstanding indebtedness or to pay dividends, or requires us to maintain financial attributes. All of our Existing Notes have covenants, similar to those in the indenture governing the Notes, that limit our, or our subsidiaries, ability to
	create liens securing indebtedness or enter into sale and leaseback transactions. We believe we were in compliance with our debt covenants as of November 30, 2015.


	In April 2015, we amended the credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) governing our unsecured revolving credit facility. Under the
	Credit Agreement, we may borrow, on a revolving basis, up to $1.6 billion, which includes a $163 million accordion feature, subject to additional commitments. The maturity for $1.3 billion of the credit facility is in June 2019, with the remainder
	maturing in June 2018. The interest rate on $1.3 billion of the credit facility is LIBOR plus 1.75% and the interest rate on the remainder of the credit facility is LIBOR plus 2.00%, in each instance subject to possible adjustment based upon our
	leverage ratio. The Credit Agreement provides that up to $500 million in commitments may be used for letters of credit. At November 30,

	2015, we had no borrowings outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility. Lennar Corporations obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by substantially the same
	subsidiaries that will be guaranteeing the Notes and that guarantee the Existing Notes. See Description of NotesThe Guarantees. We also have $315 million of letter of credit facilities with different financial institutions. At
	November 30, 2015, we had $453.2 million of performance and financial letters of credit outstanding.

	The table below shows our capitalization as it existed at November 30, 2015 and as adjusted to give effect to (i) the conversion or
	exchange of approximately $162.9 million aggregate principal amount of the 2.75% convertible senior notes due 2020 subsequent to November 30, 2015, (ii) the issuance of $500 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes offered by this
	prospectus supplement, and (iii) our assumed use of the net proceeds from this offering to repay or repurchase all of our 6.50% senior notes due 2016. See Use of Proceeds.

	DESCRIPTION OF NOTES



	The following description of the Notes supplements, and to the extent it is inconsistent with, replaces, the description of the general terms
	and provisions of the debt securities set forth in the accompanying prospectus. We will issue the Notes under an indenture dated as of December 31, 1997 (the Base Indenture), as supplemented and amended by a twelfth supplemental
	indenture to be dated as of March 4, 2016 (the Twelfth Supplemental Indenture and, together with the Base Indenture, the Indenture) among us, the subsidiary guarantors and The Bank of New York Mellon, as successor trustee
	(the Trustee). We have filed the Base Indenture with the SEC. The Indenture is subject to, and governed by, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the TIA). You should read the Indenture for additional information
	before you purchase any Notes. You may request a copy of the Indenture at our address shown under the caption Incorporation by Reference in this prospectus supplement. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this section have the
	meanings specified in the Indenture. For purposes of this Description of Notes, we, our or us refers to Lennar Corporation and does not include our subsidiaries, except in references to financial data determined
	on a consolidated basis.


	The following description is a summary of the material provisions of the Notes and the Indenture. We urge you to
	read the Indenture because that document, and not this description, will define each Holders rights as a Holder of the Notes.



	General



	The Notes will be our direct, unsecured obligations and will rank equal in right of payment by us with all of our other unsecured and
	unsubordinated indebtedness from time to time outstanding. The Notes will be issued in denominations of $2,000 principal amount and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess of that amount and will be payable, and may be presented for registration of
	transfer and exchange, without service charge, at the Trustees office or agency in New York, New York.


	The Notes are limited in
	aggregate principal amount to $500 million, but we may, without the consent of the Holders (as defined below), reopen the Notes and issue additional Notes at any time on the same terms and conditions and with the same CUSIP number as the
	Notes offered by this prospectus supplement. The Notes and any such additional Notes subsequently issued under the Indenture will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture, including, without limitation, for purposes of
	waivers, amendments and redemptions.


	The Notes will mature on April 1, 2021. Interest on the Notes will accrue at 4.750% per annum and
	will be payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year, commencing October 1, 2016. Interest on the Notes will also be payable on their maturity date and on any redemption date. If any interest payment date, maturity date or redemption
	date is not a Business Day, then the interest payment will be postponed until the first following Business Day and no additional interest will accrue.


	Business Day means each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday which is not a legal holiday in New York, New York.


	We will pay interest to the persons in whose names the Notes are registered at the close of business on March 15 and September 15, as
	applicable, before the interest payment date; provided that the interest payable at the maturity date or on a redemption date will be paid to the person to whom principal is payable.


	Interest on the Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from and
	including the date of issuance. There is no sinking fund applicable to the Notes.


	In connection with the Notes, we have not agreed to any
	financial covenants or any restrictions on the payment of dividends or the issuance or repurchase of our securities. We also have not agreed to any covenants or other provisions to protect Holders of the Notes in the event of a highly leveraged
	transaction.

	We may, at our option, redeem the Notes in whole or in part at any time and from time to time. If we redeem any of the Notes more than 60 days
	prior to their scheduled maturity date, the redemption price of those Notes will be equal to the greater of:


	 




	 


	


	 


	100% of their principal amount; or




	 




	 


	


	 


	the present value of the Remaining Payments (as defined below) on the Notes being redeemed, discounted to the date of the redemption, on a semi-annual basis, at the Treasury Rate plus 50 basis points (0.500%).




	If we redeem Notes on or after the date that is 60 days prior to the scheduled maturity date of the Notes, the redemption
	price will be equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes.


	In any redemption, we will also pay accrued interest on the Notes being
	redeemed to the date of redemption. In determining the redemption price and accrued interest, interest will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.


	Any redemption will be on at least 30, but not more than 60, days prior notice.


	If money sufficient to pay the redemption price of and accrued interest on the Notes to be redeemed is deposited with the Trustee on or before
	the redemption date, beginning on the redemption date interest will cease to accrue on the Notes (or the portion of them) called for redemption and those Notes will cease to be outstanding.


	Comparable Treasury Issue means the United States Treasury security selected by the Reference Treasury Dealer as having a maturity
	comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the
	remaining term of the Notes.


	Comparable Treasury Price means, with respect to any redemption date, (1) the average of
	the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) on the third Business Day preceding such redemption date, as set forth in the daily statistical release (or any successor
	release) published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and designated Composite 3:30 p.m. Quotations for U.S. Government Securities or (2) if such release (or any successor release) is not published or does not contain such
	price on such Business Day, (A) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (B) if the Quotation Agent obtains fewer
	than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations.


	Quotation Agent means any Reference
	Treasury Dealer appointed by us.


	Reference Treasury Dealer means (A) each of Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Deutsche
	Bank Securities Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Goldman, Sachs & Co. and RBC Capital Markets, LLC and one primary U.S. government securities dealer in New York
	City (a Primary Treasury Dealer) designated by Wells Fargo Securities, LLC (or its affiliate that is a Primary Treasury Dealer); provided, however, that if any of them shall cease to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, we will substitute
	another Primary Treasury Dealer; and (B) any other Primary Treasury Dealer(s) selected by us.


	Reference Treasury Dealer
	Quotations means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Quotation Agent, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage
	of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Quotation Agent by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m. on the third Business Day preceding such redemption date.

	Remaining Payments means, with respect to any Note that is redeemed, the remaining
	payments of interest and the payment of principal (or the portion of the principal) that would have been due with regard to that Note after the actual redemption date if the Note had been redeemed on the day that is 60 days before the scheduled
	maturity date of the Notes; provided, however, that, if such redemption date is not an interest payment date with respect to such Note, the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment with respect to the Note will be reduced by the
	amount of interest accrued with respect to the Note to such redemption date.


	Treasury Rate means, with respect to any
	redemption date, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the
	Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date.



	The Guarantees



	The guarantor Subsidiaries are all 100% owned by us. Each guarantor Subsidiary will, in the circumstances described below (but only in those
	circumstances), unconditionally guarantee, jointly and severally with the other Subsidiaries that are guaranteeing the Notes, all of our obligations under the Notes and the Indenture, including our obligations to pay principal, premium, if any, and
	interest with respect to the Notes. The guarantees will be general unsecured obligations of the guarantors and will rank

	pari passu

	with all existing and future unsecured indebtedness of the guarantors that is not, by its terms, expressly
	subordinated in right of payment to the guarantees or to other senior indebtedness of the guarantors. The obligations of each guarantor will be limited to the maximum amount which, after giving effect to all other contingent and fixed liabilities of
	such guarantor and after giving effect to any collections from or payments made by or on behalf of any other guarantor in respect of the obligations of such other guarantor under its guarantee or pursuant to its contribution obligations under the
	Indenture, will result in the obligations of such guarantor under its guarantee not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under federal or state law. Each guarantor that makes a payment or distribution under a guarantee will be
	entitled to a contribution from each other guarantor in an amount

	pro rata,

	based on the net assets of each guarantor, determined in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. While any of our
	wholly-owned (i.e., directly or indirectly 100% owned) Subsidiaries is guaranteeing the Notes, its guarantee will be full and unconditional, and joint and several with the guarantees of all our other wholly-owned (i.e., directly or indirectly 100%
	owned) Subsidiaries that are guaranteeing the Notes, subject to limitations intended to prevent the guarantees from constituting fraudulent conveyances or fraudulent transfers under federal or state law.


	The Indenture will require that, except as described below, each of our existing and future wholly-owned (i.e., directly or indirectly 100%
	owned) Subsidiaries (other than finance company Subsidiaries and foreign Subsidiaries) guarantee the Notes if that Subsidiary guarantees any of our (i.e., Lennar Corporations) Indebtedness or guarantees the obligations of any Subsidiary as a
	guarantor of our (i.e., Lennar Corporations) Indebtedness (each such Subsidiary, a guarantor). At the date of this prospectus supplement, all of our wholly-owned Subsidiaries (other than our Subsidiaries that (1) engage in the
	mortgage banking business, (2) own, finance, manage or service real estate assets (i.e., the subsidiaries in our Rialto segment), (3) engage in the development, investment and management of commercial or mixed use properties,
	(4) engage in the development, investment and management of multi-family rental properties, (5) engage in the installation, development, ownership, servicing, sale or lease of solar power systems or sale of solar power, (6) are
	prohibited from delivering a guarantee by law, rule, regulation or an agreement, or (7) individually have a net worth of less than $10 million and collectively have an aggregate net worth of not more than $75 million) guarantee our obligations
	under the Credit Agreement (see Other Indebtedness). Accordingly, all of the Subsidiaries that guarantee our obligations under the Credit Agreement (except our finance company Subsidiaries and our foreign Subsidiaries) will guarantee the
	Notes when they are issued.


	The obligations of a guarantor will be automatically suspended, and that guarantor will not be a guarantor
	(but will remain a Restricted Subsidiary) and will not have any obligations with regard to the Notes, during any


	 


	S-15






	Table of Contents



	period when the principal amount of our (i.e., Lennar Corporations) obligations or of any Subsidiarys obligations as a guarantor of our (i.e., Lennar Corporations) obligations,
	in each case other than the Notes and any other Indebtedness containing provisions similar to this, that the guarantor is guaranteeing totals less than $75 million. Additionally, if any guarantor is released from its guarantee (rather than a
	suspension of its guarantee) of the outstanding Indebtedness of us or the obligations of any Restricted Subsidiary as a guarantor of our Indebtedness, that guarantor will automatically be released from its obligations as a guarantor under the
	Indenture, and from and after the date of that release, that guarantor will cease to constitute a guarantor of the Notes and will not be a Restricted Subsidiary.


	The Indenture will provide that if all or substantially all of the assets of any guarantor or all of the capital stock of any guarantor is
	sold (including by consolidation, merger, issuance or otherwise) or disposed of (including by liquidation, dissolution or otherwise) by us or any of our Subsidiaries (other than in each case to us or an affiliate of ours or any of our Subsidiaries),
	then that guarantor or the Person acquiring those assets (in the event of a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the guarantor) will be deemed automatically and unconditionally released and discharged from all of
	its obligations under the Indenture without any further action on the part of the Trustee or any Holder of the Notes.



	Change of Control Offer



	If a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, unless we have exercised our option to redeem the Notes by notifying the noteholders to that
	effect as described above, we will be required to make an offer (a Change of Control Offer) to each Holder of Notes to repurchase all or any part of that Holders Notes on the terms set forth in the Notes. In a Change of Control
	Offer, we will be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes that are repurchased to the date of repurchase (a Change of
	Control Payment). Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event or, at our option, prior to any Change of Control, but after public announcement of the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the Change of Control, a
	notice will be sent to Holders of the Notes, describing the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Notes on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier
	than 30 days and no later than 60 days after the date that notice is sent, other than as may be required by law (a Change of Control Payment Date). The notice will, if sent prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control,
	state that the Change of Control Offer is conditioned on the Change of Control Triggering Event occurring on or prior to the applicable Change of Control Payment Date.


	On each Change of Control Payment Date, we will, to the extent lawful:


	 




	 


	


	 


	accept for payment all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered in response to the Change of Control Offer;




	 




	 


	


	 


	deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes properly accepted together with an Officers Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of Notes being repurchased and that all
	conditions precedent provided for in the Indenture to the Change of Control Offer and to the repurchase by us of Notes pursuant to the Change of Control Offer have been complied with.




	We will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event if a third party makes
	such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer made by us and the third party purchases all Notes properly tendered in response to its offer and not withdrawn.


	To the extent that we are required to offer to repurchase the Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, we will have
	a similar obligation with regard to the Existing Notes. We may not have


	 


	S-16






	Table of Contents



	sufficient funds to repurchase the Notes and the Existing Notes for cash at that time. In addition, our ability to repurchase the Notes or the Existing Notes for cash may be limited by law or the
	terms of other agreements relating to our indebtedness that is outstanding at the time. The failure to make a required repurchase of the Notes or the Existing Notes would result in a Default under the Notes.


	We will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and
	any other securities laws and regulations under it to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any
	such securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Offer provisions of the Notes, we will comply with those securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached our obligations under the Change of Control
	Offer provisions of the Notes by virtue of any such conflict.


	For purposes of the Change of Control Offer provisions of the Notes, the
	following terms will be applicable:


	Change of Control means the occurrence of any of the following:
	(1) the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger or consolidation), in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our
	subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person, other than to us or one of our subsidiaries; (2) the consummation of any transaction (including, without limitation, any merger or consolidation) the result of which is that any person becomes the
	beneficial owner (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of our outstanding Voting Stock or other Voting Stock into which our Voting Stock is reclassified, consolidated, exchanged or
	changed, measured by voting power rather than number of shares; (3) we consolidate with, or merge with or into, any person, or any person consolidates with, or merges with or into, us, in any such event pursuant to a transaction in which any of
	our outstanding Voting Stock or the Voting Stock of such other person is converted into or exchanged for cash, securities or other property, other than any such transaction where the shares of our Voting Stock outstanding immediately prior to such
	transaction constitute, or are converted into or exchanged for, a majority of the Voting Stock of the surviving person or any direct or indirect parent company of the surviving person immediately after giving effect to such transaction; (4) the
	first day on which a majority of the members of our board of directors are not Continuing Directors; or (5) the adoption of a plan relating to our liquidation or dissolution.


	Notwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction (or series of related transactions) will not be deemed to involve a Change of Control under
	clause (2) above if, either:


	 




	 


	(i)


	(A) we become a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of a holding company and (B)(1) the direct or indirect holders of the Voting Stock of such holding company immediately following that transaction are
	substantially the same as the holders of our Voting Stock immediately prior to that transaction or (2) the shares of our Voting Stock outstanding immediately prior to such transaction are converted into or exchanged for, a majority of the
	Voting Stock of such holding company immediately after giving effect to such transaction; or




	 




	 


	(ii)


	(A) Stuart Miller, together with members of his immediate family, directly or indirectly, becomes the beneficial owner of more than 50%, but less than 66

	 2

	⁄

	3

	%, of our outstanding Voting Stock (measured by voting power rather than number of shares) and (B) immediately after such transaction or transactions, our Class A common stock is listed for trading on
	the New York Stock Exchange or The NASDAQ Global Market.




	The term person, as used in this definition, has the
	meaning given to it in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act.


	The definition of change of control includes a phrase
	relating to the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Although there is a body of case law interpreting
	the phrase substantially all, there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a Holder of Notes to require


	 


	S-17






	Table of Contents



	us to repurchase its Notes as a result of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to another
	person or group may be uncertain.


	Change of Control Triggering Event means the occurrence of both a Change of Control and a
	Rating Event.


	Continuing Director means, as of any date of determination, any member of our Board of Directors who
	(1) was a member of our Board of Directors on the date the Notes were initially issued or (2) was nominated for election, elected or appointed to our Board of Directors with the approval of a majority of the Continuing Directors who were
	members of our Board of Directors at the time of the nomination, election or appointment (either by a specific vote or by approval of our proxy statement in which that member was named as a nominee for election as a director, without objection to
	the nomination).


	Fitch means Fitch Inc. and its successors.


	Investment Grade Rating means a rating equal to or higher than Baa3 (or the equivalent) by Moodys, BBB- (or the equivalent)
	by S&P and BBB- (or the equivalent) by Fitch, and the equivalent investment grade credit rating from any replacement Rating Agency or Rating Agencies selected by us.


	Moodys means Moodys Investors Service, Inc. and its successors.


	Rating Agencies means (1) each of Moodys, S&P and Fitch; and (2) if any of Moodys, S&P or Fitch
	ceases to rate the Notes or fails to make a rating of the Notes publicly available for reasons beyond our control, a nationally recognized statistical rating organization as such term is defined in Section 3(a)(62) of the Exchange
	Act that is selected by us (as certified by a resolution of our Board of Directors) as a replacement agency for Moodys, S&P or Fitch, or all of them, as the case may be.


	Rating Event means the rating on the Notes is lowered by at least two of the three Rating Agencies and the Notes are rated below
	an Investment Grade Rating by at least two of the three Rating Agencies (and, if there is a split among the three Rating Agencies, by the two Rating Agencies with the lowest rating), in any case on any day during the period (which period will be
	extended so long as the rating of the Notes is under publicly announced consideration for a possible downgrade by any of the Rating Agencies) commencing 90 days prior to the earlier of (i) the first public notice of the occurrence of a Change
	of Control or (ii) the first public notice of our intention to effect a Change of Control, and ending 90 days following consummation of such Change of Control.


	S&P means Standard & Poors Rating Services, a Standard & Poors Financial Services LLC business,
	and its successors.


	Voting Stock means, with respect to any specified person (as that term is used in
	Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) as of any date, the capital stock of that person that is at the time entitled to vote generally in the election of the board of directors of that person.



	Certain Covenants





	Limitation on
	Liens.


	We will not, nor will we permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create, assume, incur or suffer to exist any Lien upon any of our or its properties or assets, whether owned on the date of original issuance of the Notes (Issue
	Date) or thereafter acquired, unless:


	 




	 


	


	 


	if such Lien secures Indebtedness ranking equal in right of payment with the Notes, then the Notes are secured by a Lien on the same properties or assets on an equal and ratable basis with the obligation so secured
	until such time as such obligation is no longer secured by a Lien;




	 




	 


	


	 


	if such Lien secures Indebtedness which is subordinated to the Notes, then the Notes are secured by a Lien on the same properties or assets and the Lien securing such Indebtedness is subordinated to the Lien granted to
	the Holders of the Notes to the same extent as such Indebtedness is subordinated to the Notes; or

	from all Sale-Leaseback Transactions which are not Permitted Sale Leaseback Transactions (as defined below), does not exceed 20% of Consolidated Net Tangible Assets.

	Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, we may, and may permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, effect any Sale-Leaseback Transaction involving
	any real or tangible personal property which is not a Permitted Sale-


	 


	S-20






	Table of Contents



	Leaseback Transaction, provided that the aggregate net sales proceeds from all Sale-Leaseback Transactions which are not Permitted Sale-Leaseback Transactions, together with all Indebtedness
	secured by Liens which are not Permitted Liens, does not exceed 20% of Consolidated Net Tangible Assets.




	Mergers and
	Consolidations.


	We may not consolidate with or merge into, or sell or lease our assets substantially as an entirety to, a Person unless:


	 




	 


	


	 


	the resulting corporation or the person which acquires or leases our assets (if not us) is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America, any state thereof or the District of
	Columbia, and such corporation (if not us) expressly assumes all our obligations under the Notes and all the covenants in the Indenture; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	immediately after the transaction, no Event of Default or event which, after notice or lapse of time or both, would be an Event of Default, will have occurred and continue.





	Compliance Certificate



	We must deliver
	to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officers Certificate as to the signers knowledge of our compliance with all conditions and our covenants in the Indenture. The Officers Certificate also must
	state whether or not the signer knows of any Default or Event of Default that occurred during the preceding fiscal year. If the signer knows of such a Default or Event of Default, the Officers Certificate must describe the Default or Event of
	Default and the efforts to remedy it. For the purposes of this provision of the Indenture, compliance is determined without regard to any grace period or requirement of notice under the Indenture.



	Events of Default; Notice and Waiver



	The
	following will constitute Events of Default under the Indenture, subject to any additional limitations and qualifications included in the Indenture:


	 




	 


	


	 


	our failure to pay any interest on the Notes continuing for 30 days after it was due;




	 




	 


	


	 


	our failure to pay any principal or redemption price or repurchase price of the Notes when it is due;




	 




	 


	


	 


	our failure or the failure of any Restricted Subsidiary to fulfill an obligation to pay Indebtedness for borrowed money (other than any Non-Recourse Indebtedness incurred by us or any Restricted Subsidiary), which such
	failure shall have resulted in the acceleration of, or be a failure to pay at final maturity, Indebtedness aggregating more than $50 million, and where such acceleration does not cease to exist, or such Indebtedness is not satisfied, in either case,
	within 30 days after such acceleration;




	 




	 


	


	 


	our failure to perform any other covenant or warranty in the Indenture, continuing for 60 days after written notice as provided in the Indenture;




	 




	 


	


	 


	final judgments or orders are rendered against us or any Restricted Subsidiary which require the payment by us or any Restricted Subsidiary of an amount (to the extent not covered by insurance) in excess of $50 million
	and such judgments or orders remain unstayed or unsatisfied for more than 60 days and are not being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization with respect to (i) us or (ii) any Significant Subsidiary or group of subsidiaries that, taken as a whole, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary.




	If an Event of Default (other than certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization with respect to us or any
	Significant Subsidiary) has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may declare the principal amount of the Notes then outstanding and interest, if any, accrued
	thereon to be due and payable immediately. However, if we cure all Defaults (except the nonpayment of the principal and interest due on any of the Notes that have become due by


	 


	S-21






	Table of Contents



	acceleration) and certain other conditions in the Indenture are met, with certain exceptions, such declaration may be annulled and past Defaults may be waived by the Holders of a majority of the
	principal amount of the Notes then outstanding as described below. In the case of certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization with respect to us or any Significant Subsidiary, the principal amount of the Notes will automatically
	become and be immediately due and payable.


	Within 90 days after a Trust Officer (as defined in the Indenture) has knowledge of the
	occurrence of a Default or any Event of Default, the Trustee must send to all Holders notice of all Defaults or Events of Default known to a Trust Officer, unless such Default or Event of Default is cured or waived before the giving of such notice.
	However, except in the case of a payment Default on any of the Notes, the Trustee will be protected in withholding such notice if and so long as a trust committee of directors and/or officers of the Trustee in good faith determines that the
	withholding of such notice is in the interest of the Holders; and provided, further, in the case of any Default with respect to a failure by us or any Restricted Subsidiary to fulfill an obligation to pay Indebtedness for borrowed money, no such
	notice to Holders shall be given until the end of the 30-day grace period referred to above.


	The Holders of a majority in principal
	amount of outstanding Notes will have the right to direct the time, method and place of any proceedings for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee, subject to certain limitations specified in
	the Indenture.


	The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee
	determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder of the Notes or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification satisfactory to
	it in its sole discretion against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action.


	The Holders of a majority in
	principal amount of outstanding Notes may waive any past Defaults under the Indenture, except a Default relating to the non-payment of principal or interest, a Default arising from our failure to redeem or repurchase any Notes when required pursuant
	to the terms of the Indenture or a Default in respect of any covenant that cannot be amended without the consent of each Holder affected thereby.


	Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee
	will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to it against any
	loss, liability or expense. No Holder of the Notes may pursue any remedy under the Indenture or the Notes, except in the case of a Default due to the non-payment of principal or interest on the Notes, unless:


	 




	 


	


	 


	the Holder has given the Trustee written notice of a Default;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of outstanding Notes make a written request to the Trustee to pursue the remedy;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the Trustee does not receive an inconsistent direction from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of outstanding Notes; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	the Trustee fails to comply with the request within 60 days after receipt of the request and offer of indemnity.




	To the extent any Holder or Holders request the Trustee to take any action, the Holder or Holders are required to offer to the Trustee
	indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to it against any costs, liability or expense of the Trustee.


	The Indenture will require us
	(i) every year to deliver to the Trustee a statement as to performance of our obligations under the Indenture and as to any Default, and (ii) to deliver to the Trustee prompt notice of any Default.


	 


	S-22






	Table of Contents



	The Indenture will provide that if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the
	Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs.


	Payments of the redemption price, the Change of Control repurchase price, or principal and interest that are not made when due will accrue
	interest per annum at the then-applicable interest rate plus one percent from the required payment date.



	Modifications of the Indenture



	With the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding, we and the Trustee may
	modify the Indenture or the rights of the Holders of the Notes. However, without the consent of each Holder of Notes that is affected, we cannot, among other actions:


	 




	 


	


	 


	extend the stated maturity of any Note;




	 




	 


	


	 


	reduce the rate or extend the time for the payment of interest on any Note;




	 




	 


	


	 


	reduce the principal amount of any Note or the redemption price, or change the time at which or the circumstances under which the Notes may or must be redeemed;




	 




	 


	


	 


	impair the right of a Holder to receive payment of principal of or interest on such Holders Notes on or after the due dates of such Notes or to institute suit for the payment of any Note;




	 




	 


	


	 


	change the currency in which the Notes are payable; or




	 




	 


	


	 


	release any guarantor except as provided in the Indenture and described under The Guarantees.




	In addition, without the consent of the Holders of all of the Notes then outstanding, we cannot reduce the percentage of Notes the Holders of
	which are required to consent to any such amendment or to waive a Default or Event of Default as described under Events of Default, Notice and Waiver.


	We and the Trustee may modify the Indenture without notice to or the consent of any Holder in order to make certain minor changes that do not
	adversely affect the Holders of the Notes and to conform the text of the Indenture or the Notes (or any guarantee of the Notes) to any corresponding provisions of the Description of Debt Securities or Description of Notes or
	similar provisions in any prospectus filed in respect of the Notes (including any prospectus supplement).



	Notices



	Except as otherwise provided in this Description of Notes or the Indenture, notices to Holders of the Notes will be given by mail
	to the addresses of Holders of the Notes as they appear in the Notes register; provided that notices given to Holders holding Notes in book-entry form may be given through the facilities of DTC or any successor depositary.



	No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders



	No director, officer, employee, incorporator, stockholder or partner of Lennar Corporation, or any successor or any subsidiary of the
	foregoing, as such, will have any liability for any obligations of Lennar Corporation or any Subsidiary under the Notes or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder of
	Notes by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. The waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws.

	Unclaimed Money



	If money deposited with the Trustee or a Paying Agent for the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or accrued and unpaid interest on,
	the Notes remains unclaimed for two years, the Trustee and Paying Agent will pay the money back to us upon our written request. However, the Trustee and Paying Agent have the right to withhold paying the money back to us until they publish, at our
	expense, in a newspaper of general circulation in the City of New York, or mail to each registered Holder, a notice stating that the money will be paid back to us if unclaimed after a date no less than 30 days from the publication or mailing. After
	the Trustee or Paying Agent pays the money back to us, Holders of Notes entitled to the money must look to us for payment as general creditors, subject to applicable law, and all liability of the Trustee and the Paying Agent with respect to the
	money will cease.



	Governing Law



	The
	Notes and the Indenture, and any claim, controversy or dispute arising under or related to the Indenture or the Notes, will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York (without regard to the conflicts of laws
	provisions thereof).



	Reporting



	The
	Indenture will provide that any documents or reports that we are required to file with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act will be provided to the Trustee within 15 days after they are filed with the SEC. Documents filed
	by us with the SEC via the EDGAR system will be deemed provided to the Trustee as of the time such documents are filed via EDGAR.



	Form, Denomination,
	Exchange, Registration and Transfer



	The Notes will be issued:


	 




	 


	


	 


	in fully registered form;




	 




	 


	


	 


	without interest coupons; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	in denominations of $2,000 principal amount and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess of that amount.




	If there are certificated Notes, Holders may present certificated Notes for registration of transfer and exchange at the office maintained by
	us for such purpose, which will initially be an office or agency of the Trustee.



	Global Notes



	The Notes will be issued in the form of one or more global notes that will be deposited with the Trustee as custodian for DTC. Holders will
	receive interests in the global notes. Interests in the global notes will be issued only in denominations of $2,000 principal amount or integral multiples of $1,000 in excess of that amount. Unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for
	securities in definitive form, a global note may not be transferred except as a whole to a nominee of DTC for such global note, or by a nominee of DTC to DTC or another nominee of DTC, or by DTC or any such nominee to a successor depositary or a
	nominee of such successor depositary.



	Payment and Paying Agent



	We will maintain an office or agent in the United States where we will pay the principal on the Notes, and a Holder may present Notes for
	registration of transfer or exchange for other denominations, which shall initially be an office or agency of the Trustee.


	Payments on
	the Notes represented by the global notes will be made to DTC, or its nominee, as the case may be, as the registered owner of the global notes, in immediately available funds.

	Table of Contents




	Book-Entry, Delivery and Settlement



	We will issue the Notes in the form of one or more permanent global notes in definitive, fully registered, book-entry form. The global notes
	will be deposited with the Trustee as custodian for DTC and registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC.


	DTC has
	advised us as follows:


	 




	 


	


	 


	DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law, a banking organization within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a
	clearing corporation within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a clearing agency registered under Section 17A of the Exchange Act.




	 




	 


	


	 


	DTC holds securities for its participating organizations that its participants (collectively, the participants) deposit with DTC and facilitates the settlement among participants of securities transactions,
	such as transfers and pledges, in deposited securities, through electronic computerized book-entry changes in participants accounts, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates.




	 




	 


	


	 


	Direct participants include securities brokers and dealers, trust companies, clearing corporations and other organizations.




	 




	 


	


	 


	DTC is owned by a number of its direct participants and by the NYSE and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc.




	 




	 


	


	 


	Access to the DTC system is also available to others, such as securities brokers and dealers, banks and trust companies (collectively, the indirect participants) that clear through or maintain a custodial
	relationship with a direct participant, either directly or indirectly.




	 




	 


	


	 


	The rules applicable to DTC and its participants are on file with the SEC.




	 




	 


	


	 


	Persons who are not participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through DTCs participants or DTCs indirect participants.




	We are providing the following descriptions of the operations and procedures of DTC to the Holders solely as a matter of convenience. These
	operations and procedures are solely within the control of DTC and are subject to change by DTC from time to time. None of us, the underwriters or the Trustee takes any responsibility for these operations or procedures, and each Holder is urged to
	contact DTC or its participants directly to discuss these matters.


	We expect that under procedures established by DTC:


	 




	 


	


	 


	Upon deposit of the global notes with DTC or its custodian, DTC will credit on its internal system the accounts of direct participants designated by the underwriters with portions of the principal amounts of the global
	notes.




	 




	 


	


	 


	Ownership of the Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership thereof will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC or its nominee, with respect to interests of direct participants, and the records
	of direct and indirect participants, with respect to interests of persons other than participants.




	Payments by participants
	to owners of beneficial interests in the global note held through such participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary practice as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers registered in the names of
	nominees for such customers. The participants will be responsible for those payments. Transfers between participants in DTC will be effected in accordance with DTCs rules and will be settled in immediately available funds.


	 


	S-25






	Table of Contents



	The laws of some jurisdictions require that purchasers of securities take physical delivery of
	those securities in definitive form. Accordingly, the ability to transfer interests in the Notes represented by a global note to those persons may be limited. In addition, because DTC can act only on behalf of its participants, who in turn act on
	behalf of persons who hold interests through participants, the ability of a person having an interest in Notes represented by a global note to pledge or transfer those interests to persons or entities that do not participate in DTCs system, or
	otherwise to take actions in respect of such interest, may be affected by the lack of a physical definitive security in respect of such interest.


	As long as the Notes are represented by one or more global notes, DTCs nominee will be the Holder of the Notes and therefore will be the
	only entity that can exercise a right to repayment, repurchase or conversion of the Notes. Notice by participants or indirect participants or by owners of beneficial interests in a global note held through such participants or indirect participants
	of the exercise of the option to require purchase of beneficial interests in Notes represented by a global note must be transmitted to DTC in accordance with its procedures on a form required by DTC and provided to participants. In order to ensure
	that DTCs nominee will timely exercise a right to purchase with respect to a particular note, the beneficial owner of such note must instruct the broker or the participant or indirect participant through which it holds an interest in such note
	to notify DTC of its desire to exercise a right to purchase. Different firms have cut-off times for accepting instructions from their customers and, accordingly, each beneficial owner should consult the broker or other participant or indirect
	participant through which it holds an interest in a note in order to ascertain the cut-off time by which such an instruction must be given in order for timely notice to be delivered to DTC. We will not be liable for any delay in delivery of notices
	of the exercise of the option to elect purchase.


	Notes represented by a global note will be exchangeable for registered certificated
	securities with the same terms only if: (1) DTC is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary or if DTC ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act and a successor depositary is not appointed by us within 90 days;
	(2) we decide to discontinue use of the system of book-entry transfer through DTC (or any successor depositary); or (3) an Event of Default under the Indenture occurs and is continuing.


	Neither we nor the Trustee will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of
	Notes by DTC or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records of DTC relating to the Notes.



	Concerning the Trustee



	The Bank of New York Mellon is the Trustee under the Indenture and will be appointed by us as the initial Paying Agent, registrar and custodian
	with regard to the Notes. We may maintain deposit accounts and conduct other banking transactions with the Trustee or its affiliates in the ordinary course of business. The Trustee is the trustee under indentures relating to the Existing Notes in
	addition to the Notes. The Trustee and its affiliates may from time to time in the future provide banking and other services to us in the ordinary course of their business.



	Discharge of the Indenture



	We may
	satisfy and discharge our obligations under the Indenture with respect to the Notes by:


	 




	 


	


	 


	delivering to the Trustee for cancellation all outstanding Notes; or




	 




	 


	


	 


	depositing with the Trustee, after all outstanding Notes have become due and payable (or are by their terms to become due and payable within one year), whether at stated maturity, or otherwise, cash and/or U.S.
	Government Obligations sufficient to pay all of the outstanding Notes and paying all other sums payable under the Indenture by us with respect to the Notes.




	Upon the deposit of such funds with the Trustee, the Indenture will, with certain limited exceptions, cease to be of further effect with
	respect to the Notes. The rights that would continue following the deposit of those funds with the Trustee are:


	 




	 


	


	 


	the remaining rights of registration of transfer, substitution and exchange of the Notes;




	 


	S-26






	Table of Contents





	 


	


	 


	the rights of Holders under the Indenture to receive payments due with respect to the Notes and the other rights, duties and obligations of Holders, as beneficiaries with respect to the amounts, if any, that are
	deposited with the Trustee; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	the rights, obligations and immunities of the Trustee under the Indenture.

	terms is renewable or extendible or payable out of the proceeds of similar Indebtedness incurred pursuant to the terms of any revolving credit agreement or any similar agreement at the option of such Person for a period ending more than one year

	specific land or other real property interests of us or such Restricted Subsidiary securing such Indebtedness; provided, however, that recourse, obligations or liabilities solely for indemnities, or breaches of warranties or representations in
	respect of Indebtedness, will not prevent that Indebtedness from being classified as Non-Recourse Indebtedness.


	Officers

	CERTAIN MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS



	The following summary describes certain U.S. federal income tax consequences to you of purchasing, owning and disposing of Notes. This summary
	is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), legislative history, administrative pronouncements and practices of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), judicial decisions and final, temporary and
	proposed Treasury regulations. Future changes, legislation, Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations and practices and court decisions may adversely affect, perhaps retroactively, the tax consequences described in this discussion. We can
	provide no assurance that the tax consequences described in this discussion will not be challenged by the IRS or will be sustained by a court if challenged by the IRS.


	This summary assumes that, except where otherwise specifically noted, you will acquire Notes on original issue at the issue price (the first
	price at which a substantial amount of the Notes is sold by the underwriters for money to investors) and will hold them as capital assets. It is expected, and this summary assumes, that the Notes will be issued at a price that does not result in
	original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes. It does not address all the tax consequences that may be relevant to you in light of your particular circumstances. State, local and non-U.S. income tax laws may differ substantially from
	the corresponding U.S. federal income tax laws, and this discussion does not purport to describe any aspect of the tax laws of any state, local or non-U.S. jurisdiction. This summary also does not address any aspects of U.S. federal tax laws other
	than U.S. federal income tax laws. In addition, this summary does not address the tax consequences relevant to persons who receive special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax law including, without limitation:


	 




	 


	


	 


	financial institutions, banks, and thrifts;




	 




	 


	


	 


	insurance companies;




	 




	 


	


	 


	tax-exempt organizations, retirement plans, individual retirement accounts, and tax-deferred accounts;




	 




	 


	


	 


	S corporations, controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies, regulated investment companies and real estate investment trusts and shareholders in such entities;




	 




	 


	


	 


	pass-through entities, including partnerships and entities and arrangements classified as partnerships for U.S. federal tax purposes, and beneficial owners of pass-through entities;




	 




	 


	


	 


	certain U.S. expatriates;




	 




	 


	


	 


	traders and dealers in securities or currencies;




	 




	 


	


	 


	persons subject to the alternative minimum tax;




	 




	 


	


	 


	persons holding Notes as part of a constructive sale, wash sale or other integrated transaction or a hedge, straddle or synthetic security;




	 




	 


	


	 


	persons whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	persons that acquire the Notes offered hereby for a price other than their issue price.





	You are urged to consult your tax advisor with respect to the application of the U.S. federal income tax laws to your particular situation,
	as well as any tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes arising under the federal estate or gift tax rules, under the laws of any state, local, foreign or other taxing jurisdiction or under any applicable tax treaty.



	As used in this section, the term U.S. holder means the beneficial owner of a Note that is for U.S. federal income tax
	purposes either:


	 




	 


	


	 


	an individual citizen or resident of the United States, including an alien individual who is a lawful permanent resident of the United States or who meets the substantial presence test under
	Section 7701(b) of the Code;




	 




	 


	


	 


	a corporation, including an entity treated as a corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state of the United States or the District of Columbia;




	 


	S-30






	Table of Contents





	 


	


	 


	an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or




	 




	 


	


	 


	a trust whose administration is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and which has one or more U.S. persons who have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or that has made a
	valid election to be treated as a U.S. person.




	If you are the beneficial owner of a Note that is an individual,
	corporation, estate, or trust who or that is not a U.S. holder, you are a non-U.S. holder.



	Contingent Payments



	We may be required to pay amounts in excess of the stated interest and principal payable on the Notes to some or all of the holders of the
	Notes under certain circumstances. See Offer to Repurchase Upon a Change of Control Triggering Event and Redemption at our Option. Under the Treasury Regulations regarding contingent payment debt instruments, any payment
	subject to a remote or incidental contingency (for instance, where there is a remote likelihood that the payment will be required or the potential amount of the payment is insignificant relative to the remaining payments on the debt instrument) is
	not considered a contingent payment and is ignored for purposes of computing original issue discount accruals. We intend to take the position that the Notes should not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments because of these possible
	payments. This position is binding on all holders unless the holder of a Note discloses its differing position in a statement attached to its U.S. federal income tax return for the taxable year during which the Note was acquired.



	U.S. Holders





	Taxation of Interest




	Although this summary assumes that the Notes will not be issued with original issue discount, whether the Notes are issued with
	original issue discount, and the amount thereof, will be determined as of the issue date. If the Notes principal amount exceeds the issue price by more than a de minimis amount, as determined under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations, you
	will be required to include the excess in income as original issue discount, as it accrues, in accordance with a constant-yield method based on a compounding of interest, before the receipt of cash payments attributable to this income. Nevertheless,
	on the assumption that the Notes will be issued without original issue discount, a U.S. holder generally will include in gross income payments of stated interest received or accrued on a Note, in accordance with its usual method of accounting for
	U.S. federal income tax purposes as ordinary interest income from sources within the United States.




	Sale or Exchange of Notes




	A U.S. holder generally will recognize gain or loss upon the sale or exchange of a Note equal to the difference between the amount
	realized upon the sale or exchange and the holders adjusted basis in the Note. Generally, any gain or loss will be capital gain or loss.




	Medicare Tax




	A
	3.8% Medicare contribution tax on net investment income, including taxable interest, dividends and capital gains, is imposed on U.S. individuals whose income exceeds a specified level, as well as on certain estates and trusts. Generally, the tax is
	levied on the lesser of net investment income for the year or the excess of modified adjusted gross income over $200,000 for individuals, $250,000 for spouses filing jointly, and $125,000 for spouses filing separately. In addition, the
	tax generally is imposed on certain estates and trusts on the lesser of their undistributed net investment income or the excess of such estate or trusts adjusted gross


	income over the dollar amount at which the highest tax bracket applicable to trusts and estates under Code Section 1(e) begins for the applicable tax
	year. U.S. holders that may be subject to this tax should consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect, if any, of this tax on their ownership and disposition of Notes.


	 


	S-31






	Table of Contents





	Backup Withholding and Information Reporting




	We will, where required, report to U.S. holders and the IRS the amount of any interest paid on the Notes in each calendar year and the amounts
	of tax withheld, if any, from those payments. A U.S. holder may be subject to backup withholding tax at a 28% rate with respect to payments made on the Notes as well as proceeds from the disposition of Notes unless such U.S. holder:


	 




	 


	


	 


	is a corporation or is otherwise exempt from withholding and, when required, demonstrates this fact; or




	 




	 


	


	 


	provides a taxpayer identification number, certifies that the IRS has not notified it that it is subject to backup withholding, and otherwise complies with applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules.




	Amounts paid as backup withholding do not constitute an additional tax and will be credited against the U.S. holders
	U.S. federal income tax liabilities, so long as the required information is provided to the IRS. A U.S. holder who does not provide the payor with his or her correct taxpayer identification number may be subject to penalties imposed by the IRS.



	Non-U.S. Holders





	Taxation of
	Interest




	Subject to the discussion below regarding the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) and backup
	withholding, interest received or accrued on the Notes by a non-U.S. holder will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes or withholding tax if that interest is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United
	States by the non-U.S. holder and such non-U.S. holder:


	 




	 


	


	 


	does not actually or constructively own 10% or more of the total combined voting power of our outstanding stock;




	 




	 


	


	 


	is not a controlled foreign corporation with respect to which we are, directly or indirectly, a related person;




	 




	 


	


	 


	is not a bank receiving interest described in section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	appropriately certifies as to its foreign status.




	A non-U.S. holder can generally meet this
	certification requirement by providing a properly executed Form W-8BEN, Form W-8BEN-E or appropriate substitute form to us or our Paying Agent. If the non-U.S. holder holds the Notes through a financial institution or other agent acting on the
	non-U.S. holders behalf, the non-U.S. holder may be required to provide appropriate documentation to the agent. The non-U.S. holders agent will then generally be required to provide appropriate certifications, including IRS Form W-8IMY
	(or successor form), to us or our Paying Agent, either directly or through other intermediaries. Special certification rules apply to foreign estates and trusts, and in certain circumstances certifications as to foreign status of trust owners or
	beneficiaries may have to be provided to us or our Paying Agent.


	If a non-U.S. holder does not qualify for an exemption under these
	rules, interest income will be subject to withholding tax at the rate of 30% at the time the interest is paid, unless the non-U.S. holder provides us or our Paying Agent, as applicable, with a properly executed IRS Form W-8BEN or Form W-8BEN-E (or
	successor form) claiming an exemption from or reduction in withholding due to the benefit of an applicable U.S. income tax treaty, or IRS Form W-8ECI (or successor form) stating that interest paid on the Note is not subject to withholding tax
	because it is effectively connected with the non-U.S. holders U.S. trade or business. If a non-U.S. holder is engaged in a trade or business in the United States and interest on a Note is effectively connected with the conduct of that trade or
	business or, if a U.S. income tax treaty applies, the non-U.S. holder maintains a permanent establishment in the United States to which the income is attributable, the non-U.S. holder will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net
	income basis at the rates applicable to U.S. persons generally. In


	 


	S-32






	Table of Contents



	addition, if a non-U.S. holder is a foreign corporation and the payment of interest is effectively connected with the non-U.S. holders U.S. trade or business, the non-U.S. holder may be
	subject to a 30% branch profits tax.




	Sales or Exchanges of Notes




	A non-U.S. holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any amount which constitutes capital gain upon retirement or
	disposition of a Note, unless either of the following is true:


	 




	 


	


	 


	The non-U.S. holders investment in the Note is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business; or




	 




	 


	


	 


	The non-U.S. holder is a nonresident alien individual holding the Note as a capital asset and is present in the United States for 183 or more days in the taxable year within which the sale, redemption or other
	disposition takes place and certain other conditions exist.




	If the non-U.S. holder has a U.S. trade or business and the
	investment in the Notes is effectively connected with such U.S. trade or business or, if a U.S. income tax treaty applies, such non-U.S. holder maintains a permanent establishment in the United States to which the income is attributable,
	the payment of the sale proceeds with respect to the Notes would be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net basis at the rate applicable to U.S. persons generally. In addition, a foreign corporation may be subject to a 30% branch profits tax if
	the foreign corporations investment in a Note is effectively connected with its U.S. trade or business. An individual non-U.S. holder who is subject to U.S. federal income tax because the non-U.S. holder was present in the United States for
	183 days or more during the year of sale, redemption or other disposition of the Notes will be subject to a flat 30% tax on the gain derived from that sale, redemption or other disposition, which gain may be offset by any U.S. source capital losses
	the non-U.S. holder may have.




	Additional Withholding Requirements




	On March 18, 2010, FATCA was signed into law as part of the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act. Under certain circumstances,
	FATCA will impose a withholding tax of 30% on (i) certain payments of U.S. source interest, and, (ii) beginning on January 1, 2019, the gross proceeds receivable from the sale or disposition of certain assets that give rise to U.S.
	source dividend or interest payments, including the Notes. In general, no FATCA withholding will be required with respect to the Notes to the extent that a non-U.S. holder provides to us the documentation described above in Non-U.S.
	HoldersTaxation of Interest certifying such non-U.S. holders FATCA compliance. Prospective investors are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the possible implications of FATCA with respect of the Notes.




	Backup Withholding and Information Reporting




	We will generally file information returns with the IRS with respect to payments we make to non-U.S. holders. Backup withholding generally will
	not be required with respect to interest paid to a non-U.S. holder to the extent that such non-U.S. holder provides to us the documentation described above in Non-U.S. holdersTaxation of Interest or the non-U.S. holder is an exempt
	recipient and, in each case, we do not have actual knowledge that the beneficial owner of such payment is a U.S. person. Copies of information returns reporting such payments and any withholding may also be made available to the tax authorities in
	the country in which a non-U.S. holder resides under the provisions of a treaty or agreement.


	Information reporting requirements and,
	depending on the circumstances, backup withholding tax will apply to any payment of the proceeds of the sale of a Note by a non-U.S. holder when such sale is effected within the United States or conducted through certain U.S. related financial
	intermediaries, unless the beneficial owner certifies under penalty of perjury that it is a non-U.S. holder (and we do not have actual knowledge or reason to know that the beneficial owner is a U.S. person as defined in the Code), or the beneficial
	owner otherwise establishes its right to an exemption.

	Table of Contents



	If you are a non-U.S. holder, you should consult your tax advisor regarding the application of
	information reporting and backup withholding in your particular situation, the availability of an exemption from information reporting and backup withholding, and the procedure for obtaining the exemption, if available. Any amounts withheld from
	payments to you under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit against your U.S. federal income tax liability, provided that the required information is furnished to the IRS.



	THE SUMMARY ABOVE IS NOT INTENDED TO CONSTITUTE A COMPLETE ANALYSIS OF ALL TAX CONSIDERATIONS APPLICABLE TO INVESTORS WITH RESPECT TO THEIR
	ACQUISITION, OWNERSHIP OR DISPOSITION OF NOTES, AND INVESTORS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE TAX CONSIDERATIONS APPLICABLE TO THEM IN THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES.

	CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS



	The following summary regarding certain aspects of the United States Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or
	ERISA, and the Code is based on ERISA, the Code, judicial decisions and United States Department of Labor and IRS regulations and rulings that are in existence on the date of this prospectus supplement. This summary is general in nature
	and does not address every issue pertaining to ERISA that may be applicable to us, the Notes or a particular investor. Accordingly, each prospective investor, including plan fiduciaries, should consult with his, her or its own advisors or counsel
	with respect to the advisability of an investment in the Notes, and potentially adverse consequences of such investment, including, without limitation, certain ERISA-related issues that affect or may affect the investor with respect to this
	investment and the possible effects of changes in the applicable laws.




	General Fiduciary Matters




	ERISA imposes certain requirements on employee benefit plans subject to Title I of ERISA and on entities that are deemed to hold the plan
	assets of such plans within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101 as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA or otherwise (collectively, ERISA Plans), and on those persons who are fiduciaries with respect to ERISA Plans.
	Investments by ERISA Plans are subject to ERISAs general fiduciary requirements, including, but not limited to, the requirement of investment prudence and diversification and the requirement that an ERISA Plans investments be made in
	accordance with the documents governing the ERISA Plan. Non-U.S. plans, U.S. governmental plans and certain U.S. church plans, while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Section 406 of ERISA or the prohibited transaction
	provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code (as discussed below), may nevertheless be subject to non-U.S., state, local or other federal laws or regulations that are substantially similar to the foregoing provisions of ERISA and the Code
	(Similar Law). Prior to purchasing any Notes, fiduciaries of ERISA Plans should evaluate whether the acquisition and holding of the Notes is prudent and in the interests of the ERISA Plan, considering, among other things, the role that
	the Notes would play in the ERISA Plans portfolio, taking into consideration whether the investment is designed reasonably to further the ERISA Plans purposes, the risk and return factors associated with the investment, the composition
	of the ERISA Plans total investment portfolio with regard to diversification, the liquidity and current return of the ERISA Plans portfolio relative to its anticipated cash flow needs, and the projected return of the ERISA Plans
	portfolio relative to its objectives. If the investor is an employee benefit plan that is not subject to ERISA, the Investor (including persons responsible for the decision to purchase and acquire the Notes) should consider whether the acquisition
	and holding of the Notes meets all requirements of, and is consistent with and within the limits of, any Similar Law and other federal, state, local, foreign or other laws or regulations applicable to the Investor and its investments. Fiduciaries of
	ERISA Plans or other plan investors should consult with their counsel before purchasing any Notes to determine the suitability of the Notes for such plan and the need for, and the availability, if necessary, of any exemptive relief under any such
	laws or regulations.




	Prohibited Transaction Issues




	Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan (as well as
	those plans that are not subject to ERISA but which are subject to Section 4975 of the Code, such as individual retirement accounts (together with ERISA Plans, Plans)) and certain persons (referred to as parties in
	interest or disqualified persons) having certain relationships to such Plans, unless a statutory or administrative exemption is applicable to the transaction. Certain affiliates of the Company provide or may provide services to
	Plans. Therefore, it is possible that the Company could be considered a party in interest and a disqualified person with respect to a Plan. To the extent that a Plan engages in a prohibited transaction for which no exemption
	is available, the fiduciary that caused the Plan to engage in the transaction may be subject to liability. Additionally, the disqualified person involved in the prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes under the Code.

	Table of Contents



	Any Plan fiduciary which proposes to cause a Plan to purchase the Notes should consult with its
	counsel regarding the applicability of the fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code to such an investment, and to confirm that such purchase and holding of any Notes is in accordance
	with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction or any other violation of an applicable requirement of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code.


	The fiduciary of a Plan that proposes to purchase and hold any Notes should consider, among other things, whether such purchase and holding
	may involve a prohibited transaction, including, without limitation, (i) the direct or indirect extension of credit between a Plan and a party in interest or a disqualified person, (ii) the sale or exchange of any property between a Plan
	and a party in interest or a disqualified person, or (iii) the transfer to, or use by or for the benefit of, a party in interest or disqualified person, of any Plan assets. Purchase and/or holding of the Notes by a Plan with respect to which
	the Company or the underwriters, among others, are or become a party in interest or disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, unless
	the Notes are acquired and held in accordance with an applicable exemption.


	Certain exemptions from the prohibited transaction rules of
	Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code could be applicable to the purchase and holding of notes by a Plan, depending on the type and circumstances of the fiduciary making the decision to acquire such notes and the relationship
	of the party in interest or disqualified person to the Plan. Included among these exemptions are:


	Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and
	Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code for certain transactions between a Plan and certain service providers to the Plan. In addition, the U.S. Department of Labor (the DOL) has issued certain administrative prohibited transaction
	exemptions that may apply to the purchase and holding of notes, including Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption (PTCE) 84-14 (relating to transactions effected by a qualified professional asset manager), PTCE 90-1 (relating
	to investments by insurance company pooled separate accounts), PTCE 91-38 (relating to investments by bank collective investment funds), PTCE 95-60 (relating to investments by insurance company general accounts) and PTCE 96-23 (relating to
	transactions directed by an in-house asset manager) (collectively, the Class and Statutory Exemptions).


	Each of these
	exemptions contains conditions and limitations on its application, and there can be no assurance that any Class and Statutory Exemption or any other exemption will be available with respect to any particular transaction involving the Notes.
	Fiduciaries of Plans should consult with their counsel regarding the availability of any exemption before purchasing any Notes.




	Consultation with Counsel




	The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be comprehensive; by its offer of the Notes, the Company does not make any
	representation that purchase or holding of such Notes meets the relevant legal requirements with respect to any particular investor. The complexity of these rules, and the severity of potential penalties, make it particularly important that
	fiduciaries or other persons considering an acquisition of Notes on behalf of or with the plan assets of any Plan, or plan subject to Similar Law, consult with its counsel regarding the suitability of an acquisition of the Notes in light of such
	prospective purchasers particular circumstances.




	Deemed Representation




	By its acceptance of any Note or any interest in a Note, the purchaser of the Note will be deemed to have represented, warranted and covenanted
	that, throughout the period that it holds such Note or an interest in it, either:


	(1) it is not acquiring or holding such
	Note or an interest in it with the assets of (A) an employee benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) that is subject to Part 4 of Subtitle B of Title I of


	 


	S-36






	Table of Contents



	ERISA, (B) a plan to which Section 4975 of the Code applies, (C) any entity whose underlying assets include plan assets of any of the foregoing by reason of
	an employee benefit plans or plans investment in such entity or (D) a governmental plan (as described in Section 3(32) of ERISA), church plan (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA and that has not made an election under
	Section 410(d) of the Code) or a non-U.S. plan subject to Similar Law; or


	(2) the acquisition and holding of such
	Note by it, throughout the period that it holds such Note and the disposition of such Note or an interest in it, will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or
	a violation of any provisions of any applicable Similar Law.

	The underwriting agreement provides that the obligations of the underwriters to purchase the Notes included in
	this offering are subject to approval of legal matters by counsel and to other conditions. The underwriters are obligated to purchase all the Notes if they purchase any of the Notes.


	Notes sold by the underwriters to the public will initially be offered at the initial public offering price set forth on the cover of this
	prospectus supplement. Any Notes sold by the underwriters to securities dealers may be sold at a discount from the initial public offering price not to exceed 0.400% of the principal amount per Note. Any such securities dealers may resell any Notes
	purchased from the underwriters to certain other brokers or dealers at a discount from the initial public offering price not to exceed 0.250% of the principal amount per Note. If not all the Notes are sold at the initial offering price, the
	underwriters may change the offering price and the other selling terms.


	The following table shows the underwriting discount that we are
	to pay to the underwriters in connection with this offering (expressed as a percentage of the principal amount per Note).


	 
















	 


	  



	Paid by Lennar



	 





	Per Note



	  


	 


	0.650


	% 




	We estimate that our expenses with regard to this offering will be approximately $1,100,000. The underwriters
	have agreed to reimburse us for certain fees and expenses included in those expenses.


	In connection with the offering, the underwriters
	may purchase and sell Notes in the open market. Purchases and sales in the open market may include short sales, purchases to cover short positions and stabilizing purchases.


	 




	 


	


	 


	Short sales involve secondary market sales by the underwriters of a greater principal amount of Notes than they are required to purchase in the offering.




	 




	 


	


	 


	Covering transactions involve purchases of Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions.




	 




	 


	


	 


	Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase Notes so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum.




	 


	S-38






	Table of Contents



	Purchases to cover short positions and stabilizing purchases, as well as other purchases by the
	underwriters for their own accounts, may have the effect of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the Notes. They may also cause the price of the Notes to be higher than the price that would otherwise exist in the open market in
	the absence of these transactions. The underwriters may conduct these transactions in the over-the-counter market or otherwise. If the underwriters commence any of these transactions, they may discontinue them at any time.


	We expect to deliver the Notes against payment for the Notes on or about the date specified in the last paragraph on the cover page of this
	prospectus supplement, which will be the fifth business day following the date of the pricing of the Notes. In accordance with Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in three business
	days, unless the parties to a trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade Notes on the date of pricing or the next succeeding business day will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially will settle in
	T+5, to specify alternative settlement arrangements to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to trade the Notes on the date of pricing or the next succeeding business day should consult their own advisors.



	Conflicts of Interest



	As described in
	Use of Proceeds, we intend to use the net proceeds of this offering for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of debt, which may include the repayment or repurchase of our 6.50% senior notes due 2016 in full or in part. The
	6.50% senior notes due 2016 mature on April 15, 2016. Certain of the underwriters (or their affiliates) may hold some of our 6.50% senior notes due 2016 and would receive a portion of the proceeds from this offering if we use the net proceeds to
	repay or repurchase those notes. If any one underwriter, together with its affiliates, were to receive 5% or more of the net proceeds as a result of the repayment or repurchase, such underwriter would be deemed to have a conflict of
	interest with us in regard to this offering under FINRA Rule 5121. Accordingly, this offering will be conducted in accordance with FINRA Rule 5121. No underwriter with a conflict of interest under FINRA Rule 5121 will confirm sales
	to any discretionary accounts without receiving specific written approval from the account holder. Pursuant to FINRA Rule 5121(a)(1)(A), the appointment of a qualified independent underwriter is not required in connection with this
	offering because the FINRA member primarily responsible for managing this offering does not have a conflict of interest, is not an affiliate of any member that has a conflict of interest and meets the requirements of paragraph (f)(12)(E) of FINRA
	Rule 5121. See Use of Proceeds.



	Other Relationships



	The underwriters and their affiliates have performed investment banking, commercial banking, dealer and advisory services for us or our
	affiliates from time to time, for which they have received customary fees and expenses. The underwriters or their affiliates may, from time to time, engage in transactions with and perform services for us or our affiliates in the ordinary course of
	their respective businesses. Among other things, affiliates of certain of the underwriters are participants in our Credit Agreement and have entered into other credit arrangements with us. To the extent that any of the proceeds of this offering are
	used to repay indebtedness under our Credit Agreement or under these other credit arrangements, these affiliates will receive all or a portion of the proceeds from this offering.


	If any of the underwriters or their affiliates has a lending relationship with us, certain of those underwriters or their affiliates routinely
	hedge, and certain other of those underwriters or their affiliates may hedge their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, these underwriters and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by
	entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could
	adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby.


	We have agreed to indemnify the underwriters against certain
	liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments the underwriters may be required to make because of any of those liabilities.

	offer of securities shall require us or any underwriter to publish a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive.

	to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe for the securities, as the expression may be varied in that member state by any measure implementing the Prospectus Directive in that member state, and the expression
	Prospectus Directive means Directive 2003/71/EC (and amendments thereto, including the 2010 PD Amending Directive, to the extent implemented in the relevant member state) and includes any relevant implementing measure in each relevant
	member state. The expression 2010 PD Amending Directive means Directive 2010/73/EU.


	The sellers of the Notes have not authorized and do
	not authorize the making of any offer of Notes through any financial intermediary on their behalf, other than offers made by the underwriters with a view to the final placement of the Notes as contemplated in this prospectus supplement. Accordingly,
	no purchaser of Notes, other than the underwriters, is authorized to make any further offer of the Notes on behalf of the sellers or the underwriters.

	ABOUT THIS PROSPECTUS



	This prospectus is part of a registration statement filed by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, utilizing a
	shelf registration process. Under this shelf process, we may, from time to time, sell any securities or combination of securities described in this prospectus in one or more offerings. This prospectus provides you with a general
	description of the securities we may offer. Each time we offer to sell securities, we will provide a prospectus supplement that will contain specific information about the securities that are being offered and the terms of the offering. The
	prospectus supplement may also add, update or change information contained in this prospectus. You should read both this prospectus and any applicable prospectus supplement together with additional information described under the headings
	Where You Can Find More Information and Incorporation of Certain Documents by Reference, or similar headings.


	In
	this prospectus, except as otherwise indicated, the terms Company, we, us or our mean Lennar Corporation and all entities included in our consolidated financial statements.





	LENNAR CORPORATION



	We are one of the nations largest homebuilders. Our homebuilding operations include the construction and sale of single-family attached
	and detached homes, as well as the purchase, development and sale of residential land directly and through unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. We conduct homebuilding activities in various states, with our largest homebuilding
	operations in Florida, Texas and California. We have grouped our homebuilding activities into five reportable segments, which we refer to as Homebuilding East, Homebuilding Central, Homebuilding West, Homebuilding Southeast Florida and Homebuilding
	Houston. We include homebuilding activities that are not in those reportable segments under Homebuilding Other. We also have three other reportable segments: Lennar Financial Services (Financial Services), Rialto Investments
	(Rialto) and Lennar Multifamily (Multifamily). Our Financial Services segment provides mortgage financing, title insurance and closing services for both buyers of our homes and others. Our Rialto segments operations
	include raising, investing and managing third party capital, originating and securitizing commercial mortgage loans, as well as investing its own capital in real estate related mortgage loans, properties and related securities. Our Multifamily

	SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS



	Forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) are statements that relate to
	expectations, beliefs, projections, future plans and strategies, anticipated events or trends concerning matters that are not historical facts. These statements are often preceded by or include the words believe, expect,
	intend, estimate, anticipate, will, may, could, should or similar expressions. This prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference in this prospectus contain
	forward-looking statements including, but not limited to, statements regarding: our belief that the Company is well positioned to be able to continue to perform well in current market conditions; our belief that the recovery is continuing its
	progression at a slow and steady pace, and that it is supported on the downside by the significant production deficit that has been built over the past seven years; our expectation that we will continue to invest in carefully underwritten strategic
	land acquisitions; our belief that we are on track to achieve another year of strong profits; our expectation that the main driver of our earnings will continue to be our homebuilding and Financial Services operations; our belief that the recovery
	will continue to benefit the rental market; our expectation regarding the pipeline of future projects in the Multifamily segment; our expectation that our ancillary businesses will enhance shareholder value; our intent to settle the face value of
	the 2.75% convertible senior notes due 2020 in cash; our expectation regarding our variability in our quarterly results; our belief that Rialto Mortgage Finance will be a significant contributor to Rialtos revenues in the near future; our
	expectations regarding the renewal or replacement of our warehouse facilities; our belief regarding draws upon our bonds or letters of credit, and our belief regarding the impact to the Company if there were such a draw; our belief that our
	operations and borrowing resources will provide for our current and long-term capital requirements at our anticipated levels of activity; and our estimates regarding certain tax matters and accounting valuations, including our expectations regarding
	the result of anticipated settlements with various taxing authorities.


	These statements, as well as other forward-looking statements
	contained in this prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference in this prospectus, are based on our current plans and expectations and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. We caution readers that certain important factors
	could cause actual results and events to differ significantly from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. These factors include, among others, the following: a slowdown in the recovery of real estate markets across the nation, or any
	downturn in such markets; changes in general economic and financial conditions, and demographic trends, in the U.S. leading to decreased demand for our services and homes, lower profit margins and reduced access to credit; unfavorable or
	unanticipated outcomes in legal proceedings that substantially exceed our expectations; the possibility that we will incur non-recurring costs that may not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition, but may have a
	material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements for a particular reporting period; decreased demand for our Multifamily rental properties; our ability to acquire land and pursue real estate opportunities at anticipated prices;
	increased competition for home sales from other sellers of new and resale homes; conditions in the capital, credit and financial markets, including mortgage lending standards, the availability of mortgage financing and mortgage foreclosure rates;
	changes in interest and unemployment rates, and inflation; a decline in the value of the land and home inventories we maintain or possible future write-downs of the book value of our real estate assets; increases in operating costs, including costs
	related to real estate taxes, construction materials, labor and insurance, and our ability to manage our cost structure, both in our Homebuilding and Multifamily businesses; our inability to maintain anticipated pricing levels and our inability to
	predict the effect of interest rates on demand; the ability and willingness of the participants in various joint ventures to honor their commitments; our ability to successfully and timely obtain land-use entitlements and construction financing, and
	address issues that arise in connection with the use and development of our land; natural disasters and other unforeseen damage for which our insurance may not provide adequate coverage; our inability to successfully grow our ancillary businesses;
	potential liability under environmental or construction laws, or other laws or regulations affecting our business; our ability to comply with the terms of our debt instruments; and our ability to successfully estimate the impact of certain
	regulatory, accounting and tax matters.


	The list of risks above is not exhaustive. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is
	not possible for management to predict all such risk factors or to assess the impact of such risk factors on our business. As a

	result, no assurance can be given as to our future results or achievements. You should not place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements contained herein, which speak only as of the date
	of this prospectus. We do not intend, or assume any obligation, to update or revise any forward-looking statements contained in this prospectus, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.








	USE OF PROCEEDS



	Unless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement, we intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of the securities offered
	by this prospectus for general corporate purposes, which may include the repayment of indebtedness, working capital, capital expenditures, acquiring and developing land and repaying or repurchasing existing debt. Pending use for these purposes, we
	may invest proceeds from the sale of the securities in short-term marketable securities. Unless the applicable prospectus supplement indicates otherwise, we will not receive any proceeds from the sale of securities by selling stockholders.








	SELLING STOCKHOLDERS



	We may register securities covered by this prospectus to permit selling stockholders to resell their securities. We may register securities
	for resale by selling stockholders by filing a prospectus supplement with the SEC. The prospectus supplement would set forth information about the selling stockholders, including their names, the amounts of their securities that will be sold, their
	beneficial ownership of the securities and their relationship with us.





	RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES



	The following table sets forth our ratio of earnings to fixed charges for the five fiscal years ended November 30, 2013 and the
	nine months ended August 31, 2014. For the purpose of calculating the ratio of earnings to fixed charges, earnings consist of income before income taxes plus fixed charges and certain other adjustments. Fixed
	charges consist of interest incurred on all indebtedness (including amortization of original issue discount and including additional interest on two issues of senior notes) and the implied interest component of our rent obligations. There was
	no preferred stock outstanding for any of the periods presented. Accordingly, the ratios of earnings to combined fixed charges and preferred stock dividends were identical to the ratios of earnings to fixed charges.

	DESCRIPTION OF DEBT SECURITIES



	The following is a description of the general terms and provisions that may apply to debt securities we offer. The particular terms of any
	debt securities that are offered will be described in the prospectus supplement relating to those debt securities, which may add, update or change the terms described in this prospectus. To review the terms of any debt securities offered by this
	prospectus, you must review both this prospectus and the relevant prospectus supplement.


	We may issue debt securities under either
	(a) an indenture dated as of December 31, 1997, with The Bank of New York Mellon, as successor trustee, or (b) one or more other indentures with that or another trustee. We may supplement any of these indentures from time to time. The
	following paragraphs describe the provisions of the current indenture. We have filed the indenture dated December 31, 1997, as an exhibit to Registration Statement File No. 333-45527, at which time the trustee was J.P. Morgan Trust
	Company, N.A., the successor in interest to the original trustee, The First National Bank of Chicago. You can inspect that indenture as described under Where You Can Find More Information or at the office of the trustee that is a party
	to it.



	General



	The debt securities
	will be direct obligations of our Company and may be either senior debt securities or subordinated debt securities. Some or all of the co-registrants under the registration statement which includes this prospectus (each of which is our direct or
	indirect wholly-owned subsidiary) may guaranty our payment of debt securities issued under this prospectus. In addition, the debt securities may be secured by the shares of some or all of our subsidiaries or by other assets. None of the indentures
	relating to our currently outstanding debt securities limits the principal amount of debt securities that we may issue. We may offer one or more issues of debt securities. An indenture or a supplemental indenture will set forth specific terms of
	each issue of debt securities. There will be prospectus supplements relating to particular issues or series of debt securities. Each prospectus supplement will describe:


	 




	 


	


	 


	the title of the debt securities and whether the debt securities are senior or subordinated debt securities;




	 




	 


	


	 


	any limit upon the aggregate principal amount of the issue or series of debt securities which we may issue;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the date or dates on which principal of the debt securities will be payable and the amount of principal which will be payable;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the rate or rates (which may be fixed or variable) at which the debt securities will bear interest, if any, or contingent interest, if any, as well as the dates from which interest will accrue, the dates on which
	interest will be payable, the persons to whom interest will be payable, if other than the registered holders on the record date, and the record date for the interest payable on any payment date;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the currency or currencies in which principal, premium, if any, and interest, if any, will be paid;




	 




	 


	


	 


	whether our obligations with regard to the debt securities are guaranteed by some or all of our subsidiaries;




	 




	 


	


	 


	whether our obligations with regard to the debt securities are secured by shares of some or all of our subsidiaries or by other assets;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the place or places where principal, premium, if any, and interest, if any, on the debt securities will be payable and where debt securities which are in registered form can be presented for registration of transfer or
	exchange;




	 




	 


	


	 


	any provisions regarding our right to prepay debt securities or of holders to require us to prepay debt securities;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the right, if any, of holders of the debt securities to convert them into common stock or other securities, including any contingent conversion provisions;




	 


	5






	Table of Contents





	 


	


	 


	any provisions requiring or permitting us to make payments to a sinking fund which will be used to redeem debt securities or a purchase fund which will be used to purchase debt securities;




	 




	 


	


	 


	any index or formula used to determine the required payments of principal, premium, if any, or interest, if any;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the percentage of the principal amount of the debt securities which is payable if maturity of the debt securities is accelerated because of a default;




	 




	 


	


	 


	any special or modified events of default or covenants with respect to the debt securities; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	any other material terms of the debt securities.




	None of the indentures relating to Lennar
	Corporations currently outstanding debt securities contains any restrictions on the payment of dividends or the repurchase of our securities or any financial covenants. However, supplemental indentures relating to particular series of debt
	securities, or future indentures, may contain provisions of that type.


	We may issue debt securities at a discount from, or at a premium
	to, their stated principal amount. A prospectus supplement may describe federal income tax considerations and other special considerations applicable to a debt security issued with original issue discount or at a premium.


	If the principal of, premium, if any, or interest, if any, with regard to any series of debt securities is payable in a foreign currency, then
	in the prospectus supplement relating to those debt securities, we will describe any restrictions on currency conversions, tax considerations or other material restrictions with respect to that issue of debt securities.



	Form of Debt Securities



	We may issue
	debt securities in certificated or uncertificated form, in registered form with or without coupons or in bearer form with coupons, if applicable.


	We may issue debt securities of an issue or a series in the form of one or more global certificates evidencing all or a portion of the
	aggregate principal amount of the debt securities of that issue or series. We may deposit the global certificates with depositaries, and the global certificates may be subject to restrictions upon transfer or upon exchange for debt securities in
	individually certificated form.



	Events of Default and Remedies



	An event of default with respect to each issue or series of debt securities will include:


	 




	 


	


	 


	our default in payment of the principal of or premium, if any, on debt securities of the issue or series beyond any applicable grace period;




	 




	 


	


	 


	our default for 30 days or a different period specified in a supplemental indenture, which may be no period, in payment of any installment of interest due with regard to debt securities of the issue or series;




	 




	 


	


	 


	our default for 60 days after notice or a different period specified in a supplemental indenture, which may be no period, in the observance or performance of any other covenants in the indenture; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	certain events involving our bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization.




	Supplemental
	indentures relating to particular issues or series of debt securities may include other events of default.


	The current indenture provides
	that the trustee may withhold notice to the holders of any issue or series of debt securities of any default (except a default in payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, if any) if the trustee considers it in the interest of the holders
	to do so.


	 


	6






	Table of Contents



	The current indenture provides that if any event of default has occurred and is continuing, the
	trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the issue or series of debt securities then outstanding may declare the principal of and accrued interest, if any, on all the debt securities of that issue or series to be due and
	payable immediately. However, if we cure all defaults (except the failure to pay principal, premium or interest which became due solely because of the acceleration) and certain other conditions are met, that declaration may be annulled and past
	defaults may be waived by the holders of a majority in principal amount of the issue or series of debt securities then outstanding.


	The
	holders of a majority of the outstanding principal amount of an issue or series of debt securities will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting proceedings for any remedy available to the trustee, subject to certain
	limitations specified in the indenture.


	A prospectus supplement will describe any additional or different events of default which apply
	to any issue or series of debt securities.



	Modification of an Indenture



	We and the trustee under an indenture may:


	 




	 


	


	 


	without the consent of holders of debt securities, modify the indenture to cure errors or clarify ambiguities;




	 




	 


	


	 


	with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the debt securities which are outstanding under the indenture, modify the indenture or the rights of the holders of the debt securities
	generally; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in outstanding principal amount of any issue or series of debt securities, modify any supplemental indenture relating solely to that series of debt securities
	or the rights of the holders of that issue or series of debt securities.




	However, we may not:


	 




	 


	


	 


	extend the fixed maturity of any debt securities, reduce the rate or extend the time for payment of interest, if any, on any debt securities, reduce the principal amount of any debt securities or the premium, if any, on
	any debt securities, impair or affect the right of a holder to institute suit for the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, if any, with regard to any debt securities, change the currency in which any debt securities are payable or
	impair the right, if any, to convert any debt securities into common stock or any other of our securities, without the consent of each holder of debt securities who will be affected; or




	 




	 


	


	 


	reduce the percentage of holders of debt securities required to consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver, without the consent of the holders of all the then outstanding debt securities or outstanding debt
	securities of a series which will be affected.





	Mergers and Other Transactions



	Our current indenture provides that we may not consolidate with or merge into any other entity, or transfer or lease our properties and assets
	substantially as an entirety to another person, unless (1) the entity formed by the consolidation or into which we are merged, or which acquires or leases our properties and assets substantially as an entirety, assumes by a supplemental
	indenture all our obligations with regard to outstanding debt securities and our other covenants under the indenture, and (2) with regard to each issue or series of debt securities, immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no event
	of default, with respect to that series of debt securities, and no event which would become an event of default, will have occurred and be continuing.

	Table of Contents




	Guarantees



	Debt securities may be guaranteed by some or all of our wholly-owned (i.e., 100% owned) subsidiaries. Those guarantees may remain in effect for
	the life of the guaranteed debt securities, or may terminate on the occurrence of specified events or circumstances. The prospectus supplement describing an issue of debt securities that are guaranteed by some or all of our wholly-owned subsidiaries
	will identify the guarantor subsidiaries, either by name or by category, and will describe the terms of the guarantee, including any conditions to its effectiveness and any events or circumstances under which it will be suspended or terminate.



	Concerning the Trustees



	The Bank of New
	York Mellon, the trustee under our current indenture, or its affiliates, provide, and may continue to provide, loans and banking services to us in the ordinary course of their businesses.



	Governing Law



	Each of our indentures,
	each supplemental indenture, and the debt securities issued under them will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of New York State.








	DESCRIPTION OF WARRANTS



	Each issue of warrants will be the subject of a warrant agreement which will contain the terms of the warrants. We will distribute a
	prospectus supplement with regard to each issue of warrants. Each prospectus supplement will describe, as to the warrants to which it relates:


	 




	 


	


	 


	the securities which may be purchased by exercising the warrants (which may be Class A common stock, Class B common stock, preferred shares, participating preferred shares, debt securities, depositary shares or
	units consisting of two or more of those types of securities);




	 




	 


	


	 


	the exercise price of the warrants (which may be wholly or partly payable in cash or wholly or partly payable with other types of consideration);




	 




	 


	


	 


	the period during which the warrants may be exercised;




	 




	 


	


	 


	any provision adjusting the securities which may be purchased on exercise of the warrants and the exercise price of the warrants in order to prevent dilution or otherwise;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the place or places where warrants can be presented for exercise or for registration of transfer or exchange; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	any other material terms of the warrants.










	DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL
	STOCK




	General



	At the date of
	this prospectus, we were authorized to issue up to 300,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, $0.10 par value, 90,000,000 shares of Class B common stock, $0.10 par value, 100,000,000 shares of participating preferred stock, $0.10 par value,
	and 500,000 shares of preferred stock, $10.00 par value. At August 31, 2014, 173,941,743 shares of our Class A common stock, 31,303,195 shares of our Class B common stock and no shares of participating preferred stock or preferred stock
	were outstanding. Our Class A common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol LEN and our Class B common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol LEN.B.

	Description of Common Stock




	Dividend Rights



	Subject to preferences
	that may apply to any shares of preferred stock and participating preferred stock outstanding at the time, the holders of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock will be entitled to share equally, on a per share basis, in any
	dividends that our Board of Directors may determine to issue from time to time. In the event that a dividend is paid in the form of shares of Class A common stock or Class B common stock, our Board of Directors may determine that the holders of
	shares of Class A common stock will receive Class A common stock, and the holders of shares of Class B common stock will receive Class B common stock.



	Voting Rights



	Our Class B common stock
	is identical in every respect with our Class A common stock, except that (a) each share of Class B common stock entitles the holder to ten votes on each matter submitted to the vote of the common stockholders, while each share of
	Class A common stock entitles the holder to only one vote, (b) amendments to provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation relating to the Class A common stock or the Class B common stock require the approval of a majority of the
	shares of Class A common stock which are voted with regard to them (as well as approval of a majority in voting power of all the outstanding Class A common stock and Class B common stock combined), and (c) under the Delaware General
	Corporation Law (DGCL), certain matters affecting the rights of holders of Class B common stock may require approval of the holders of the Class B common stock voting as a separate class. The holders of our common stock do not have
	cumulative voting rights.


	As of August 31, 2014, Stuart A. Miller, our Chief Executive Officer, had voting control, through
	family-owned entities and personal holdings, of Class A and Class B common stock which would entitle Mr. Miller to approximately 44.3% of the combined votes that could be cast by the holders of our outstanding Class A and Class B
	common stock combined. That gives significant influence to Mr. Miller in electing our directors and approving matters that are presented to our stockholders. Mr. Millers voting power might discourage someone from making a significant
	equity investment in us, even if we needed the investment to meet our obligations and to operate our business.



	Liquidation Rights



	In the event of our dissolution or liquidation, after satisfaction of all our debts and liabilities, the payment of liquidating dividends to
	the holders of any preferred stock that may be outstanding equal to the amounts to which they are preferentially entitled, and the payment of a liquidating distribution totaling $10.00 per share to the holders of any participating preferred stock
	that may be outstanding, the holders of Class A and Class B common stock will be entitled to a liquidating distribution totaling $10.00 per share. Any liquidating distributions to the holders of the participating preferred stock and the
	Class A and Class B common stock in excess of $10.00 per share will be made to the holders of all those classes on an equal per share basis without regard to class.



	Termination of Class Rights and Powers



	If at any time (i) the number of outstanding shares of our Class B common stock is less than 10% of the number of outstanding shares of
	Class A common stock and Class B common stock taken together, or (ii) the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Class B common stock vote to cause all the Class B common stock to be converted into Class A common stock,
	the Class B common stock will automatically be converted into, and become for all purposes, shares of Class A common stock, and we will no longer be authorized to issue Class B common stock.



	No Other Rights



	Holders of our common
	stock are not entitled to preemptive, redemption, subscription or conversion rights other than as described above. The rights, preferences and privileges of holders of common stock could be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of
	the holders of shares of any preferred stock or participating preferred stock, if any, which may be issued in the future.

	Description of Preferred Stock



	We may issue preferred stock in series with any rights and preferences which may be authorized by our Board of Directors. We will distribute a
	prospectus supplement with regard to each series of preferred stock. Each prospectus supplement will describe, as to the series of preferred stock to which it relates:


	 




	 


	


	 


	the title of the series;




	 




	 


	


	 


	any limit upon the number of shares of the series which may be issued;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the preference, if any, to which holders of the series will be entitled upon our liquidation;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the date or dates on which we will be required or permitted to redeem shares of the series;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the terms, if any, on which we or holders of the series will have the option to cause shares of the series to be redeemed;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the voting rights of the holders of the series;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the dividends, if any, which will be payable with regard to the series (which may be fixed dividends or participating dividends and may be cumulative or non-cumulative);




	 




	 


	


	 


	the right, if any, of holders of the series to convert them into another class or series of our stock or securities, including provisions intended to prevent dilution of those conversion rights;




	 




	 


	


	 


	any provisions by which we will be required or permitted to make payments to a sinking fund which will be used to redeem shares of the series or a purchase fund which will be used to purchase shares of the series; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	any other material terms of the series.




	Holders of shares of preferred stock will not have
	preemptive rights under our Certificate of Incorporation or under the DGCL, but the terms of particular series of preferred stock, or agreements into which we enter when we sell shares of preferred stock, may give rights that are similar to
	preemptive rights.






	Description of Participating Preferred Stock



	Our participating preferred stock is identical with the Class A common stock in every way, except that (a) no dividends may be paid
	with regard to the Class A and Class B common stock in a calendar year until the holders of the participating preferred stock have received a total of $.0125 per share, then no dividends may be paid in that year with regard to the participating
	preferred stock until the holders of the Class A and Class B common stock have received dividends totaling $.0125 per share, and then any additional dividends in the year will be paid on an equal per share basis to the holders of the
	participating preferred stock and of the Class A and Class B common stock, (b) if we are liquidated, none of our assets may be distributed to the holders of the Class A and Class B common stock until the holders of the participating
	preferred stock have received distributions totaling $10 per share, then no assets may be distributed to the holders of the participating preferred stock until the holders of the Class A and Class B common stock have received distributions
	totaling $10 per share, and then any further liquidating distributions will be made on an equal per share basis to the holders of the participating preferred stock and of the Class A and Class B common stock, and (c) holders of
	participating preferred stock will vote separately on corporate actions which would change the participating preferred stock or would cause the holders of the participating preferred stock to receive per share consideration in a merger or similar
	transaction which is different from the per share consideration received by the holders of the Class A and Class B common stock.

	Anti-Takeover Effects of our Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws



	Following is a description of the anti-takeover effects of certain provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as
	amended (Certificate of Incorporation) and of our By-Laws, as amended (Bylaws).



	Advance Notice
	Requirements.

	Our By-Laws contain a requirement that stockholders give advance notice of their intention to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring other business before an annual or special meeting of stockholders. These
	By-Law provisions may prevent some matters from being voted upon at a meeting. They may prevent or deter a potential acquirer from soliciting proxies to elect a slate of directors selected by the potential acquirer or otherwise attempting to obtain
	control of our company.


	We have also provided in our By-Laws that our stockholders must meet requirements set forth in our By-Laws to be
	able to request that the Board of Directors set a record date for action to be taken by the written consent of stockholders. This provision may discourage or limit the ability of an acquirer to cause the stockholders to act by written consent.



	Calling of Special Meetings of Stockholders.

	Our By-Laws provide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called by
	stockholders only by notice given by our president or secretary upon the written request of the holders of at least a majority of all the outstanding shares of any class entitled to vote on the action proposed to be taken. These provisions may
	impede a stockholders ability to bring matters before a special meeting of stockholders.



	Undesignated Preferred Stock.

	The
	ability to authorize undesignated preferred stock makes it possible for our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us. These and other provisions
	may have the effect of deferring or preventing hostile takeovers or delaying or preventing changes in control or management of our Company.



	Board Authority to Amend By-Laws.

	Under our By-Laws, our Board of Directors has the authority to adopt, amend or repeal the By-laws
	without the approval of our stockholders.



	Delaware Anti-Takeover Statute



	We are subject to Section 203 of the DGCL regulating corporate takeovers. In general, Section 203 prohibits a publicly-held Delaware
	corporation from engaging, under certain circumstances, in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date the person became an interested stockholder unless:


	 




	 


	


	 


	prior to the date of the transaction, the board of directors of the corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder;




	 




	 


	


	 


	upon completion of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction
	commenced, excluding for purposes of determining the number of shares outstanding (1) shares owned by persons who are directors and also officers and (2) shares owned by employee stock plans in which employee participants do not have the
	right to determine confidentially whether shares held subject to the plan will be tendered in response to a tender or exchange offer; or




	 




	 


	


	 


	on or subsequent to the date of the transaction, the business combination is approved by the board of directors and authorized at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, and not by written consent, by the
	affirmative vote of at least 66

	 2

	⁄

	3

	% of the outstanding voting stock which is not owned by the interested stockholder.




	 


	11






	Table of Contents



	Generally, a business combination includes a merger, asset or stock sale, or other transaction
	resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. An interested stockholder is a person who owns 15% or more of a corporations outstanding voting securities or is an affiliate or associate of the corporation and, within three
	years prior to the determination of interested stockholder status, did own 15% or more of a corporations outstanding voting securities, and affiliates and associates of such person. The existence of this provision may have an antitakeover
	effect with respect to transactions our Board of Directors does not approve in advance. Section 203 may also discourage attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares of capital stock held by stockholders.






	Transfer Agent and Registrar



	The
	transfer agent and registrar for the Class A common stock and Class B common stock is Computershare Trust Company, N.A. of Canton, Massachusetts.








	DESCRIPTION OF DEPOSITARY SHARES



	We may issue depositary receipts representing interests, which are called depositary shares, in shares of our common stock of either class or
	of particular series of a preferred stock. If we did that, we would deposit the common or preferred stock which is the subject of depositary shares with a depositary, which would hold that common or preferred stock for the benefit of the holders of
	the depositary shares, in accordance with a deposit agreement between the depositary and us. The holders of depositary shares would be entitled to all the rights and preferences of the common or preferred stock to which the depositary shares relate,
	including dividend, voting, conversion, redemption and liquidation rights, to the extent of their interests in that common or preferred stock.


	While the deposit agreement relating to a particular class or series of common or preferred stock may have provisions applicable solely to
	that class or series of stock, all deposit agreements relating to common or preferred stock we issue would include the following provisions:



	Dividends and Other Distributions

	. Each time we pay a cash dividend or make any other type of cash distribution with regard to the
	common stock or to the preferred stock of a series, the depositary will distribute to the holder of record of each depositary share relating to that common stock or to that series of preferred stock an amount equal to the dividend or other
	distribution per depositary share the depositary receives. If there is a distribution of property other than cash, the depositary either will distribute the property to the holders of depositary shares in proportion to the depositary shares held by
	each of them, or the depositary will, if we approve, sell the property and distribute the net proceeds to the holders of the depositary shares in proportion to the depositary shares held by them.



	Withdrawal of Preferred Stock

	. A holder of depositary shares will be entitled to receive, upon surrender of depositary receipts
	representing depositary shares, the number of shares of the applicable class of common stock or series of preferred stock, and any money or other property, to which the depositary shares relate.



	Redemption of Depositary Shares

	. Whenever we redeem shares of a series of preferred stock held by a depositary, the depositary will be
	required to redeem, on the same redemption date, depositary shares constituting, in total, the number of shares of that series held by the depositary which we redeem, subject to the depositarys receiving the redemption price of those shares.
	If fewer than all the depositary shares relating to a series are to be redeemed, the depositary shares to be redeemed will be selected by lot or by another method we determine to be equitable.



	Voting

	. Any time we send a notice of meeting or other materials relating to a meeting to the holders of a class of common stock or a
	series of preferred stock to which depositary shares relate, we will provide the depositary with sufficient copies of those materials so they can be sent to all holders of record of the applicable


	 


	12






	Table of Contents



	depositary shares, and the depositary will send those materials to the holders of record of the depositary shares on the record date for the meeting. The depositary will solicit voting
	instructions from holders of depositary shares and will vote or not vote the common or preferred stock to which the depositary shares relate in accordance with those instructions.



	Liquidating Distributions

	. Upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the holder of each depositary share will be entitled to
	what the holder of the depositary share would have received if the holder had owned the number of shares of common stock or of the series of preferred stock which is represented by the depositary share.



	Conversion

	. If shares of a series of preferred stock are convertible into common stock or other of our securities or property, holders
	of depositary shares relating to that series of preferred stock will, if they surrender depositary receipts representing depositary shares with appropriate instructions to convert them, receive the shares of common stock or other securities or
	property into which the number of shares of the series of preferred stock to which the depositary shares relate could at the time be converted.



	Amendment and Termination of a Deposit Agreement

	. We and the depositary may amend a deposit agreement, except that an amendment which
	materially and adversely affects the rights of holders of depositary shares, or would be materially and adversely inconsistent with the rights granted to the holders of the class of common stock or series of preferred stock to which they relate,
	must be approved by holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding depositary shares. No amendment will impair the right of a holder of depositary shares to surrender the depositary receipts evidencing those depositary shares and receive the
	common or preferred stock to which they relate, except as required to comply with law. We may terminate a deposit agreement with the consent of holders of a majority of the depositary shares to which it relates. Upon termination of a deposit
	agreement, the depositary will make the shares of common or preferred stock to which the depositary shares issued under the deposit agreement relate available to the holders of those depositary shares. A deposit agreement will automatically
	terminate if:


	 




	 


	


	 


	all outstanding depositary shares to which it relates have been withdrawn, redeemed or converted or




	 




	 


	


	 


	the depositary has made a final distribution to the holders of the depositary shares issued under the deposit agreement upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up.





	Miscellaneous

	. There will be provisions (i) requiring the depositary to forward to holders of record of depositary shares any
	reports or communications from us which the depositary receives with respect to the common or preferred stock to which the depositary shares relate, (ii) regarding compensation of the depositary, (iii) regarding resignation of the
	depositary, (iv) limiting our liability and the liability of the depositary under the deposit agreement (usually to failure to act in good faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct) and (v) indemnifying the depositary against certain
	possible liabilities.








	DESCRIPTION OF UNITS



	We may issue securities in units, each consisting of two or more types of securities. For example, we might issue units consisting of a
	combination of debt securities and warrants to purchase common stock. If we issue units, the prospectus supplement relating to the units will contain the information described above with regard to each of the securities that is a component of the
	units. In addition, each prospectus supplement relating to units will:


	 




	 


	


	 


	state how long, if at all, the securities that are components of the units must be traded in units, and when they can be traded separately;




	 




	 


	


	 


	state whether we will apply to have the units traded on a securities exchange or securities quotation system;




	 


	13






	Table of Contents





	 


	


	 


	describe how, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the purchase price paid for the units is to be allocated among the component securities.










	PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION



	We may sell the securities:


	 




	 


	


	 


	to or through underwriters or dealers;




	 




	 


	


	 


	through agents;




	 




	 


	


	 


	directly to purchasers; or




	 




	 


	


	 


	through a combination of any such methods of sale.




	We will describe in each prospectus
	supplement the particular terms of the offering of the securities to which the prospectus supplement relates, including the following:


	 




	 


	


	 


	the names of any underwriters or dealers;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the purchase price and the proceeds we will receive from the sale (which may be at a fixed price or prices, the market price prevailing at the time of sale, a price related to the prevailing market price or a negotiated
	price);




	 




	 


	


	 


	any underwriting discounts and other items constituting underwriters compensation;




	 




	 


	


	 


	any initial public offering price and any discounts or concessions allowed or reallowed or paid to dealers;




	 




	 


	


	 


	any over-allotment options granted to the underwriters; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	any other information we think is important.




	If securities are sold in an underwritten
	offering, we will execute an underwriting agreement with an underwriter or underwriters. The underwriters will use this prospectus and the prospectus supplement to sell the securities. The underwriting agreement will provide that the obligations of
	the underwriters are subject to specified conditions precedent and that the underwriters will be obligated to purchase all the securities if any are purchased. Underwriters may be involved in any at the market offering of securities by or on our
	behalf.


	In connection with the sale of securities, underwriters may receive compensation from us in the form of underwriting discounts or
	commissions. They may also receive commissions from purchasers of securities for whom they may act as agent. Underwriters may sell securities to or through dealers. These dealers may receive compensation in the form of discounts, concessions or
	commissions from the underwriters, and they may also receive commissions from purchasers for whom they may act as agent.


	Offers to
	purchase securities may be solicited by agents designated by us from time to time. Any agent involved in the offer or sale of the securities in respect of which this prospectus is delivered will be named, and any commissions payable by us to the
	agent will be set forth, in the applicable prospectus supplement. Unless otherwise set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement, any agent will be acting on a reasonable best efforts basis for the period of its appointment. Any agent may be
	deemed to be an underwriter, as that term is defined in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, of the offered securities so offered and sold.


	If we directly use a dealer in the sale of the securities, we will sell the securities to the dealer, as principal. The dealer may then resell
	these securities to the public at varying prices to be determined by the dealer at the time of resale. The prospectus supplement will name the dealers and describe the terms of our arrangements with them. A dealer may sell some or all of the
	securities to other dealers. To the extent that we are aware of the terms under which securities may be sold by a dealer to another dealer, we will describe those terms in the applicable prospectus supplement.


	 


	14






	Table of Contents



	Underwriters, dealers and agents participating in the distribution of securities may be deemed to
	be underwriters under the Securities Act. Also any discounts and commissions received by them and any profit realized by them on resale of the securities may be deemed to be underwriting discounts and commissions under the Securities Act.
	Underwriters, dealers and agents may be entitled under agreements with us to indemnification against and contribution toward certain civil liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and to reimbursement by us for various expenses.


	In order to facilitate an offering of our securities, any underwriters or agents, as the case may be, involved in the offering of such
	securities may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of such securities. Specifically, the underwriters or agents, as the case may be, may overallot in connection with the offering, creating a short position
	in the securities for their own account. In addition, to cover overallotments or to stabilize the price of such securities, the underwriters or agents, as the case may be, may bid for, and purchase, securities in the open market. Finally, in any
	offering of our securities through a syndicate of underwriters, the underwriting syndicate may reclaim selling concessions allotted to an underwriter or a dealer for distributing such securities in the offering if the syndicate repurchases
	previously distributed securities in transactions to cover syndicate short positions, in stabilization transactions or otherwise. Any of these activities may stabilize or maintain the market price of the securities above independent market levels.
	The underwriters or agents, as the case may be, are not required to engage in these activities, and may end any of these activities at any time.


	We may offer and sell securities directly to institutional investors or others. These parties may be deemed to be underwriters under the
	Securities Act with respect to their resales. The prospectus supplement applicable to transactions of that type will include the terms of the transactions.


	As long as our Class A and Class B common stock is listed on the NYSE, any Class A or Class B common stock we sell pursuant to this
	prospectus will be listed on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance. Any other securities sold pursuant to this prospectus may or may not be listed on a national securities exchange or a foreign securities exchange. The securities may not
	have an established trading market. No assurances can be given that there will be a market for any of the securities.


	Agents,
	underwriters and dealers may be customers of, engage in transactions with, or perform services for, us and our subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business.
