Objective
The fund seeks to provide current income exempt from regular federal, and New York State and New York City income tax and to enhance portfolio value.


Highlights
Seeks to provide:
Attractive monthly tax-free income
Portfolio diversification
Attractive after tax total returns




Investment Strategy
The fund invests in municipal securities that are exempt from federal, New York state, and New York City income taxes.  The fund invests at least 80% of its managed assets in municipal securities rated  investment grade (Baa/BBB or better by S&P, Moody’s, or Fitch) at the time of investment, or, if they are unrated, are judged by the manager to be of comparable quality. The fund may invest up to 20% of its managed assets in municipal securities rated below investment quality or judged by the manager to be of comparable quality, of which up to 10% of its managed assets may be rated below B-/B3 or of comparable quality.  The fund may invest in inverse floating rate municipal securities, also known as tender option bonds.  The fund’s use of tender option bonds to more efficiently implement its investment strategy may create up to 10% effective leverage.

RISKSInvestment, Market, and Price Risk: Closed-end fund shares are subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of the entire principal amount that you invest.  Common shares frequently trade at a discount to their NAV.  At any point in time, your common shares may be worth less than you paid, even after considering the reinvestment of fund distributions.Interest Rate Risk: Fixed-income securities such as bonds, preferred, convertible and other debt securities will decline in value if market interest rates rise.Credit Risk: Debt or preferred securities held by the fund may fail to make dividend or interest payments when due.  Investments in securities below investment grade credit quality are predominantly speculative and subject to greater volatility and risk of default.  Unrated securities are evaluated by fund managers using industry data and their own analysis processes that may be similar to that of a nationally recognized rating agency; however, such internal ratings are not equivalent to a national agency credit rating. Counterparty credit risk may arise if counterparties fail to meet their obligations, should the fund hold any derivative instruments for either investment exposure or hedging purposes.Single State Concentration Risk: Because the fund primarily purchases municipal bonds from a single state or U.S. territories, such as Puerto Rico, the fund is more susceptible to adverse local economic, political, or regulatory changes affecting municipal bond issuers in those locations. Certain municipal bond issuers in Puerto Rico have recently experienced financial difficulties and rating agency downgrades.Tax Risk: The tax treatment of fund distributions may be affected by future changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation by the Internal Revenue Service or state tax authorities.Inverse Floater Risk: The fund invests in inverse floaters. Due to their leveraged nature, these derivative investments can greatly increase a fund’s exposure to interest rate risk and credit risk, including counter-party credit risk. In addition, investments in inverse floaters involve the risk that the fund could lose more than its original principal investment.Call Risk or Prepayment Risk: Issuers may exercise their option to prepay principal earlier than scheduled, forcing the fund to reinvest in lower-yielding securities.Hedging Risk: The fund may use derivative instruments for hedging purposes, but there is no assurance that the fund’s hedging strategy will be successful.  Derivatives may involve a high degree of financial risk, including the risk that the loss on a derivative may be greater than the principal amount invested.Municipal Bond Market Liquidity Risk: Inventories of municipal bonds held by brokers and dealers have decreased in recent years, either due to broker-dealer choices or to federal banking regulations, reducing their ability to make a market in these securities. This may decrease the fund’s ability to buy or sell bonds, and may increase bond price volatility and trading costs, particularly during periods of economic or market stress. As a result, the fund may be forced to sell a security at a lower price than desired, to sell other securities to raise cash, or to give up an investment opportunity, any of which could have a negative effect on performance. Large block sales could further reduce bond prices and hurt fund performance.
NOTES


					** The premium/discount is calculated as (most recent price/most recent NAV) -1.






				Income may be subject to state and local income taxes and the alternative minimum tax. Capital gains, if any, will be subject to capital gains tax.

†† INCOME ONLY DISTRIBUTIONS

				Distributions are sourced entirely from net investment income, unless noted otherwise.
				
						
							Distribution rates represent the latest declared regular distribution, annualized, relative to the most recent market price and NAV. Special distributions, including special capital gains distributions, are not included in the calculation.
						
					
			
1 Taxable Equivalent Yield

				Taxable equivalent yield is the yield or distribution rate needed from a taxable investment to be economically equal to receiving the stated tax-free yield from a municipal bond investment. Please note that the income levels shown in the calculator do not reflect (i) any federal or state limitations on the amounts of allowable itemized deductions, phaseouts of personal or dependent exemption credits or other allowable credits, (ii) any local taxes imposed, or (iii) any alternative minimum taxes or any taxes other than personal income taxes. The user is responsible for selecting the applicable federal and, as applicable, state tax rates. The stated federal tax rates for joint incomes over $250,000 include the 3.8% medicare tax imposed on the net investment income of certain taxpayers with higher incomes. This calculator is for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to represent actual performance, or to predict future performance, of any Nuveen Investments product. Certain taxpayers may find their effective marginal tax rates to be greater than those shown in the calculator. In that case, the taxable equivalent yield may be even higher.
			

				Income may be subject to state and local taxes, as well as the federal alternative minimum tax. There is no assurance that tax rates will remain unchanged; the rates used are believed to be correct for tax year 2016.

Scroll to TopThe ExchangeNUVEEN CELEBRATES 30 YEARS OF INVESTING IN AMERICAInterview Highlights
Anne KritzmireMD & Head of Closed-End Fund Marketing
Tell us why you’re here today.So we’re here today to celebrate 30 years of Nuveen Closed-End Funds starting with NUV which was the largest IPO on the New York Stock Exchange at the time.
NUV is our oldest Closed-End Fund. It was launched to invest in municipal bonds. Along the way, it’s built a whole lot of income for the shareholders while building many of America's essential public works through the municipal bonds the fund financed.
What should investors understand about how Closed-End Funds work?The number one thing to understand about Closed-End Funds is they’re mostly designed for income, to provide regular cash flow whether you’re a retiree or somebody early in your career. If you want that regular opportunity for income or investing the income, then a Closed-End Fund can be an important investment tool for you. 
In addition, unlike other funds that you may be familiar with, they trade on the stock exchange throughout the day, so you have those opportunities for visibility and liquidity, and naming the price that you want to pay for the Closed-End Fund share.
Besides celebrating 30 years today, what else is distinctive about NUV?One of the things we’re really proud of, for NUV, our oldest fund, is the idea that it has built income for the shareholders while building America for all of the rest of us. Over time, this helped meaningfully grow our municipal bond franchise which now stands at more than $125 billion dollars – again, by helping retail investors invest in America while receiving income along the way.

John Miller
  MD & Co-Head of Fixed Income
I understand that the fund has been available for the past 30 years. What do you consider the greatest contributors to that longevity? I think it starts with the strength of the municipal asset class but in addition, the product structure has been very beneficial to stability and monthly income over time. Active management and our deep fundamental research have also helped the fund succeed over three decades.
NUV was Nuveen’s first muni Closed-End Fund. How has that suite grown since then?Closed-End Funds at Nuveen have had incredible growth over the last 30 years. We currently have 75 funds with total assets under management (AUM) more than $60 billion when you combine the value of those funds. So it has expanded across different parts of the yield curve, different parts of the credit spectrum and different asset classes as well—all really with the foundation of having income produced by all those products.

How would you say that the Closed-End Fund structure has enabled retail investors to invest in municipal bonds?The Closed-End Fund structure helps retail investors in part because of the liquidity, the ease of trading and the incremental approach to getting investors involved—this includes the amount that needs to be invested for an individual trade, the information available, and the diversification that comes from active professional management.
Daniel Close
  SVP & Portfolio Manager
Thirty years ago, Nuveen launched its first Nuveen Municipal Value Fund. What has been the primary goal of this fund?
Our primary goal is income distribution, so in the 30 years that NUV has been in existence it's paid out $3.2 billion dollars in tax-free monthly distributions. That relentless pursuit of income has been the goal of NUV and we’re happy to celebrate its 30-year anniversary right now.
What would you consider to be the hallmarks of the Nuveen Municipal Value Fund?
The hallmark of NUV has been its consistency. Thirty years ago it launched at $10 a share and right now it's trading at $10.06 a share—so over this 30 years it’s provided consistent monthly income to our shareholders.
What are some of the key projects supported by investments made by NUV?
NUV has supported key infrastructure projects throughout America. Every major airport built over the last 30 years – such as Denver International Airport, the reconstruction of LaGuardia Airport right now, McCarran Airport, E470 – which is a 46 mile outer belt around Denver – were all supported by NUV along with water and sewer projects like Atlanta Water, where we just financed a 2.4 billion gallon reservoir for clean water.
How did it feel to ring the Opening Bell at the New York Stock Exchange?
It was absolutely fantastic. It was one of the coolest events I've ever had so I'm super grateful the New York Stock Exchange. You guys put on such a wonderful event, thank you!

			Taxable Income
			 : Taxable Municipal Funds



			About Taxable Municipal Debt and Build America Bonds(BABs)
		

			Municipal bonds are debt issued by a state, city, or other municipality for general governmental needs or to finance special projects.
		

			Taxable municipal bonds may be issued by the same municipal entities that issue tax-exempt bonds. In April 2009, Build America Bonds (BABs), a new form of taxable municipal bonds, were first issued as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.
		

			BABs are an alternative to tax-exempt bonds for state and local governments issued in 2009 and 2010. As part of a program designed to provide a federal subsidy for a larger portion of the borrowing costs of state and local governments than traditional tax-exempt bonds. The goal was to stimulate the economy and encourage investments in capital projects in 2009 and 2010. The interest on BABs is taxable to investors. As a result, the nominal interest rate on BABs is similar to interest paid by non-state and local government borrowers, such as corporations.
		



					About Nuveen's Build America Bond Funds

Nuveen Build America Bond Fund (NBB)
Nuveen Build America Bond Opportunity Fund (NBD)


					These funds invest primarily in a diversified portfolio of Build America Bonds (BABs), which, under normal circumstances, will make up at least 80% of its managed assets. Up to 20% may be invested in other securities, including taxable and tax-exempt municipal securities and US Treasury and other government securities. At least 80% of the funds' managed assets will be invested in securities that are investment grade quality at the time of purchase, as rated by at least one NRSRO or judged to be of comparable quality by NAM. These funds use leverage.
					

					As of 1/1/2013, there has been no new issuance of BABs or similarly US Treasury-subsidized taxable municipal bonds for a 24-month period. Because of this, the fund’s contingent term provision is now in force, and the fund will terminate on or around 6/30/2020, distributing the fund’s assets to shareholders at that time.

				






								Investor Profile

								Are these CEFs right for you?
The features and investment objectives of these funds might be especially appealing to investors seeking:

Potential for attractive, monthly income
Diversification of a portfolio otherwise comprised of taxable fixed-income and equity securities


								What are potential risks?

Municipal bonds are subject to interest rate risk, or the risk that the bonds will decline in value because of changes in market interest rates. 
Municipal bonds are also subject to call risk, and credit risk.

Chart Definitions
Income-oriented closed-end funds make payouts largely from interest	and dividends.
Income and capital appreciation funds seek regular cash	flow made up of interest and dividends, with the remainder from capital appreciation or, if necessary, return of capital.
Capital appreciation and income closed-end funds seek cash flow mainly from capital appreciation.
Single-asset-class funds invest primarily in one asset class, which can be used as components in a well-diversified income portfolio.
Pre-packaged combinations are funds featuring multiple asset types, which are designed to work together to diversify fund cash flow risks.

Closed the Income Gap®
with Nuveen Closed-End Funds



Closed-End Funds Offer Attractive Income Potential
In the search for increased income opportunities, closed-end funds can be a smart choice. Designed and built for income, closed-end funds seek to provide regular, stable cash flow over time and can serve as a compelling tool for optimizing an income portfolio.
Consider closed-end funds if you’re seeking to:1


1


Enhance Income and Cash Flow
Because of their unique closed structure and ability to use leverage,2 closed-end funds offer potentially higher distributions3 than traditional income investments.4


2


Manage Interest Rate Risk 
Floating rate, shorter duration or equity closed-end funds may help reduce a portfolio’s interest rate sensitivity.


3


Protect Purchasing Power
Closed-end funds that invest in real assets and dividend-paying stocks, which typically increase their payments with rising inflation, may help buffer the effects of rising inflation.


4


Maximize After-Tax Efficiency
Nuveen offers a wide array of national, state specific and AMT-free municipal closed-end funds that may help reduce your tax liability on investment income.5


5


Improve Diversification
With strategies that provide access to specialized asset classes, including alternatives, Nuveen closed-end funds may enhance portfolio diversification.

There is no guarantee that any of the funds will achieve their stated objectives. For detailed information on the specific risks associated with each fund, please view the fund overview by clicking on the fund name above.
1 Goal classifications represent common investor concerns when evaluating portfolio needs, are provided for informational purposes only, and are not intended to be relied upon as investment advice or recommendations.
2 Leverage typically magnifies the total return of a fund’s portfolio, whether that return is positive or negative, and creates an opportunity for increased common share net income as well as higher volatility of net asset value, market price, and distributions. There is no assurance that a fund’s leveraging strategy will be successful.
3 Potential distribution sources include net investment income, realized gains and return of capital.  
4 Different types of asset investments have different types of risks, which may provide higher returns but also greater volatility. In general, equity securities tend to be more volatile that fixed income securities. The value of, and income generated by, debt securities will decrease or increase based on changes in market interest rates. As interest rates risk, bond prices fall. In general, below investment grade (high-yield) debt securities tend to be more volatile than investment grade securities. Preferred securities are subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company's capital structure, and therefore are subject to greater credit risk. The interest and principal payments of U.S. Treasury securities are guaranteed.
5 Income may be subject to state and local income taxes and the alternative minimum tax. Capital gains, if any, will be subject to capital gains tax.
