    Buffington Mohr McNeal - Financial Insight    

    In the months ahead, it seems likely that the chatter will grow louder on financial TV stations and across the Web about how terrible higher bond yields are going to be for stocks. This has happened in previous periods of rising rates. Prognosticators are probably going to make three arguments:

One, that higher bond yields provide competition to dividend yields, which will make stocks less attractive. Secondly, that higher bond yields drive down the market’s price-to-earnings ratio. And, lastly, that higher bond yields will choke economic growth, sending stocks lower.

Wall Street’s talking heads have already been out in force in the media, warning that rising interest rates will hurt stocks. When you hear these forecasts, remember that many-- if not most--of Wall Street’s prognosticators have a bad track record for predicting the market’s next move. So when bond yields start to rise and you hear the refrain: “rising bond yields are bad for stocks,” don’t believe it.
