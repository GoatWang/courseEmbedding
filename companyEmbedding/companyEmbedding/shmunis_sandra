 JFCS Partners with the Galicia Jewish Museum in Krakow on a New Exhibit Featuring Rywka’s Diary	HolocaustJFCS NewsWhen the JFCS Holocaust Center first received an old and tattered school notebook written in Polish and pulled from the ashes of Auschwitz, JFCS Executive Director Dr. Anita Friedman suspected the power the mysterious volume contained as she turned each carefully penned page.
Since the manuscript’s publication in 2014 Rywka’s Diary: The Writings of a Jewish Girl from the Lodz Ghetto has been an international sensation, sold alongside The Diary of Anne Frank and, at last count, translated into 15 languages worldwide.
Dr. Anita Friedman worked with the Galicia Jewish Museum to create the exhibit based on JFCS’ book, Rywka’s… Read More Posted by Admin	on July 6, 2017	 JFCS Financial Aid Centers Expands Loans and College Scholarships	Financial AssistanceYouthTen minutes before Ma’ayan Epstein, 18, was due to give the speech at her high school graduation she got a call from Michelle Lamphere, Director of JFCS’ Financial Aid Center. “When I answered the phone Michelle said, ‘I have some information.’ I didn’t want bad news right before my speech, but she interrupted to say I had won the scholarship!

So how are these millennials finding meaning in being Jewish today? JFCS has four different programs that answer this very question.

Young Professional Community Connection: Behind the Scenes

LGBTQ seniors, who often don’t have children or who may be single and living alone, are among those taking advantage of JFCS’ popular Futures Program, which helps seniors plan for their future care needs while they are healthy.

Alan and Peter were thrilled to sign up for the Futures Program. As self-described “planners” in all aspects of their lives, the couple approached their care at home no differently.

 Vlad and Sandra Shmunis: Helping Others Is Their Business	Financial AssistanceStories & TestimonialsAs small business owners who have seen their own enterprises grow over the years, Vlad and Sandra Shmunis have a particular affection for budding entrepreneurs who are trying to get a good start in life. That’s why they have invested in JFCS’ Small Business and Professional Loan Program, which offers assistance to young, promising upstarts in the Bay Area.
“We’re big believers in helping those who are helping themselves,” says Sandra, “and we wanted to invest in a program that is already well established so that we didn’t need to reinvent the wheel. In addition, we have a great deal of respect for JFCS—it’s one of the top-run organizations in the Bay Area—and we believe in supporting the Jewish community.”
Originally from Odessa, Vlad and Sandra are grateful for JFCS and other Jewish family service organizations that helped bring them, their parents, grandparents, and other close relatives and friends to the United States from the former Soviet Union. They hope that their gift to JFCS’ Small Business and Professional Loan Program will reap dividends in a number of ways: inspiring others in the community to contribute to it and seeing the businesses that are helped grow and fuel our local economy by hiring more workers.
“We are deeply grateful to Vlad and Sandra and their family for their support of the Jewish community. This vital program is inspiring bright, young people to be successful and give back the way the Shmunis family is,” says Dr. Anita Friedman, JFCS’ Executive Director. “At the same time, the Shmunis’ gift is also inspiring other thoughtful friends to come forward to make gifts to the Small Business and Professional Loan Program. We appreciate their generosity.”
Learn how you can support the Small Business and Professional Loan Program: call 415-449-3858 or email BFarber@jfcs.org.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Homelessness, trauma, debt, and few job skills can create unsurmountable hurdles to creating a new life—oftentimes leading them back to their abuser. That’s why JFCS’ Dream Program helps women and their children with not only finding stable long-term housing, but with a multitude of other wrap-around services and support necessary to get them back on their feet.

Surgery left her with excruciating stomach and joint pain, making it difficult to walk.
Beverly had to leave her part-time job due to her disability and was behind on her rent. One day she returned home to find a notice in her mail: her rent for her Peninsula apartment was going up $200 a month—an astronomical amount on her small fixed income. Feeling despondent, she talked to a friend who said, “Have you ever thought about calling JFCS?”

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.
