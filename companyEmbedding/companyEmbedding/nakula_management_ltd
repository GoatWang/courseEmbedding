Nakula Management Ltd Just Reported Giant Enova International Inc Stake


09/14/2015  by OctaStaff 
			in SEC 13G & 13D Filings 












Share with your friendsYour NameYour EmailRecipient EmailEnter a MessageI read this article and found it very interesting, thought it might be interesting for you. The article is called Nakula Management Ltd Just Reported Giant Enova International Inc Stake and is was published by Octafinance.com at http://www.octafinance.com/nakula-management-ltd-just-reported-giant-enova-international-inc-stake/195940/.CaptchaSubmitNakula Management Ltd New Position in Enova International Inc (NYSE:ENVA)
Nakula Management Ltd has filled a SC 13D form regarding Enova International, Inc  15.85 -0.15 -0.94%. Filing Link: 000119312515318447.  Per Nakula Management Ltd’s filing, the filler now owns 6% of the company, holding 1,991,290 shares.
 Enova International Inc (NYSE:ENVA) is a newly disclosed equity position  and the filing was required due to activity on September2, 2015. This most probably shows Nakula Management Ltd’s confidence and optimism in the future of the company.
Why Nakula Management Ltd Bought Enova International, Inc
Item4. Purpose of Transaction 
The ReportingPersons currently hold the shares of Common Stock for investment purposes. Mr.Boyko and his affiliates previously explored the possibility of a transaction regarding the acquisition of Enova prior to acquiring more than 5 percent of the CommonStock of Enova with the assistance of a financial advisory firm but ultimately determined not to pursue the acquisition transaction. 
The ReportingPersons have had conversations with Enovas management and may in the future continue to have discussions with Enovas management, Board of Directors and other stockholders. In particular, Mr.Boyko has discussed one of his affiliatedcompanies potentially entering into a customer relationship with Enova. In addition, he suggested other potential uses of Enovas software and other co-investment and business opportunities for companies affiliated with Mr.Boyko andEnova. 
Other than as set forth above, no Reporting Person has any present plan or proposal that relates to any of the matters set forth in subparagraphs(a)-(j)of Item4. 
6 of 9 
Subject to various factors (including, without limitation, Enovas business and prospects, theperformance of the Common Stock in the market, availability of funds, alternative uses of funds, and money, stock market and general economic and industry conditions, future developments at Enova and applicable law and relationship with management),the Reporting Persons generally intend to acquire additional shares of Common Stock. The Reporting Persons may, however, depending on market conditions, dispose of securities of Enova. Any purchases or dispositions of securities inEnova may be in the open market or privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise. The Reporting Persons may, from time to time, and reserve the right to, change their plans or intentions and to take any and all actions that they deem appropriate tomaximize the value of their investment in Enova; there can be no assurance that the Reporting Persons will acquire or dispose of securities of Enova.  
Form 13D is SEC filing that must be submitted within 10 days, by anyone who acquires beneficial ownership of more than 5% of any publicly traded securities. A filer must promptly update its 13D filing in case of acquisition or disposition of 1% or more of the securities that are the subject of the filing. These filings may be a precursor to hostile takeovers, company breakups, and other “change of control” events.
