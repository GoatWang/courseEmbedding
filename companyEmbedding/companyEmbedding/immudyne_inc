Immunotherapy, the field of medicine that deals with using the body’s immune system to fight disease, is currently the most promising area of medical research and is expected to be a $13B market by 2023.

6000+ scientific papers have shown beta-glucan to be an immune-modulator that binds to and activates Natural Killer (NK), dendritic (DC), and other immune cells.


We believe our generally recognized as safe (GRAS) beta glucan based immune support products can capture significant near term market share.

Immudyne Announces Successful National Launch of Shapiro MD Hair Loss Product Line




















June 07, 2017 08:00 ET

 | Source: ImmuDyne, Inc.






MT. KISCO, N.Y., June  07, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ImmuDyne, Inc. (OTCQB:IMMD) (“Immudyne” or the “Company”), a leader in the development and marketing of OTC healthcare products, is pleased to announce a successful national launch of our patented Shapiro MD product line.  Within the first several weeks of the product’s launch on Facebook, Immudyne sold all available inventory. Our entire team and supply chain partners have been working diligently to increase production and inventory levels for the product, and we’re pleased to report that as of today we have sufficient inventory levels to considerably scale the Shapiro MD business. “Although we had and continue to have big expectations for the Shapiro MD line, the initial success of our marketing efforts exceeded everyone’s expectations,” stated Justin Schreiber, President of Immudyne PR. “I believe that the success of this product launch reinforces Immudyne PR’s business model of in-licensing high quality consumer products in large addressable markets that can be scaled through online marketing channels such as Facebook, Google and Amazon.” The Shapiro MD product line is the result of 15 years of research and development by thought-leading dermatologists Dr. Steven Shapiro and Dr. Michael Borenstein.  It is protected by two U.S. patents and is the only product in the hair loss vertical that contains what we believe are the 3 most powerful, naturally-occurring dihydrotestosterone (DHT) blocking ingredients.  DHT is widely believed to be the main culprit of balding/hair-loss. In addition to the Shampoo and Conditioner, Immudyne PR has formulated a once-daily leave in foam and is finalizing the formulation of a nutritional supplement. We believe both products will be a strong addition to the product line and should be available within the next 90 days. “The amount of inbound inquiries we’ve received on Shapiro MD within the first several weeks of launch is off-the-charts,” stated Mark McLaughlin, Chief Executive Officer of Immudyne. “We’re very excited about the potential of the line and are now laser-focused on scaling inventory levels and optimizing our infrastructure to permit profitable revenue growth around the world.”     The global alopecia (hair loss) market is expected to reach USD 11.8 Billion by 2024 according to a recent report published by independent research firm, Grand View Research, Inc. For more information on Shapiro MD or to purchase the product, please visit www.shapiromd.com. About lmmuDyne lmmuDyne, Inc. (the "Company") is a health and wellness company that develops, manufactures, and markets innovative consumer products. Immudyne manufactures and markets a proprietary and patent protected Yeast Beta Glucan that has been shown in thousands of clinical studies to support and regulate the human immune system.  It has broad applications in skincare and as an immune support supplement.  Immudyne PR, a majority owned subsidiary of ImmuDyne, Inc., is the digital marketing arm of Immudyne and is currently focused on marketing products for thicker and fuller hair (Shapiro MD) and a skincare line containing Immudyne’s proprietary Yeast Beta Glucan ingredient (Inate MD).  All of lmmuDyne's intellectual property is protected by patents and/or trade secrets.

(OTCQB:IMMD) ("Immudyne" or the "Company"), a leader in the development and marketing of OTC healthcare products, is pleased to announce a successful national launch of our patented Shapiro MD product line.  Within the first several weeks of the product's launch on Facebook, Immudyne sold all available inventory. Our entire team and supply chain partners have been working diligently to increase production and inventory levels for the product, and we're pleased to report that as of today we have sufficient inventory levels to considerably scale the Shapiro MD business. "Although we had and continue to have big expectations for the Shapiro MD line, the initial success of our marketing efforts exceeded everyone's expectations," stated Justin Schreiber, President of Immudyne PR. "I believe that the success of this product launch reinforces Immudyne PR's business model of in-licensing high quality consumer products in large addressable markets that can be scaled through online marketing channels such as Facebook, Google and Amazon." The Shapiro MD product line is the result of 15 years of research and development by thought-leading dermatologists Dr. Steven Shapiro and Dr. Michael Borenstein.  It is protected by two U.S. patents and is the only product in the hair loss vertical that contains what we believe are the 3 most powerful, naturally-occurring dihydrotestosterone (DHT) blocking ingredients.  DHT is widely believed to be the main culprit of balding/hair-loss. In addition to the Shampoo and Conditioner, Immudyne PR has formulated a once-daily leave in foam and is finalizing the formulation of a nutritional supplement. We believe both products will be a strong addition to the product line and should be available within the next 90 days. "The amount of inbound inquiries we've received on Shapiro MD within the first several weeks of launch is off-the-charts," stated Mark McLaughlin, Chief Executive Officer of Immudyne. "We're very excited about the potential of the line and are now laser-focused on scaling inventory levels and optimizing our infrastructure to permit profitable revenue growth around the world."

While the product may invade the scalp, it is a far-fetched fantasy that it could invade the skull and access the brain. For instance, many topical ointments contain cortisone, mentholatum and other remedies. While they permeate the skin, the FDA has no concerns about them invading the bloodstream or skeleton.  relax.  Try the product and perhaps you will benefit both in appearance and confidence.

MT. KISCO, N.Y., July  18, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Immudyne, Inc. (OTCQB:IMMD) (“Immudyne” or the “Company”), a leader in the development and marketing of OTC health and wellness products addressing large unmet needs, announced today the Company’s preliminary financial results for the fiscal second quarter ended June 30, 2017.  The Company expects to report net revenue was approximately $1.1 million, an increase of approximately 150% from the previous quarter.  Revenue growth in the second quarter was led by the Shapiro MD product line, sold through Immudyne’s majority owned subsidiary, Immudyne PR, LLC.  Immudyne’s strategic additive business also increased approximately 74% from the previous quarter. “Although it’s our current policy not to publicly project future revenue, we will simply say that we are very pleased with our sales performance in the second quarter, and look forward to the remainder of 2017 and beyond,” stated Mark McLaughlin, CEO of Immudyne. “Immudyne and our PR subsidiary have built a highly scalable infrastructure and a world-class marketing team that is beginning to show promising traction across multiple brands.  Our restructuring effort that we began late last year is clearly starting to pay off.” The Company estimates that it had approximately $700,000 in cash, near-term receivables and merchant reserves as of July 15, 2017.  Additionally, between April 1, 2017 and July 15, 2017, Immudyne reduced its net liabilities by approximately $200,000. “The restructuring effort we began in early 2017 is starting to gain traction,” stated Stefan Galluppi, COO of Immudyne.  “We’ve internalized most of our media buying, significantly improved our margins, and have created a patented product line that we can roll out globally in a multi-billion-dollar market.” About Shapiro MD™  The Shapiro MD product line is the result of 15 years of research and development by thought-leading dermatologists Dr. Steven Shapiro and Dr. Michael Borenstein.  It is protected by two U.S. patents and is the only product in the hair loss vertical that contains what we believe are the 3 most powerful, naturally-occurring dihydrotestosterone (DHT) blocking ingredients.

PURACERE is a patent protected and clinically researched dietary supplement that is the purist yeast beta-1,3/1,6-D-glucan available. It is manufactured in the United States by Immudyne via a proprietary process and is sold to some of the world’s largest cosmetic companies. Purcacere is also used in Immudyne’s cosmetic products marketed directly to consumers around the world.

Proven through hundreds of studies and centuries of clinical experience, beta-glucans are powerful in supporting immune health. Clinical research has demonstrated that yeast beta-1/3, 1/6-D-glucan activates neutrophils, B-lymphocytes, T-helper cells, NK1 cells, and macrophages to destroy harmful pathogens such as bacteria, fungi, protozoan, and pre-malignant and malignant cancer cells. These naturally derived compounds also have potent anti-oxidant properties that assist in the body’s natural detoxification process. Other studies have shown that yeast beta-1,3/1,6-D-glucan increases immune system cell count, stimulates new tissue growth, and accelerates wound healing.
Specifically, Immudyne’s beta-1,3/1,6-D-glucan has been extensively researched by many renowned medical laboratories, including; Baylor College of Medicine, US Armed Forces Radiobiology Institute, Stanford University, Southwest Research Institute, Case Western Reserve University, the University of Arkansas, North Caroline State University, The University of Bern in Switzerland, and the China Agricultural University, China.

Style Scores:



NA Value | NA Growth | NA Momentum | NA VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score

Growth Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Zacks Equity Research reports, or ZER for short, are our in-house, independently produced research reports.
The ever popular one-page Snapshot reports are generated for virtually every single Zacks Ranked stock. It's packed with all of the company's key stats and salient decision making information. Including the Zacks Rank, Zacks Industry Rank, Style Scores, the Price, Consensus & Surprise chart, graphical estimate analysis and how a stocks stacks up to its peers.
The detailed multi-page Analyst report does an even deeper dive on the company's vital statistics. In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The IMMUNDYNE line of products with PURACERE™ have been a great complement to our practice and have become a standard part of our patient’s use for immune support. I searched out all of the beta glucan products and IMMUDYNE’s PURACERE ™ is the most reliable beta-glucan. IMMUDYNE has the go-to products for immune support.

IMMUDYNE’s PURACERE™ is has the most reliable beta-glucan, with the cleanest 1,3/1,6 linkage. Other copy-cat products are unreliable whole glucans with larger milligram amounts too large to be taken up by the white blood cells. Such products do not achieve a reliable result. I observe that IMMUDYNE’s URACERE™ is the only pure, reliable beta-glucan, with the proper molecular structure necessary to achieve the desired results of helping maintain and support a healthy immune system.

KISCO, N.Y., June 07, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ImmuDyne, Inc. (IMMD) (“Immudyne” or the “Company”), a leader in the development and marketing of OTC healthcare products, is pleased to announce a successful national launch of our patented Shapiro MD product line. Within the first several weeks of the product’s launch on Facebook, Immudyne sold all available inventory. Our entire team and supply chain partners have been working diligently to increase production and inventory levels for the product, and we’re pleased to report that as of today we have sufficient inventory levels to considerably scale the Shapiro MD business.“Although we had and continue to have big expectations for the Shapiro MD line, the initial success of our marketing efforts exceeded everyone’s expectations,” stated Justin Schreiber, President of Immudyne PR. “I believe that the success of this product launch reinforces Immudyne PR’s business model of in-licensing high quality consumer products in large addressable markets that can be scaled through online marketing channels such as Facebook, Google and Amazon.”The Shapiro MD product line is the result of 15 years of research and development by thought-leading dermatologists Dr. Steven Shapiro and Dr. Michael Borenstein.  It is protected by two U.S. patents and is the only product in the hair loss vertical that contains what we believe are the 3 most powerful, naturally-occurring dihydrotestosterone (DHT) blocking ingredients.  DHT is widely believed to be the main culprit of balding/hair-loss.In addition to the Shampoo and Conditioner, Immudyne PR has formulated a once-daily leave in foam and is finalizing the formulation of a nutritional supplement. We believe both products will be a strong addition to the product line and should be available within the next 90 days.“The amount of inbound inquiries we’ve received on Shapiro MD within the first several weeks of launch is off-the-charts,” stated Mark McLaughlin, Chief Executive Officer of Immudyne. “We’re very excited about the potential of the line and are now laser-focused on scaling inventory levels and optimizing our infrastructure to permit profitable revenue growth around the world.”    The global alopecia (hair loss) market is expected to reach USD 11.8 Billion by 2024 according to a recent report published by independent research firm, Grand View Research, Inc.For more information on Shapiro MD or to purchase the product, please visit www.shapiromd.com.About lmmuDynelmmuDyne, Inc.

Development, Acquisition and Commercialization of Revolutionary Healthcare & Consumer Products
Immudyne is discovering and marketing new innovative and revolutionary products that address large unmet needs in the market.  New product opportunities are everywhere, yet few companies have the expertise to recognize gaps in the market, source products that can fill those gaps, and commercialize new products in a scalable way that doesn’t require large amounts of capital. Immudyne’s proven track record is the result of a diverse leadership team comprised of individuals with experience in online advertising, direct-response marketing, mergers and acquisitions, investment banking, product licensing and private equity.
80-90% of new product launches fail within the first 2 years.  Depending on the product and industry, new product launches may require millions, if not hundreds of millions of dollars in outside capital.  Given the high failure rate, investing in new product launches with limited data to gauge consumer demand is an extremely risky business. At Immudyne, we’ve developed a model to directly market products with multi-billion-dollar potential with very low initial capital requirements and a proven return on investment on marketing spend prior to product launch.  This means we avoid unnecessary dilution and allocate our time and resources to products that we have a high degree of confidence in creating long-term shareholder value.
2016 was a year of record growth for Immudyne.  We grew our business by over 300% with year end top line revenue projected to be $5.25MM, the most in Immudyne’s history. We also in-licensed a patented line of hair-loss products, called Shapiro MD, from Dr. Steven Shapiro and Dr. Michael Borenstein.  Our team has been working hard on the launch of this product line and we believe it will be a big contributor to 2017 revenue.  In late 2016 we partnered with a third dermatologist, Dr. Lilliana Ramirez, to revamp and endorse our Inate MD skincare line.  We believe that Inate MD and Shapiro MD are well positioned for success in 2017.
Most importantly, Immudyne committed significant resources in 2016 to building a world-class direct-marketing infrastructure.  We built and trained a call-center in Puerto Rico, built a media buying team, and invested heavily in managerial talent that has improved all aspects of our operations.  Although this value is not yet reflected on our balance sheet, we believe it is very meaningful to our long-term success and will facilitate long term and profitable growth.

Development, Acquisition and Commercialization of Revolutionary Healthcare & Consumer Products
Immudyne is discovering and marketing new innovative and revolutionary products that address large unmet needs in the market.  New product opportunities are everywhere, yet few companies have the expertise to recognize gaps in the market, source products that can fill those gaps, and commercialize new products in a scalable way that doesn’t require large amounts of capital. Immudyne’s proven track record is the result of a diverse leadership team comprised of individuals with experience in online advertising, direct-response marketing, mergers and acquisitions, investment banking, product licensing and private equity.
80-90% of new product launches fail within the first 2 years.  Depending on the product and industry, new product launches may require millions, if not hundreds of millions of dollars in outside capital.  Given the high failure rate, investing in new product launches with limited data to gauge consumer demand is an extremely risky business. At Immudyne, we’ve developed a model to directly market products with multi-billion-dollar potential with very low initial capital requirements and a proven return on investment on marketing spend prior to product launch.  This means we avoid unnecessary dilution and allocate our time and resources to products that we have a high degree of confidence in creating long-term shareholder value.
2016 was a year of record growth for Immudyne.  We grew our business by over 300% with year end top line revenue projected to be $5.25MM, the most in Immudyne’s history. We also in-licensed a patented line of hair-loss products, called Shapiro MD, from Dr. Steven Shapiro and Dr. Michael Borenstein.  Our team has been working hard on the launch of this product line and we believe it will be a big contributor to 2017 revenue.  In late 2016 we partnered with a third dermatologist, Dr. Lilliana Ramirez, to revamp and endorse our Inate MD skincare line.  We believe that Inate MD and Shapiro MD are well positioned for success in 2017.
Most importantly, Immudyne committed significant resources in 2016 to building a world-class direct-marketing infrastructure.  We built and trained a call-center in Puerto Rico, built a media buying team, and invested heavily in managerial talent that has improved all aspects of our operations.  Although this value is not yet reflected on our balance sheet, we believe it is very meaningful to our long-term success and will facilitate long term and profitable growth.
