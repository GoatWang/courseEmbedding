About SGEP: Entrepreneurs Who Understand Operating a Business | SGEP














































Our Story

Our Story
We have the most flexible source of capital you will find anywhere, and we love working with passionate entrepreneurs, founders, and operators.










A Very Different Kind of Investor
Susquehanna Growth Equity was founded in 2006 to create a different kind of growth equity investor: a firm that itself is funded by entrepreneurs who understand the ups-and-downs of operating a business; a firm that has no fixed time horizons and is not subject to the vagaries of the private equity fundraising cycle; a firm that can be flexible in the types of deals it does, the securities it holds, and the risks it takes; and a firm which will help strategically without forcing its operational playbook on the operators we are backing.
All of our capital comes from Susquehanna International Group (SIG), one the world’s largest privately-held financial services firms. Founded in 1987, SIG has grown to over 1,800 employees across the globe, while continuing to be owned and operated by its founders.  We are proud to be a part of one of the biggest bootstrapped, entrepreneurial success stories in history.








Respect for founders and entrepreneurs permeates everything we do.






Our Commitment
We will be engaged, collaborative, and passionate about your business.
Strategic Guidance
Our familiarity with the market means we can help our entrepreneurs avoid pitfalls, see around corners, and capitalize on rapidly emerging trends.
Rapid Decision-Making
We’ve seen what can happen when investors consume too much of management’s time during a fundraise. Our unique structure means we can move faster than just about any other investor and let you get back to the business of running your business.




Capital
We have the most flexible capital in the industry. We can provide capital for growth, acquisitions, or shareholder liquidity – all over multiple tranches with no fixed time horizons.
Access to Talent
We have an enormous rolodex of executives and operators across the software industry. We will work as hard as you do to convince them that your company is an exciting place to build their careers.
Exit Management
We’ve been through countless strategic sales and IPOs, and we leverage that experience to help maximize outcomes when our portfolio companies are looking to exit.








SGE By The Numbers
Our culture is to stay under the radar screen. We live vicariously through the achievements of our portfolio companies and work to make sure that they are in the spotlight, not us. Here is some data to give you a sense of their achievements:
