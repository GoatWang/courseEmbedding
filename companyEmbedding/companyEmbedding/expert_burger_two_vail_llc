“Expert ingredients”


Reviewed November 17, 2015



via mobile




Very good high quality ingredients. Price was very reasonable for the quality of product. Had the blue cheese burger with onion rings. Hubby had angel fire with chili fries. We are traveling down 70 to Denver and saw the sign to the place. Good choice! And Tampa honey, you are the sunshine of the place. Enjoyed chatting with you. Keep cooking your menu and you shall succeed!

“Good gourmet burgers but pricey for Eagle”


Reviewed September 1, 2015




I have been twice and had a good experience. The burgers are good. Fries or onion rings are fine. Prompt service. The only complaint I have is that the prices are fairly high for Eagle. Probably fine in Vail.

“Not recommended”


Reviewed August 30, 2015




I ordered their blue cheese burger, it was undercooked. Their homemade French firs were swimming in a pool of oil. When I complaint about the burger being cooked medium rare, the owner stated that their ground beef comes from certified angus beef. I was pointless to argue that ground beef can be contaminated during processing. At least they offered to refund my money, after pointing out the small lettering in their menu that states that all burger are cooked medium unless otherwise requested.

“not worth the trip”


Reviewed July 8, 2015




I went into the restaurant, Because of the name " EXPERT" not!, it did look like the picture here shown, I got the crispy jalapeno burger, Not sure of the name the bed sheet "leaf lettuce' was soaking wet the bun not grilled was plan and so was all the ingredients and did not stand up to its name, Not spicy at all, But for someone who can not stand taco sauce it just might be,and again not sure of that, the fries were cut thick and again very plain and a lot of potato, too much for me I only eat half of my burger and threw away half of my meal, Better off going to smash burger and getting the Colorado burger much better and maybe the owners should try it as an example..

“One of the best burgers around but pricey for Eagle”


Reviewed July 6, 2015



via mobile




The burger choices and flavor are worth the visit. Each is loaded with fresh and flavorful ingredients. There is a turkey and salmon burger as well and the salmon was good. The truffle fries are too soft and way overpriced for the quantity. The onion rings were excellent with the tasty BBQ ranch dip. Interesting drinks on the soda fountain and large selection of bottled root beers. I believe beer is coming soon. We will return.

“GOOD AND HOPEFULLY GETS BETTER”


Reviewed July 1, 2015




Being brand new you could tell they were still hashing out the kinks. Need more tables inside and out. There was a line of people waiting for the one person trying to wait on everyone, but with time the lines should die down. I mean everybody loves a good burger!Price was OK, but the burger was a little small I thought for the price, but making sure the burger is packed will help that issue.Overall I have hope for it as I support all local businesses and have seen too many come and go as restaurants.Seating, quicker orders, and keep the burgers plump will make it an institution here.Mahalo

Reviewed 17 November 2015

Very good high quality ingredients. Price was very reasonable for the quality of product. Had the blue cheese burger with onion rings. Hubby had angel fire with chili fries. We are traveling down 70 to Denver and saw the sign to the place. Good choice! And Tampa honey, you are the sunshine of the place. Enjoyed chatting with you. Keep cooking your menu and you shall succeed!

Reviewed 30 August 2015




I ordered their blue cheese burger, it was undercooked. Their homemade French firs were swimming in a pool of oil. When I complaint about the burger being cooked medium rare, the owner stated that their ground beef comes from certified angus beef. I was pointless to argue that ground beef can be contaminated during processing. At least they offered to refund my money, after pointing out the small lettering in their menu that states that all burger are cooked medium unless otherwise requested.

Lux F3Reviewed April 1, 2017 Good burger but overpricedThis restaurant is walking distance from the hotel I always stay at. The choice of burgers are all really good. The burgers are a bit overpriced though, but I will definitely return because of how delicious the burgers areThank Lux F 



GEORGE SEagle, Colorado13638Reviewed March 1, 2017 GOOD BURGERS!!!Have not been to Expert Burger since it opened and my wife and I decided to give it another try. The first time was OK, but being new, crowded, and still working the kinks out keep us away.
You have a good choice of burgers...MoreThank GEORGE S 



Anne MDenver, Colorado1718Reviewed January 5, 2017 Amazing Burgers and Fries!This place specializes in fancy burgers and fries--this is not McDonald's! I had a delicious salmon burger and truffle fries--both were fantastic! Of course, the prices are not McDonald's either--my meal cost about $15, but was totally worth it!Thank Anne M 



Colleen M3512Reviewed December 2, 2016 via mobile Great people. Great food. Fun decor and friendly folks set me up to totally enjoy this place. Love the food choices. Food tastes great and the portions are perfect!Thank Colleen M 



jeremyrowland59Denver, Colorado2Reviewed November 10, 2016 amazingWe heard about Expert burger through others, and they were right. It is super good, creative and well priced.Thank jeremyrowland59 



Jessica P6Reviewed October 4, 2016 via mobile A must!Truly amazing flavor. Truffle fries and onion rings are great sides. They support local business and have rocky mountain sodas. Loved this place!Thank Jessica P 



stevestrAurora, Colorado9623Reviewed September 17, 2016 Meh.My burger was pretty tasteless and the onion rings were nothing special. Really wanted to like the place based on the previous reviews. Staff was okay but not overly friendly. Only fountain drinks were from Rocky Mountain Soda Company. They tasted okay.Thank stevestr 



Amy PEagle colorado51Reviewed September 12, 2016 Absolutely the tastiest Burger around and the meat is 'never ever' a hormone free productThis is a must eat at place. Fun family friendly spot. The onion rings are my favorite bit the parmesan fries are to die for too.
Try the Sunnyside burger with an egg on top - it's yummy!!!Thank Amy P

Lux F3Reviewed 1 April 2017 Good burger but overpricedThis restaurant is walking distance from the hotel I always stay at. The choice of burgers are all really good. The burgers are a bit overpriced though, but I will definitely return because of how delicious the burgers areThank Lux F 



GEORGE SEagle, Colorado13638Reviewed 1 March 2017 GOOD BURGERS!!!Have not been to Expert Burger since it opened and my wife and I decided to give it another try. The first time was OK, but being new, crowded, and still working the kinks out keep us away.
You have a good choice of burgers...MoreThank GEORGE S 



Anne MDenver, Colorado1718Reviewed 5 January 2017 Amazing Burgers and Fries!This place specializes in fancy burgers and fries--this is not McDonald's! I had a delicious salmon burger and truffle fries--both were fantastic! Of course, the prices are not McDonald's either--my meal cost about $15, but was totally worth it!Thank Anne M

stevestrAurora, Colorado9623Reviewed 17 September 2016 Meh.My burger was pretty tasteless and the onion rings were nothing special. Really wanted to like the place based on the previous reviews. Staff was okay but not overly friendly. Only fountain drinks were from Rocky Mountain Soda Company. They tasted okay.Thank stevestr 



Amy PEagle colorado51Reviewed 12 September 2016 Absolutely the tastiest Burger around and the meat is 'never ever' a hormone free productThis is a must eat at place. Fun family friendly spot. The onion rings are my favorite bit the parmesan fries are to die for too.
Try the Sunnyside burger with an egg on top - it's yummy!!!Thank Amy P
