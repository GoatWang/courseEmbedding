CUSTOMER REVIEWS
              Just got the pictures that I ordered and they look incredible! Better than I thought they would to be honest, the frames are beautiful and solid, much more refined than I had thought they may be. I can't get over the quality of the picture either, the matting is just stunningly done. I will definitely be coming back to look for some other pieces. Thanks again!!- Trevor, West Virginia

DESIGNER TIPS AND DECORATING IDEASShould All Frames Match in a Room? The answer is twofold. If you are creating a grouping of similar art on the wall, then yes, there should be cohesion to your frames. They don't have to be identical frames, but their colors should be consistent. For example, variations of black frames. This way, the focus is on the artwork or the photography, rather than on the huge assortment of frames. However, if you are adding singular pieces, dispersed throughout a room, than you can use different frames. Each artwork should have the most suitable frame, complimenting it and the room's decor. If the frames happen to match, than that's great, but they don't have to be identical throughout the entire room. Show off your personality in your artwork and your frame choices!

				When riding on pavement, the inverted tread on these tires overcome the high rolling resistance and poor traction of knobby tires.


Low-profile inverted tread is in continuous contact with the road, and doesn't loose energy thumping from one knob to the next
On pavement, they corner just like road tires with lean angles up to 45°  for speed with a higher margin of safety

The equations overlap the text!  What can I do to fix this? Show Answer 

	If the equations are overlapping the text (they are probably all shifted downwards from where they should be) then you are probably using Internet Explorer 10 or Internet Explorer 11.  To fix this problem you will need to put your browser in "Compatibly Mode" (see instructions below).  Alternatively, you can view the pages in Chrome or Firefox as they should display properly in the latest versions of those browsers without any additional steps on your part.

	
Put Internet Explorer 10 in Compatibility Mode
Look to the right side of the address bar at the top of the Internet Explorer window.  You should see an icon that looks like a piece of paper torn in half.  Click on this and you have put the browser in Compatibility View for my site and the equations should display properly.
Put Internet Explorer 11 in Compatibility Mode
    Look to the right side edge of the Internet Explorer window.  You should see a gear icon (it should be right below the "x" icon for closing Internet Explorer).  Click on this to open the Tools menu.  Down towards the bottom of the Tools menu you should see the option "Compatibility View Settings".  Select this option to open a dialog box.  In the "Add this website" box Internet Explorer should already have filled in "lamar.edu" for you, if not fill that in.  Then all you need to do is click the "Add" button and you will have put the browser in Compatibility View for my site and the equations should display properly.


Can you help me with a problem/homework/etc? Show Answer 

Short Answer : No.
Long Answer : No. 
Long Answer with Explanation : I'm not trying to be a jerk with the previous two answers but the answer really is "No".  Here's why.  
	
	My first priority is always to help the students who have paid to be in one of my classes here at Lamar University (that is my job after all!).  I also have quite a few duties in my department that keep me quite busy at times.  All this means that I just don't have a lot of time to be helping random folks who contact me via this website.  I would love to be able to help everyone but the reality is that I just don't have the time.  So, because I can't help everyone who contacts me for help I don't answer any of the emails asking for help.
	
	Also, when I first started this site I did try to help as many as I could and quickly found that for a small group of people I was becoming a free tutor and was constantly being barraged with questions and requests for help.  Unfortunately there were a small number of those as well that were VERY demanding of my time and generally did not understand that I was not going to be available 24 hours/day, 7 days/week for help.  I really got tired of dealing with those kinds of people and that was one of the reasons (along with simply getting busier here at Lamar) that made me decide to quit answering any email asking for help.
	
	So, while I'd like to answer all emails for help, I can't and so I'm sorry to say that all emails requesting help will be ignored.


Where are the answers/solutions to the Assignment Problems? Show Answer 

	Answer/solutions to the assignment problems do not exist.  Those are intended for use by instructors to assign for homework problems if they want to.  Having solutions (and for many instructors even just having the answers) readily available would defeat the purpose of the problems.  Please do not email asking for the solutions/answers as you won't get them from me.


How do I download pdf versions of the pages? Show Answer 

	There are a variety of ways to download pdf versions of the material on the site.
From Content Page
	If you are on a particular content page hover/click on the "Downloads" menu item.  You will be presented with a variety of links for pdf files associated with the page you are on.  Included in the links will be links for the full Chapter and E-Book of the page you are on (if applicable) as well as links for the Notes, Practice Problems, Solutions to the Practice Problems and Assignment Problems.  The links for the page you are on will be highlighted so you can easily find them.
From Download Page
	All pdfs available for download can be found on the Download Page.  Links to the download page can be found in the Download Menu, the Misc Links Menu and at the bottom of each page.  Once on the Download Page simply select the topic you wish to download pdfs from.  This will present you with another menu in which you can select the specific page you wish to download pdfs for.  Once you have made a selection from this second menu up to four links (depending on whether or not practice and assignment problems are available for that page) will show up below the second menu that you can click on to initiate the download.
From Site Map Page
	The Site Map Page for the site will contain a link for every pdf that is available for downloading.  You can access the Site Map Page from the Misc Links Menu or from the link at the bottom of every page.
Note for Internet Explorer Users
	If you are using Internet Explorer in all likelihood after clicking on a link to initiate a download a gold bar will appear at the bottom of your browser window that will allow you to open the pdf file or save it.
	


I've found a typo in the material. Show Answer 

	If you have found a typo or mistake on a page them please contact me and let me know of the typo/mistake.  Please be as specific as possible in your report.  Let me know what page you are on and just what you feel the typo/mistake is.  It's kind of hard to find the potential typo if all you write is "The 2 in problem 1 should be a 3" (and yes I've gotten handful of typo reports like that...). 


Some of the equations are too small for me to see! Show Answer 

	This is a problem with some of the equations on the site unfortunately.  It is especially true for some exponents and occasionally a "double prime" 2nd derivative notation will look like a "single prime".  You can click on any equation to get a larger view of the equation.  Clicking on the larger equation will make it go away.

	If you are a mobile device (especially a phone) then the equations will appear very small.  I am attempting to find a way around this but it is a function of the program that I use to convert the source documents to web pages and so I'm somewhat limited in what I can do.  I am hoping they update the program in the future to address this.  In the mean time you can sometimes get the pages to show larger versions of the equations if you flip your phone into landscape mode.

	Another option for many of the "small" equation issues (mobile or otherwise) is to download the pdf versions of the pages.  These often do not suffer from the same problems.


Is there any way to get a printable version of the solution to a particular Practice Problem? Show Answer 

	Yes.  If you want a printable version of a single problem solution all you need to do is click on the "[Solution]" link next to the problem to get the solution to show up in the solution pane and then from the "Solution Pane Options" select "Printable Version" and a printable version of that solution will appear in a new tab of your browser.

Next Section  3-Dimensional Space (Introduction)





 Cross Product

In this final section of this chapter we will look at the
cross product of two vectors.  We should
note that the cross product requires both of the vectors to be three
dimensional vectors.  
 
Also, before getting into how to compute these we should
point out a major difference between dot products and cross products.  The result of a dot product is a number and
the result of a cross product is a vector! 
Be careful not to confuse the two.
 
So, let’s start with the two vectors  and  then the cross product is given by the
formula,
 



 



 
This is not an easy formula to remember.  There are two ways to derive this
formula.  Both of them use the fact that
the cross product is really the determinant of a 3x3 matrix.  If you don’t know what this is that is don’t
worry about it.  You don’t need to know
anything about matrices or determinants to use either of the methods.  The notation for the determinant is as
follows,
 



 



                                                                        
The first row is the standard basis vectors and must appear
in the order given here.  The second row
is the components of  and the third row is the components of .  Now, let’s take a look at the different
methods for getting the formula.
 
The first method uses the Method of Cofactors.  If you don’t know the method of cofactors
that is fine, the result is all that we need. 
Here is the formula.
 



                                          
where,
                                                            



 
This formula is not as difficult to remember as it might at
first appear to be.  First, the terms
alternate in sign and notice that the 2x2 is missing the column below the
standard basis vector that multiplies it as well as the row of standard basis
vectors.
 
The second method is slightly easier; however, many
textbooks don’t cover this method as it will only work on 3x3
determinants.  This method says to take
the determinant as listed above and then copy the first two columns onto the
end as shown below.






 


 



 
We now have three diagonals that move from left to right and
three diagonals that move from right to left. 
We multiply along each diagonal and add those that move from left to
right and subtract those that move from right to left.
 
This is best seen in an example.  We’ll also use this example to illustrate a
fact about cross products.
 



Example 1  If
   and  compute each of the following.
(a)  
(b)  
Solution
(a)  Here is the computation for this one.
                
(b) And here is
  the computation for this one.
                



 
Notice that switching the order of the vectors in the cross
product simply changed all the signs in the result.  Note as well that this means that the two
cross products will point in exactly opposite directions since they only differ
by a sign.  We’ll formalize up this fact
shortly when we list several facts.
 
There is also a geometric interpretation of the cross
product.  First we will let θ  be the angle between the two vectors  and  and assume that ,
then we have the following fact,









(1)



and the following figure.

 
There should be a natural question at this point.  How did we know that the cross product
pointed in the direction that we’ve given it here?  
 
First, as this figure, implies the cross product is
orthogonal to both of the original vectors. 
This will always be the case with one exception that we’ll get to in a
second.
 
Second, we knew that it pointed in the upward direction (in
this case) by the “right hand rule”. 
This says that if we take our right hand, start at  and rotate our fingers towards  our thumb will point in the direction
of the cross product.  Therefore, if we’d
sketched in  above we would have gotten a vector in the
downward direction.
 



Example 2  A
  plane is defined by any three points that are in the plane.  If a plane contains the points ,
   and  find a vector that is orthogonal to the
  plane.
 
Solution
The one way that we know to get an orthogonal vector is to
  take a cross product.  So, if we could
  find two vectors that we knew were in the plane and took the cross product
  of these two vectors we know that the cross product would be orthogonal to
  both the vectors.  However, since both
  the vectors are in the plane the cross product would then also be orthogonal
  to the plane.
 
So, we need two vectors that are in the plane.  This is where the points come into the
  problem. Since all three points lie in the plane any vector between them must
  also be in the plane.  There are many
  ways to get two vectors between these points. 
  We will use the following two,
                                              
 
The cross product of these two vectors will be orthogonal
  to the plane.  So, let’s find the cross
  product.
                                                  
 
So, the vector  will be orthogonal to the plane containing
  the three points.



 
Now, let’s address the one time where the cross product will
not be orthogonal to the original vectors. 
If the two vectors,  and ,
are parallel then the angle between them is either 0 or 180 degrees.  From (1)
this implies that,



 


 


 



 
From a fact about the magnitude we saw in the first section
we know that this implies
 
In other words, it won’t be orthogonal to the original
vectors since we have the zero vector. 
This does give us another test for parallel vectors however.
 
Fact



If  then  and  will be parallel vectors.



 
Let’s also formalize up the fact about the cross product
being orthogonal to the original vectors.
 
Fact



Provided  then  is orthogonal to both  and .



 
Here are some nice properties about the cross product.
 
Properties



If ,
   and  are vectors and c is a number then,
                    



 
The determinant in the last fact is computed in the same way
that the cross product is computed.  We
will see an example of this computation shortly.
 
There are a couple of geometric applications to the cross
product as well.  Suppose we have three
vectors ,
 and  and we form the three dimensional figure shown
below.

 
The area of the parallelogram (two dimensional front of this
object) is given by,
 






 


 



 
and the volume of the parallelepiped (the whole three
dimensional object) is given by,
 
 
 
Note that the absolute value bars are required since the
quantity could be negative and volume isn’t negative.
 
We can use this volume fact to determine if three vectors
lie in the same plane or not.  If three
vectors lie in the same plane then the volume of the parallelepiped will be
zero.
 



Example 3  Determine
  if the three vectors ,
   and  lie in the same plane or not.
 
Solution
So, as we noted prior to this example all we need to do is
  compute the volume of the parallelepiped formed by these three vectors.  If the volume is zero they lie in the same
  plane and if the volume isn’t zero they don’t lie in the same plane.
 
                
 
So, the volume is zero and so they lie in the same plane.
