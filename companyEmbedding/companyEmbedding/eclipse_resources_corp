Key Operating Areas
Eclipse Resources core acreage position is well delineated in the heart of a world class play.  

Noble, Guernsey, Monroe, Belmont and Harrison Counties, located in Eastern Ohio.




Superior Technical and Operational Expertise
We have assembled a team of technical specialists, individually selected as the best in their respective fields, and have implemented an organizational structure that emphasizes a systematic, process-driven approach to developing our asset base. Utilizing the expertise of our employees, consultants and top level service companies, allows us to complete the drilling process quickly and efficiently, while keeping operating costs to a minimum.




Eclipse has increased its lateral length by over 33% since its inception while significantly lowering its cost per lateral foot to industry leading levels
Peering leading drilling days averaging just 17 in the higher pressure, deeper and more technically challenged portion of our acreage in the dry gas areas
When compare to peers, Eclipses recent dry gas well costs per lateral foot have outperformed peers by 15-25%



Diversified Midstream Strategy
Eclipse’s acreage is centered across a confluence of major pipelines in the country providing significant in and out of basin optionality.  The company’s transportation portfolio follows our projected production volume growth and that ramp in production is properly matched to our pipeline commitments.  Our gathering and processing contracts are supported by acreage dedications rather than volumetric commitments. This in place capacity allows us to achieve tighter differentials while allowing production to flow to premium markets and a diversity of customers.



Firm gathering, processing and fractionation with Blue Racer Midstream for its operated Utica Shale liquids area acreage in place
Firm gathering with Eureka Hunter for its operated Utica Shale dry gas acreage in place
Firm condensate gathering and stabilization with EnLink Midstream in place





Environmental Excellence
We believe the pursuit of excellence requires a commitment to sound environmental practices, the promotion of a safe work environment and corporate social responsibility.  We live this commitment each day through the implementation of best management practices that are utilized throughout the well development process and in every operation.  Ohio has a long history of oil and gas production and we have built a solid, cooperative relationship with Federal, State and Local Regulators.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    0.82      Net Money Flow ($)  -32,970    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.

We're committed toDoing the right thing for the  communities in which we operateLearn About Our Operations Unmatched technical and operational proficiency sets us apartLearn About Our Management Team We have a Proven Track Record of Achieving Results Learn About Our Operations We’re focused on the exploration and development of  Oil & Natural Gas Properties in the Appalachian BasinLearn About Leasing with Eclipse  











Eclipse Resources
Eclipse is an independent exploration and production company engaged in the acquisition and development of oil and natural gas properties in the Appalachian Basin. Its business strategy is to create stockholder value by aggressively developing its asset base while generating industry-leading rates of return on our capital.
Brief History
Eclipse began assembling our acreage position in 2011 based upon an analytical evaluation of the shale properties within the Utica and Point Pleasant formations across Eastern Ohio, and based upon this evaluation, concentrated its acquisition efforts in an area spanning parts of 5 counties that it believes is the most prolific region of the play. This area includes parts of Noble, Guernsey, Monroe, Belmont and Harrison Counties. Eclipse has assembled an acreage position in Eastern Ohio of approximately 112,000 net acres located in what we believe to be the most prolific and economic area of the Utica Shale fairway and approximately 14,000 of these net acres are also prospective for the highly liquids rich area of the Marcellus Shale in Eastern Ohio.
Eclipse has identified approximately 16 years of risked horizontal drilling locations across our acreage, while extending our type curve lateral length to over 13,000 feet and improving our cost per lateral foot. Since entering the play in 2011, Eclipse and its operating partners have commenced drilling over 225 wells in this 5 county area, which it believes to be the core of the Utica Shale play.
Competitive Strengths



Net production averaged approximately 229 MMcfe/d per day in 2016
Revenues of $235 million for 2016
Grew proved reserves to 469 Bcfe as of December 31, 2016, representing 35% year over year growth
Liquidity of $342 million as of December 31, 2016
Innovative operational team has revolutionized the cost structure and returns profile of the Utica Shale through its Super Lateral Porgram
