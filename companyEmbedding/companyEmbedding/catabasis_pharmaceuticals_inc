Catabasis Pharmaceuticals to Present Results from the MoveDMD® Trial of Edasalonexent (CAT-1004) at the 2017 PPMD Annual Connect Conference



CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jun. 23, 2017--
      Catabasis
      Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:CATB), a clinical-stage
      biopharmaceutical company, today announced that it will present data
      from Part A and Part B of the MoveDMD trial of edasalonexent (CAT-1004)
      in an oral presentation at the upcoming 2017 Parent Project Muscular
      Dystrophy (PPMD) Annual Connect Conference to be held June 29 – July 2,
      2017, in Chicago, IL, at the Chicago Marriott Downtown.
    
Joanne Donovan, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer of Catabasis, will
      deliver a presentation titled “MoveDMD: Phase 2 Trial of Edasalonexent,
      an NF-kB Inhibitor, in 4 to 7-Year Old Patients with Duchenne Muscular
      Dystrophy” on Friday, June 30, 2017, from 4:30pm – 4:45pm CT.
    
About Edasalonexent (CAT-1004)Edasalonexent (CAT-1004) is
      an investigational oral small molecule that is being developed as a
      potential disease-modifying therapy for all patients affected by DMD,
      regardless of their underlying mutation. Edasalonexent inhibits NF-kB, a
      protein that is activated in DMD and drives inflammation and fibrosis,
      muscle degeneration and suppresses muscle regeneration. We are currently
      conducting the MoveDMD trial, a three-part clinical trial investigating
      the safety and efficacy of edasalonexent in boys ages 4 – 7 affected
      with DMD (any confirmed mutation). The third part of the trial, an
      open-label extension with edasalonexent, is ongoing. The FDA has granted
      orphan drug, fast track and rare pediatric disease designations and the
      European Commission has granted orphan medicinal product designation to
      edasalonexent for the treatment of DMD. For a summary of clinical
      results reported to-date, please visit www.catabasis.com.
    
About CatabasisAt Catabasis Pharmaceuticals, our mission is
      to bring hope and life-changing therapies to patients and their
      families. Our SMART (Safely Metabolized And Rationally Targeted) linker
      drug discovery platform enables us to engineer molecules that
      simultaneously modulate multiple targets in a disease. We are applying

      candidates for rare diseases and plan to pursue partnerships to develop
      additional product candidates. For more information on the Company's
      drug discovery platform and pipeline of drug candidates, please visit www.catabasis.com.
