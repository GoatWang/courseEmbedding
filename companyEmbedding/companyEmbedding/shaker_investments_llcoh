Shaker Investments



 









About Us 

 
We believe there is no substitute for insightful, original research. An understanding of the dynamics of financial markets coupled with detailed, company-specific knowledge is the foundation for superior returns.




Our Commitment
We at Shaker Investments are fully committed to our clients and our community. We work tirelessly to add value for our clients through our investment and risk management activities. In addition to taking an active approach to investment and research, we work with our business partners to maintain a high level of operational diligence, transparency, and risk management. 
Shaker Investments has aligned its interests with those of its clients, as our partners and employees are heavily invested in the firm’s products. Shaker Investments was founded in Cleveland, Ohio, and we take great pride in being part of the vibrant business community of our great city. Also, we happily support many charitable organizations that have personal meaning to our clients and that assist the Cleveland area community.


We live and work right here in Cleveland, and we’re extremely proud to be a Cleveland company.
Rich Rund, Vice President Sales






Strong, In-house Research Capabilities
In light of our investment philosophy, it should be no surprise that our company and our portfolio management process are centered around research. Exhaustive investment research is the key to outperforming the averages and providing our clients with value.
Unlike many other investment management firms, we don’t depend on Wall Street research to identify and assess intriguing companies. At Shaker Investments, we perform our own research to identify leading sectors of growth, and conduct extensive due diligence on every company in which we invest, as well as many in which we don’t. Our strong historical investment returns are tied directly to how well we know the companies represented in our portfolios.

Investment Characteristics | Expert Investment Management
 
















































Shaker Investments



 









Investment Characteristics 
Having identified industries of interest, we identify companies of interest within those target industries. We evaluate the companies to determine which ones we believe are superior to their competitors and, most importantly, which ones we believe are superior growth investment candidates. In making this evaluation, we use a variety of information sources and criteria. Information sources may include filings by the company, meetings with company management, contacts with professionals in the same industries, meetings and presentations at investment and trade conferences, business publications, online databases, and research obtained from brokerage firms. Among the evaluation criteria is a group of eleven characteristics developed by Shaker that helps determine what we call “fundamental superiority.” 

Our Eleven Characteristics of Superior Growth Companies



1. Demonstrable growth
We look for companies in robust industries that have proven their ability to grow faster than similar companies.


2. Sustainable competitive advantage
It’s not enough for a company to be growing. We have to be convinced that it possesses a sufficient competitive advantage, which will allow it to continue to excel.


3. Dominant market leadership
More often than not, strong companies get stronger at the expense of the weak. We want a company to rank in the top three in market share in its industry segment, and to dominate a product or service niche.




4. Strong management
We spend considerable time talking to management. We seek to be convinced that senior managers have formed a coherent team and are collectively prepared to respond to marketplace challenges in a timely and creative manner.


5. A single mission
We are most comfortable when management is focused on a single, well-defined business.


6. Many customers and many different products
We prefer a diversified customer base and a multi-product line, so that a company is not left excessively vulnerable to several key buyers or to a limited number of product offerings.





7. Consistent development of new products and services
We’re attracted to companies that place a significant emphasis on research and development and are consistently bringing innovative products and feature refinements to market.


8. Companies that are praised by customers and competitors
Over time, those companies that are recognized by customers as being “the best at meeting their needs” generally prosper far more than companies with less customer focus. 


9. Positive earnings or cash flow
We’re hesitant to invest in a company that depends heavily upon external equity capital to remain in business. We seek management teams that are extremely focused on creating a level of earnings and/or cash flow that can support ambitious growth plans.




10. Conservative financial statements
We’re attracted to growth companies that maintain a conservative balance sheet with significant cash positions.

11. Significant insider ownership
We’re pleased when management owns a significant portion of a company. This virtually assures that management’s interests are closely aligned with shareholders’ goals.

Products 
 
Shaker Investments acts as an investment manager for individuals and institutions through custodial accounts with brokers or banks. Typical accounts include taxable accounts, Traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs, Profit Sharing of Defined Benefit Plans, and Trusts.




We currently offer two long-only model portfolio investment strategies. Our All Cap Growth portfolio strategy invests in growth companies over a wide range of market capitalization that includes large (more than $10 billion in market value), medium ($3 billion to $10 billion in market value), and small ($3 billion or less in market value) capitalization stocks. 
Our Small Cap Growth portfolio strategy also invests in growth companies and is focused on the small capitalization end of the equity markets. 
All stocks purchased for our clients trade on U.S. stock exchanges, or over the counter, although a number of them may be companies headquartered outside of the United States.

Five Step Approach | Expert Investment Management
 
















































Shaker Investments



 









Five Step Approach 
Our ultimate goal is to select for our portfolios companies that we believe have superior businesses, are capable of sustaining above market growth rates, and whose potential value is not already fully reflected in the company’s stock price. Our approach combines bottom-up fundamental research with macroeconomic and demographic trend analysis to evaluate and choose investments. While we do not try to anticipate short term market movements, we do consider the trading and investment trends of the market prior to making investment decisions.
We employ a five-step strategy when constructing portfolios, buying and selling investments, evaluating our historical performance, and assessing the risks inherent to equity investing.

Our Five Step Approach



Step 1:
We identify investment themes of potential interest. This entails a thorough analysis of short- and long-term macroeconomic trends, including a top-down economic review, demographic factors and industry influences affecting sector growth rates. It also involves frequent visits with senior management, as well as attendance at trade and brokerage research conferences.




Step 2:
We find superior companies. To achieve this, we perform further research that measures potential companies for investment against 11 specified characteristics. The criteria for a company to be included in our portfolios are extremely stringent. Out of the thousands of potential companies for investment in the United States, we are looking for only 30 to 60 to be in our portfolio at any given time (25 to 40 in the Small Cap).



Step 3:
The third step is to construct a portfolio. We continually track 150-200 mid-sized and small U.S. companies that meet our criteria. In-depth, detailed research helps to prevent mistakes, and as a result our portfolio turnover is relatively low.




Step 4:
The fourth step is to re-balance the portfolio periodically. Judicious adjustments can help to manage portfolio risk by limiting overexposure to any one sector or issue.



Step 5:
The fifth step is to give considerable attention to our sell discipline, because often the sale of a stock is as important to portfolio performance as the original purchase.
