  0 Your shop floor has gotten smarter. Time for your people to do the same.
July 17, 2017 

We all know that manufacturing jobs are disappearing. But even for seasoned industry people, the pace of job evaporation is pretty breathtaking. We’ve lost 5,000,000 factory jobs since 2000. Some point to the unintended consequences of poor trade deals, or cheaper labor overseas, as reasons for this phenomenon. But those arguments don’t explain what’s happening. […]















  0 The Wild West of Ransomware is here…
July 10, 2017 

Ransomware is one of the newest malware threats in the news.  (Mal,  the Latin root for “bad” or “evil,” forms  words like malfunction, maltreat, and malice.)  And ransomware is truly bad!  An attack will literally hold companies’ user systems hostage until they agree to pay the “ransom” request via Bitcoin or another hard to trace online […]

June 26, 2017 

In the late 90’s, the front office reception team at Nestle USA would greet incoming calls saying, “This is Nestle.

June 5, 2017 

For two years, I was stationed in a remote area of South Africa teaching English in a poor, rural public school to Zulu-speaking middle schoolers.  Having few resources and books, I relied on chalk and a blackboard to instruct.

  0 Catch Them While You Can: Why You Can No Longer Afford to Ignore the Value of B2B e-commerce
May 22, 2017 

At first, B2B e-commerce was pretty simple. Storefronts, the ability to reorder consumables, or request service. Basic steps in response to an emerging desire by customers to serve themselves, online. Now? Your customers no longer distinguish between you and Amazon or any other consumer outfit. To them, online is online and they expect speed, simplicity, […]
