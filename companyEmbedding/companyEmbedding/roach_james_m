After a roach infestation, you will most likely notice skin irritations, rashes, and cockroach bites making you feel self conscious when in public. Even worse, restless nights and insomnia which now affects your personal life, causing anxiousness and nervousness.

While you may see one or two roaches or other insects. Your family and children will feel them the worse. The roaches migrate to food, counter tops, eating areas and can transport disease.


Being Forced To Evacuate


Insomnia and Feeling Self Conscious


When the infestation is left untreated, you will be told to throw away all your valuables, your clothes, countertops, furniture, bedding, etc. Then after all this, you would be asked to politely evacuate and you or a company would use toxic pesticides having you, your family, and your pets feeling homeless for at least 4 weeks.

Top Product of 2014 for Green Pest Control









by Senam – Amazon Review


Below Are Only A Few 5 Star Reviews We Received From
Amazon, Ebay Sears, MyCleaningProducts.com and our other retailers.


by Barb Kelly – Amazon Review


Worked very well. Have not seen a live roach and has been two weeks since I sprayed. Thanks Roach Bully!








I bought this because we had a roach problem. It has a slight odor that smells pleasant. It doesn't give me an asthma attack the way that poisons do. It takes a little longer for the bugs to die, but they do die. I have used it on ants and spiders also.


I recently had a roaches outbreak, and I would see them even in the middle of the day. After I got this item, I sprayed it all over my house, (everywhere) and let it dry for a few minutes (or hours) and then went to bed: I did not see one roach!

After I washed my older blanket -which I thought the roaches were hiding in- I sprayed it silly, as well, and went to sleep soundly. Those roaches have not come back yet.

This product works!! The roaches might simply be hiding for now, I’m not sure, but I intend to spray my entire bed room soon, to make sure they never show their ugly bug faces again. This was a good expense.


We were scared out of our wits with roaches when I notice a roach crawling on my child. I found you guys from a friend and want to thank you. Roach Bully is a great product and worked as promised. No more  roaches. You have saved me a ton of worry. Thank you.


A Must If You Have A Roach Problem!








We recently had roaches in my apartment building. They did not hire an exterminator right away. I purchased this product and sprayed the area in the doorway to my apartment because I did not want the roaches coming into my apartment. I also sprayed the areas under my bathroom and kitchen sinks. I believe that this product helped a lot.

I have not seen any roach in my apartment and I hope I never do.


Great Stuff!

- Stephanie - Amazon Review


This has been used on two occasions in the past three years due to apartment roach infestations. It has been effective both times. The smell is there, but not unpleasant. We have a house cat and the product has been harmless, as described, to her. This product is a very “green” product and I highly recommend this over any type of chemical infestation treatment that may be out there. Shipping was great as well as packaging.


Bully Those Roaches


Bully Those Roaches!








by Gentle Deer Lion Tamer– Amazon Review


I had Roach Bully sent to my son who is living in Harlem. He had roaches all over the house. I sent him detailed instructions on how to use it with DE. Needless to say, the kid did not follow my instructions and just sprayed it around and sprinkled the DE into the carpet where he sleeps!

Thankfully it WORKED!

He sleeps on the floor on an air mattress and this stuff works! The roaches have disappeared and his spirits are better.

He thinks I’m joking when I told him that when he comes home he’s coming in the back door naked while I take his stuff to the laundromat ha ha!


Roach Bully has been a Top Green Product with large pest control companies, hotels and health facilities, farms, and animal clinics. Since it’s public release we have already received great feedback from our customers in helping them get rid of their roach problem.

Belleair, Florida, United States


Occupation

Known for
Chairman and CEO of General Motors


James M. Roche (December 16, 1906 – June 6, 2004) was an American statistician who served as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chairman of the Board at General Motors Corporation. He is credited for promoting racial equality within General Motors (GM).

Early life and background[edit]
Roche was born in Elgin, Illinois. He married Louise McMillan in 1929[1] and eventually had a daughter and two sons.[2] Roche never went to college [3] because of his father's early death.[4] He was one of the few American industrialists lacking a college education.[3]
General Motors career[edit]
He joined GM as a statistician in 1927 in the Chicago sales and service branch[2] and slowly worked his way up through the ranks, becoming president of the corporation in 1965.[5] Most of his career was spent at the Cadillac Division, becoming head of the division in 1957.[2] Roche became vice-president of General Motors in 1957, and executive vice-president and board member in 1962.[1]
Involvement in equal opportunity and other controversies at GM[edit]
Roche is cited as dedicating General Motors and himself personally to ensuring equal employment opportunities.[4] In 1971, he offered Rev. Leon Sullivan, a Philadelphia minister active in the civil rights movement, a seat on the GM board - GM's first black board member. Sullivan later sought to have GM and other corporations leave South Africa in protest of the country's apartheid policies.[2]
In 1966, Roche issued an apology for the company's efforts to discredit consumer activist Ralph Nader after Nader published the book Unsafe at Any Speed, which criticized the GM-built Corvair as being unsafe.[2]
During Roche's tenure, public opinion about automobile companies was changing from praise for producing cars which allowed freedom and mobility to dissatisfaction.[6]
Chairman and Chairman of the Board[edit]
Roche served as Chairman of GM from June 1, 1965, to October 31, 1967, and as Chairman of the Board of Directors from November 1, 1967, to December 31, 1971.[7] He retired in 1971 because of a mandatory retirement age.[2]
Other career achievements[edit]
Roche served on the board of directors of PepsiCo, Jack Eckerd Corp., the New York Stock Exchange and other entities. After retirement he served several years as chairman of the National Committee for Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve. He also volunteered in many community development programs, mostly in Detroit.[2] Roche was quoted as saying in 1987, "Anybody who achieves a top position in an organization owes a debt of some kind,... If you have a talent and you have your health, you should help others."[2]
Roche is an inductee to the Automotive Hall of Fame. Ten colleges and universities awarded him honorary degrees.[4]
Time magazine called "Roche is a folksy sort who never shows his temper and whose greatest failing, according to companions and competitors alike, is that 'he may be too much of a gentleman.' "[3]

For example, a doctor may improperly diagnose, treat or medicate outside the standard of medical care. The three types of malpractice are: a settlement, an arbitration award, or a judgment.If my doctor has malpractice history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact the quality of care you receive. Claim settlements and arbitration awards may occur for a variety of reasons, which should not necessarily reflect negatively on the doctor's professional competence or conduct.You may want to use this information to start a discussion with the doctor about his or her history and specific ability to provide healthcare for you.How far back does Healthgrades malpractice history go?Healthgrades reports details of a doctor’s malpractice history when the doctor has at least one closed medical malpractice claim within the last five years, even if he or she no longer practices in that state.For which states does Healthgrades collect malpractice history?Healthgrades collects malpractice information from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia. If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact your quality of care. Sometimes multiple states report the same claim. If a provider practices in a state where data is unavailable, please reach out to your local state legislature to help make this data publicly available.0SanctionsNo sanctions history found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What is a sanction or disciplinary actionWhat is a sanction or disciplinary action?A sanction, also known as a disciplinary action, is an action taken to punish or restrict a doctor who has demonstrated professional misconduct. Sanctions may be imposed by a state medical board, professional medical licensing organization, or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.If my doctor has sanction history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a sanction, it does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor-quality doctor. Some sanctions are not related to medical care, and involve a doctor’s finances or administrative activities. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, we recommend that you evaluate the doctor’s sanction information and determine how severe or relevant you think the sanction cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades sanction history go?Healthgrades reports state and federal sanctions from the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect sanction history?Healthgrades collects sanction history from all 50 U.S. states. Physicians with a disciplinary action in one state may move to another state where they have a clean record. Since Healthgrades painstakingly compiles disciplinary action information from all 50 states, Healthgrades website will show if a physician has a disciplinary action in more than one state.0Board ActionsNo board actions found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What are board actionsWhat are board actions?Board actions are non-disciplinary actions imposed upon a doctor based on a complaint investigation. A patient or medical colleague may file a complaint with that state medical board or professional licensing organization, which then investigates the complaint. Board actions are intended to ensure that a doctor is able to perform safe medical and health care tasks.Types of non-disciplinary actions include an advisory letter, a corrective action agreement, a limitation or restriction on the medical or healthcare tasks a doctor can perform, or a voluntary agreement by the doctor not to practice. A board action can also include a termination of a corrective action agreement or voluntary agreement, which allows the doctor to return to full practice.If my doctor has a board action, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a board action, it means he or she has had a non-disciplinary action imposed upon him or her. It does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor quality doctor. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, evaluate the doctor's board action information and determine how severe or relevant you think the cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades non-disciplinary board action history go?Healthgrades reports non-disciplinary board action history from for the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect non-disciplinary board actions?Healthgrades collects non-disciplinary board actions from all 50 U.S. states.Conditions TreatedBlood in Urine (Hematuria)Prostate CancerEducationMedical SchoolMed Coll Of WiGraduated in 1967Residency HospitalUniversity Iowa Hosps and ClinicsVet Affairs Med Center W LaLanguages SpokenEnglishMemberships & Professional AffiliationsDr. Roach does not have any memberships or affiliations listed.

James Roach (c1740-1792) of Orange County, North Carolina










by Nathan W. Murphy, MA, Accredited Genealogist®
James Roach settled in Orange County, North Carolina during the Revolutionary War Era.  His origins are unknown.  He probably had a brother named William Roach who also lived in Orange County, North Carolina with whom he associated (as seen in old records in that county).  James married a woman named Ann who later married John Reading following Roach’s death in 1792.  James left a will and accompanying deeds indicate he owned a large “mansion” house.  His will states his mother (unnamed) lived with him in 1792.  His younger children were raised in the homes of nearby families according to court records in Orange and Person Counties, North Carolina.  Many of his descendants settled in Grainger County, Tennessee.
DNA analysis of descendants of James Roach (c1740-1792) and William Buck Roach (1806-____) reveals a match. These two men share a common ancestor.
