Company – Lithortech Resources Inc.





































































 





 
























THE COMPANYAbout Lithortech Resources Inc.

Lithortech Resources, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Oroplata Resources, Inc., is a lithium resource explorer and developer, with a primary focus on becoming a low cost provider for the flourishing lithium battery industry. Through steady-handed management and keen attention to market conditions, we have acquired a number of lithium resources throughout the West Nevada region. The ultimate goal of our operation is to local, develop and supply lithium to key buyers like Tesla, Tesla, Faraday, Panasonic, AESC, LG, BYD and even utility companies.The world is in the midst of a revolution. Every day, the number of fossil fuels on the planet grows smaller and smaller. This necessitates the transition to sustainable energy sources, particularly in the automotive (car) sector. Companies like Tesla are rapidly gaining market share in this fast growing industry. However, these innovators will need access to large amounts of lithium for the batteries that make their vehicles run. As the owner of some of the richest Lithium mines in the country, Lithortech is perfectly positioned to be a leading supplier of raw materials to this fast-growing industry.Lithortech Resources also has one of the largest land packages in Nevada covering over 20,000 acres. The land package is highly prospective and close to the only producing lithium operation in North America – Silver Peak, owned and operated by Albemarle, one the world’s largest lithium producers.
Oroplata Resources Inc., our parent company, is listed on the OTCBB under the symbol ORRP.

Oroplata Resources Inc (OTCBB:ORRP) Hits The OTC

Oroplata Resources Inc (OTCBB:ORRP) has hit the OTC with a bang. The company was long dormant until it announced early this month that it was acquiring a Lithium property and Craig Alford was joining the company as CEO. Penny stock investors know that lithium remains one of the hottest sectors on the OTC Markets and explains the strong interest in shares of ORRP. Investors are now asking how much higher can shares of ORRP run?
On June 1, ORRP announced that it  entered into a binding purchase agreement to acquire the Western Nevada Basin project in Southwest Nevada. The Western Nevada Basin Project covers the south central portion of an area that was first identified as Lithium rich by the United States Geological Survey. The Project includes 500 mining claims covering approximately 10,000 acres. The company also has an option to acquire another 600 mining claims, approximately 12,000 acres. Oroplata will acquire a 100% interest in the project and the vendors of the project will retain a royalty equal to 2% of the gross value of mineral products recovered from commercial production, which may be reduced to 1% with a single payment of $1,000,000 at any time prior to production.
At the same time as acquiring the Western Nevada Basin Project, ORRP appointed Craig Alford to the position of CEO and a Director of the Company. He holds both a Bachelor of Science (Hons), a Master of Science in Geology and is a registered Professional Geoscientist (P.Geo) in Ontario and a Qualified Person as defined in National Instrument 43-101. He said:
“I am delighted to be joining Oroplata at this very exciting and important point in the Company’s history. This is a company to watch. The demand for Lithium has only just begun to grow and Oroplata has put together some exceptional Lithium projects in the Southwest U.S., including the Western Nevada Basin Project.”
ORRP has chosen to focus on Lithium brine and this is a smart move. Lithium Brine projects have a number of significant advantages over conventional hard rock Lithium mining projects; they are cheaper to explore compared to the alternatives; they are quicker in proving up a resource and reserves; they are faster and much less capital intensive to put into production. Lithium brine production also has a much smaller environmental footprint and produces ready-to-ship Lithium carbonate.
Prices for Lithium carbonate are up 47% from the average price in 2015 in the first quarter of this year and numerous sources have reported the potential growth in demand for Lithium to be very robust. The Nevada-based Tesla Gigafactory, expected to open on July 29th 2016, will produce advanced lithium batteries for Tesla. Elon Musk has stated that Tesla will need to consume the entire lithium market to meet its demands of 500,000 Model 3’s by 2018. Chinese demand of lithium has been another factor behind the surge of the lithium market which is driven by the country’s desire for electric cars and buses.
In a report from Goldman Sachs called “What if I told you” Goldman refers to lithium as the “new gasoline”. This is due to increasing demand for electric vehicles. The cause is that the lithium market could triple from the current demand of 160,000mt to 470,000mt by 2025. Just 1% EV penetration into the market increases demand by 70,000mt a year.
In addition to Craig Alford becoming CEO, ORRP also added William (Bill) Hunter as Director of Finance and Gregory Kuzma to the Board of Directors and VP of Exploration. CEO Craig Alford said:
“Oroplata is already off to an exciting start with the acquisition of some potentially very valuable Lithium Brine projects in Nevada. Now we expect the appointment of two highly qualified professionals to our team will be a tremendous further boost to the Company. Greg and Bill are very experienced and knowledgeable, and both have great track records in the mining sector. We expect they will be a great addition and help support Oroplata’s continued growth strategy.”

Currently trading with a market cap of $66 million, ORRP is certainly one name to keep an eye on. The company now has a seasoned mining team behind it centered around lithium, which is perhaps the hottest mining sector to be in right now. We expect the new team to focus on fund raising and bringing the Western Nevada Basin Project online. We will be updating Insider Financial as soon as we know more.

		​Oroplata Resources Inc. Has One of the Most Favorable Risk Profiles in the Inherently Risky Junior Lithium Space

Electric vehicle (EV) maker Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is in the news for all the wrong reasons right now, as questions surrounding the safety of its vehicles, and specifically, their autopilot feature, dominates the media. The company may be taking some heat, but there's one thing we can say for sure – the situation will pass. Sentiment fluctuates, and when it reverses, Tesla will get back to doing what it does best – spearheading the EV revolution.
The EV space going to dominate personal travel within the next two decades, likely sooner, and companies like Tesla are almost certain to benefit from the shift it and others are sparking. As far as potential exposures go, Tesla is, of course, a direct option. There are a few alternative exposures available, however; exposures rooted in the wider EV industry.
One that is just getting started is Oroplata Resources Inc. (OTCMKTS:ORRP).
Oroplata is a lithium explorer based in Nevada. The company is currently in the process of surveying salt flats for lithium brine – something that we'll get to in a little more detail shortly.
Before that, however, why lithium?
Lithium is the core component for the batteries that power electric vehicles. Lithium ion batteries are lightweight, rechargeable and high energy density, making them ideal for EV powering. There's already a large market for lithium ion batteries – they are the power source of choice in most cell phones and other personal electronic items. In turn, there's already a pretty healthy market for lithium. It's nothing, however, compared to what it will be if EV demand increases in line with analyst forecasts. Analysts expect global lithium demand to rise 8.9% annually through 2019, reaching just short of 50,000 metric tons annually. Tesla's Gigafactory, the Nevada plant at which the company intends to build its EVs, will account for 15,000 of these tons from the start of 2017. This increase in demand can only have one impact on the per ton price of lithium carbonate (the raw material used in the batteries), and that's an increase. Back in 2000, lithium carbonate went for around $1,500 a ton. The price is currently closer to $6,000, and that's based on the limited penetration EVs have had to date. As price rises, the incentive to mine and process lithium rises. As does, in turn, the value of the resources owned by the mining companies.
So, that answers the question as to why lithium is an attractive space right now. Why Oroplata?
 

 First, it's important to note that there are some inherent risks associated with allocating capital to this end of the lithium market. The companies involved have plenty of upside potential, sure, but they are similar in risk profile to a gold or silver junior. Companies like Oroplata don’t produce at this stage, and there's no guarantee that they will reach the production stage near term. All we can do is look at the facts, and form an opinion based on what we know. Sometimes, of course, this opinion might be wrong, but if it's not, the reward on offer can be enough to outweigh the risk of fact misinterpretation. The facts underpinning Oroplata are what make the company attractive, and the reward seems to outweigh the risk at the company's current price.
With this in mind, let's look at the facts.
As mentioned above, the company's primary real estate is in Nevada – the state widely considered as the epicenter of lithium mining in the US. Nevada is where the current lead producers mine and process lithium carbonate, and it's also where Tesla is building its Gigafactory.
Its primary resource is the Western Nevada Basin project, a circa 10,000-acre property that houses more than 500 mining claims, and has the option to tack on a further 22,000 acres and 600 more mining claims if it wishes to going forward. The property is lithium brine, which is one of two primary types of mineral extraction associated with the space. The lithium is located just beneath arid salt flats, in a brine like fluid. Miners pump the brine fluid into what are called evaporation pools, and leave it for a set period. Over the period, and as the name of the pools suggests, the liquid in the pools partly evaporates, and leaves a thick, lithium rich fluid. Companies then add sodium carbonate to the liquid, which precipitates lithium carbonate.
Oroplata just reported an updated resource estimate on its project, based on examination of a large geochemical dataset derived from a United States Geological Survey (USGS) study of the region. The estimate suggested lithium present with an economic grade of between 80 ppm and 200 ppm in the company's core project focus region. To put this in context, the Clayton Valley project, which is currently the largest producing piece of real estate in the US, processes lithium that has a grade of between 150 ppm and 200ppm. In other words, a large portion of the tested region holds lithium of economic grade equal to or better than comparable regions in a currently producing zone.
So the lithium is there, and a USGS survey has confirmed it's of a high enough economic grade to warrant extraction ad processing. What about the team that will oversee this process?
Oroplata's leadership is strong, and is one of the attributes that set it apart from some of the other players in the space. CEO is Craig Alford, a geoscientist and Qualified Person (as as defined in National Instrument 43-101) with more than 30 years of experience in mining projects. He's worked with and for bin names in China, Russia and the US, and prior to his taking the position at Oroplata's helm, played a pivotal role in the Zijin Mining Group investment in mining giant Barrick Gold Corporation (USA) (NYSE:ABX) – a deal worth $298 million at its close.
The company just announced the appointment of Paul Pelosi Jr. to its advisory board. Pelosi is an advisor to the NASA Ames Research Center, founded the Cisco Systems Connected Urban Development team under the direction of Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) CEO John Chambers, and is the son of the former US Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi.
To sum things up, lithium is set to be one of the tightest global markets in terms of supply for the next five decades. A number of companies are breaking into the space, and the nature of exploratory resource mining means most are high risk allocations. Some are also potentially high reward, however, and based on its resource study, real estate location and management team, Oroplata has one of the most favorable risk to reward ratios on offer.(Photo by Famartin)
