In the world of municipal finance, issuers need a partner who understands that options are critical. The market changes rapidly and can be perilous to the unprepared. Issuers with well-conceived financing options are in a position to respond to market changes proactively, rather than reactively.   Sycamore Advisors is engaged from early project planning through continuing disclosure, enabling us to understand our clientsâ goals and provide optional paths, each with a specific set of values.
Sycamore Advisors, LLC is both a WBE and DBE certified financial advisory firm specializing in providing independent advice services to state and local governments.

Independent
Sycamore Advisors, LLC is a leading Indiana-based municipal financial advisory firm specializing in providing independent advice to municipal governments. We have played an integral role in structuring over $4.4 Billion in financing transactions in recent years. Strategically focused, Sycamore brings depth, expertise and a passion for its clients to each assignment. We believe that independence from the underwriter serves the client best in terms structuring the deal, negotiating the distribution and pricing of the securities, and certain aspects of the documents and covenants.

 

Comprehensive
Sycamoreâs involvement with its clients goes far beyond the aspects of a single transaction or deal, with multiple long-term strategic and financial consulting assignments for issuers. We have served as Financial Advisor on contracts involving over $5 Billion in long-term capital projects, including identifying and structuring revenue streams and rate structures, as well as the sizing and timing of the capital plan. Our engagement typically begins long before the Preliminary Offering Statement (POS) has been drafted and continues through Continuing Disclosure submissions and annual budget preparation and revenue forecasting.

 

Issuer Focused
Having been issuers ourselves, we understand our clientâs unique perspective in managing risk and evaluating options. Our staff brings 15 years of direct experience as an issuer to each assignment. We believe a successful financial advisory firm needs to understand the numbers, the credit, the documents and the financial markets. Sycamore Advisors prides itself on its attention to detail, diligence, and communication with its clients on each of these essential pieces of a transaction.
