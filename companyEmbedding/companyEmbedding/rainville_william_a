The surname Rainville is based on the short forms of various Germanic personal names containing the element Ragin, meaning counsel. It it thought that the name could also have been derived from Rennes, in  Brittany. [1]CITATION[CLOSE]Lowe, Mark Anthony, Patronymica Britannica, A Dictionary of Family Names of the United Kingdom. London: John Russel Smith, 1860. Print. However, not all of the family joined the Conqueror as seen by the listing of Warenger Raine in  Normandy (1180-1195.)

    Buy PDF History »The surname Rainville was first found in  Essex where Roger Rayne was granted lands at Rayne as companion in arms of William the Conqueror. Other early spellings of the name include De Raines and Raneis. [1]CITATION[CLOSE]Lowe, Mark Anthony, Patronymica Britannica, A Dictionary of Family Names of the United Kingdom. London: John Russel Smith, 1860. Print. The  Hundredorum Rolls of 1273 list the following: Alice Reine in Cambridgeshire; John Reyn and Nicholas Reyn in Lincolnshire; Robert de Rennes in Oxfordshire; and Richard de Rennes. The  Yorkshire Poll Tax Rolls of 1379 lists: Robert Rayne; Johannes Rayne; Richard Rayneson; and William Rayne.

(ISBN 0-900455-44-6)Rainville Spelling VariationsRainville Spelling VariationsBefore English spelling was standardized a few  hundred years ago,  spelling variations of names were a common occurrence. Elements of Latin, Norman French and other languages became incorporated into English throughout the Middle Ages, and name spellings changed even among the literate. The variations of the surname Rainville include Raines, Raine, Rayne and others.Rainville Early HistoryRainville Early HistoryThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Rainville research.

The voyages were expensive, crowded, and difficult, though, and many arrived in North America sick, starved, and destitute. Those who did make it, however, were greeted with greater opportunities and freedoms that they could have experienced at home. Many of those families went on to make important contributions to the young nations in which they settled. Early immigration records have shown some of the first Rainvilles to arrive on North American shores: Rainville Settlers in United States in the 19th CenturyMme. Eugenie Rainville, aged 37, who emigrated to the United States, in 1893Mr. Henri Rainville, aged 41, who landed in America, in 1893Noel Rainville, aged 47, who landed in America, in 1893Arthur Rainville, aged 26, who landed in America from Paris, in 1897Rainville Settlers in United States in the 20th CenturyGenevieve Rainville, aged 22, who emigrated to the United States from Paris, France, in 1916Georges Rainville, aged 47, who landed in America from Paris, France, in 1916Rainville Settlers in Canada in the 20th CenturyH.

Mottoes first began to be shown with arms in the 14th and 15th centuries, but were not in general use until the 17th century. Thus the oldest coats of arms generally do not include a motto. Mottoes seldom form part of the grant of arms: Under most heraldic authorities, a motto is an optional component of the coat of arms, and can be added to or changed at will; many families have chosen not to display a motto.
