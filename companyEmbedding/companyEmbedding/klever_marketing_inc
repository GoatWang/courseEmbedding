	Klever Marketing™, Inc. was founded by Paul G. Begum,  the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, based upon his belief that through the deployment of various patents and technological applications he could create an in-store marketing tool that would provide consumer package goods manufacturers, advertisers and retailers with Point-of-Selection® access to consumers.

Although other  companies provide a variety of in-store marketing solutions,  no one had successfully brought interactive advertising to shoppers directly at the point of decision.  With over 70% of consumer purchase decisions made at the shelf, Paul knew that the  Company's Klever-Kart® system could revolutionize the way that marketers and retailers could impact the billions of dollars  spent in grocery stores, mass merchandisers, toy stores, home centers and other retail outlets.

Having validated that the Klever-Kart® system would both function in a retail format  and deliver unprecedented product sales results, Klever Marketing™ began preparation for a 1999 roll out of its products and services
