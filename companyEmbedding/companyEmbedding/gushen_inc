	NOTES
	TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS






	FOR
	THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2017






	(Currency
	expressed in United States Dollars (“US$”))






	(Unaudited)





	 





	NOTE
	1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION





	 




	The
	accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by management in accordance with both accounting
	principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation
	S-X. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in audited financial statements prepared in accordance with generally
	accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to those rules and regulations, although the Company believes
	that the disclosures made are adequate to make the information not misleading.




	 




	In
	the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for the fair presentation
	of the financial information for the interim periods reported have been made. Results of operations for the nine months ended
	January 31, 2017 are not necessarily indicative of the results for the year ending April 30, 2017 or any period thereafter.




	 




	These
	unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the Management’s
	Discussion and the audited financial statements and notes thereto included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
	ended April 30, 2016.




	 





	NOTE
	2 - ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS BACKGROUND





	 




	Gushen,
	Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated on March 9, 2015 in the state of Nevada. The Company is a development stage
	company with nominal operations. The principal activities of the Company are the provision of managerial assistance services including
	funding, administrative and IT support services for small and medium enterprises (“SMEs”) and money lending service
	in Hong Kong through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Gushen Holding Limited (“Gushen Holding”), a company incorporated
	in the Republic of Seychelles, and Gushen Credit Limited (“Gushen Credit), a company incorporated in Hong Kong. The Company
	attempts to assist the SMEs which are recently established and at an early stage of operations, but will not participate in board
	of the SMEs or making business decision. The primary purpose behind focusing on providing services to companies at this early
	stage of development will be for the Company to establish and nurture long-term relationships with clients during their growth
	and development.




	 




	On
	August 5, 2016, Gushen Holding acquired 100% equity interest of Gushen Credit Limited, a company incorporated in Hong Kong, for
	a cash consideration of $0.13. Gushen Credit Limited has obtained a Money Lender License by Hong Kong Licensing Court for a period
	of 12 months commencing from December 3, 2015 and is authorized to carry on money lending business in Hong Kong under the Hong
	Kong Money Lender Ordinance (Chapter 163 of the Laws of Hong Kong). Mr. Huang Pin Lung, the director of the Company, is the sole
	stockholder and director of Gushen Credit. The merger of Gushen Credit into Gushen Holding, which has nominal net assets, is considered
	to be acquisition transactions under common control. For accounting purpose, Gushen, Inc., the holding company of Gushen Holding,
	presents consolidated financial statements as of the beginning of the period as though the acquisition had occurred at the beginning
	of the period. Financial statements of all prior periods are retrospectively adjusted to furnish comparative information. No goodwill
	was recognized for these acquisition transactions under common control.




	 




	Gushen,
	Inc. and its subsidiaries are herein after referred to as the “Company”.




	 





	NOTE
	3 - GOING CONCERN UNCERTAINTIES





	 




	The
	accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue
	as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the discharge of liabilities in the normal course of business
	for the foreseeable future.




	 




	As
	of January 31, 2017, the Company suffered an accumulated deficit of $711,417 and incurred a continuous net operating loss of $456,705
	for the nine months ended January 31, 2017. Although the Company has generated revenues from its money lending services, the Company’s
	cash position may not be significant enough to support the Company’s daily operations. The continuation of the Company as
	a going concern through April 30, 2017 is dependent upon improving the profitability and the continuing financial support from
	its stockholders. Management believes the existing shareholders or external financing will provide the additional cash to meet
	the Company’s obligations as they become due.




	 




	These
	and other factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These condensed consolidated
	financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification
	of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result in the Company not being able to continue as a going
	concern.

	TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS






	FOR
	THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2017

	NOTE
	4 -

	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES






	 




	The
	accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements reflect the application of certain significant accounting policies as
	described in this note and elsewhere in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes.




	 





	Basis
	of presentation





	 




	The
	accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
	in the United States of America (“US GAAP”).




	 





	Basis
	of consolidation





	 




	The
	condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All inter-company accounts
	and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.




	 





	Use
	of estimates





	 




	Management
	uses estimates and assumptions in preparing these condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with US GAAP. Those
	estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
	in the balance sheet, and the reported revenue and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results may differ from these
	estimates.




	 





	Plant
	and equipment






	Plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Depreciation is
	calculated on the straight-line basis over the following expected useful lives from the date on which they become fully operational.




	 








	Categories




	 




	Expected
	useful life






	Furniture,
	fixtures, and office equipment




	 




	5
	years






	Leasehold
	improvement




	 




	5
	years







	 





	Cash
	and cash equivalents





	 




	Cash
	and cash equivalents are carried at cost and represent cash on hand, demand deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions
	and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less as of the purchase date of such investments.




	 





	Loans
	receivables





	 




	Loans
	receivables primarily represent loan amount due from customers. Loans receivables are recorded at unpaid principal balances and
	net of an allowance that reflects the Company’s best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected. As of January 31,
	2017, the loans receivables portfolio consists of personal loans.




	 





	Allowance
	for loan losses





	 




	Management’s
	policy is to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level sufficient to absorb estimated probable incurred losses in the
	loan portfolio. The loan loss allowance is a valuation allowance established to provide for estimated incurred credit losses in
	the portfolio of loans at the balance sheet. The Company may incur losses in connection with loans if borrowers fail to pay their
	monthly loan payments. The allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses and recoveries and is decreased
	by charged-off loans. When the loans become uncollectible, a charge-off will be recorded by reducing both loan balance (credit)
	and allowance for loan losses (debit).




	 




	The
	Company provides for incurred losses on loans with an allowance for loan losses in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification
	310-10

	“Receivables”

	(“ASC310-10”). A loan is impaired when, based on current information and events,
	it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement.




	 




	An
	insignificant delay or insignificant shortfall in amount of payments does not require application of this Statement. A loan is
	not impaired during a period of delay in payment if the creditor expects to collect all amounts due including interest accrued
	at the contractual interest rate for the period of delay.




	 




	The
	allowance for loan losses, which management evaluates on a periodic basis, represents an estimate of potential credit losses inherent
	in the portfolio and is based on a variety of factors, including the composition and quality of the loan portfolio, delinquency
	levels and trends, indication of credit deterioration, deterioration of the fair value of the loan collateral and the inability
	of the borrower to provide additional collateral to make up for the shortfall.




	 




	Determining
	the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is subjective, complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters
	that are inherently uncertain.




	 




	For
	the nine months ended January 31, 2017, there was no provision for allowance for loan losses.

	NOTES
	TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS






	FOR
	THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2017






	(Currency
	expressed in United States Dollars (“US$”))






	(Unaudited)





	 





	Revenue
	recognition





	 




	In
	accordance with the Accounting Standard Codification Topic 605 “Revenue Recognition” (“ASC 605”), the
	Company recognizes revenue when the following four criteria are met: (1) delivery has occurred or services rendered; (2) persuasive
	evidence of an arrangement exists; (3) there are no continuing obligations to the customer; and (4) the collection of related
	accounts receivable is probable.




	 






	(a)




	Loan
	interest income






	 




	The
	Company uses the effective interest method to recognize income on loans. Interest on loans is comprised largely of interest and
	late fees on loans. Interest income is recognized based upon the amount of loans outstanding and their contractual interest rate.
	Late fees are recognized when billable to the customer. Interest income is accrued and recorded in the consolidated statement
	of operations as earned. Loans are placed on non-accrual status when any portion of scheduled loan principal or interest payments
	is impaired, or earlier, when concern exists as to the ultimate collectability of outstanding principal or interest. When loans
	are placed on non-accrual status, all interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed against current period interest
	income. Income on non-accrual loans is subsequently recognized only to the extent cash is received. Loans are written off when
	deemed uncollectible. Loans return to accrual status when principal and interest become current and are anticipated to be fully
	collectible on a timely basis.




	 






	(b)




	Service
	income






	 




	Revenue
	from the provision of IT consulting and support service based upon the customer’s specifications. The services are billed
	either on a fixed-fee basis or on a time-and-material basis. Generally, the Company recognizes revenue when services are performed
	and accepted by the customers.




	 





	Cost
	of revenues





	 




	Cost
	of revenues represented the purchase costs of computer hardware for re-sale to customer and subcontractor fee for loans collection




	 





	Income
	taxes





	 




	Income
	taxes are determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes” (“ASC Topic 740”).
	Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences
	between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax
	assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which
	those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Any effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change
	in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.




	 




	ASC
	740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their financial statements
	uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740, tax positions must initially be recognized
	in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities.
	Such tax positions must initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50%
	likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant
	facts.




	 




	The
	Company did not have any unrecognized tax positions or benefits and there was no effect on the financial condition or results
	of operations for the nine months ended January 31, 2017. The Company and its subsidiary are subject to local and foreign tax
	jurisdictions. The Company’s tax returns remain open subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions.




	 





	Net
	loss per share





	 




	The
	Company calculates net loss per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260 “Earnings per share”. Basic loss per share
	is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss
	per share is computed similar to basic loss per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional
	common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common stock equivalents had been issued and if the additional
	common shares were dilutive.

	(Unaudited)





	 





	Foreign
	currencies translation





	 




	Transactions
	denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates
	prevailing at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional
	currency are translated into the functional currency using the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The resulting
	exchange differences are recorded in the statements of operations.




	 




	The
	reporting currency of the Company is United States Dollars (“US$”) and the accompanying condensed consolidated financial
	statements have been expressed in US$. In addition, the Company’s subsidiary in Seychelles and Hong Kong also maintain its
	books and record in US$.




	 





	Related
	parties





	 




	Parties,
	which can be a corporation or individual, are considered to be related if the Company has the ability, directly or indirectly,
	to control the other party or exercise significant influence over the other party in making financial and operating decisions.
	Companies are also considered to be related if they are subject to common control or common significant influence.




	 





	Fair
	value of financial instruments:





	 




	The
	carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, loans receivables, prepayment, deposits,
	accounts payable and accrued liabilities and amount due to a director approximate at their fair values because of the short-term
	nature of these financial instruments.




	 




	The
	Company also follows the guidance of the ASC Topic 820-10, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” (“ASC 820-10”),
	with respect to financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value. ASC 820-10 establishes a three-tier fair value
	hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:




	  






	 




	Level
	1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;





	 


	 





	  




	Level
	2: Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and





	 


	 





	  




	Level
	3: Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.






	 





	Recent
	accounting pronouncements





	 




	The
	Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and does not believe the future adoption
	of any such pronouncements may be expected to cause a material impact on its financial condition or the results of its operations.




	 





	NOTE
	5 - LOANS RECEIVABLE





	 



	During the nine months ended January 31, 2017,
	the Company acquired loans receivable of $41,719 through its acquisition of Gushen Credit with interest bearing ranged from 36%
	to 51.443% per annum and receivables in the next twelve months. As of January 31, 2017 and April 30, 2016, the total loans receivables
	balance was $29,917 and $41,719, respectively.



	 




	For
	the three months ended January 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company generated loan interest income of $3,781 and $0, respectively.

	Company
	Overview






	 





	Gushen,
	Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 9, 2015. Gushen is a development
	stage company that intends to provide managerial, capital and IT support to start-ups companies as well as small and medium enterprises
	(“SMEs”) to assist them in their early stages of operations as they expand and grow their own company.




	 




	Gushen
	Inc. is a holding company which operates exclusively through its wholly owned subsidiary, Gushen Holding Limited. Gushen Holding
	Limited was incorporated in the Republic of Seychelles, however at this time any and all physical operations take place in Hong
	Kong. Gushen Inc. shares the same business plan as Gushen Holding Limited and any reference to one or the other is synonymous
	when referencing the business plan or plan of operations.




	 




	Gushen
	attempts to assist companies that are just getting off the ground and that are at an early stage of operations, but will not rule
	out business that are a little further along. The primary purpose behind focusing on companies at this early stage of development
	will be for Gushen, Inc. to establish and nurture long-term lasting relationships with our clients as they grow and develop. Gushen
	will initially target companies located in Hong Kong.




	 




	As
	mentioned in our Form S-1, the Company intends to assist any future clients through various methods beyond just capital support,
	although that may be included. On August 5, 2016, Gushen Holding Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gushen Inc., acquired 100%
	equity interest of Gushen Credit Limited, a company incorporated in Hong Kong, for a cash consideration of $0.13. The purchase
	price is determined based on the mutual agreement between Gushen Holding Limited and Gushen Credit Limited, which is believed
	to be beneficial to both parties. Gushen Holding Limited funded the cash consideration through its own working capital. Mr. Huang
	Pin Lung, the director of the Company, is the sole stockholder and director of Gushen Credit Limited.




	  




	Gushen
	Credit Limited, which was incorporated on June 29, 2015 and granted a Money Lenders License by Hong Kong Licensing Court for a
	period of 12 months from the 3rd day of December 2015, is allowed to carry on money lending business in Hong Kong. Gushen Credit
	Limited is an authorized financial company incorporated under the Hong Kong Money Lender Ordinance (Chapter 163 of the Laws of
	Hong Kong). With the use of a web-based loan management system and credit system, Gushen Credit Limited provides a full range
	of flexible and diversified quality money lending services to customers, including SME financing, mortgage loan and personal loan
	to help resolve customers’ financial needs. In the future, the Company expects to shift the business to focus on money lending
	activities and to generate income from provision of various loan services to financially support clients.




	 






	Results
	of Operation







	 







	For
	The Three and Nine Months Ended January 31, 2017 and 2016






	 





	Revenue





	 




	For
	the three and nine months ended January 31, 2017, we earned loan interest income of $3,781 and $17,915 respectively from our money
	lending business in Hong Kong. We also earned service income of $18,556. For the three and nine months ended January 31, 2016,
	we had revenue amount of $0 and $3,800 respectively, which mainly represented the provision of IT consulting and support service
	based upon the customer’s specifications.




	  





	General
	and administrative expenses





	 




	We
	incurred a total of $125,352 and $486,305 general and administrative expenses for the three and nine months ended January 31,
	2017 respectively. The general and administrative expenses are mainly comprised of rent and rates, salary and bonus, and building
	management fee. The Company expects operating expenses to increase when the money lending business starts to expand. For the three
	and nine months ended January 31, 2016, we incurred a total of $80,561 and $140,784 general and administrative expenses, which
	are mainly comprised of rent and rates, salary and bonus, and building management fee.

	Net
	loss





	 




	For
	the three and nine months ended January 31, 2017, we incurred a total net loss of $106,402 and $456,705 respectively. For the
	three and nine months ended January 31, 2016, we incurred a total net loss of $80,561 and $138,784 respectively. The increases
	in net loss is mainly attributed to the general and administrative expenses incurred for the commencement of money lending business.

	For

	interest rate ranging from 36% to 51% per annum with credit terms mutually agreed with the customers. The Group has not made impairment
	on these loans to customers because, in the opinion of directors of the Company, it is probable the Company is able to collect
	all outstanding amounts and there is no significant change in credit quality of the customers.

	activities of $252,456 for the nine months ended January 31, 2016. The cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended
	January 31, 2017 was a result of our net loss of $456,705 attributable to the general and administrative expenses incurred and
	the increase in deposits of $77,591. The substantial increase in net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended
	January 31, 2017 was due to the business operation of the subsidiary.

	the nine months ended January 31, 2017, the net cash used in financing activities was $1,084,731 which was mainly attributed to
	the repayment to a director of the Company. For the nine months ended January 31, 2016, the net cash provide in financing activities
	was $211,618, which were mainly attributed to the advances from a director of the Company and issuance of Common Stock.




	 





	Going
	Concern






	  





	As
	of January 31, 2017, the Company suffered an accumulated deficit of $711,417 and incurred a continuous net operating loss of $456,705
	for the nine months ended January 31, 2017. These matters raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
	Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report have been prepared in conformity with
	accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which contemplate our continuation as a going concern
	and the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The carrying amounts of assets
	and liabilities presented in the condensed consolidated financial statements do not necessarily purport to represent realizable
	or settlement values. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustment that might result from the
	outcome of this uncertainty

	Off-balance
	Sheet Arrangements





	 




	We
	have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our
	financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures
	or capital resources that are material to our stockholders as of January 31, 2017.





	 









	Item
	3 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.





	 




	As
	a “smaller reporting company” as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide information
	required by this Item.





	 









	Item
	4 Controls and Procedures.





	 






	Evaluation
	of Disclosure Controls and Procedures:






	 




	We
	carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
	in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of January 31, 2017. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and
	with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive
	Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of January 31, 2017, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
	due to the presence of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting.




	 




	A
	material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there
	is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not
	be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management has identified the following material weaknesses which have caused management
	to conclude that, as of January 31, 2017, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective: (i) inadequate segregation
	of duties and effective risk assessment; and (ii) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting
	with respect to the requirements and application of both US GAAP and SEC guidelines.




	 






	Changes
	in Internal Control over Financial Reporting:






	 




	There
	were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the nine months ended January 31, 2017, that have materially
	affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

	UNAUDITED
	PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS





	 




	On
	April 27, 2017, the Company, through its subsidiary Gushen Holding Limited (“GHL”), and Greenpro Resources Limited
	(“Greenpro”), a company incorporated in British Virgin Islands, entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”),
	pursuant to which GHL sold the assets in Gushen Credit Limited (“GCL”), a wholly owned subsidiary of GHL. As
	consideration thereof, Greenpro agreed to pay for the purchase price of $105,000. The asset disposition was completed on April
	27, 2017.




	 




	On
	April 28, 2017, the Company, through its subsidiary GHL, sold Two (2) ordinary shares of GCL to Greenpro, representing
	100% of ownership, for a total consideration of $0.26 in cash. The purchase price is determined based on the mutual agreement
	between GHL and Greenpro. The company starting from April 28, 2017 ceased to carry on money lending business.




	 




	The
	following Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been derived by the application of adjustments
	to the Company's historical consolidated financial statements. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income
	for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016 and for the nine months ended January 31, 2017 are presented as if the disposition had
	occurred on May 1, 2016. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2017 is presented
	as if the disposition had occurred on January 31, 2017.




	 




	Historical financial information for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016 has
	been derived from audited historical consolidated financial statements included in Gushen Inc’s 2016 Annual Report on Form
	10-K. Historical financial information for the Company as of and for the nine months ended January 31, 2017 has been derived from
	unaudited historical consolidated condensed financial statements included in the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.




	 




	The
	unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet and condensed consolidated statements of income are provided for informational
	purposes only and should not be construed to be indicative of the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of
	operations had the transaction been consummated on the date assumed and do not project the Company’s consolidated financial
	position or results of operations for any future period or date.




	 




	The
	unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet and unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of income were derived by adjusting
	the Company’s historical consolidated financial statements for the deposition of GCL. The unaudited pro forma condensed
	combined statements of income do not include the impact of any potential cost savings or one-time costs that may result from the
	disposition.

	(e)




	Reflect
	the amount due from a director of $72,659 by the Company minus the amount due to a director of $39,656 by GHL






	 




	 




	 






	 




	(f)




	Reflect
	the amount that would have been due from GCL as if the disposition had occurred on January 31, 2017
