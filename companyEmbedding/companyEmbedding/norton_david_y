How do I find my Norton product key
There are different ways to find your product key depending upon your situation. The best way is to get it from your Norton account. 
In most cases, you do not need the product key to update your Norton subscription. If your Norton product is expired or shows incorrect subscription days, then you may need to download the product from your account which has the current subscription. 


Download and install your Norton product




Sign In to Norton.


If you are not signed in to Norton already, you will be prompted to sign in. Type in your email address and password for Norton, and click Sign In.


In the Norton Setup window, click Download Norton.


Click Agree & Download.


Do one of the following depending on your browser:


For Internet Explorer or Microsoft Edge browser: Click Run.


For Firefox or Safari: On the top-right corner of the browser, click the Download option to view the downloaded files, and click the file that you downloaded.


For Chrome: On the bottom-left corner, click the file that you downloaded.




If the User Account Control window appears, click Continue.
Follow the on-screen instructions.


Your Norton product is now installed and activated.





How to find your product key



You can find your product key based on how you obtained your Norton product. Choose one of the following:




Norton account



At the top of your Norton product window, click Help > My Norton.
If you cannot start your Norton product, you can directly go to your Norton account.
Log in to your account, if prompted.


In the Subscriptions page, select your Norton product.


Copy the product key.




Norton Online Store



 If you downloaded your product from Norton Online Store, the product key, or the instruction to obtain the product key is in your confirmation email message.
If you have purchased your product from Hong Kong Online Store, read How do I find the product key for the Norton product that I purchased from Hong Kong Norton Online Store.




Product CD or Retailer's card



If you purchased a boxed product CD online or at a local retail store, your product key is inside the box either on a sticker on the back of the CD sleeve or DVD case, or printed on a card in the box. 




Third-party website



Look for the product key in a confirmation email you received for your order. If you cannot locate the confirmation email in your inbox, check your spam filter folder.




Preinstalled



 If your Norton product came installed on your computer, check your My Documents or Documents folder to see if there is a Symantec folder. You may find a text file there with your product key  (examples: Norton 360 Key.txt or Norton AntiVirus Key.txt).
If your product came with a one year or longer subscription, you can contact your computer manufacturer to get your product key .
Some computer manufacturers may provide the product key  on an activation card.




Service provider







 You may  have an Activation PIN that you can get from your service provider to activate your product or 


You have to log in to your service provider portal to download and install your Norton product.


For more information read I want to install my Norton product from my service provider.




TechBench-Computer repair shop



 If your Norton product is purchased from TechBench,  Norton product key will be stored in your Norton account after you complete the product activation. TechBench also provides a Norton product activation card or product CD which will have your Norton product key printed on it.

Studies, family and early career[edit]
Norton earned a Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering from Washington University in St. Louis in 1952. In 1953 he married Joan Marie Carter of Webster Groves, Missouri, and in 1954 their first child, Anita Lee Norton (later Kronsberg) was born. During these years Norton also served as Associate Leader of the St. Louis Ethical Society. He and his wife lost an infant daughter, Nancy Ann, to crib death (or sudden infant death syndrome) in 1959. I n 1961 Norton and his wife adopted an infant son, whom they named Ronald Vallet Norton.
After working as a civil engineer in California, Norton returned to Washington University to study philosophy, earning a Master's degree in 1962. He then took up doctoral work at Boston University, earning his Ph.D. in 1968. While in Boston, Norton served as Leader of the Boston Ethical Society. His second son, Peter, was born in Boston in 1963. His dissertation was "Transcendental Imagination: A Post-Kantian Appraisal."
In 1966 Norton moved with his family to Newark, Delaware, to serve on the faculty of the University of Delaware's philosophy department. Shortly thereafter he divorced and remarried. He fathered two more sons, Tucker (b. 1971) and Cory (b. 1976).
Philosophy[edit]
Norton taught at the University of Delaware for 29 years. In 1976 Princeton University Press published his book Personal Destinies: A Philosophy of Ethical Individualism, which received wide notice. His next book, Democracy and Moral Development, was published by the University of California Press in 1991. In 1995 Norton succumbed quickly to cancer, dying July 24. His final book, Imagination, Understanding, and the Virtue of Liberality, published by Rowman and Littlefield, appeared soon after.
In the last of the works listed above, Norton summarized his three books' related purposes. In Personal Destinies, he "addressed the fundamental moral question, What is a worthy life for a human being?" In Democracy and Moral Development, he took up "the inescapable correlative, What is a good society?" Finally, in Imagination, Understanding, and the Virtue of Liberality, Norton asked "what kind of world can productively accommodate a plurality of good societies?" and identified the traits of character required of individuals who would promote it.
As an academic philosopher, Norton devoted attention to the fundamental and practical problems of the life well lived. For his inspiration Norton turned chiefly to the Greeks, and especially to the dialogues of Plato. He called himself an ethical individualist, seeing a harmony between the individual's fidelity to his own "personal destiny" and the fulfillment of society's collective needs. He held that within each person is an innate potentiality (his daimon, or soul), and that each person's life task is to discover it and actualize it. This conviction shaped Norton's views on the distinct purposes of each of life's stages, on the proper roles of parents and schools, and on the best social and political arrangements.
In a late essay, Norton put his philosophy in succinct terms: "There is a distinctive course of life that is right for each individual, amid countless possibilities. This is the individual's vocation, variously termed his or her 'genius,' 'daimon,' 'Buddha nature,' or 'atman.' It consists in innate potentialities that predispose persons to a particular direction in life. As distinguished from other possibilities, the actualization by an individual of his or her potentialities affords intrinsic rewards to that person—that is, the activity is personally fulfilling and satisfying. Self-knowledge, then, is knowledge of the activities, situations, and relationships that the individual experiences as intrinsically rewarding. Engaged at these, the individual invests the best of himself or herself and strives continuously to improve, while in the process contributing objective values to others." ["Education for Self-Knowledge and Worthy Living," in Howie and Schedler, eds., Ethical Issues in Contemporary Society (Southern Illinois University Press, 1995)].
Norton's own philosophy recognized "duplicity" as a "hallmark of human nature," and saw in it the ultimate threat to the life well lived (Personal Destinies, ch. 1). The epigraph to Personal Destinies' is an appeal from Socrates to unite "the outward and inward man." As Norton wrote in 1976, "Philosophy will sometimes present an individual with features of his acts and principles that horrify him, producing in him an exchange of principles and patterns of behavior" (Personal Destinies, "Unscholarly Epilogue").
Quotations[edit]
• "In pre-Hellenic Greece, sculptors made busts of the semi-deity Silenus that had a trick to them. Inside the hollow clay likeness was hidden a golden figurine, to be revealed when the bust was broken open. .... Each person is a bust of Silenus containing a golden figurine, his daimon. The person's daimon is an ideal of perfection—unique, individual, and self-identical. It is neither the actual person nor a product of the actual person, yet it is fully real, affording to the actual person his supreme aim and establishing the principle by which the actual person can grow in identity, worth, and being." —Personal Destinies, ch. 1.
• "From the humanistic standpoint a philosophy that seeks converts is a contradiction in terms. The function of humanistic philosophy is not to impose invented forms upon human life, but to elicit and clarify the forms the lives of persons implicitly possess." —Personal Destinies, "Unscholarly Epilogue."
• "Those who accepted classical liberalism's invitation also incurred great costs, for with it they accepted an economistic conception of self and society that has by its moral minimalism rendered invisible the large demands and rewards of worthy living." —Democracy and Moral Development, ch. 7.
• Autonomy is not "total self-sufficiency" but "the entitlement of each interactive entity to determine for itself what its contributions to others will be and, likewise, to determine for itself what use it will make of the self-determined contributions of other entities." —Imagination, Understanding, and the Virtue of Liberality, ch. 4.

Studies, family and early career[edit]
Norton earned a Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering from Washington University in St. Louis in 1952. In 1953 he married Joan Marie Carter of Webster Groves, Missouri, and in 1954 their first child, Anita Lee Norton (later Kronsberg) was born. During these years Norton also served as Associate Leader of the St. Louis Ethical Society. He and his wife lost an infant daughter, Nancy Ann, to crib death (or sudden infant death syndrome) in 1959. I n 1961 Norton and his wife adopted an infant son, whom they named Ronald Vallet Norton.
After working as a civil engineer in California, Norton returned to Washington University to study philosophy, earning a Master's degree in 1962. He then took up doctoral work at Boston University, earning his Ph.D. in 1968. While in Boston, Norton served as Leader of the Boston Ethical Society. His second son, Peter, was born in Boston in 1963. His dissertation was "Transcendental Imagination: A Post-Kantian Appraisal."
In 1966 Norton moved with his family to Newark, Delaware, to serve on the faculty of the University of Delaware's philosophy department. Shortly thereafter he divorced and remarried. He fathered two more sons, Tucker (b. 1971) and Cory (b. 1976).
Philosophy[edit]
Norton taught at the University of Delaware for 29 years. In 1976 Princeton University Press published his book Personal Destinies: A Philosophy of Ethical Individualism, which received wide notice. His next book, Democracy and Moral Development, was published by the University of California Press in 1991. In 1995 Norton succumbed quickly to cancer, dying July 24. His final book, Imagination, Understanding, and the Virtue of Liberality, published by Rowman and Littlefield, appeared soon after.
In the last of the works listed above, Norton summarized his three books' related purposes. In Personal Destinies, he "addressed the fundamental moral question, What is a worthy life for a human being?" In Democracy and Moral Development, he took up "the inescapable correlative, What is a good society?" Finally, in Imagination, Understanding, and the Virtue of Liberality, Norton asked "what kind of world can productively accommodate a plurality of good societies?" and identified the traits of character required of individuals who would promote it.
As an academic philosopher, Norton devoted attention to the fundamental and practical problems of the life well lived. For his inspiration Norton turned chiefly to the Greeks, and especially to the dialogues of Plato. He called himself an ethical individualist, seeing a harmony between the individual's fidelity to his own "personal destiny" and the fulfillment of society's collective needs. He held that within each person is an innate potentiality (his daimon, or soul), and that each person's life task is to discover it and actualize it. This conviction shaped Norton's views on the distinct purposes of each of life's stages, on the proper roles of parents and schools, and on the best social and political arrangements.
In a late essay, Norton put his philosophy in succinct terms: "There is a distinctive course of life that is right for each individual, amid countless possibilities. This is the individual's vocation, variously termed his or her 'genius,' 'daimon,' 'Buddha nature,' or 'atman.' It consists in innate potentialities that predispose persons to a particular direction in life. As distinguished from other possibilities, the actualization by an individual of his or her potentialities affords intrinsic rewards to that person—that is, the activity is personally fulfilling and satisfying. Self-knowledge, then, is knowledge of the activities, situations, and relationships that the individual experiences as intrinsically rewarding. Engaged at these, the individual invests the best of himself or herself and strives continuously to improve, while in the process contributing objective values to others." ["Education for Self-Knowledge and Worthy Living," in Howie and Schedler, eds., Ethical Issues in Contemporary Society (Southern Illinois University Press, 1995)].
Norton's own philosophy recognized "duplicity" as a "hallmark of human nature," and saw in it the ultimate threat to the life well lived (Personal Destinies, ch. 1). The epigraph to Personal Destinies' is an appeal from Socrates to unite "the outward and inward man." As Norton wrote in 1976, "Philosophy will sometimes present an individual with features of his acts and principles that horrify him, producing in him an exchange of principles and patterns of behavior" (Personal Destinies, "Unscholarly Epilogue").
Quotations[edit]
• "In pre-Hellenic Greece, sculptors made busts of the semi-deity Silenus that had a trick to them. Inside the hollow clay likeness was hidden a golden figurine, to be revealed when the bust was broken open. .... Each person is a bust of Silenus containing a golden figurine, his daimon. The person's daimon is an ideal of perfection—unique, individual, and self-identical. It is neither the actual person nor a product of the actual person, yet it is fully real, affording to the actual person his supreme aim and establishing the principle by which the actual person can grow in identity, worth, and being." —Personal Destinies, ch. 1.
• "From the humanistic standpoint a philosophy that seeks converts is a contradiction in terms. The function of humanistic philosophy is not to impose invented forms upon human life, but to elicit and clarify the forms the lives of persons implicitly possess." —Personal Destinies, "Unscholarly Epilogue."
• "Those who accepted classical liberalism's invitation also incurred great costs, for with it they accepted an economistic conception of self and society that has by its moral minimalism rendered invisible the large demands and rewards of worthy living." —Democracy and Moral Development, ch. 7.
• Autonomy is not "total self-sufficiency" but "the entitlement of each interactive entity to determine for itself what its contributions to others will be and, likewise, to determine for itself what use it will make of the self-determined contributions of other entities." —Imagination, Understanding, and the Virtue of Liberality, ch. 4.

Studies, family and early career[edit]
Norton earned a Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering from Washington University in St. Louis in 1952. In 1953 he married Joan Marie Carter of Webster Groves, Missouri, and in 1954 their first child, Anita Lee Norton (later Kronsberg) was born. During these years Norton also served as Associate Leader of the St. Louis Ethical Society. He and his wife lost an infant daughter, Nancy Ann, to crib death (or sudden infant death syndrome) in 1959. I n 1961 Norton and his wife adopted an infant son, whom they named Ronald Vallet Norton.
After working as a civil engineer in California, Norton returned to Washington University to study philosophy, earning a Master's degree in 1962. He then took up doctoral work at Boston University, earning his Ph.D. in 1968. While in Boston, Norton served as Leader of the Boston Ethical Society. His second son, Peter, was born in Boston in 1963. His dissertation was "Transcendental Imagination: A Post-Kantian Appraisal."
In 1966 Norton moved with his family to Newark, Delaware, to serve on the faculty of the University of Delaware's philosophy department. Shortly thereafter he divorced and remarried. He fathered two more sons, Tucker (b. 1971) and Cory (b. 1976).
Philosophy[edit]
Norton taught at the University of Delaware for 29 years. In 1976 Princeton University Press published his book Personal Destinies: A Philosophy of Ethical Individualism, which received wide notice. His next book, Democracy and Moral Development, was published by the University of California Press in 1991. In 1995 Norton succumbed quickly to cancer, dying July 24. His final book, Imagination, Understanding, and the Virtue of Liberality, published by Rowman and Littlefield, appeared soon after.
In the last of the works listed above, Norton summarized his three books' related purposes. In Personal Destinies, he "addressed the fundamental moral question, What is a worthy life for a human being?" In Democracy and Moral Development, he took up "the inescapable correlative, What is a good society?" Finally, in Imagination, Understanding, and the Virtue of Liberality, Norton asked "what kind of world can productively accommodate a plurality of good societies?" and identified the traits of character required of individuals who would promote it.
As an academic philosopher, Norton devoted attention to the fundamental and practical problems of the life well lived. For his inspiration Norton turned chiefly to the Greeks, and especially to the dialogues of Plato. He called himself an ethical individualist, seeing a harmony between the individual's fidelity to his own "personal destiny" and the fulfillment of society's collective needs. He held that within each person is an innate potentiality (his daimon, or soul), and that each person's life task is to discover it and actualize it. This conviction shaped Norton's views on the distinct purposes of each of life's stages, on the proper roles of parents and schools, and on the best social and political arrangements.
In a late essay, Norton put his philosophy in succinct terms: "There is a distinctive course of life that is right for each individual, amid countless possibilities. This is the individual's vocation, variously termed his or her 'genius,' 'daimon,' 'Buddha nature,' or 'atman.' It consists in innate potentialities that predispose persons to a particular direction in life. As distinguished from other possibilities, the actualization by an individual of his or her potentialities affords intrinsic rewards to that person—that is, the activity is personally fulfilling and satisfying. Self-knowledge, then, is knowledge of the activities, situations, and relationships that the individual experiences as intrinsically rewarding. Engaged at these, the individual invests the best of himself or herself and strives continuously to improve, while in the process contributing objective values to others." ["Education for Self-Knowledge and Worthy Living," in Howie and Schedler, eds., Ethical Issues in Contemporary Society (Southern Illinois University Press, 1995)].
Norton's own philosophy recognized "duplicity" as a "hallmark of human nature," and saw in it the ultimate threat to the life well lived (Personal Destinies, ch. 1). The epigraph to Personal Destinies' is an appeal from Socrates to unite "the outward and inward man." As Norton wrote in 1976, "Philosophy will sometimes present an individual with features of his acts and principles that horrify him, producing in him an exchange of principles and patterns of behavior" (Personal Destinies, "Unscholarly Epilogue").
Quotations[edit]
• "In pre-Hellenic Greece, sculptors made busts of the semi-deity Silenus that had a trick to them. Inside the hollow clay likeness was hidden a golden figurine, to be revealed when the bust was broken open. .... Each person is a bust of Silenus containing a golden figurine, his daimon. The person's daimon is an ideal of perfection—unique, individual, and self-identical. It is neither the actual person nor a product of the actual person, yet it is fully real, affording to the actual person his supreme aim and establishing the principle by which the actual person can grow in identity, worth, and being." —Personal Destinies, ch. 1.
• "From the humanistic standpoint a philosophy that seeks converts is a contradiction in terms. The function of humanistic philosophy is not to impose invented forms upon human life, but to elicit and clarify the forms the lives of persons implicitly possess." —Personal Destinies, "Unscholarly Epilogue."
• "Those who accepted classical liberalism's invitation also incurred great costs, for with it they accepted an economistic conception of self and society that has by its moral minimalism rendered invisible the large demands and rewards of worthy living." —Democracy and Moral Development, ch. 7.
• Autonomy is not "total self-sufficiency" but "the entitlement of each interactive entity to determine for itself what its contributions to others will be and, likewise, to determine for itself what use it will make of the self-determined contributions of other entities." —Imagination, Understanding, and the Virtue of Liberality, ch. 4.

Testimonials

"Grinding stainless steel railings is not an easy task. We were using zirconia flap discs and dynafile belts to grind the welds smooth. We called the folks at Lehigh Valley Abrasives to see if they could help us cut our abrasive costs. Lehigh Valley Abrasives sent us free samples of ceramic grain flap discs and belts to test. The samples outperformed our current discs and belts by 200% and actually cost a little less than our old supplier was charging us. In the last six months we have saved $7,000. We appreciate the folks at LVA showing us a new product and saving us money which falls right down to the bottom line, more profit."  John K – Stainless Steel Railings, Whitewater WI


"We originally were skeptical that we could buy a flap disc for $1.72 and it would last as long as the $6.00 discs we were currently using. Lehigh Valley Abrasives agreed to send us some samples for free testing in our shop. They were right. Their flap discs outlasted our $6.00 discs buy 50%. We now use Lehigh Valley Abrasives exclusively and have reduced our finishing costs to 1/3 of what it used to be. Last year we saved about $12,000."  Stuart S – Ornamental Iron – Los Angeles, CA


"The BEST find on Ebay!  Superior quality product & service! Why pay upwards of $6 a wheel when you can get three?? These flap wheels stand toe to toe with any $6 disk out there!"   Ken -  Fab shop owner -- Pittsburgh, Pa.


"Abrasives make up a significant portion of our fabrication costs so we are always looking for a better product at a better price. We stumbled across Lehigh Valley Abrasives when doing a Google searchon the internet and are glad we found them. After calling LVA we ordered some flap discs, roloc discs and belts to see if their products held up given they cost about a third less than we were currently paying. We were very please with the results. For the last two years we have been ordering all our flap discs cut off wheels, roloc discs and belts from LVA. I am not sure exactly how much money we have saved, but, I know it is a lot. We are also pleased that our orders ship in a timely manner and the customer service is knowledgeable and friendly. I have recommended Lehigh Valley Abrasives to a few friends in the industry and would suggest to anyone looking for a good product at a great price to give them a try."  Steve K – Steel Fabrication – Bethlehem PA 


"I've used alot of sanding discs in my 35 years of welding and fabrication, and these products meet or excede any on the market. The quality is always consistent, and the customer service is top-notch"  Jim - custom motorcycle builder


"Until I found Chris’s company, Lehigh Valley Abrasives who now solely supply my grinding disk needs, my grinding cost and usage factors were astronomical. I mainly use 4’’  40 grit zirconia grinding discs. Since switching to LVA my cost and time factors have been greatly reduced. Because of this  I do not shudder quite as much as I used to when it is time to throw away a disc. LVA has helped me decrease my grinding time and also keep more profits within my company. I highly recommend them to all."   JPS - Metal fabrication owner - North Carolina


"They are without a doubt the best quality,fastest cutting ,longest lasting I have used in my 35 years of metal shop work... I cut mild steel here at work -sheet 18 Ga and bar stock up to 1/2" thick by 3" wide a lot. They have time and again proven their worth in saving plasma cutting expendables and Oxygen/Acetylene as well. I buy in bulk and save a little money too, so I am very happy to continue using them. Thanks for handling a great product ."  Kenny - Missouri


"I have done extensive marketing research and used the products of numerous suppliers. For price, product quality, promptness of shipping and friendly service you have no peer. Consider me a life time customer. I can not thank you enough."  John Brommel


" We can't say enough good things about the products and pricing! The cost of abrasives is one of the hardest things to keep accounted for and under control, in the metal fab industry. Dealing with Lehigh Valley Abrasives has made this much easier and worry-free, which is definitely good for business! Thank you for offering such fine products at such reasonable prices, with the quick turn-around on our orders. It really couldn't be much better! We look forward to receiving our next shipment and many more in the future. " Richard Thompson - CHR, Inc. - Springfield, Mo.

About Lehigh Valley Abrasives
Lehigh Valley Abrasives has a long history of providing high quality products at value prices. The company originated in 1967 as a fabricator of stainless steel tanks, vessels, and hoppers for the food, pharmaceutical, and chemical industries. The demand from customers for improved surface finishes drove us to delve deeply into the field of abrasives. Over time we became very knowledgeable in the field of abrasives and began to develop and manufacture flap discs, belts, and cut-off wheels that we used for our own product line.
The products we developed performed so well that we decided to offer them to the general metalworking industries. Our products are used to grind, cut, blend, and polish metal. Each of our products performs extremely well and is priced competitively. In order to hold costs down we sell direct to the end user and maintain a low overhead structure.
Our employees are customer service oriented, product knowledgeable and courteous. These qualities have allowed Lehigh Valley Abrasives to become one of the largest independent sellers of flap discs in the United States. We look forward to working in partnership with your company. Lowering both your finishing time and costs.

What are the best antivirus programs?There are many different antivirus programs on the market all offering a host of features and services. While it is difficult to say which service is the best, the better antivirus programs provide their users with solid virus and malware detection and removal rates, light, adaptable software and real-time protection. Some of the top antivirus providers include McAfee, Norton and Bullguard.2. What is the best virus protection for my pc?There is a lot of different antivirus software on the market. Finding the ideal software to suit your needs depends on a variety of factors. One of the most reputable antivirus solutions you may want to consider is McAfee which scored well in independent lab tests, and earned top score in PCMag’s URL blocking test.3. What is the best antivirus for Mac?One of the biggest misconceptions when it comes to virus protection is that Macs don’t need to be protected. This is a myth and you can quickly find yourself in hot water if you aren’t careful. While not all antivirus solutions are compatible with Mac, there is still a decent enough selection.

It provides comprehensive coverage across a range of devices and earned a perfect score from AV-Test Institute. While ICSA Labs and West Coast Labs don’t test Norton antivirus software, they both certify the software for malware removal and detection. Most independent tests found that it identified and blocked 80% of known threats. That’s a pretty impressive feat.What we appreciated the most about Norton antivirus was its easy of use. The interface is user-friendly and highly intuitive. This is refreshing and particularly useful for less tech savvy users. It is regarded by many as one of the best antivirus providers on the market and is very good at detecting new threats.Visit Norton Antivirus Now >CompatibilityNorton antivirus is compatible with both Mac and PC as well as a range of mobile devices. The important thing is to choose your antivirus software carefully. The Standard package, for example, provides protection for only one device (PC or Mac). For users looking for more comprehensive coverage which covers multiple devices the Deluxe and Premium plans might be a good option.Spyware, Malware & Ransomware ScansWhen it comes to detecting and removing malware and Ransomware, Norton is an efficient and reliable solution. AV-Tests found that the software removed 100 percent of well-known threats, and was found to be extremely effective when it comes to zero-day malware threats. In fact, when it comes to removing these threats, Norton performs far better than other antivirus software.One of the most impressive things about Norton’s approach to malware is that it deals with the issue immediately. Once a threat of this level has been detected, Norton simply deals with it without asking a user for permission. Additionally, their Symantec Endpoint Protection 12 software is configured to handle Ransomware threats with accuracy.Email ScansIn all tests run by PC Mag it was found that Norton didn’t block any valid email. This is significant and means you can use the software with the peace of mind that none of your important emails will get caught in your spam folder. Norton does have some room for improvement however. One PC Mag test found that the scanner did fail to detect 10% or spam. While disappointing, we don’t think this is a deal breaker. Norton still offers top notch email protection.Download ProtectionNorton offers a live site advisor which scans all links before you click them. This ensure you can surf the internet with peace of mind. The sophisticated scanner checks online content for everything from spyware, and spam to phishing viruses. There’s an option to configure level of download protection. You could, for example, configure Norton to block all suspicions downloads without the option to download them.Resource UsageResource usage tends to be lower than other antivirus software. In fact, unless you’re running a really intensive scan you’re unlikely to notice Norton running in the background. Most tests found that Norton uses less than 1% CPU and only about 7MB of memory.Real-time ScanningWe were very impressed with Norton’s real-time scanning which blocked almost all threats in real-time. Most tests indicate that it was able to block 80% of threats in real-time. While efficient, we didn’t like the way the software alerts you to real-time threats. When the anti-virus picks up any threats a small alert window pops up and then disappears. This isn’t helpful, and it’s easy to miss an important alert.Privacy PolicyNorton does its best to protect its users privacy and only collects data where relevant for improving the software or keeping one safe.

In addition to its comprehensive antivirus, McAfee also offers a selection of scans, system tune-ups , encryption and a firewall to keep your computer running at its best. McAfee is a complete security package that goes beyond basic virus protection.In fact, McAfee has been rated favorably by almost all the independent labs including CSA Labs and West Cost Labs. Additionally, McAfee was awarded platinum certification by West Coast Labs. And when it comes to file-detection, this antivirus software was awarded Advanced+, the highest rating, by AV-Comparatives.Visit McAfee Now >CompatibilityMcAfee works well on both PC and Mac. The software also provides effective mobile protection and can be used on a range of both Android and iOS devices including mobile phones and tablets. What’s great about McAfee is that you have the option to purchase either a package for your specific operating system or one that works across all devices.Spyware, Malware & Ransomware ScansDetecting and removing malware, spyware, and Ransomware is no simple task. Very few anti-virus solutions are able to remove all infestations. However, McAfee manages this impressively well. In tests run by PC Magazine, McAfee was found to have an approximately 75 percent detection rate, and was able to remove almost all threats found. Furthermore, McAfee really stands out when it comes to malware blocking. McAfee is able to block possible threats on multiple levels by blocking malicious websites or detecting them before you even click on a link. McAfee, on average, has a 92 percent success rate when it comes to blocking malware and spyware, while its Threat Intelligence Exchange swiftly detects Ransomware and eliminates it.Email ScansMcAfee offers a comprehensive email scanning solution. This includes thorough inbound protection for blocking spam and other malicious incoming email. You can rest assured that with McAfee, your email will be protected from phishing, viruses, spam surges and DoS attacks. In fact, the service has over 99 percent accuracy. But with McAfee it doesn’t stop there. This email solution also offers email encryption to prevent data loss. A quality service, if you’re looking to keep your email safe look no further than McAfee.Download ProtectionEvery file you download will automatically be scanned beforehand keeping your computer safe and virus-free. Depending on the protection level you set, McAfee will either stop a download or ask for your permission to continue with the download. This pertains to websites you visit as well. When you perform a Google search, for example, McAfee scans and rates every site so you know whether or not to click on a link. This even works on social media sites, ensuring you never click on malicious links or download harmful content.Resource UsageIt goes without saying that running an antivirus in the background impacts the running of your computer. The good news is that on average McAfee slows a computer by 1 second. This is a vast improvement from most other anti-virus software which tends to slow a computer’s processing by 3 seconds. Furthermore, McAfee uses about 22 MB on a 2 GB computer. You’re unlikely to notice that McAfee is there, working away quietly in the background.Real-time ScanningLike many of the leading anti-virus providers, McAfee offers real-time virus scanning which checks all files automatically before you access them. You can configure the real-time scanning to suit your needs and browsing habits. For example, there’s an option to have McAfee alert you when a website uses cookies. Other options include using real-time scanning for local or network scans exclusively.Privacy PolicyMcAfee clearly states in its privacy policy that while it does collect user data, it keeps this to a minimum. It also only collects data that can be used to improve the overall user experience and to ensure the software provides the best protection possible. It’s important to keep in mind that McAfee collects a combination of personal and non-personal information, all of which is securely stored. However, this is the only information that’s obtained during using McAfee software.Customer SupportThe customer support offered by McAfee is thorough, efficient and very reliable. In addition to a thorough knowledge base which offers advice and lets users ask questions, there’s the option to contact customer support via chat, email or phone. The knowledge base is conveniently organized into Technical Support, Customer Service and McAfee TechMaster. Each of these support categories consists of the most commonly asked questions and also includes some handy video tutorials.Visit McAfee Now >McAfee AntiVirus PlusInternet SecurityTotal ProtectionPrice per year$19.99$39.99$44.99DevicesUnlimitedUnlimitedUnlimitedLicense duration1 year1 year1 yearAnti-spamAnti-spywareAnti-adwareAnti-malwareReal-time protectionEmail protectionFirewallWi-Fi protectionParental controlSupports MacProsDoesn't affect performanceAccurate spam filterIntuitive interfaceConsNot good at cleaning already-infected computersSporadic pop-upsBottom LineMcAfee’s antivirus and internet security solution is highly recommended for its malware detection and removal rates.CompatibilityWindows 10, Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows XP, Windows 2000, MAC OS x, iOS, Android, Linux/UnixTop 5 Antivirus Software1Read Review9.8Score2Read Review9.3Score3Read Review9.1Score4Read Review8.9Score5Read Review8.7ScoreVideo ReviewCompare Similar Products CompareMcAfeeRemoval qualityThreat updatesDetection ratesTechnical support9.8Read McAfee review...Norton AntivirusRemoval qualityThreat updatesDetection ratesTechnical support9.3Read Norton Antivirus review...BitdefenderRemoval qualityThreat updatesDetection ratesTechnical support9.1Read Bitdefender review...AviraRemoval qualityThreat updatesDetection ratesTechnical support8.9Read Avira review...BullGuardRemoval qualityThreat updatesDetection ratesTechnical support8.7Read BullGuard review...KasperskyRemoval qualityThreat updatesDetection ratesTechnical support7.5Read Kaspersky review...ESETRemoval qualityThreat updatesDetection ratesTechnical support7.1Read ESET review...AVGRemoval qualityThreat updatesDetection ratesTechnical support6.9Read AVG review...Intego X9Removal qualityThreat updatesDetection ratesTechnical support5.3Read Intego X9 review...ScanGuardRemoval qualityThreat updatesDetection ratesTechnical support1.0Read ScanGuard review...
