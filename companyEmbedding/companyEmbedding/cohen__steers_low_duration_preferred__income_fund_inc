Cohen & Steers Expands Preferred Securities Product Lineup with Launch of Low Duration Preferred and Income Fund

December 07, 2015 10:28

NEW YORK, Dec. 7, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Cohen & Steers, Inc. (NYSE:CNS), a leading global investment manager, announces the launch of the Cohen & Steers Low Duration Preferred and Income Fund, a first-of-its-kind mutual fund offering the potential for attractive monthly income with added tax advantages, along with reduced sensitivity to changes in interest rates.  The Fund delivers Cohen & Steers' market-leading preferred securities strategy to retail and institutional investors, focusing on security structures with low durations. Under normal market conditions, the Fund will have a weighted-average modified duration of three years or less and will potentially offer a higher income rate than many longer-duration fixed-income offerings. Additionally, a substantial portion of the income distributed by the Fund may be considered qualified dividend income for tax purposes, generally taxed at a lower rate than regular income, resulting in the potential for attractive yields both before and after taxes. "Cohen and Steers has been investing in preferred securities since the late 1990s and we've found them to offer tremendous income potential with unique investment characteristics," said Robert Steers, Chief Executive Officer of Cohen & Steers. "Leveraging our extensive experience with the asset class, we believe the Low Duration Preferred and Income Fund is an excellent vehicle to help investors manage interest-rate risk in today's market environment."The Fund provides access to the global preferred securities market, including over-the-counter securities that are available only to large institutional investors. The majority of preferred securities are issued by the world's largest banks, insurance companies, utilities, and real estate investment trusts, which may be less represented in other fixed-income asset classes, notably high yield. While most preferred securities are from issuers with investment-grade credit ratings, the Fund will also pursue value-driven opportunities in below-investment-grade and non-rated issues.Portfolio managers William Scapell and Elaine Zaharis-Nikas have an average of 21 years of experience and have been managing the firm's preferred securities portfolios since 2003. They are backed by a team of analysts whose proprietary research is supported by extensive contacts in the industry. The group also leverages the global research capabilities of Cohen & Steers' market-leading real estate and infrastructure investment professionals. Together, the team oversees $7.9 billion in preferred securities for individual investors and pension funds around the world.The Fund's five share classes have been listed on the NASDAQ exchange under the following symbols:Class A: LPXAXClass C: LPXCXClass I: LPXIXClass R: LPXRXClass Z: LPXZXAbout Cohen & Steers. Cohen & Steers is a global investment manager specializing in liquid real assets, including real estate securities, listed infrastructure, commodities and natural resource equities, as well as preferred securities and other income solutions. Founded in 1986, the firm is headquartered in New York City, with offices in London, Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Seattle.This press release is not intended as an offer of or advice to purchase shares of Cohen & Steers Low Duration Preferred and Income Fund or Cohen & Steers, Inc. Please consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fund carefully before investing. A summary prospectus and prospectus containing this and other information may be obtained, free of charge, by calling 800-330-7348 or by visiting cohenandsteers.com. Please read the summary prospectus or prospectus carefully before investing. Cohen & Steers Securities, LLC, distributor.Risks of Investing in Preferred SecuritiesInvesting in any market exposes investors to risks. In general, the risks of investing in preferred securities are similar to those of investing in bonds, including credit risk and interest-rate risk. As nearly all preferred securities have issuer call options, call risk and reinvestment risk are also important considerations. In the event of bankruptcy, a company's preferred securities are senior to common stock but subordinated to all other types of corporate debt. In addition, investors face equity-like risks, such as deferral or omission of distributions and higher corporate governance risks with limited voting rights. The Fund is classified as a "non-diversified" fund under the federal securities laws because it can invest in fewer companies than a diversified fund. However, the fund must meet certain diversification requirements under the U.S. tax laws. Preferred securities funds may invest in below-investment-grade securities, as well as unrated securities judged to be below investment grade by the Advisor. Below-investment-grade securities or equivalent unrated securities generally involve greater price volatility and risk of loss of income and principal, and may be more susceptible to real or perceived adverse economic and competitive industry conditions than higher-grade securities. The benchmarks do not contain below-investment-grade securities.Special risks of investing in foreign securities include (i) currency fluctuations, (ii) lower liquidity, (iii) political and economic uncertainties, and (iv) differences in accounting standards. Some international securities may represent small- and medium-sized companies, which may be more susceptible to price volatility and less liquid than larger companies.Duration RiskDuration is a mathematical calculation of the average life of a fixed-income or preferred security that serves as a measure of the security's price risk to changes in interest rates (or yields). Securities with longer durations tend to be more sensitive to interest rate (or yield) changes than securities with shorter durations.For more information please visit cohenandsteers.com. To view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cohen--steers-expands-preferred-securities-product-lineup-with-launch-of-low-duration-preferred-and-income-fund-300188828.htmlSOURCE  Cohen & Steers, Inc.

A quarter of S&P 500’s 2017 climb due to five stocks (yes, those five)

Amazon earnings fall 77%, shares drop
              
              Amazon.com Inc.  reported much lower earnings than expected Thursday, and shares declined more than 2% in late trading. The e-commerce giant reported net income of $197 million, or 40 cents a share, on sales of $38 billion, a profit decline of 77% from the same quarter a year ago. Analysts on average expected Amazon to report earnings of $1.41 a share on sales of $37.2 billion. The company's spending cut into profit, as fulfillment costs -- the amount Amazon spends to fulfill customers' orders on its e-commerce platform -- rose about 33% from a year ago and spending on technology and content increased by about 43%. Amazon stock traded at all-time highs this week, making Amazon the fourth U.S. company with a market capitalization of $500 billion and briefly giving Chief Executive Jeff Bezos the title of richest man in the world, but shares declined about 2% in immediate after-hours action.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Class A Expense Ratio as disclosed in the April 1, 2017 prospectus:
Gross Expense Ratio (Class A) 1.90%
Net Expense Ratio (Class A) 0.90%
Through June 30, 2018, Cohen & Steers Capital Management, Inc., the Fund’s investment advisor (the Advisor), has contractually agreed to waive its fee and/or reimburse expenses so that the Fund’s total annual operating expenses (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, taxes and extraordinary expenses) do not exceed 0.90% for the Class A shares.
* Maximum 2.00% sales charge; returns for other share classes will differ due to differing expense structures and sales charges.
** The blended benchmark consists of 65% BofA ML 8% Constrained Developed Markets Low Duration Capital Securities Custom Index and 35% BofA Merrill Lynch 1-5 Year US Corporate Index.
Performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. The investment return and the principal value of an investment will fluctuate and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Returns are historical and include change in share price and reinvestment of all distributions. Month-end performance information can be obtained by visiting our website at cohenandsteers.com.
During certain periods presented above, the Advisor waived fees and/or reimbursed expenses. Without this arrangement, performance would be lower.
The BofA Merrill Lynch 1-5 Year US Corporate Index tracks the performance of US dollar denominated investment grade corporate debt publicly issued in the US domestic market with a remaining term to final maturity of less than five years. The BofA Merrill Lynch 8% Constrained Developed Markets Low Duration Capital Securities Custom Index tracks the performance of select U.S. dollar-denominated fixed and floating-rate preferred, corporate and contingent capital securities, with a remaining term to final maturity of one year or more, but less than five years. The S&P 500 Index is an unmanaged index of 500 large-capitalization stocks that is frequently used as a general measure of U.S. stock market performance. 
An investor cannot invest directly in an index, and index performance does not reflect the deduction of any fees, expenses or taxes

Estimates Only - Do Not Use for Tax Reporting Purposes
This table provides estimates of the Fund's distribution sources at the time of payment and should not be relied upon or used for tax planning or tax reporting purposes. A return of capital occurs when a portion of the money that you invested is paid back to you and should not be confused with “yield” or “income”. The source of all distributions paid by the Fund, including net investment income, is subject to change. This is because the Fund primarily invests in real estate investment trusts (REITs) and similar companies. Distributions from REITs are attributed to various sources including net investment income, capital gains and return of capital. The estimate shown above is based on the prior year breakdown of the distributions from the REIT securities held by the Fund. The Fund generally will receive from these companies a final determination as to the source of distributions early next year.
Income as determined under federal income tax regulations differs from GAAP.

Risks of Investing in Preferred Securities
Investing in any market exposes investors to risks. In general, the risks of investing in preferred securities are similar to those of investing in bonds, including credit risk and interest-rate risk. As nearly all preferred securities have issuer call options, call risk and reinvestment risk are also important considerations. In addition, investors face equity-like risks, such as deferral or omission of distributions, subordination to bonds and other more senior debt, and higher corporate governance risks with limited voting rights. The fund is classified as a “non-diversified” fund under the federal securities laws because it can invest in fewer individual companies than a diversified fund.  However, the fund must meet certain diversification requirements under the U.S. tax laws.
Risks associated with preferred securities differ from risks inherent with other investments. In particular, in the event of bankruptcy, a company’s preferred securities are senior to common  stock but subordinated to all other types of corporate debt.  Throughout this presentation we will make comparisons of preferred securities to corporate bonds, municipal bonds and 10-Year Treasury bonds.  It is important to note that corporate bonds sit higher in the capital structure than preferred securities, and therefore in the event of bankruptcy will be senior to the preferred securities.  Municipal bonds are issued and backed by state and local governments and their agencies, and the interest from municipal securities is often free from both state and local income taxes.  10-Year Treasury bonds are issued by the U.S. government and are generally considered the safest of all bonds since they're backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government as to timely payment of principal and interest.
The Fund may invest in below investment-grade securities and unrated securities judged to be below investment-grade by the Advisor.  Below investment-grade securities or equivalent unrated securities generally involve greater volatility of price and risk of loss of income and principal, and may be more susceptible to real or perceived adverse economic and competitive industry conditions than higher grade securities.  The Fund’s benchmarks do not contain below investment-grade securities. No representation or warranty is made as to the efficacy of any particular strategy or fund or the actual returns that may be achieved.
Duration Risk
Duration is a mathematical calculation of the average life of a fixed-income or preferred security that serves as a measure of the security’s price risk to changes in interest rates (or yields). Securities with longer durations tend to be more sensitive to interest rate (or yield) changes than securities with shorter durations. Duration differs from maturity in that it considers potential changes to interest rates, and a security’s coupon payments, yield, price and par value and call features, in addition to the amount of time until the security matures. Various techniques may be used to shorten or lengthen the Fund’s duration. The duration of a security will be expected to change over time with changes in market factors and time to maturity.
For U.S. residents only.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
