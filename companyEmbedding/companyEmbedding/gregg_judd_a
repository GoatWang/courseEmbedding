Judd Alan Gregg (born February 14, 1947) served as the 76th Governor of New Hampshire and was a United States Senator from New Hampshire, who served as chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. He is a member of the Republican Party and was a businessman and attorney in Nashua before entering politics. He currently serves as the Chair of the Public Advisory Board at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College.[1] Gregg was nominated for Secretary of Commerce in the Cabinet by President Barack Obama,[2] but withdrew his name on February 12, 2009.[3][4][5] He would have been up for re-election in 2010, but chose not to run.[6] In the November 2010 elections, former State Attorney General Kelly Ayotte, also a Republican, was elected to succeed Gregg in the Senate.[7] On May 27, 2011, Goldman Sachs announced that Gregg had been named an international advisor to the firm.[8] In May 2013, Gregg was named the CEO of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, a Wall Street lobbying group.[9] He later stepped down as CEO in December 2013 and became a senior adviser.
For the United States presidential election in 2016 Gregg endorsed former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, and upon Bush's suspension of his campaign Gregg endorsed Ohio Governor John Kasich.[10]

Early life[edit]
Born in Nashua, New Hampshire, he is the son of Catherine Gregg (née Warner) and Hugh Gregg, who was Governor from 1953 to 1955. Gregg graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy in 1965. Gregg received his baccalaureate from Columbia University in 1969 and, from Boston University School of Law, a Juris Doctor in 1972 and a Master of Laws in 1975.[11]
Early political career[edit]




Then-Governor Judd Gregg as painted by Richard Whitney


The first elective office held by Gregg was a seat on the Executive Council of New Hampshire, a post which he held from 1979 to 1981. He was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1980, and was reelected in 1982, 1984 and 1986.[12]
He declined to run for re-election in 1988, and ran for Governor of New Hampshire instead. He won that election and was re-elected in 1990, New Hampshire being one of two states (Vermont is the other) that continues to elect its governors to two-year, rather than four-year, terms. As Governor, he balanced the budget, leaving the office in 1993 with a $21 million surplus.[13][14] However, his political opponents in the 1990s attacked Judd for the state's weak economy and his Vietnam War deferments.[15]
U.S. Senate tenure[edit]
Elections[edit]
In 1992, Gregg decided to run for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by two-term Republican Warren Rudman. He defeated Democrat John Rauh, and took his seat as a United States Senator in 1993. He was re-elected to a second term in 1998 after defeating George Condodemetraky, and ran for a third term. That year, 2004, he defeated campaign finance activist Doris "Granny D" Haddock, the then 94-year-old Democratic nominee, by 66% to 34%.
After withdrawing from his nomination to become United States Secretary of Commerce in the presidential administration of Democrat Barack Obama on February 12, 2009, Gregg said he would "probably not" seek reelection in 2010, when his term of office was set to expire.[16]
Leadership[edit]
In January 2005, Gregg was elected to chair the U.S. Senate Committee on Budget by the Senate Republican Conference. While chairman of this committee Gregg has been a steadfast supporter of lower spending.[17] Throughout his Senate career he has been highly supportive of lower taxes as well.

On November 14, 2008 Gregg was appointed by United States Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell to serve on the five-member Congressional Oversight Panel created to oversee the implementation of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. Gregg "stepped aside" on December 1, citing his Senate workload:

I regret that due to the impending Senate schedule involving the potential of dealing with an extremely large stimulus package, coupled with the ongoing issues of developing fiscal policy relative to the budget and the continuing economic downturn and my responsibility for foreign operations appropriations, it has become difficult to continue service on the TARP oversight board. I have advised Senator McConnell I will need to step aside from this effort.[18][19]

Platform[edit]
Republicans for Environmental Protection issued Gregg an "environmental harm demerit" for sponsoring the 2006 S.C. Resolution 83, which according to REP "included only one revenue-raising instruction to Senate appropriations committees, an abuse of the congressional budget process in order to force oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge", and "would perpetuate America's dangerous oil dependence and damage the most scenic, wildlife-rich reserve in the circumpolar north."[20] The organization also praised Gregg, together with John E. Sununu, for their work to pass the New England Wilderness act, which classified nearly 100,000 acres (400 km2) of New Hampshire and Vermont as wilderness.[21] In 2006, Gregg received a score of 43% from the nonpartisan League of Conservation Voters.[22]
The University of New Hampshire renamed its Environmental Technology Building Gregg Hall, because Gregg used earmarks to secure $266 million of federal funds for research and development projects for the university. The Judd Gregg Meteorology Institute (JGMI), established in 2003, is the center of meteorological and atmospheric research at Plymouth State University in Plymouth, NH, which offers the only meteorology degree program in the state. The Senator was also instrumental in the establishing of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College in 1999.
In 2007, Gregg voted for the Clean Energy Act of 2007 (H.R. 6) and the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007 (S. 1639).
In October 2009, Gregg said, "You talk about systemic risk. The systemic risk today is the Congress of the United States...we’re creating these massive debts which we’re passing on to our children...(the figures) mean we’re basically on the path to a banana republic-type of financial situation in this country.[23] "
Gregg has a moderate record on social issues. In June 2006, he joined six of his fellow Republicans in voting against the Federal Marriage Amendment. In April 2007, he was among the breakaway Republicans to support the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. However, his record on the issue of abortion is otherwise a solidly pro-life one. Gregg has voted for some gun control measures and against others. He voted against the Brady Bill, but in recent years has voted for trigger control locks on firearms and in favor of the ban on assault weapons.
On December 17, 2009, Gregg voted to extend Chairman Ben Bernanke's term.[24]
Presidential politics[edit]
During the 2004 Presidential Election, Gregg stood in for John Kerry during practice sessions held by George W. Bush in preparation for the 2004 United States Presidential Election Debates. Four years earlier he had played the part of Al Gore for the same purpose.
On October 29, 2007, Gregg endorsed Mitt Romney, former Governor of Massachusetts, to be the Republican nominee for President of the United States.
Gregg has not foreclosed the possibility of running for President himself after he leaves the Senate but he has said it’s “not likely”:

"In New Hampshire we like to have a variety of candidates, so I would seriously doubt that. I expect to be actively involved in the presidential primary. That’s the fun on coming from New Hampshire and being in office,” Gregg said.
“I don't rule out anything in my future. Let's face it -- that's not likely and I wouldn't expect to be doing that,” he added.[25]

The Spanish Justice System and Guantanamo Bay[edit]
Main article: The Bush Six
In April 2009, Senator Gregg was sent to accompany an American diplomat to speak with a Spanish diplomat Luis Felipe Fernández de la Peña after a war crimes case was filed by Spanish NGO Association for the Dignity of Spanish Prisoners at the Audiencia Nacional of Spain accusing them of crimes in Iraq and Guantanamo Bay.[26] The case targeted six former US government officials for allegedly violating the Geneva Convention, the 1984 Convention Against Torture, and the 1998 Rome Statute.[27] The six accused were: Alberto Gonzales, David Addington, William Haynes, Douglas Feith, Jay Bybee, and John Yoo.[28] A summary of the meeting as recorded in a confidential diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks stated:

Senator Gregg expressed his concern and dismay about reported Spanish judiciary desire to indict six former Bush administration officials for allegedly creating a legal framework that permitted torture. Fernandez de la Pena lamented this development, adding that judicial independence notwithstanding, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs disagreed with efforts to apply universal jurisdiction in such cases.[29]

Senator Mel Martinez had a similar diplomacy meeting during the same period with the same agenda discussed. Martinez noted that "the prosecutions would neither be understood nor accepted in the U.S. and would have an enormous impact on the bilateral relationship". Spanish Foreign Minister Angel Lossada retorted, "the National Court had broad jurisdiction for universal justice and that there was no political influence on the judicial process."[30]
In an earlier cable days before the senators arrived, a US diplomat commented:

We do not know if the [Spanish] government would be willing to take the risky step of trying behind the scenes to influence the prosecutor's recommendation on this case or what their reaction to such a request would be.[31]

Controversies[edit]
In the Senate, Gregg was the leading Republican negotiator and author of the TARP program, which bailed out financial institutions, while he had a multimillion-dollar investment in Bank of America.[32][33][34] After leaving the Senate Gregg became an advisor to the investment bank Goldman Sachs.[35]
In February 2009, the Associated Press reported that Gregg and his family had profited personally from federal earmarks secured by the senator for the redevelopment of the Pease Air Force Base in Portsmouth, New Hampshire into an industrial park.[36][37] According to Senate records, Gregg has collected from $240,017 to $651,801 from his investments in Pease Air Force Base, while helping to arrange at least $66 million in federal aid for the former base.[36][37] Gregg has denied any wrongdoing in the matter and claimed that his withdrawal from consideration for the Commerce Secretary was unrelated to the White House's discovery during the vetting process of his involvement in his family's real estate investments in Pease. Gregg explained away his actions by saying, "I've throughout my entire lifetime been involved in my family's businesses and that's just the way our family works. We support each other and our activities."[36][38]
Gregg as a member of President Barack Obama's deficit commission defended cutting Social Security by quoting Willie Sutton who, when asked why he robbed banks, replied, "because that's where the money is."[39] The New York Times on August 24, 2015 published a letter by Gregg advocating cuts in Social Security benefits.
Commerce Secretary nomination and withdrawal[edit]
On February 2, 2009, Politico and CNN reported that Gregg accepted President Obama's offer to be the next United States Secretary of Commerce.[40] If Gregg had been confirmed by the Senate, he would have had to resign his Senate seat and be replaced with an appointment by Democratic Governor John Lynch. Sources from both parties confirmed that Gregg's former chief of staff, Republican Bonnie Newman, would have been chosen to replace him.[41] The Washington Post had alleged that Gregg would not accept the appointment unless Gov. Lynch agreed to appoint a Republican to fill his seat until 2010.[42] In February 2009 many news outlets noted that Gregg had, in 1995, voted to abolish the United States Department of Commerce.[43] Although he has stated that he supports the stimulus package promoted by President Obama, he has stated that he will recuse himself from voting on the package.[44]
With reports that the Obama Administration would move the United States Census Bureau, typically run by the Commerce Department, out of Gregg's jurisdiction, Republican leaders urged Obama to allow Gregg to run the census or withdraw Gregg's nomination.[45] On February 12, 2009, Gregg withdrew his name from consideration for the position of United States Commerce Secretary, citing disagreements with issues surrounding the census and the stimulus bill.[46] White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs issued a statement regarding Gregg's withdrawal in which he accused the senator of not following through on his alleged statements of support for Obama's economic agenda made during the vetting process:[47]

Senator Gregg reached out to the President and offered his name for Secretary of Commerce. He was very clear throughout the interviewing process that despite past disagreements about policies, he would support, embrace, and move forward with the President's agenda. Once it became clear after his nomination that Senator Gregg was not going to be supporting some of President Obama's key economic priorities, it became necessary for Senator Gregg and the Obama administration to part ways. We regret that he has had a change of heart.

While speaking to press afterward, Gregg acknowledged responsibility for his decision and accepted the blame for accepting and then rejecting the Commerce Secretary nomination.[16]
In an interview response to the AP, Gregg was quoted as saying, "For 30 years, I've been my own person in charge of my own views, and I guess I hadn't really focused on the job of working for somebody else and carrying their views, and so this is basically where it came out."[48]
In February 2009, the Associated Press reported that Gregg and his family had profited personally from federal earmarks secured by the Senator for the redevelopment of the Pease Air Force Base into an industrial park.[37] According to Senate records, Gregg has collected from $240,017 to $651,801 from his investments in Pease Air Force Base, while helping to arrange at least $66 million in federal aid for the former base.[37] Gregg claimed that his withdrawal from consideration for the Commerce Secretary was unrelated to the White House's discovery during the vetting process of his involvement in his family's real estate investments in Pease.
Personal life[edit]
Gregg belongs to the Congregationalist Church. He is married to Kathleen MacLellan Gregg. The couple have has daughters, Molly and Sarah, and a son, Joshua.
Gregg won more than $850,000 in 2005 after buying $20 worth of Powerball tickets at a Washington, D.C. convenience store.[49]

Judd Alan Gregg (born February 14, 1947) served as the 76th Governor of New Hampshire and was a United States Senator from New Hampshire, who served as chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. He is a member of the Republican Party and was a businessman and attorney in Nashua before entering politics. He currently serves as the Chair of the Public Advisory Board at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College.[1] Gregg was nominated for Secretary of Commerce in the Cabinet by President Barack Obama,[2] but withdrew his name on February 12, 2009.[3][4][5] He would have been up for re-election in 2010, but chose not to run.[6] In the November 2010 elections, former State Attorney General Kelly Ayotte, also a Republican, was elected to succeed Gregg in the Senate.[7] On May 27, 2011, Goldman Sachs announced that Gregg had been named an international advisor to the firm.[8] In May 2013, Gregg was named the CEO of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, a Wall Street lobbying group.[9] He later stepped down as CEO in December 2013 and became a senior adviser.
For the United States presidential election in 2016 Gregg endorsed former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, and upon Bush's suspension of his campaign Gregg endorsed Ohio Governor John Kasich.[10]

Early life[edit]
Born in Nashua, New Hampshire, he is the son of Catherine Gregg (née Warner) and Hugh Gregg, who was Governor from 1953 to 1955. Gregg graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy in 1965. Gregg received his baccalaureate from Columbia University in 1969 and, from Boston University School of Law, a Juris Doctor in 1972 and a Master of Laws in 1975.[11]
Early political career[edit]




Then-Governor Judd Gregg as painted by Richard Whitney


The first elective office held by Gregg was a seat on the Executive Council of New Hampshire, a post which he held from 1979 to 1981. He was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1980, and was reelected in 1982, 1984 and 1986.[12]
He declined to run for re-election in 1988, and ran for Governor of New Hampshire instead. He won that election and was re-elected in 1990, New Hampshire being one of two states (Vermont is the other) that continues to elect its governors to two-year, rather than four-year, terms. As Governor, he balanced the budget, leaving the office in 1993 with a $21 million surplus.[13][14] However, his political opponents in the 1990s attacked Judd for the state's weak economy and his Vietnam War deferments.[15]
U.S. Senate tenure[edit]
Elections[edit]
In 1992, Gregg decided to run for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by two-term Republican Warren Rudman. He defeated Democrat John Rauh, and took his seat as a United States Senator in 1993. He was re-elected to a second term in 1998 after defeating George Condodemetraky, and ran for a third term. That year, 2004, he defeated campaign finance activist Doris "Granny D" Haddock, the then 94-year-old Democratic nominee, by 66% to 34%.
After withdrawing from his nomination to become United States Secretary of Commerce in the presidential administration of Democrat Barack Obama on February 12, 2009, Gregg said he would "probably not" seek reelection in 2010, when his term of office was set to expire.[16]
Leadership[edit]
In January 2005, Gregg was elected to chair the U.S. Senate Committee on Budget by the Senate Republican Conference. While chairman of this committee Gregg has been a steadfast supporter of lower spending.[17] Throughout his Senate career he has been highly supportive of lower taxes as well.

On November 14, 2008 Gregg was appointed by United States Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell to serve on the five-member Congressional Oversight Panel created to oversee the implementation of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. Gregg "stepped aside" on December 1, citing his Senate workload:

I regret that due to the impending Senate schedule involving the potential of dealing with an extremely large stimulus package, coupled with the ongoing issues of developing fiscal policy relative to the budget and the continuing economic downturn and my responsibility for foreign operations appropriations, it has become difficult to continue service on the TARP oversight board. I have advised Senator McConnell I will need to step aside from this effort.[18][19]

Platform[edit]
Republicans for Environmental Protection issued Gregg an "environmental harm demerit" for sponsoring the 2006 S.C. Resolution 83, which according to REP "included only one revenue-raising instruction to Senate appropriations committees, an abuse of the congressional budget process in order to force oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge", and "would perpetuate America's dangerous oil dependence and damage the most scenic, wildlife-rich reserve in the circumpolar north."[20] The organization also praised Gregg, together with John E. Sununu, for their work to pass the New England Wilderness act, which classified nearly 100,000 acres (400 km2) of New Hampshire and Vermont as wilderness.[21] In 2006, Gregg received a score of 43% from the nonpartisan League of Conservation Voters.[22]
The University of New Hampshire renamed its Environmental Technology Building Gregg Hall, because Gregg used earmarks to secure $266 million of federal funds for research and development projects for the university. The Judd Gregg Meteorology Institute (JGMI), established in 2003, is the center of meteorological and atmospheric research at Plymouth State University in Plymouth, NH, which offers the only meteorology degree program in the state. The Senator was also instrumental in the establishing of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College in 1999.
In 2007, Gregg voted for the Clean Energy Act of 2007 (H.R. 6) and the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007 (S. 1639).
In October 2009, Gregg said, "You talk about systemic risk. The systemic risk today is the Congress of the United States...we’re creating these massive debts which we’re passing on to our children...(the figures) mean we’re basically on the path to a banana republic-type of financial situation in this country.[23] "
Gregg has a moderate record on social issues. In June 2006, he joined six of his fellow Republicans in voting against the Federal Marriage Amendment. In April 2007, he was among the breakaway Republicans to support the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. However, his record on the issue of abortion is otherwise a solidly pro-life one. Gregg has voted for some gun control measures and against others. He voted against the Brady Bill, but in recent years has voted for trigger control locks on firearms and in favor of the ban on assault weapons.
On December 17, 2009, Gregg voted to extend Chairman Ben Bernanke's term.[24]
Presidential politics[edit]
During the 2004 Presidential Election, Gregg stood in for John Kerry during practice sessions held by George W. Bush in preparation for the 2004 United States Presidential Election Debates. Four years earlier he had played the part of Al Gore for the same purpose.
On October 29, 2007, Gregg endorsed Mitt Romney, former Governor of Massachusetts, to be the Republican nominee for President of the United States.
Gregg has not foreclosed the possibility of running for President himself after he leaves the Senate but he has said it’s “not likely”:

"In New Hampshire we like to have a variety of candidates, so I would seriously doubt that. I expect to be actively involved in the presidential primary. That’s the fun on coming from New Hampshire and being in office,” Gregg said.
“I don't rule out anything in my future. Let's face it -- that's not likely and I wouldn't expect to be doing that,” he added.[25]

The Spanish Justice System and Guantanamo Bay[edit]
Main article: The Bush Six
In April 2009, Senator Gregg was sent to accompany an American diplomat to speak with a Spanish diplomat Luis Felipe Fernández de la Peña after a war crimes case was filed by Spanish NGO Association for the Dignity of Spanish Prisoners at the Audiencia Nacional of Spain accusing them of crimes in Iraq and Guantanamo Bay.[26] The case targeted six former US government officials for allegedly violating the Geneva Convention, the 1984 Convention Against Torture, and the 1998 Rome Statute.[27] The six accused were: Alberto Gonzales, David Addington, William Haynes, Douglas Feith, Jay Bybee, and John Yoo.[28] A summary of the meeting as recorded in a confidential diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks stated:

Senator Gregg expressed his concern and dismay about reported Spanish judiciary desire to indict six former Bush administration officials for allegedly creating a legal framework that permitted torture. Fernandez de la Pena lamented this development, adding that judicial independence notwithstanding, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs disagreed with efforts to apply universal jurisdiction in such cases.[29]

Senator Mel Martinez had a similar diplomacy meeting during the same period with the same agenda discussed. Martinez noted that "the prosecutions would neither be understood nor accepted in the U.S. and would have an enormous impact on the bilateral relationship". Spanish Foreign Minister Angel Lossada retorted, "the National Court had broad jurisdiction for universal justice and that there was no political influence on the judicial process."[30]
In an earlier cable days before the senators arrived, a US diplomat commented:

We do not know if the [Spanish] government would be willing to take the risky step of trying behind the scenes to influence the prosecutor's recommendation on this case or what their reaction to such a request would be.[31]

Controversies[edit]
In the Senate, Gregg was the leading Republican negotiator and author of the TARP program, which bailed out financial institutions, while he had a multimillion-dollar investment in Bank of America.[32][33][34] After leaving the Senate Gregg became an advisor to the investment bank Goldman Sachs.[35]
In February 2009, the Associated Press reported that Gregg and his family had profited personally from federal earmarks secured by the senator for the redevelopment of the Pease Air Force Base in Portsmouth, New Hampshire into an industrial park.[36][37] According to Senate records, Gregg has collected from $240,017 to $651,801 from his investments in Pease Air Force Base, while helping to arrange at least $66 million in federal aid for the former base.[36][37] Gregg has denied any wrongdoing in the matter and claimed that his withdrawal from consideration for the Commerce Secretary was unrelated to the White House's discovery during the vetting process of his involvement in his family's real estate investments in Pease. Gregg explained away his actions by saying, "I've throughout my entire lifetime been involved in my family's businesses and that's just the way our family works. We support each other and our activities."[36][38]
Gregg as a member of President Barack Obama's deficit commission defended cutting Social Security by quoting Willie Sutton who, when asked why he robbed banks, replied, "because that's where the money is."[39] The New York Times on August 24, 2015 published a letter by Gregg advocating cuts in Social Security benefits.
Commerce Secretary nomination and withdrawal[edit]
On February 2, 2009, Politico and CNN reported that Gregg accepted President Obama's offer to be the next United States Secretary of Commerce.[40] If Gregg had been confirmed by the Senate, he would have had to resign his Senate seat and be replaced with an appointment by Democratic Governor John Lynch. Sources from both parties confirmed that Gregg's former chief of staff, Republican Bonnie Newman, would have been chosen to replace him.[41] The Washington Post had alleged that Gregg would not accept the appointment unless Gov. Lynch agreed to appoint a Republican to fill his seat until 2010.[42] In February 2009 many news outlets noted that Gregg had, in 1995, voted to abolish the United States Department of Commerce.[43] Although he has stated that he supports the stimulus package promoted by President Obama, he has stated that he will recuse himself from voting on the package.[44]
With reports that the Obama Administration would move the United States Census Bureau, typically run by the Commerce Department, out of Gregg's jurisdiction, Republican leaders urged Obama to allow Gregg to run the census or withdraw Gregg's nomination.[45] On February 12, 2009, Gregg withdrew his name from consideration for the position of United States Commerce Secretary, citing disagreements with issues surrounding the census and the stimulus bill.[46] White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs issued a statement regarding Gregg's withdrawal in which he accused the senator of not following through on his alleged statements of support for Obama's economic agenda made during the vetting process:[47]

Senator Gregg reached out to the President and offered his name for Secretary of Commerce. He was very clear throughout the interviewing process that despite past disagreements about policies, he would support, embrace, and move forward with the President's agenda. Once it became clear after his nomination that Senator Gregg was not going to be supporting some of President Obama's key economic priorities, it became necessary for Senator Gregg and the Obama administration to part ways. We regret that he has had a change of heart.

While speaking to press afterward, Gregg acknowledged responsibility for his decision and accepted the blame for accepting and then rejecting the Commerce Secretary nomination.[16]
In an interview response to the AP, Gregg was quoted as saying, "For 30 years, I've been my own person in charge of my own views, and I guess I hadn't really focused on the job of working for somebody else and carrying their views, and so this is basically where it came out."[48]
In February 2009, the Associated Press reported that Gregg and his family had profited personally from federal earmarks secured by the Senator for the redevelopment of the Pease Air Force Base into an industrial park.[37] According to Senate records, Gregg has collected from $240,017 to $651,801 from his investments in Pease Air Force Base, while helping to arrange at least $66 million in federal aid for the former base.[37] Gregg claimed that his withdrawal from consideration for the Commerce Secretary was unrelated to the White House's discovery during the vetting process of his involvement in his family's real estate investments in Pease.
Personal life[edit]
Gregg belongs to the Congregationalist Church. He is married to Kathleen MacLellan Gregg. The couple have has daughters, Molly and Sarah, and a son, Joshua.
Gregg won more than $850,000 in 2005 after buying $20 worth of Powerball tickets at a Washington, D.C. convenience store.[49]

Judd Alan Gregg (born February 14, 1947) served as the 76th Governor of New Hampshire and was a United States Senator from New Hampshire, who served as chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. He is a member of the Republican Party and was a businessman and attorney in Nashua before entering politics. He currently serves as the Chair of the Public Advisory Board at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College.[1] Gregg was nominated for Secretary of Commerce in the Cabinet by President Barack Obama,[2] but withdrew his name on February 12, 2009.[3][4][5] He would have been up for re-election in 2010, but chose not to run.[6] In the November 2010 elections, former State Attorney General Kelly Ayotte, also a Republican, was elected to succeed Gregg in the Senate.[7] On May 27, 2011, Goldman Sachs announced that Gregg had been named an international advisor to the firm.[8] In May 2013, Gregg was named the CEO of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, a Wall Street lobbying group.[9] He later stepped down as CEO in December 2013 and became a senior adviser.
For the United States presidential election in 2016 Gregg endorsed former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, and upon Bush's suspension of his campaign Gregg endorsed Ohio Governor John Kasich.[10]

Early life[edit]
Born in Nashua, New Hampshire, he is the son of Catherine Gregg (née Warner) and Hugh Gregg, who was Governor from 1953 to 1955. Gregg graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy in 1965. Gregg received his baccalaureate from Columbia University in 1969 and, from Boston University School of Law, a Juris Doctor in 1972 and a Master of Laws in 1975.[11]
Early political career[edit]




Then-Governor Judd Gregg as painted by Richard Whitney


The first elective office held by Gregg was a seat on the Executive Council of New Hampshire, a post which he held from 1979 to 1981. He was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1980, and was reelected in 1982, 1984 and 1986.[12]
He declined to run for re-election in 1988, and ran for Governor of New Hampshire instead. He won that election and was re-elected in 1990, New Hampshire being one of two states (Vermont is the other) that continues to elect its governors to two-year, rather than four-year, terms. As Governor, he balanced the budget, leaving the office in 1993 with a $21 million surplus.[13][14] However, his political opponents in the 1990s attacked Judd for the state's weak economy and his Vietnam War deferments.[15]
U.S. Senate tenure[edit]
Elections[edit]
In 1992, Gregg decided to run for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by two-term Republican Warren Rudman. He defeated Democrat John Rauh, and took his seat as a United States Senator in 1993. He was re-elected to a second term in 1998 after defeating George Condodemetraky, and ran for a third term. That year, 2004, he defeated campaign finance activist Doris "Granny D" Haddock, the then 94-year-old Democratic nominee, by 66% to 34%.
After withdrawing from his nomination to become United States Secretary of Commerce in the presidential administration of Democrat Barack Obama on February 12, 2009, Gregg said he would "probably not" seek reelection in 2010, when his term of office was set to expire.[16]
Leadership[edit]
In January 2005, Gregg was elected to chair the U.S. Senate Committee on Budget by the Senate Republican Conference. While chairman of this committee Gregg has been a steadfast supporter of lower spending.[17] Throughout his Senate career he has been highly supportive of lower taxes as well.

On November 14, 2008 Gregg was appointed by United States Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell to serve on the five-member Congressional Oversight Panel created to oversee the implementation of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. Gregg "stepped aside" on December 1, citing his Senate workload:

I regret that due to the impending Senate schedule involving the potential of dealing with an extremely large stimulus package, coupled with the ongoing issues of developing fiscal policy relative to the budget and the continuing economic downturn and my responsibility for foreign operations appropriations, it has become difficult to continue service on the TARP oversight board. I have advised Senator McConnell I will need to step aside from this effort.[18][19]

Platform[edit]
Republicans for Environmental Protection issued Gregg an "environmental harm demerit" for sponsoring the 2006 S.C. Resolution 83, which according to REP "included only one revenue-raising instruction to Senate appropriations committees, an abuse of the congressional budget process in order to force oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge", and "would perpetuate America's dangerous oil dependence and damage the most scenic, wildlife-rich reserve in the circumpolar north."[20] The organization also praised Gregg, together with John E. Sununu, for their work to pass the New England Wilderness act, which classified nearly 100,000 acres (400 km2) of New Hampshire and Vermont as wilderness.[21] In 2006, Gregg received a score of 43% from the nonpartisan League of Conservation Voters.[22]
The University of New Hampshire renamed its Environmental Technology Building Gregg Hall, because Gregg used earmarks to secure $266 million of federal funds for research and development projects for the university. The Judd Gregg Meteorology Institute (JGMI), established in 2003, is the center of meteorological and atmospheric research at Plymouth State University in Plymouth, NH, which offers the only meteorology degree program in the state. The Senator was also instrumental in the establishing of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College in 1999.
In 2007, Gregg voted for the Clean Energy Act of 2007 (H.R. 6) and the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007 (S. 1639).
In October 2009, Gregg said, "You talk about systemic risk. The systemic risk today is the Congress of the United States...we’re creating these massive debts which we’re passing on to our children...(the figures) mean we’re basically on the path to a banana republic-type of financial situation in this country.[23] "
Gregg has a moderate record on social issues. In June 2006, he joined six of his fellow Republicans in voting against the Federal Marriage Amendment. In April 2007, he was among the breakaway Republicans to support the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. However, his record on the issue of abortion is otherwise a solidly pro-life one. Gregg has voted for some gun control measures and against others. He voted against the Brady Bill, but in recent years has voted for trigger control locks on firearms and in favor of the ban on assault weapons.
On December 17, 2009, Gregg voted to extend Chairman Ben Bernanke's term.[24]
Presidential politics[edit]
During the 2004 Presidential Election, Gregg stood in for John Kerry during practice sessions held by George W. Bush in preparation for the 2004 United States Presidential Election Debates. Four years earlier he had played the part of Al Gore for the same purpose.
On October 29, 2007, Gregg endorsed Mitt Romney, former Governor of Massachusetts, to be the Republican nominee for President of the United States.
Gregg has not foreclosed the possibility of running for President himself after he leaves the Senate but he has said it’s “not likely”:

"In New Hampshire we like to have a variety of candidates, so I would seriously doubt that. I expect to be actively involved in the presidential primary. That’s the fun on coming from New Hampshire and being in office,” Gregg said.
“I don't rule out anything in my future. Let's face it -- that's not likely and I wouldn't expect to be doing that,” he added.[25]

The Spanish Justice System and Guantanamo Bay[edit]
Main article: The Bush Six
In April 2009, Senator Gregg was sent to accompany an American diplomat to speak with a Spanish diplomat Luis Felipe Fernández de la Peña after a war crimes case was filed by Spanish NGO Association for the Dignity of Spanish Prisoners at the Audiencia Nacional of Spain accusing them of crimes in Iraq and Guantanamo Bay.[26] The case targeted six former US government officials for allegedly violating the Geneva Convention, the 1984 Convention Against Torture, and the 1998 Rome Statute.[27] The six accused were: Alberto Gonzales, David Addington, William Haynes, Douglas Feith, Jay Bybee, and John Yoo.[28] A summary of the meeting as recorded in a confidential diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks stated:

Senator Gregg expressed his concern and dismay about reported Spanish judiciary desire to indict six former Bush administration officials for allegedly creating a legal framework that permitted torture. Fernandez de la Pena lamented this development, adding that judicial independence notwithstanding, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs disagreed with efforts to apply universal jurisdiction in such cases.[29]

Senator Mel Martinez had a similar diplomacy meeting during the same period with the same agenda discussed. Martinez noted that "the prosecutions would neither be understood nor accepted in the U.S. and would have an enormous impact on the bilateral relationship". Spanish Foreign Minister Angel Lossada retorted, "the National Court had broad jurisdiction for universal justice and that there was no political influence on the judicial process."[30]
In an earlier cable days before the senators arrived, a US diplomat commented:

We do not know if the [Spanish] government would be willing to take the risky step of trying behind the scenes to influence the prosecutor's recommendation on this case or what their reaction to such a request would be.[31]

Controversies[edit]
In the Senate, Gregg was the leading Republican negotiator and author of the TARP program, which bailed out financial institutions, while he had a multimillion-dollar investment in Bank of America.[32][33][34] After leaving the Senate Gregg became an advisor to the investment bank Goldman Sachs.[35]
In February 2009, the Associated Press reported that Gregg and his family had profited personally from federal earmarks secured by the senator for the redevelopment of the Pease Air Force Base in Portsmouth, New Hampshire into an industrial park.[36][37] According to Senate records, Gregg has collected from $240,017 to $651,801 from his investments in Pease Air Force Base, while helping to arrange at least $66 million in federal aid for the former base.[36][37] Gregg has denied any wrongdoing in the matter and claimed that his withdrawal from consideration for the Commerce Secretary was unrelated to the White House's discovery during the vetting process of his involvement in his family's real estate investments in Pease. Gregg explained away his actions by saying, "I've throughout my entire lifetime been involved in my family's businesses and that's just the way our family works. We support each other and our activities."[36][38]
Gregg as a member of President Barack Obama's deficit commission defended cutting Social Security by quoting Willie Sutton who, when asked why he robbed banks, replied, "because that's where the money is."[39] The New York Times on August 24, 2015 published a letter by Gregg advocating cuts in Social Security benefits.
Commerce Secretary nomination and withdrawal[edit]
On February 2, 2009, Politico and CNN reported that Gregg accepted President Obama's offer to be the next United States Secretary of Commerce.[40] If Gregg had been confirmed by the Senate, he would have had to resign his Senate seat and be replaced with an appointment by Democratic Governor John Lynch. Sources from both parties confirmed that Gregg's former chief of staff, Republican Bonnie Newman, would have been chosen to replace him.[41] The Washington Post had alleged that Gregg would not accept the appointment unless Gov. Lynch agreed to appoint a Republican to fill his seat until 2010.[42] In February 2009 many news outlets noted that Gregg had, in 1995, voted to abolish the United States Department of Commerce.[43] Although he has stated that he supports the stimulus package promoted by President Obama, he has stated that he will recuse himself from voting on the package.[44]
With reports that the Obama Administration would move the United States Census Bureau, typically run by the Commerce Department, out of Gregg's jurisdiction, Republican leaders urged Obama to allow Gregg to run the census or withdraw Gregg's nomination.[45] On February 12, 2009, Gregg withdrew his name from consideration for the position of United States Commerce Secretary, citing disagreements with issues surrounding the census and the stimulus bill.[46] White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs issued a statement regarding Gregg's withdrawal in which he accused the senator of not following through on his alleged statements of support for Obama's economic agenda made during the vetting process:[47]

Senator Gregg reached out to the President and offered his name for Secretary of Commerce. He was very clear throughout the interviewing process that despite past disagreements about policies, he would support, embrace, and move forward with the President's agenda. Once it became clear after his nomination that Senator Gregg was not going to be supporting some of President Obama's key economic priorities, it became necessary for Senator Gregg and the Obama administration to part ways. We regret that he has had a change of heart.

While speaking to press afterward, Gregg acknowledged responsibility for his decision and accepted the blame for accepting and then rejecting the Commerce Secretary nomination.[16]
In an interview response to the AP, Gregg was quoted as saying, "For 30 years, I've been my own person in charge of my own views, and I guess I hadn't really focused on the job of working for somebody else and carrying their views, and so this is basically where it came out."[48]
In February 2009, the Associated Press reported that Gregg and his family had profited personally from federal earmarks secured by the Senator for the redevelopment of the Pease Air Force Base into an industrial park.[37] According to Senate records, Gregg has collected from $240,017 to $651,801 from his investments in Pease Air Force Base, while helping to arrange at least $66 million in federal aid for the former base.[37] Gregg claimed that his withdrawal from consideration for the Commerce Secretary was unrelated to the White House's discovery during the vetting process of his involvement in his family's real estate investments in Pease.
Personal life[edit]
Gregg belongs to the Congregationalist Church. He is married to Kathleen MacLellan Gregg. The couple have has daughters, Molly and Sarah, and a son, Joshua.
Gregg won more than $850,000 in 2005 after buying $20 worth of Powerball tickets at a Washington, D.C. convenience store.[49]

Judd Alan Gregg (born February 14, 1947) served as the 76th Governor of New Hampshire and was a United States Senator from New Hampshire, who served as chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. He is a member of the Republican Party and was a businessman and attorney in Nashua before entering politics. He currently serves as the Chair of the Public Advisory Board at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College.[1] Gregg was nominated for Secretary of Commerce in the Cabinet by President Barack Obama,[2] but withdrew his name on February 12, 2009.[3][4][5] He would have been up for re-election in 2010, but chose not to run.[6] In the November 2010 elections, former State Attorney General Kelly Ayotte, also a Republican, was elected to succeed Gregg in the Senate.[7] On May 27, 2011, Goldman Sachs announced that Gregg had been named an international advisor to the firm.[8] In May 2013, Gregg was named the CEO of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, a Wall Street lobbying group.[9] He later stepped down as CEO in December 2013 and became a senior adviser.
For the United States presidential election in 2016 Gregg endorsed former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, and upon Bush's suspension of his campaign Gregg endorsed Ohio Governor John Kasich.[10]

Early life[edit]
Born in Nashua, New Hampshire, he is the son of Catherine Gregg (née Warner) and Hugh Gregg, who was Governor from 1953 to 1955. Gregg graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy in 1965. Gregg received his baccalaureate from Columbia University in 1969 and, from Boston University School of Law, a Juris Doctor in 1972 and a Master of Laws in 1975.[11]
Early political career[edit]




Then-Governor Judd Gregg as painted by Richard Whitney


The first elective office held by Gregg was a seat on the Executive Council of New Hampshire, a post which he held from 1979 to 1981. He was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1980, and was reelected in 1982, 1984 and 1986.[12]
He declined to run for re-election in 1988, and ran for Governor of New Hampshire instead. He won that election and was re-elected in 1990, New Hampshire being one of two states (Vermont is the other) that continues to elect its governors to two-year, rather than four-year, terms. As Governor, he balanced the budget, leaving the office in 1993 with a $21 million surplus.[13][14] However, his political opponents in the 1990s attacked Judd for the state's weak economy and his Vietnam War deferments.[15]
U.S. Senate tenure[edit]
Elections[edit]
In 1992, Gregg decided to run for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by two-term Republican Warren Rudman. He defeated Democrat John Rauh, and took his seat as a United States Senator in 1993. He was re-elected to a second term in 1998 after defeating George Condodemetraky, and ran for a third term. That year, 2004, he defeated campaign finance activist Doris "Granny D" Haddock, the then 94-year-old Democratic nominee, by 66% to 34%.
After withdrawing from his nomination to become United States Secretary of Commerce in the presidential administration of Democrat Barack Obama on February 12, 2009, Gregg said he would "probably not" seek reelection in 2010, when his term of office was set to expire.[16]
Leadership[edit]
In January 2005, Gregg was elected to chair the U.S. Senate Committee on Budget by the Senate Republican Conference. While chairman of this committee Gregg has been a steadfast supporter of lower spending.[17] Throughout his Senate career he has been highly supportive of lower taxes as well.

On November 14, 2008 Gregg was appointed by United States Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell to serve on the five-member Congressional Oversight Panel created to oversee the implementation of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. Gregg "stepped aside" on December 1, citing his Senate workload:

I regret that due to the impending Senate schedule involving the potential of dealing with an extremely large stimulus package, coupled with the ongoing issues of developing fiscal policy relative to the budget and the continuing economic downturn and my responsibility for foreign operations appropriations, it has become difficult to continue service on the TARP oversight board. I have advised Senator McConnell I will need to step aside from this effort.[18][19]

Platform[edit]
Republicans for Environmental Protection issued Gregg an "environmental harm demerit" for sponsoring the 2006 S.C. Resolution 83, which according to REP "included only one revenue-raising instruction to Senate appropriations committees, an abuse of the congressional budget process in order to force oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge", and "would perpetuate America's dangerous oil dependence and damage the most scenic, wildlife-rich reserve in the circumpolar north."[20] The organization also praised Gregg, together with John E. Sununu, for their work to pass the New England Wilderness act, which classified nearly 100,000 acres (400 km2) of New Hampshire and Vermont as wilderness.[21] In 2006, Gregg received a score of 43% from the nonpartisan League of Conservation Voters.[22]
The University of New Hampshire renamed its Environmental Technology Building Gregg Hall, because Gregg used earmarks to secure $266 million of federal funds for research and development projects for the university. The Judd Gregg Meteorology Institute (JGMI), established in 2003, is the center of meteorological and atmospheric research at Plymouth State University in Plymouth, NH, which offers the only meteorology degree program in the state. The Senator was also instrumental in the establishing of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College in 1999.
In 2007, Gregg voted for the Clean Energy Act of 2007 (H.R. 6) and the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007 (S. 1639).
In October 2009, Gregg said, "You talk about systemic risk. The systemic risk today is the Congress of the United States...we’re creating these massive debts which we’re passing on to our children...(the figures) mean we’re basically on the path to a banana republic-type of financial situation in this country.[23] "
Gregg has a moderate record on social issues. In June 2006, he joined six of his fellow Republicans in voting against the Federal Marriage Amendment. In April 2007, he was among the breakaway Republicans to support the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. However, his record on the issue of abortion is otherwise a solidly pro-life one. Gregg has voted for some gun control measures and against others. He voted against the Brady Bill, but in recent years has voted for trigger control locks on firearms and in favor of the ban on assault weapons.
On December 17, 2009, Gregg voted to extend Chairman Ben Bernanke's term.[24]
Presidential politics[edit]
During the 2004 Presidential Election, Gregg stood in for John Kerry during practice sessions held by George W. Bush in preparation for the 2004 United States Presidential Election Debates. Four years earlier he had played the part of Al Gore for the same purpose.
On October 29, 2007, Gregg endorsed Mitt Romney, former Governor of Massachusetts, to be the Republican nominee for President of the United States.
Gregg has not foreclosed the possibility of running for President himself after he leaves the Senate but he has said it’s “not likely”:

"In New Hampshire we like to have a variety of candidates, so I would seriously doubt that. I expect to be actively involved in the presidential primary. That’s the fun on coming from New Hampshire and being in office,” Gregg said.
“I don't rule out anything in my future. Let's face it -- that's not likely and I wouldn't expect to be doing that,” he added.[25]

The Spanish Justice System and Guantanamo Bay[edit]
Main article: The Bush Six
In April 2009, Senator Gregg was sent to accompany an American diplomat to speak with a Spanish diplomat Luis Felipe Fernández de la Peña after a war crimes case was filed by Spanish NGO Association for the Dignity of Spanish Prisoners at the Audiencia Nacional of Spain accusing them of crimes in Iraq and Guantanamo Bay.[26] The case targeted six former US government officials for allegedly violating the Geneva Convention, the 1984 Convention Against Torture, and the 1998 Rome Statute.[27] The six accused were: Alberto Gonzales, David Addington, William Haynes, Douglas Feith, Jay Bybee, and John Yoo.[28] A summary of the meeting as recorded in a confidential diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks stated:

Senator Gregg expressed his concern and dismay about reported Spanish judiciary desire to indict six former Bush administration officials for allegedly creating a legal framework that permitted torture. Fernandez de la Pena lamented this development, adding that judicial independence notwithstanding, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs disagreed with efforts to apply universal jurisdiction in such cases.[29]

Senator Mel Martinez had a similar diplomacy meeting during the same period with the same agenda discussed. Martinez noted that "the prosecutions would neither be understood nor accepted in the U.S. and would have an enormous impact on the bilateral relationship". Spanish Foreign Minister Angel Lossada retorted, "the National Court had broad jurisdiction for universal justice and that there was no political influence on the judicial process."[30]
In an earlier cable days before the senators arrived, a US diplomat commented:

We do not know if the [Spanish] government would be willing to take the risky step of trying behind the scenes to influence the prosecutor's recommendation on this case or what their reaction to such a request would be.[31]

Controversies[edit]
In the Senate, Gregg was the leading Republican negotiator and author of the TARP program, which bailed out financial institutions, while he had a multimillion-dollar investment in Bank of America.[32][33][34] After leaving the Senate Gregg became an advisor to the investment bank Goldman Sachs.[35]
In February 2009, the Associated Press reported that Gregg and his family had profited personally from federal earmarks secured by the senator for the redevelopment of the Pease Air Force Base in Portsmouth, New Hampshire into an industrial park.[36][37] According to Senate records, Gregg has collected from $240,017 to $651,801 from his investments in Pease Air Force Base, while helping to arrange at least $66 million in federal aid for the former base.[36][37] Gregg has denied any wrongdoing in the matter and claimed that his withdrawal from consideration for the Commerce Secretary was unrelated to the White House's discovery during the vetting process of his involvement in his family's real estate investments in Pease. Gregg explained away his actions by saying, "I've throughout my entire lifetime been involved in my family's businesses and that's just the way our family works. We support each other and our activities."[36][38]
Gregg as a member of President Barack Obama's deficit commission defended cutting Social Security by quoting Willie Sutton who, when asked why he robbed banks, replied, "because that's where the money is."[39] The New York Times on August 24, 2015 published a letter by Gregg advocating cuts in Social Security benefits.
Commerce Secretary nomination and withdrawal[edit]
On February 2, 2009, Politico and CNN reported that Gregg accepted President Obama's offer to be the next United States Secretary of Commerce.[40] If Gregg had been confirmed by the Senate, he would have had to resign his Senate seat and be replaced with an appointment by Democratic Governor John Lynch. Sources from both parties confirmed that Gregg's former chief of staff, Republican Bonnie Newman, would have been chosen to replace him.[41] The Washington Post had alleged that Gregg would not accept the appointment unless Gov. Lynch agreed to appoint a Republican to fill his seat until 2010.[42] In February 2009 many news outlets noted that Gregg had, in 1995, voted to abolish the United States Department of Commerce.[43] Although he has stated that he supports the stimulus package promoted by President Obama, he has stated that he will recuse himself from voting on the package.[44]
With reports that the Obama Administration would move the United States Census Bureau, typically run by the Commerce Department, out of Gregg's jurisdiction, Republican leaders urged Obama to allow Gregg to run the census or withdraw Gregg's nomination.[45] On February 12, 2009, Gregg withdrew his name from consideration for the position of United States Commerce Secretary, citing disagreements with issues surrounding the census and the stimulus bill.[46] White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs issued a statement regarding Gregg's withdrawal in which he accused the senator of not following through on his alleged statements of support for Obama's economic agenda made during the vetting process:[47]

Senator Gregg reached out to the President and offered his name for Secretary of Commerce. He was very clear throughout the interviewing process that despite past disagreements about policies, he would support, embrace, and move forward with the President's agenda. Once it became clear after his nomination that Senator Gregg was not going to be supporting some of President Obama's key economic priorities, it became necessary for Senator Gregg and the Obama administration to part ways. We regret that he has had a change of heart.

While speaking to press afterward, Gregg acknowledged responsibility for his decision and accepted the blame for accepting and then rejecting the Commerce Secretary nomination.[16]
In an interview response to the AP, Gregg was quoted as saying, "For 30 years, I've been my own person in charge of my own views, and I guess I hadn't really focused on the job of working for somebody else and carrying their views, and so this is basically where it came out."[48]
In February 2009, the Associated Press reported that Gregg and his family had profited personally from federal earmarks secured by the Senator for the redevelopment of the Pease Air Force Base into an industrial park.[37] According to Senate records, Gregg has collected from $240,017 to $651,801 from his investments in Pease Air Force Base, while helping to arrange at least $66 million in federal aid for the former base.[37] Gregg claimed that his withdrawal from consideration for the Commerce Secretary was unrelated to the White House's discovery during the vetting process of his involvement in his family's real estate investments in Pease.
Personal life[edit]
Gregg belongs to the Congregationalist Church. He is married to Kathleen MacLellan Gregg. The couple have has daughters, Molly and Sarah, and a son, Joshua.
Gregg won more than $850,000 in 2005 after buying $20 worth of Powerball tickets at a Washington, D.C. convenience store.[49]

Judd Alan Gregg (born February 14, 1947) served as the 76th Governor of New Hampshire and was a United States Senator from New Hampshire, who served as chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. He is a member of the Republican Party and was a businessman and attorney in Nashua before entering politics. He currently serves as the Chair of the Public Advisory Board at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College.[1] Gregg was nominated for Secretary of Commerce in the Cabinet by President Barack Obama,[2] but withdrew his name on February 12, 2009.[3][4][5] He would have been up for re-election in 2010, but chose not to run.[6] In the November 2010 elections, former State Attorney General Kelly Ayotte, also a Republican, was elected to succeed Gregg in the Senate.[7] On May 27, 2011, Goldman Sachs announced that Gregg had been named an international advisor to the firm.[8] In May 2013, Gregg was named the CEO of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, a Wall Street lobbying group.[9] He later stepped down as CEO in December 2013 and became a senior adviser.
For the United States presidential election in 2016 Gregg endorsed former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, and upon Bush's suspension of his campaign Gregg endorsed Ohio Governor John Kasich.[10]

Early life[edit]
Born in Nashua, New Hampshire, he is the son of Catherine Gregg (née Warner) and Hugh Gregg, who was Governor from 1953 to 1955. Gregg graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy in 1965. Gregg received his baccalaureate from Columbia University in 1969 and, from Boston University School of Law, a Juris Doctor in 1972 and a Master of Laws in 1975.[11]
Early political career[edit]




Then-Governor Judd Gregg as painted by Richard Whitney


The first elective office held by Gregg was a seat on the Executive Council of New Hampshire, a post which he held from 1979 to 1981. He was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1980, and was reelected in 1982, 1984 and 1986.[12]
He declined to run for re-election in 1988, and ran for Governor of New Hampshire instead. He won that election and was re-elected in 1990, New Hampshire being one of two states (Vermont is the other) that continues to elect its governors to two-year, rather than four-year, terms. As Governor, he balanced the budget, leaving the office in 1993 with a $21 million surplus.[13][14] However, his political opponents in the 1990s attacked Judd for the state's weak economy and his Vietnam War deferments.[15]
U.S. Senate tenure[edit]
Elections[edit]
In 1992, Gregg decided to run for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by two-term Republican Warren Rudman. He defeated Democrat John Rauh, and took his seat as a United States Senator in 1993. He was re-elected to a second term in 1998 after defeating George Condodemetraky, and ran for a third term. That year, 2004, he defeated campaign finance activist Doris "Granny D" Haddock, the then 94-year-old Democratic nominee, by 66% to 34%.
After withdrawing from his nomination to become United States Secretary of Commerce in the presidential administration of Democrat Barack Obama on February 12, 2009, Gregg said he would "probably not" seek reelection in 2010, when his term of office was set to expire.[16]
Leadership[edit]
In January 2005, Gregg was elected to chair the U.S. Senate Committee on Budget by the Senate Republican Conference. While chairman of this committee Gregg has been a steadfast supporter of lower spending.[17] Throughout his Senate career he has been highly supportive of lower taxes as well.

On November 14, 2008 Gregg was appointed by United States Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell to serve on the five-member Congressional Oversight Panel created to oversee the implementation of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. Gregg "stepped aside" on December 1, citing his Senate workload:

I regret that due to the impending Senate schedule involving the potential of dealing with an extremely large stimulus package, coupled with the ongoing issues of developing fiscal policy relative to the budget and the continuing economic downturn and my responsibility for foreign operations appropriations, it has become difficult to continue service on the TARP oversight board. I have advised Senator McConnell I will need to step aside from this effort.[18][19]

Platform[edit]
Republicans for Environmental Protection issued Gregg an "environmental harm demerit" for sponsoring the 2006 S.C. Resolution 83, which according to REP "included only one revenue-raising instruction to Senate appropriations committees, an abuse of the congressional budget process in order to force oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge", and "would perpetuate America's dangerous oil dependence and damage the most scenic, wildlife-rich reserve in the circumpolar north."[20] The organization also praised Gregg, together with John E. Sununu, for their work to pass the New England Wilderness act, which classified nearly 100,000 acres (400 km2) of New Hampshire and Vermont as wilderness.[21] In 2006, Gregg received a score of 43% from the nonpartisan League of Conservation Voters.[22]
The University of New Hampshire renamed its Environmental Technology Building Gregg Hall, because Gregg used earmarks to secure $266 million of federal funds for research and development projects for the university. The Judd Gregg Meteorology Institute (JGMI), established in 2003, is the center of meteorological and atmospheric research at Plymouth State University in Plymouth, NH, which offers the only meteorology degree program in the state. The Senator was also instrumental in the establishing of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College in 1999.
In 2007, Gregg voted for the Clean Energy Act of 2007 (H.R. 6) and the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007 (S. 1639).
In October 2009, Gregg said, "You talk about systemic risk. The systemic risk today is the Congress of the United States...we’re creating these massive debts which we’re passing on to our children...(the figures) mean we’re basically on the path to a banana republic-type of financial situation in this country.[23] "
Gregg has a moderate record on social issues. In June 2006, he joined six of his fellow Republicans in voting against the Federal Marriage Amendment. In April 2007, he was among the breakaway Republicans to support the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. However, his record on the issue of abortion is otherwise a solidly pro-life one. Gregg has voted for some gun control measures and against others. He voted against the Brady Bill, but in recent years has voted for trigger control locks on firearms and in favor of the ban on assault weapons.
On December 17, 2009, Gregg voted to extend Chairman Ben Bernanke's term.[24]
Presidential politics[edit]
During the 2004 Presidential Election, Gregg stood in for John Kerry during practice sessions held by George W. Bush in preparation for the 2004 United States Presidential Election Debates. Four years earlier he had played the part of Al Gore for the same purpose.
On October 29, 2007, Gregg endorsed Mitt Romney, former Governor of Massachusetts, to be the Republican nominee for President of the United States.
Gregg has not foreclosed the possibility of running for President himself after he leaves the Senate but he has said it’s “not likely”:

"In New Hampshire we like to have a variety of candidates, so I would seriously doubt that. I expect to be actively involved in the presidential primary. That’s the fun on coming from New Hampshire and being in office,” Gregg said.
“I don't rule out anything in my future. Let's face it -- that's not likely and I wouldn't expect to be doing that,” he added.[25]

The Spanish Justice System and Guantanamo Bay[edit]
Main article: The Bush Six
In April 2009, Senator Gregg was sent to accompany an American diplomat to speak with a Spanish diplomat Luis Felipe Fernández de la Peña after a war crimes case was filed by Spanish NGO Association for the Dignity of Spanish Prisoners at the Audiencia Nacional of Spain accusing them of crimes in Iraq and Guantanamo Bay.[26] The case targeted six former US government officials for allegedly violating the Geneva Convention, the 1984 Convention Against Torture, and the 1998 Rome Statute.[27] The six accused were: Alberto Gonzales, David Addington, William Haynes, Douglas Feith, Jay Bybee, and John Yoo.[28] A summary of the meeting as recorded in a confidential diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks stated:

Senator Gregg expressed his concern and dismay about reported Spanish judiciary desire to indict six former Bush administration officials for allegedly creating a legal framework that permitted torture. Fernandez de la Pena lamented this development, adding that judicial independence notwithstanding, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs disagreed with efforts to apply universal jurisdiction in such cases.[29]

Senator Mel Martinez had a similar diplomacy meeting during the same period with the same agenda discussed. Martinez noted that "the prosecutions would neither be understood nor accepted in the U.S. and would have an enormous impact on the bilateral relationship". Spanish Foreign Minister Angel Lossada retorted, "the National Court had broad jurisdiction for universal justice and that there was no political influence on the judicial process."[30]
In an earlier cable days before the senators arrived, a US diplomat commented:

We do not know if the [Spanish] government would be willing to take the risky step of trying behind the scenes to influence the prosecutor's recommendation on this case or what their reaction to such a request would be.[31]

Controversies[edit]
In the Senate, Gregg was the leading Republican negotiator and author of the TARP program, which bailed out financial institutions, while he had a multimillion-dollar investment in Bank of America.[32][33][34] After leaving the Senate Gregg became an advisor to the investment bank Goldman Sachs.[35]
In February 2009, the Associated Press reported that Gregg and his family had profited personally from federal earmarks secured by the senator for the redevelopment of the Pease Air Force Base in Portsmouth, New Hampshire into an industrial park.[36][37] According to Senate records, Gregg has collected from $240,017 to $651,801 from his investments in Pease Air Force Base, while helping to arrange at least $66 million in federal aid for the former base.[36][37] Gregg has denied any wrongdoing in the matter and claimed that his withdrawal from consideration for the Commerce Secretary was unrelated to the White House's discovery during the vetting process of his involvement in his family's real estate investments in Pease. Gregg explained away his actions by saying, "I've throughout my entire lifetime been involved in my family's businesses and that's just the way our family works. We support each other and our activities."[36][38]
Gregg as a member of President Barack Obama's deficit commission defended cutting Social Security by quoting Willie Sutton who, when asked why he robbed banks, replied, "because that's where the money is."[39] The New York Times on August 24, 2015 published a letter by Gregg advocating cuts in Social Security benefits.
Commerce Secretary nomination and withdrawal[edit]
On February 2, 2009, Politico and CNN reported that Gregg accepted President Obama's offer to be the next United States Secretary of Commerce.[40] If Gregg had been confirmed by the Senate, he would have had to resign his Senate seat and be replaced with an appointment by Democratic Governor John Lynch. Sources from both parties confirmed that Gregg's former chief of staff, Republican Bonnie Newman, would have been chosen to replace him.[41] The Washington Post had alleged that Gregg would not accept the appointment unless Gov. Lynch agreed to appoint a Republican to fill his seat until 2010.[42] In February 2009 many news outlets noted that Gregg had, in 1995, voted to abolish the United States Department of Commerce.[43] Although he has stated that he supports the stimulus package promoted by President Obama, he has stated that he will recuse himself from voting on the package.[44]
With reports that the Obama Administration would move the United States Census Bureau, typically run by the Commerce Department, out of Gregg's jurisdiction, Republican leaders urged Obama to allow Gregg to run the census or withdraw Gregg's nomination.[45] On February 12, 2009, Gregg withdrew his name from consideration for the position of United States Commerce Secretary, citing disagreements with issues surrounding the census and the stimulus bill.[46] White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs issued a statement regarding Gregg's withdrawal in which he accused the senator of not following through on his alleged statements of support for Obama's economic agenda made during the vetting process:[47]

Senator Gregg reached out to the President and offered his name for Secretary of Commerce. He was very clear throughout the interviewing process that despite past disagreements about policies, he would support, embrace, and move forward with the President's agenda. Once it became clear after his nomination that Senator Gregg was not going to be supporting some of President Obama's key economic priorities, it became necessary for Senator Gregg and the Obama administration to part ways. We regret that he has had a change of heart.

While speaking to press afterward, Gregg acknowledged responsibility for his decision and accepted the blame for accepting and then rejecting the Commerce Secretary nomination.[16]
In an interview response to the AP, Gregg was quoted as saying, "For 30 years, I've been my own person in charge of my own views, and I guess I hadn't really focused on the job of working for somebody else and carrying their views, and so this is basically where it came out."[48]
In February 2009, the Associated Press reported that Gregg and his family had profited personally from federal earmarks secured by the Senator for the redevelopment of the Pease Air Force Base into an industrial park.[37] According to Senate records, Gregg has collected from $240,017 to $651,801 from his investments in Pease Air Force Base, while helping to arrange at least $66 million in federal aid for the former base.[37] Gregg claimed that his withdrawal from consideration for the Commerce Secretary was unrelated to the White House's discovery during the vetting process of his involvement in his family's real estate investments in Pease.
Personal life[edit]
Gregg belongs to the Congregationalist Church. He is married to Kathleen MacLellan Gregg. The couple have has daughters, Molly and Sarah, and a son, Joshua.
Gregg won more than $850,000 in 2005 after buying $20 worth of Powerball tickets at a Washington, D.C. convenience store.[49]

Profile

Senator Judd Gregg is a national leader on fiscal policy, a well known budget expert, and a respected voice on economic and financial regulatory issues. He was the chairman and then ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee, a member of the Senate Banking Committee, and the chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee. He was also served on President Obama’s National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform (Simpson-Bowles). The commission, which was originally modeled after legislation introduced by Senator Gregg and Senator Kent Conrad (D-ND), produced a debt-reduction plan now hailed as a model of bipartisan compromise on taxes and spending and is the standard against which all other proposals are measured.
Gregg has played a vital role in shaping fiscal policy over the last two decades. His expertise on banking issues and derivatives reform positioned him as a pivotal voice in the debate on regulatory reform. He currently co-chairs the Campaign to Fix the Debt, a comprehensive, non-partisan effort to reduce the national debt. Its goal is to put America on a better fiscal and economic path, and it aims to enlist American people and businesses to urge Congress and the president to pass meaningful legislation.
Exclusively represented by Leading Authorities speakers bureau, Gregg addresses fiscal and economic policy, the deficit and balancing the budget, taxes, and healthcare reform. He outlines what these issues mean for business, the plausible scenarios for dealing with them and mitigating risk, the most likely outcomes, and what their potential ramifications are – both in terms of the impact to the economy and the business environment. His presentations deliver sophisticated insights, and he speaks with passion and authority on these issues.
Legislative Leader. Gregg’s common-sense New Hampshire values have shaped some of the most significant legislation that Congress has passed in recent decades. A leading voice for fiscal discipline, he played a major role in rescuing our country from the brink of economic collapse as a chief negotiator of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. He also was the lead sponsor of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 and, along with the late Senator Ted Kennedy, co-authored the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001.Working across the aisle, Senator Gregg was a key decision maker on several important issues from championing bipartisan efforts to address our looming entitlement crisis to improving our health care system and revamping our complex and inequitable tax system.
Good as Granite. Gregg served three terms in the U.S. Senate representing the Granite state. He also served the people of New Hampshire as a governor (1989–1993) and a U.S. Representative (1981–1989). He is known as one of the state’s greatest champions of land conservation and was also named by Dartmouth College as its first distinguished fellow, where he lectures on various issues involving the government.

Fiscal Policy in Our New Economic Environment. Senator Gregg has unique, in-depth, and hands-on knowledge of the fiscal policy of our nation. He was a member of the Senate Banking Committee and played a major role in rescuing our country from the brink of economic collapse as a chief negotiator of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. He has been the leader in the effort to address the growing fiscal crisis of our nation, shaping some of the most significant legislation that Congress has passed in recent decades. His expertise on banking issues and derivatives reform positions him as a pivotal voice in the regulatory debate. His presentations deliver insights into America’s banking system, the economy, and other regulatory issues affecting today’s businesses.
Creating a Balanced Budget. Senator Gregg has extensive experience working toward balancing our national budget, with the aim of achieving fiscal sustainability over the long-term. He co-authored the bi-partisan Conrad-Gregg Bill, which set up a commission to reduce the national debt through spending restraint. This proposal led to the President’s Fiscal Responsibility Commission, which became the source of ideas regarding how to lower the federal debt. As the chair of the Senate Budget Committee, he has also seen first-hand what it takes to make real strides toward these goals and can address the topics of financial responsibility, the national budget, and the deficit.
Health Care Reform. Senator Gregg was a leading force in the debate over the health care reform bill, bringing to bear his expertise as the former chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pension committee. He also authored his own health care plan called Coverage, Prevention and Reform (CPR). In his presentations, Gregg outlines the enacted health care bill and provides insights into future health care reform.
Tax Reform. Sen. Gregg is the co-author of the first major, complete, bi-partisan tax reform bill introduced in Congress in years. The Wyden-Gregg Bill dramatically reduces income tax rates (taking corporate rates to 24 percent) and makes tax laws simpler and more capital investment-friendly. It is expected that this bill will be center of the tax reform effort which will occur in the 112th Congress. In his presentations, Gregg discusses tax reform and its implications for Americans.
Championing Our Environment. During his time as Senator, Judd Gregg made good on a 30-year commitment to protect the environment. To date, his efforts have helped preserve more than 337,000 acres of sensitive land in New Hampshire. The importance of environmental issues to Gregg and his constituents makes him poised to speak about environmental policy in our nation.
New Hampshire Primaries. Sen. Gregg has been involved in New Hampshire primary politics for decades. Leading experts on the presidential electoral process in New Hampshire, Gregg and his family played a major role in the primaries of Presidents Regan, George H. Bush, George W. Bush, and other candidates seeking the presidential nomination. Continue Reading »

Judd Gregg: A rogue agency at risk


    By Judd Gregg - 06/19/17 06:00 AM EDT

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is under attack.House Republicans have passed language that would significantly adjust the bureau’s structure as part of their bank reform bill.The Trump administration’s banking reform language, although not as aggressive as that of the House, proposes revamping the bureau.A lawsuit is pending in the Circuit Court of Appeals that could, if decided as it was in the lower court, fundamentally change the way the director of the CFPB is appointed, making him or her subject to removal at the president’s discretion.This suit and others could also potentially lead to the total elimination of the CFPB or to a finding that many of its rules were promulgated in an unconstitutional manner.ADVERTISEMENTThe CFPB is, to be kind, a controversial place.It is also a very unusual bureau.The CFPB was created when the Dodd-Frank bank bill was passed after the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009.Dodd-Frank was passed in the Senate on what was essentially a party line vote during a time when the Democrats had a filibuster-proof majority. They had no need to facilitate Republican participation in the drafting of the bill.In fact, the mark-up of the final bill occurred in a conference committee of the House and Senate Banking Committees, which started one afternoon and went through the night, ending at five in the morning with the final product.No Republican amendments of any significance were allowed to pass. The CFPB was created during the marathon mark-up.At the time some Republicans, including myself, noted that the CFPB as passed would be the most powerful and unanswerable agency in the history of the government.It would make J. Edgar Hoover’s FBI look like child’s play when it came to a rogue agency.It was, as constituted, uncontrollable by and unresponsive to elected leaders, specifically the president and the Congress, no matter their party.As structured, the CFPB delivered on everything progressives saw as necessary to their purpose.It would be able to direct its actions and wrath against any person or organization that its leadership deemed to not help the causes of the left. This was particularly important given the left’s instinctive antipathy towards the market economy and, specifically, bankers.The CFPB was the ultimate force to further the purposes of the Occupy Wall Street movement, which so animates the left then and now.This power of the CFPB was made operable because, for the first time in American government, the Congress created an agency whose leadership was not subject to review by the executive branch and whose funding was not subject to the oversight of the Congress.The CFPB director was set up to serve a five-year term without any avenue of recall or control from the president.Unlike other such agencies where the leadership can be terminated by the president — or where there is a board of oversight including members of both parties — the CFPB had one leader who was all-powerful and unaccountable.In addition the CFPB funding did not come under Congressional control. Instead, it was funded from the Federal Reserve.The Securities and Exchange Commission, Comptroller of the Currency and even the Supreme Court must come to the Congress to get their funding.Article One of the Constitution places the power of the purse with the Congress for a reason. It is to make sure that people who are answerable to the people through elections have the ultimate say in how bureaucracy deals with the people. It is called “government by the people.”The CFPB thus was brought forth during a midnight birthing as an illegitimate child of the progressive movement.This movement has no problems with trampling on the rights and purpose of our historic ‘checks and balances’ constitutional form of government, if it is seen as giving them power.Once created, the CFPB under its present director consolidated its already concentrated power.It has limited the people it hires to do enforcement to those who are true believers in its progressive causes. It has stonewalled all attempts by Congress to gain even the most elementary information about its enforcement actions.It has developed a police state-like approach in its treatment of those it deems targets. It has become the rogue bureau, just as was predicated at its inception.The CFPB was the brainchild of Sen. Elizabeth WarrenElizabeth Warren'Fox & Friends' hosts criticize Dem selfies after repeal vote Senate heading for late night ahead of ObamaCare repeal showdown Dem senators 'seek assurances' Icahn not swaying regulators on AIG: report MORE (D-Mass.), dating back to the days before she held elected office.Warren, then a teacher at Harvard Law School, like so many elites believes without question that, because they are in the right, neither historic precedent nor prior rules should restrain their initiatives.They pursue with singular vigor the use of the government to control the lives of those they see as lesser or malevolent, or both.Now of course, whenever the structure of the CFPB is questioned, those who challenge it are tarred by the left and their media acolytes as undermining the self-proclaimed protections of consumers that the CFPB is suppose to defend.This is truly a unique argument.To paraphrase, its proponents assert that they need to destroy the protections of the constitution — and, in particular, its commitment to having government answerable to the people — in the name of protecting the people.The arrogance of this position is only exceeded by the abuse of our constitutional system that the CFPB represents.We can only hope that at least once, the various avenues of review and reform that are now being pursued overcome the regal intransience of Warren and her progressives handy-persons.Only then will this bureau be steered back into the orbit of government by the people.Judd Gregg (R) is a former governor and three-term senator from New Hampshire who served as chairman and ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee, and as ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Foreign Operations subcommittee.The views expressed by contributors are their own and are not the views of The Hill.

Judd Gregg: Fixing the budget


    By Judd Gregg - 09/12/16 06:00 AM EDT

The primary reason that the Congressional budget process is not functioning is that it requires difficult decisions. This is not something Congress is good at.Negotiations over the budget are structured to guarantee significant confrontations rooted in partisanship and “turf wars.”ADVERTISEMENTThe existing rules that govern the process would lead to an effective budget procedure, and end product, if the above factors were not in play. But they are, so the whole thing falls apart.Thus, the country often does not have a federal budget. Even when it has had some semblance of a budget in place over the last decade or so, this has had little practical impact on disciplining federal spending or reforming tax policy.To fix this problem and actually have the Congress produce budgets that are meaningful and effective, there needs to be fundamental change. Adjustments must address the causes of the breakdown in the present budget process. These causes are:1. The hyperpartisan nature of the way the budget is developed. The budget is the only major legislation that is intentionally produced along clear partisan lines. The majority party has to write and pass a budget with essentially only its members supporting it. This guarantees significant systemic opposition to any budget by the minority.2. The fact that other panels see the Budget Committee’s product — i.e. the budget itself — as a threat to their jurisdiction and areas of responsibility. This is particularly true of both the Senate Finance Committee and the Senate Appropriations Committee. Thus, the budget is often undermined by the desire of other committees to protect their “turf.”3. The actual form that the budget takes does not relate to the core problems that a budget should address. It is too appropriations-centric. It does not address the size of the debt in a formal way. Only rarely does it grapple with the two-thirds of the spending of the government that involves entitlements or revenues. It is not set up to separate out capital spending, federal personnel policies or unused funds. It has no comprehensive way to address major federal expenditure areas such as healthcare that cut across multiple committees and involve both discretionary and entitlement spending. It is simply dysfunctional in its structure.In order to address these issues, there needs to be a major rethink of the approach to developing a federal budget.Firstly, the Budget Committee itself should be reconstituted. It should be made up in large part of the senior members of the committees most affected by the end product. This would create a greater likelihood of buy-in from those powerful committees and dilute the forces that are naturally at odds with the effort.One-third of the Budget Committee should be from Appropriations, one-third from Finance and one-third from the general membership of the Senate. The respective party leaders should choose the chairman and ranking member from the general membership.The Budget Committee should be a bipartisan committee. It should have its membership divided fifty-fifty between the parties, with the chairman being from the majority party. This would mean that both parties would have to take responsibility for producing a budget — or take the blame for the failure to do so.This would also increase the chances of reaching the kind of consensus necessary to make progress on difficult issues such as healthcare reform and tax reform.The budget goals should be set in terms of the debt-to-GDP ratio. If possible, the same type of approach should be used to set limits on spending and tax policy.No appropriation bills should be allowed to move to the floor in the absence of a budget including an omnibus bill. Spending on discretionary accounts and on major entitlements should be reduced by five percent from the prior year and revenues from the FICA and HI taxes should be increased by five percent if no budget is passed. This would put extreme pressure on the bipartisan committee and the Congress to produce and pass the budget.The three largest areas of federal entitlement spending — Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid — should be broken out as a separate item. They could be reviewed to ensure certain goals would be reached pertaining to the debt-to-GDP ratio. This would be done via a process that would cross committee lines of jurisdiction, instead engaging all the affected committees in a single process of review.A capital budget process should be added that also coordinates all the committees of jurisdiction.A budget organized according to these concepts would dramatically increase the likelihood that the largest government in the world — a government that is spending almost $4 trillion a year — would actually have a functioning budget. It would mean a disciplined approached to spending and tax policy. And it would mean that the American people’s confidence in their government and the Congress would increase significantly.Such an event would border on revolutionary — and it would also be a nice way to govern.Judd Gregg (R) is a former governor and three-term senator from New Hampshire who served as chairman and ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee, and as ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Foreign Operations subcommittee. He has endorsed Jeb Bush in this year's presidential race.

 Career History



Senior Advisor

                                    2011 - Current                


New Mountain Capital LLC


                  New Mountain Capital seeks to generate exceptional returns through investor value-added and growth rather than debt. The firm's private efforts focus on intensive fundamental research, the proactive creation of proprietary investment advantages in carefully selected sectors and assisting managements in improving their businesses. New Mountain is a generalist firm but they tend to focus on investments in defensive growth industries. They target sectors that should succeed in both good and bad economies and are large enough and growing rapidly enough to achieve very high valuations and returns at exit. The firm has particular expertise in the following sectors: education, healthcare, logistics, business services, federal information technology services, media, software, insurance, consumer products, financial services, technology, infrastructure and energy.New Mountain looks for companies that are market leaders in sustainable growth niches and have high barriers to competitive entry as demonstrated by high operating margins and strong downside protection in all reasonable worst-case scenarios. They also look for companies that offer the opportunity for extraordinary value creation due to rapid growth or other special factors that exist at the time of the investment. Investments typically range from $100 million to $500 million per transaction.
