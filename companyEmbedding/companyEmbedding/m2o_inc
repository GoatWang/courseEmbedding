Brands are losing sales and trust

You struggle with hundreds or thousands of items, in countless formats, at varied levels of accuracy and completeness.
Selling with bad data only hurts your sales, and the trust of your customers. You are exhausting your resources collecting and maintaining product data that is not fully powered to sell. The opportunity cost of not using those resources to sell more products creates pain for Brands and Retailers alike.
There is a better way to make your product content speak to consumers.

We guide and collaborate with Brands to extend their influence consistently across their selling channels by applying our deep domain expertise to the categorization and completeness of their product content.

 Thank you for the great time! I found the time we spent in the training session and break out sessions very useful, I look forward to updating Paul Engl on our time there. Every year I go to the AutoZone Catalog Summit to hear about any possible Edgenet changes, and have to admit, I came away from this meeting understanding Edgenet a whole lot better. It was great being able to see the Merchants side of the portal and I am sure it was also very useful for Tom Robbins to be able to see the vendors side of the portal.
