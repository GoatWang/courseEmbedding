Leadership















Karen Dahut
Civil Commercial Group Lead







Meet Karen
Executive Vice President 





My favorite quote is from Michelangelo: “The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short, but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark.”
I’ve taken these words to heart throughout my career. After earning my undergraduate degree in finance, I joined the Navy, where I became an officer.
After serving as the comptroller for the Navy’s premier biomedical research institute, I entered consulting, the absolute perfect career for me.
Booz Allen empowers people to change the world. Deciding to work here was one of the most important decisions I’ve ever made.

What makes you most passionate about your work? Problem-solving. With clients, on behalf of the firm, with our incredible staff, to come up with new ways of doing things.
 
Were there lessons you learned in the Navy that have influenced your work at Booz Allen? I’ve only made four important decisions as an adult in my life. One was the man I married, the second was to have children, the third was to join the Navy, and the fourth was to join Booz Allen. The Navy taught me leadership in a way that you would never get at that age anywhere else. I was 21 years old, leading people much older and more mature than me. The Navy thrust me into leadership and I had to find my way. That’s something I continue to rely on today.
 
What are your top tips for motivating people on your team? First, you have to inspire them. They have to be able to see a future that is bright and that they want to be a part of.  Second, you have to be willing to roll up your sleeves and work with them and be apprenticing along the way. You can’t be afraid to challenge yourself and continually improve your skill set so you can continue to be an essential partner to clients.
 
What’s the best career advice you’ve ever gotten? Aim high. Don’t settle for mediocrity. Whether personally or professionally, shoot for the moon. It’s good to get comfortable being uncomfortable.
 
What did you want to be when you grew up? A Sports Illustrated photographer. I’m a sports geek. I love any kind of sport or sporting event—I’m a die-hard football fan. I figured I’d get free tickets to all of the events!
 
Do you play sports now? I’m a runner now, but I did play sports—softball and field hockey, tennis, soccer, lots of different things. I’ve run a couple marathons, lots of half marathons, innumerable 10 milers and 10Ks.
 
Is there a connection for you between the dedication it takes to run a marathon and your work at Booz Allen? For sure. I’m a competitor. I think that comes from being the third of three girls. I’m competitive in every way, and I think that’s helped me push myself.
 
What was your first job? Working at McDonald’s. That job taught me all about customer service.
 
What are you nostalgic for? My daughters are now 23 and 20, and I miss the days when they were younger and still at home. They’re kind, gentle, smart, thoughtful young women.
 
What’s the most influential book you’ve read? Where Good Ideas Come From, by Steven Johnson. It offers a creative way to ideate and think about hard problems and solve them differently.
 
What’s an idea or invention you wish you’d thought of? Velcro. I think it’s one of the most useful things we have, and it’s so simple.
 
What are some of the biggest challenges your clients are facing? It’s the same across all of them: They want a secure and sustainable enterprise. They want to be leveraging technology in creative and holistic ways to get maximum return on their investments. They’re facing huge challenges regarding their workforces and talent, so we’re helping them build human capital and talent strategies. We’re helping them figure out how to continue to pursue their missions in more technologically advanced ways, using things like the explosion of data to find creative solutions to mission challenges.
 
Why is Booz Allen best positioned to address these challenges? Booz Allen empowers people to change the world. We empower our talent, our clients, and each other. Because we do that, we unleash an incredibly talented population on really hard problems. We naturally integrate and collaborate, and that’s what makes us different. That’s why we can do things other firms aren’t able to do.

CLEARWATER, Fla., April 19, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Tech Data Corporation (Nasdaq:    TECD) today announced the nomination of Karen Dahut for appointment to the company's Board of Directors. Ms. Dahut will be included in Tech Data's proxy statement for election by the company's shareholders to serve as an independent director.   








"Our Board of Directors is excited to welcome Karen," said Steve Raymund, chairman of the Board of Tech Data. "Her global leadership experience in next-generation technologies, cybersecurity, and data science are an ideal fit for some of Tech Data's most important strategic initiatives. We look forward to her valuable perspectives and her contributions to Tech Data's continued growth and success."
Dahut serves as an executive vice president at Booz Allen Hamilton, where she leads the firm's Civil Commercial Group (CCG) and is a member of the Executive Management committee. As the lead for the CCG, Dahut directs the strategy and delivery of the firm's strategic, technology, cyber, and analytics solutions to both commercial clients and leading federal civilian agencies. From 2012 to 2016, she served as Booz Allen Hamilton's chief innovation officer, leading the establishment of the firm's Strategic Innovation Group (SIG) in 2013 to develop and deliver solutions to clients' toughest challenges, while adding new capabilities in cyber, data science, and digital microservices to the firm's portfolio. Since joining the firm in 2002, Dahut has also led Booz Allen Hamilton's Analytics and Data Science business and served as the market leader for the firm's U.S. Navy business, involving staff and engagements in 25 locations worldwide. 
Prior to joining Booz Allen Hamilton, Dahut was an officer in the U.S. Navy and served as the comptroller for the Navy's premier biomedical research institute. A widely-recognized public speaker and author, Dahut serves as a board member of the Northern Virginia Technology Council. She holds a B.S in Finance from Mount St. Mary's University and an M.S. from the Viterbi School of Engineering at the University of Southern California.
