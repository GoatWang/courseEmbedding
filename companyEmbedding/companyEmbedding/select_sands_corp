Select Sands: One Of My Top Picks For 2017 - Select Sands Corp. (OTCMKTS:SLSDF) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Select Sands: One Of My Top Picks For 2017Mar.27.17 | About: Select Sands (SLSDF) Steven Goldman Special situations, long/short equity, Event driven investments, biotechwww.goldmanhine.comSummarySelect Sands is an industrial silica sand company (with quarries located in Arkansas) which has recently transitioned into a producing company and is now selling into the oil & gas sector.The demand and pricing for frac sand in the US oil & gas industry is growing.On March 17th, Select Sands announced it had entered into a long-term supply agreement, which it expects will generate sales in excess of 1 million ton/year.The company is undervalued. With demand and pricing for its sand increasing, and with the upcoming catalysts, Select Sands is one of the author's top picks.Select Sands Corporation ("Select") (OTCQX:SLSDF), together with its wholly owned subsidiary Select Sands America Corp., is an industrial silica product company in early commercialization stages of its 100%-owned Northern White Tier-1 silica sands project located in Arkansas, USA, as well as other valuable assets. 

 (Photo supplied by Select Sands: Sandtown wet plant) The market for Select's Northern White Tier-1 sand products in the oil and gas sector, both in the Permian and other areas located near Arkansas, is now in very high demand, and the price for Northern White Tier-1 silica sand is rapidly increasing, after having been in a bear market from late 2014 until the fall of 2016. It is expected that this high demand and increasing price trend will continue for the next few years. During the past few months, Select has transitioned into a rapidly growing operating company, with commercial sales of its Tier-1 sand now being sold into the oil & gas industry. After announcing on January 12, 2017, its first 7,000 ton sale of its sand into the oil & gas industry, on March 17th the company announced that it had entered into a substantial long-term supply agreement with Liberty Oilfield Services to supply 40/70 and 100 mesh sand products (with volumes that will increase to more than 1 million tons per year by next year).
 In my view, Select's share price has not yet begun to properly reflect the value of its assets or near-term revenue and profit potential. It remains very undervalued and has a substantial upside during the next 12-24 months, which I will discuss in more detail below. Background Select is a Canadian company with offices located in both Vancouver, B.C., and Houston, Texas. The operating business is now effectively carried out of the Houston office. The shares are listed on both the TSX Venture exchange under the symbol SNS.V and the OTCQX under the symbol SLSDF. Management Team Biographical details of the management team can be found here. Members of the team include: ZIGURDS R. VITOLSPresident and CEO / Director RASOOL MOHAMMAD / B. Sc (Mining Engineering)Chief Operating Officer / Director VINCENT PALOMAREZDirector of Sales / North America DARREN URQUHART / CPA, CACFO Capital Structure Summary (as of November, 2016) Common Shares: 82,471,755 Warrants: 7,246,634 Options: 4,022,833 Fully Diluted: 93,741,222 (November, 2016) Additional options grant: 2,200,000, as per January 7, 2017 press release. Symbol SNS.V (Toronto Stock Exchange, Venture) Unless otherwise stated, all currency references in this article are in US$. Share Price Close March 24, 2017: Cdn$1.56 52-week range: Cdn$0.20-2.04 Average trading volume: 580,000 shares/day Market Cap: Cdn$128.6 million SLSDF (OTCQX on NASDAQ) in US$ Share Price Close March 24, 2017: $1.17 52-week range: $0.16-1.55 Market Cap: $96.5 million I was first introduced to Select almost exactly 2 years ago. At that time, Rasool Mohammad was the president and CEO of Select Sands. We met in my Toronto office. Before I met Rasool, I knew nothing about sand and really had very little interest in the sand or frac sand business. During our initial meeting, Rasool made a very compelling case as to why Select Sands had incredible potential. The primary asset was an unpermitted 520 acre parcel of land in Arkansas, which contained Northern White, also called Ottawa white, finer mesh sand. Unlike the image of sand that I had in my head, Northern White Tier-1 40/70 or 100 mesh sand, once processed, actually looks and feels like pure white talcum powder. I still have a small clear plastic bag of Select's sand sitting on my desk to remind me daily of my investment.
 Shortly after meeting Rasool, I started buying shares of SNS.V at Cdn$0.13 when the entire market cap for the company was under Cdn$5 million. About a month later, in April, 2015, Rasool invited me to join the board because of my legal and board background. I accepted his invitation. In less than 2 years, it has had a number of capital raises, transitioned into a producing sand company, and now has a market cap of approximately $96.5 million (approximately Cdn$128 million). In my view, in addition to being undervalued based upon its current assets, there are a number of upcoming catalysts which together make Select Sands one of my top picks for 2017. It is currently one of my largest holdings. Select Sands 1-year chart in Cdn$ trading on the TSX Venture Exchange

 Select Sands' Assets The company currently has a number of assets, including: a) Sandtown Property: An advanced-stage silica sand 520 acre property in Arkansas (the "Sandtown" project or "Sandtown Property"). It is fully permitted and recently commenced commercial operations. According to an updated report prepared by engineering firm Tetra Tech in February 2016, Sandtown contains a resource of 42 million tons, primarily finer mesh 40/70 and 100 Northern White silica sand. The details are set out in the company's press release dated February 6, 2016, found here. According to a Preliminary Economic Assessment ("PEA") completed back in June 2015, prepared by Tetra Tech in relation to only 40% of the property (20 million tons), there was an internal rate of return of 45%, with a net present value of $160 million (after-tax NPV at 8% of $92 million), based on revenues calculated at $49 per ton. An updated PEA reflecting the entire 42 million ton resource has not yet been done and may not be done.
 b) Bell Farm: A newly acquired 457-acre property ("Bell Farm") located approximately 3 miles from the 520-acre Sandtown Property. The company believes Bell Farm could be a source of Northern White Tier-1 frac sand. Bell Farm appears to be underlain by the St. Peters formation, and is currently being tested by an engineering firm retained by Select to determine the quality and quantity of its frac sand. The details of the acquisition of the Bell Farm property are disclosed in Select Sands' press release dated January 25, 2017, found here. c) 26 Acre Wet/ Dry Plants and Sand Storage facility located on Union Pacific Railway line: A wet plant and a 26-acre fully operational drying facility with storage facility located close to Select Sands acquired from Tutle Holding, LLC, Steve Hackmann, Ozark Premium Sand, LLC ("OPS"), including operating equipment, saleable inventory, and customer lists, among other miscellaneous assets owned by OPS. The 26-acre facility is located on the Union Pacific Rail Line, which has allowed Select Sands' transformation into a fully integrated, self-sufficient Tier 1 sand producer currently ramping up production at a 600,000-ton run rate, with upgrades planned this year to exceed the 1,000,000 ton capacity, and with excellent logistics. In addition, the company is evaluating the possibility of increasing capacity with relatively low capital expenditure. d) 20 million common shares in Comstock Metals Inc. (OTCPK:CMMMF, TSX.V symbol CSL.V): Comstock Metals is a micro-Canadian mining exploration company with gold exploration properties located in the Yukon, Saskatchewan, and Ontario, as well as potential uranium mining stakes in Saskatchewan. The company is currently drilling its Preview property in Saskatchewan. e) Approximately US $6 million cash or equivalents (with no debt other than the usual current trade payables etc.). Logistical Advantage Most of the type of Northern White sand being produced by Select Sands is currently mined in the northern part of the US, such as Wisconsin. For those oil & gas companies buying their Northern White frac sand from Wisconsin, this creates additional shipping costs and time delays for oil fracking producers in the Permian and other parts of the southern US, who may need very large quantities of this type of finer mesh, high-quality sand. As well, freezing winters in Wisconsin can halt production during the winter months. Hence, it was an enormous logistical advantage for Select Sands to have its quarries located in Arkansas (with a 12-month season and an approximately 650-mile shipping advantage to the oil & gas fields in the southern US).
 The map below (taken from a Select Sands November 2016 PowerPoint presentation) illustrates the company's logistical advantage in relation to the major oil & gas fields as well as the UP Rail Lines. 

 Increasing Demand and Higher Pricing for Frac Sand in the US During the past 6-9 months, the demand and pricing for finer mesh, high-quality silica sand in the oil & gas industry in the US has been rapidly increasing and there have been a number of recent articles in the financial and industry press discussing the phenomenon. For example, a Wall Street Journal article came out on March 23, 2017, called "Latest Threat to US Oil Drillers, The Rocket Price of Sand." The article underscores the opportunity for Select Sands Corp. As well, the other week, the well-respected energy investment and merchant banker Tudor Pickering Hold & Co. came out with a presentation called "Don't Sleep On the Sand Stocks: Frac Sand Supply-Demand Update and Sand Stock Upside Musings." I have taken the liberty to include some of the slides from their March 2017 presentation below, which sets out the increasing annual US frac sand demand, both historical and Tudor Pickering's forecast for 2017 and 2018. 

 


 

 

 On January 12, 2017, Select Sands issued a press release that it had just entered into its first oil & gas frac sand order to supply 7,000 tons of sand. Steven Goldman's March 22, 2017, Interview with Zig Vitols, president and CEO of Select Sands On March 22, 2017, I had an opportunity to interview Select Sands' President and CEO, Zig Vitols, for more than an hour. He also answered some follow-up questions for me. I was going to provide a Q&A format for part of this article, but Seeking Alpha no longer permits that format in its exclusive articles. Hence, I will simply incorporate some of Zig's important answers in the article. March 17th Announcement of Multi-year Frac Sand Supply Agreement to Surpass 1 Million Tons Per Year On March 17, 2017, Select Sands issued a press release here, announcing that it had entered into its first multi-year frac sand supply agreement with Liberty Oilfield Services, of Denver Colorado. "Initial rail shipments were completed in February, 2017 and are anticipated to continue throughout 2017 with volumes expected to increase in 2018 and 2019 to surpass a total of one million tons per year. The 40/70 and 100 mesh products to be supplied under the agreement will be sourced from the Company's facilities in Arkansas..." This is a major step for Select Sands, and I wanted to speak to Zig Vitols about that new supply agreement. Liberty Oilfield Services is a mid-sized pressure pumping company based in Denver, Colorado. It is a very respected company and is always pushing leading-edge new oil field technologies. Zig thought it was run by well-respected individuals and found that they were a pleasure to work with.
 Liberty Oilfield is a private company. Zig's understanding was that it has about 11 active hydraulic fracturing fleets, with each fleet generally having the capacity to service one well with typically anywhere from 20 to 40 trucks with generators or pumps or other large pieces of equipment, and that the company is upgrading with an additional six frac fleets to meet their operational standards. The finer mesh/grade (40/70 and 100 mesh), high-purity (+99% SiO2) sand being produced by Select Sands (Northern White Tier-1 frac sand, 40/70 and 100 mesh) is also ideal for specialized industrial uses which can command higher prices than the oil & gas industry, but the sales are in much smaller volumes. Zig confirmed that Select will continue to sell into the industrial market as part of its overall supply strategy. But increasingly sales will be focused on the oil & gas sector. Ramping up to 1 Million Ton/Annum Production in 2017 In December 2016, Select Sands announced that it had completed the acquisition of a 26-acre fully permitted operational facility containing both wet and dry plant production facilities located on a Tier 1 Union Pacific Rail line which could process 600,000 tons of silica sand products from its Sandtown property. To meet the 1,000,000 tons per year capacity to satisfy the Liberty Oilfield supply agreement, Zig told me that Select is "currently ramping up to the 600,000 tons annual run rate and plan to surpass the 1 million ton production capacity mark in 2017." Furthermore, to get to a 1 million ton production capacity, Select really only needs to buy some new pieces of equipment and upgrade some others, which it can easily finance with the funds currently on hand. Select's Ability to Ship by Railway and Truck Regarding the company's ability to regularly ship its sand by rail, Zig indicated that it currently uses 25 car units, with each car able to hold approximately 110-115 tons of silica sand. Select Sands is also evaluating its options to expand its rail capacity to satisfy clients' needs, and has access to other rail loading capability to build larger unit trains as required. Traditionally, a unit train is composed of 105-110 railway cars. Currently, the company has the capacity, through a combination of using its 25 railway car units and its trucking options, to ship its sand at an annualized rate in excess of 1,000,000 tons per year.
 Zig believes Select has superior truck logistics capabilities. Arkansas itself is a truck transportation hub, and Select has found trucking resources readily available. Its shipping destinations have included Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Tennessee, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas. Liquidity After raising approximately $12,500,000 in a private placement in November 2016, Zig felt Select Sands is in good financial shape with no debt, approximately $6 million in cash (and approximately $17 MM in cash or equivalents, assuming all of its options and warrants are exercised) and sufficient liquidity to carry all currently announced projects through to completion without need for further funding. While its Liberty Oilfield supply agreement should generate pretty steady cash flow for Select, it still has the ability to sell sand on the spot market as well. Spot market prices today vary, but typically (with some exceptions), producers are reporting spot being in the low- to mid-$40s per ton. On an anecdotal basis, and based upon what he has been hearing at recent oil & gas conferences, the consensus is that pricing for Select's type of sand is, and will be, increasing. The rate of price increase could be the same or higher than that of WTI, and will certainly benefit if it does. Of course, if the price of oil plummets, that will likely negatively impact Select Sands. Bell Farm Acquisition Announced January 25, 2017 On January 25, 2017, Select announced that its wholly owned US subsidiary completed the purchase of an additional 457 acres of property ("Bell Farm") located approximately 3 miles from its 520-acre Sandtown location. Bell Farm is underlain by the St. Peter Sandtown formation. Select believes the property is a source of Northern White Tier-1 frac sand. While Zig was unable to provide many details, he did confirm there was ongoing engineering work to determine quality of the sand and the quantity, and indeed, if any at all. There was a prior engineering firm that was working on the Bell Farm project before Select bought it, and Select is currently working with that engineering company with the intention of completing an NI 43-101 compliant report on the quality and quantity of the resource, if applicable.
 Hi-Crush Partners' (NYSE:HCLP) Acquisition of Permian Basin Sand Company On February 23, 2017, one of Select's competitors, Hi-Crush Partners LP, announced it entered into a series of agreements to acquire Permian Basin Sand Company and related assets for $415 million exclusive of contingent earnout considerations. The Permian Basin Sand portion of the deal was for $275 million. The Permian Basin Sand Company owns a 1226-acre sand reserve consisting of more than 55 million tons of 100 mesh sand and is located in the Permian (a logistical advantage). No production facility is included, but Hi-Crush announced that it intends to have a processing plant producing 3 million tons per year for a cost of $45-50 million. Based upon the press release, it appears that Hi-Crush paid approximately $5.00 per ton of sand in the ground for Permian Basin Sand Company with no production facility. Comparing the two companies' assets is difficult, as they contain considerably different saliencies. However, while it's not really a direct comparison, you can't ignore the sale either. On the one hand, they are within the Permian and will likely focus on that area. Select Sands services a broad geographical area from the east coast to the southwestern US and has finer Northern White Tier-1 sand. Select's Future Growth In discussing Select's future prospects, Zig emphasized that the company has a great team and great assets, the market for its products looks healthy, it has a new long-term supply agreement with a robust customer and the company sees a lot of opportunities for growth. I also asked Zig about any additional M&A opportunities. He confirmed that Select is always looking for opportunities, and thinks the company has the team and capability to evaluate opportunities in greenfield, M&A and downstream logistics solutions. The industry is going through a period of growth and consolidation, and Select is looking to better service the increase in demand for its type of silica sand, and so, is always considering all options.
 Finally, I asked Zig where he hoped Select Sands will be as a company in the next year or two. He was quite optimistic; current industry forecasts show that demand will outstrip supply. He sees a lot of opportunities to increase Select's contribution to that increasing demand. Select also hopes to uplist to the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) main trading board, which will provide even better access to capital markets and investors. Zig concluded stating that Select's mission is to be in the top tier of sand suppliers in the next three to five years. Valuation Select has not provided any guidance as to 2017 revenues or expenses. We do know, however, that it has recently transitioned from an exploration company into an operating company, having landed a major supply agreement under which it began shipping product in February 2017. Providing a rough sum of the parts valuation, I am taking into account the following: 1. Sandtown Property Contains 42 million tons of finer mesh finer quality sand, with a 26-acre production facility (both dry and wet plant) nearby with rail and trucking facilities. Taking into account the following factors, I am roughly calculating the Sandtown asset is worth in excess of $200 million, based upon:  a potential run rate of sales of 1 million tons per year (just from the Liberty Oilfield supply agreement). I am assuming rates will be in the $35-40/ton range, which is just below current spot pricing. Based upon the foregoing assumptions, the Liberty Oilfield contract alone could start generating $35-40 million gross revenues by next year on an annualized basis. Sources of other revenues could increase this figure. As well, it may be possible to add additional production capacity; Hi-Crush's recently announced acquisition (February, 2017) under which it paid $5 per ton in the ground for a well-located facility with brown sand and no permit or production facility; and the June 2015 PEA, which valued 40% of Sandtown at a Net Present Value ("NPV") of $160 million ($92 million NPV after-tax), based upon average revenues of $49/ton, a pre-production cost of $42 million and operating costs in the range of $19/ton processed. 
 2. The Bell Farm The recently acquired 457 acre Bell Farm is, in my view, premature to be valued. I prefer to wait until we can review the intended release of the NI 43-101 report before attributing any material value to it. There is currently no guarantee that Bell Farm will have any material commercial value, and it would be speculative to attribute value until Select confirms its value, and preferably until an NI-43-101 is released to the public. However, I anticipate that a reasonable amount of due diligence was conducted before Select Sands closed the acquisition, and assume the company must be reasonably confident this is a commercially viable asset. Assuming, the ongoing engineering work is going well, I expect the NI 43-101 for the Bell Farm is going to be finalized and be released by the end of Q2 2017 (perhaps early Q3), and that it will contain a material amount of Northern White Tier-1 frac sand. However, for whatever it is worth, the Oil and Gas Investments Bulletin recently put out a short article on Select Sands in which the author estimated Bell Farm has 20 million tons of 40/70 mesh Northern White sand. 3. 26 Acres-Plus Processing Facility Select Sands bought the 26-acre parcel and production facility assets at a remarkable bargain price, but the asset should be valued at approximately $20-30 million given that the original PEA assumed a $42 million capex to build the production facilities. 4. 20 Million Shares in Comstock Metals (CSL.V) Comstock Metals is a junior (primarily gold) exploration company headquartered in Vancouver, B.C. Its shares trade on the TSX Venture exchange under the symbol CSL.V. The company is currently executing a 2,500-meter drilling program at its Preview exploration deposit in Saskatchewan, Canada, as more particularly disclosed in its March 7th press release found here. For more information, please see the company website. The shares of the company are currently trading in the Cdn$0.16-0.17 range. The shares are currently worth about Cdn$3.2 million based on the current stock trading price. The valuation is speculative at this time.
 5. Cash While Select does have about $6 million in its treasury, as well as a substantial number of in-the-money options and warrants, I am not attributing any value to this cash or equivalents, as the company does need some working capital. Based upon the foregoing, I am valuing Select Sands at about $230 million (approximately Cdn$310 million) today. On a fully diluted basis, and assuming that Bell Farm has $0.00 value, the current value of shares is approximately $2.40 per share, or Cdn$3.25. Potential Upcoming Catalysts The following are some of the potential upcoming catalysts for Select Sands:  The finalization and release of a NI 43-101 for Bell Farm. I'm estimating that one will be finalized and released in Q2 2017 (or early Q3 2017). There is no guarantee that a 43-101 will be released (if it turns out not to be commercially viable), but assuming it is and it contains a material amount of Northern White Tier-1 sand (or similar), it could materially increase the value of Select Sands. For example, if Bell Farm provides an additional 20 million tons of commercially extractable Northern White Tier-1 sand, that could increase the value of Select Sands by an order of $100 million; particularly as it is located close enough to Sandtown to use the same production facility. That alone could increase the value of Select's shares by $1 (Cdn$1.35) per share or more. The current production facility being increased from 600,000 tons to 1 million ton capacity (anticipated by me to be completed by late Q2 or Q3). The upgrade involves installation of equipment upgrades to the facility with funding from the company's existing cash. Additional and larger production facilities being built, as well as improved and larger rail capacity. Increased sand prices on the spot market. Recognition of Select's value as a producer, which should provide a premium to today's share price value. An increase in the value of the 20 million CSL.V shares in the event of a successful drilling program (or other positive news). The development of leading-edge downstream logistic solutions. Uplisting to the TSX main board. Additional M&A to increase the assets of the company, or alternatively, being bought out itself. 
 Risks An investment in a small-cap company such as Select Sands has various risks, including market risks (oil & gas prices, sand prices), competition, execution risks, equipment failures, litigation risks and the various others which are set out in more detail in the company management's Discussion and Analysis filed quarterly.

Select Sands Adds 49.6 Million Tons Of Value - Select Sands Corp. (OTCMKTS:SLSDF) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Select Sands Adds 49.6 Million Tons Of ValueApr.24.17 | About: Select Sands (SLSDF) Steven Goldman Special situations, long/short equity, Event driven investments, biotechwww.goldmanhine.comSummarySelect' Bell Farm property adds 49 million additional tons of finer mesh silica sand to Select's assets. Select now owns nearly 90 million tons of finer mesh Northern white sand.Select's newly acquired 25 rail car unit rail loading facility provides additional value and efficiency to Select's sand operations in Arkansas.The value of Select Sands' assets has materially increased because of these acquisitions.Select Sands' share price remains materially undervalued.Select Sands Corporation (OTCQX:SLSDF), together with its wholly owned subsidiary Select Sands America Corp., is an industrial silica product company in early commercialization stages of its 100%-owned Northern White Tier-1 silica sands project and Bell Farm property located in Arkansas, as well as other valuable assets. My first article about Select was published on SA on March 27, 2017, which provides background information regarding the company, its management team and assets, and explains why Select Sands is one of my top picks for 2017. 

 Source: Select Sands, Sandtown wet plant. The market for Select's Northern White Tier-1 sand products in the oil and gas sector, both in the Permian and other areas located near Arkansas, is now in very high demand, and the price for Northern White Tier-1 silica sand is rapidly increasing, after having been in a bear market from late 2014 until the fall of 2016. During the past number of months, Select has transitioned into a rapidly growing operating company, with commercial sales of its Tier-1 sand now being sold into the oil & gas industry. After announcing on January 12, 2017, its first 7,000 ton sale of its sand into the oil and gas industry, on March 17th the company announced that it had entered into a substantial long-term supply agreement with Liberty Oilfield Services (Liberty) to supply 40/70 and 100 mesh sand products (with volumes that will increase to more than 1 million tons per year by next year).
 Capital Structure Summary (as of November 2016) Common Shares: 82,471,755 Warrants: 7,246,634 Options: 4,022,833 Fully Diluted: 93,741,222 (November 2016) Additional options grant: 2,200,000, as per Jan. 7, 2017, press release. (Unless otherwise stated, all currency references in this article are in U.S. dollars.) Share Price Close: April 19, 2017 -- $1.10 52-week range: $0.16-1.55 Market Cap: U.S. $90.7 million 

 SLSDF data by YCharts Two New Significant Developments Since writing my initial March 27th article, Select has announced two significant new developments: 1. The acquisition of a 25 rail car loading facility; and 2. the results of its NI 43-101 maiden inferred mineral resources report for its newly acquired Bell Farm property which indicates the addition of approximately 49 million tons (Inferred) of med to high quality, finer mesh silica sand. Lease to Purchase Acquisition of 25 Rail Car Loading Facility On April 4th, Select announced that it had entered into a lease to purchase agreement with Newport Rail Loading Facility, LLC (Seller) of Arkansas, whereby Select acquired a 25 rail car unit rail loading facility for U.S. $2,050,000 payable over 5 years. The first-year payment of U.S. $500,000 has been made to the Seller and the balance will be paid out in equal amounts of U.S. $387,500 every year until March, 2021. The loading facility located in Diaz, Arkansas is connected to the Union Pacific Railroad mainline and is 15 miles from the company's dry processing plant. This rail loading facility is currently used by Select Sands, and allows for loading and shipping of one 25 rail car unit per day (approximately 2,850 tons of silica sand per day). This rail car loading facility is being operated by Select Sands 6 days per week; hence, in addition to the trucking facilities, can load and transport 17,700 tons of silica sand per week (based upon a 6 day week and one 25 rail car unit/ day).
 One further advantage of owning its own loading facility is that this should generate savings to Select Sands of approximately US $4.00 per ton being loaded (excluding the cost of acquisition and maintenance costs). Bell Farm Property - NI 43-101 indicates inferred Mineral Resource of 49.6 million tons (23.5% of 30/50 mesh, 48% of 40/70 mesh and 42.1% of 100 mesh (70/140 mesh) On April 13th, Select announced the results of its National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101) maiden inferred resources calculation on its newly acquired 457 acre Bell Farm property. The NI 43-101 concluded Inferred Mineral Resources are 49,622,003 tons of medium-to fine grained, white sandstone, comprised of a grain size distribution of 23.5% 30/50 mesh, 48% of 40/70 mesh and 42.1% of 100 mesh (70/140 mesh). This type of sand is generally described as Northern White Tier-1 sand. The Bell Farm property covers 457 acres, has paved road access and available three-phase power, and located only about 2 miles northwest of the company's existing Sandtown project. As a result of this new NI 43-101, Select now owns a total of approximately 90 million tons of sand most of which is finer mesh, high quality Northern White Tier-1 silica sand. The conclusions in the Bell Farm's NI 43-101 have substantially increased the value of Select. Valuation While Select has not yet provided any guidance as to its 2017 revenues or expenses, it has recently transitioned from an exploration and development company into an operating company, having landed a major supply agreement with Liberty under which it began shipping silica sand product in February 2017. Hopefully, by the time Select Sands announces its Q1 2017 results in mid to late May, 2017, investors should have a much better idea as to how 2017 will be shaping up. In calculating a rough sum of the parts valuation, I am considering the following assets owned by Select: 1. Sandtown Property (Arkansas) According to its independently prepared Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) report with details announced in June 2015, the Sandtown Property contains approximately 42 million tons of finer mesh finer quality sand, with a 26-acre production facility (both dry and wet plant) nearby with rail and trucking facilities. Taking into account the following factors, I am roughly calculating the Sandtown frac sand asset is worth in excess of $200 million, based on:
  A potential run rate of sales of 1 million tons per year (just from the Liberty Oilfield supply agreement). I am assuming rates will be in the $35-40/ton range, which is just below current spot pricing. Based upon the foregoing assumptions, the Liberty Oilfield contract alone could start generating $35-40 million gross revenues by next year on an annualized basis. Sources of other revenues could increase this figure. As well, it may be possible to add additional production capacity; Hi-Crush Partners' (NYSE:HCLP) February 2017 acquisition of the Permian Basin Sand Company, located in Winkler County, Texas, under which it paid $5 per ton for sand reserves for a well-located facility with primarily Texas brown sand, with no permit or production facility. See Hi-Crush's February 23, 2017 press release for further details; and the June 2015 PEA, which valued 40% of Sandtown at a Net Present Value (NPV) of $160 million ($92 million NPV after-tax), based upon average revenues of $49/ton, a pre-production cost of $42 million and operating costs in the range of $19/ton processed.  The Bell Farm - 49 million tons of sand (NI 43-101) The NI 43-101 for the recently acquired 457 acre Bell Farm indicates a 49 million ton (Inferred) mostly finer mesh, high quality white sand. Valuing it even at $3.00 per ton/ in the ground, utilizing a 40% discount from the $5.00 per ton Hi-Crush acquisition (based upon its Inferred NI 43-101), would still value the 49 million tons of sand at the Bell Farm property at U.S. $147 million. 26 Acres-Plus Processing Facility While Select Sands bought the 26-acre parcel and production facility assets at a remarkable bargain price, the asset should be valued at approximately $20-30 million given that the June 2015 PEA assumed a $42 million capex to build the production facilities. 20 Million Shares in Comstock Metals (OTCPK:CMMMF) Comstock Metals is a junior (primarily gold) exploration company headquartered in Vancouver, B.C. Its shares trade on the TSX Venture exchange under the symbol CSL.V and on the OTC under symbol CMMMF. The company owns mining deposits or mining rights in the Yukon, Saskatchewan and Ontario. It is currently executing a 2,500-meter drilling program at its Preview exploration deposit in Saskatchewan, Canada, as more particularly disclosed in its March 7th press release found here.
 For more information about Comstock Metals, please see Comstock's company website. Based upon the current trading price in the Cdn $0.15-0.17/share range, the 20 million Comstock Metals shares are currently worth about Cdn $3.0 million. Cash While Select should have close to U.S. $5.5 million in its treasury, for the purposes of my valuation, I am not attributing any value to this cash or equivalents, as the company does need some working capital. Select has no debt other than the usual current trade payables. Based upon the foregoing, on a sum of parts basis, I am valuing Select Sands at about U.S. $370 million (approximately Cdn $500 million). Based upon the foregoing assumption, on a fully diluted basis, the current value of Select's shares is approximately U.S. $3.90 per share (OTCQX:SLSDF), or Cdn $5.25 (SNS.V), which provides a substantial upside to Select's current share price of U.S. $1.10 or Cdn $1.49 (SNS.V). Potential Upcoming Catalysts The following are some of the potential upcoming catalysts for Select Sands:  The current production facility being increased from 600,000 tons to 1 million ton capacity (anticipated to be completed by late Q2 or Q3). The upgrade involves installation of equipment upgrades to the facility with funding from the company's existing cash. Additional and larger production facilities being built, as well as improved and larger rail capacity. Increased sand prices on the spot market. On that note, Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. came out with a note on April 21 that 40/70 mesh sand is effectively sold out, 100-mesh and to some extent 30-50 are increasingly in demand. Q2 2017 pricing for 40/70 mesh sand is now materially above $45.00 per ton. Recognition of Select's value as a producer, which should provide a premium to today's share price value. An increase in the value of the 20 million Comstock Metals shares in the event of a successful drilling program (or other positive news). The development of leading-edge downstream logistic solutions. Uplisting to the Toronto Stock Exchange main board, which I anticipate will likely occur by the end of Q2 or Q3 2017. Additional M&A to increase the assets of the company, or alternatively, being bought out itself. 
 Risks Select Sands remains an early stage company and should be considered a speculative investment. It has various risks, including market risks (oil and gas prices, sand prices), competition, execution risks, equipment failures, litigation risks, lack of trading liquidity, and the various other risks which are set out in more detail in the company Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) filed quarterly and available on the sedar.com web site or the company's website.
Disclosure: I am/we are long SLSDF (SNS.V), COMSTOCK METALS (CSL.V). 
Business relationship disclosure: I was formerly a director and part-time General Counsel for Select Sands until December 21, 2016. I have spoken to Select Sands' CEO Zig Vitols and COO Rasool Mohammad, both of whom have no objection to me writing this article. I am currently a director of Comstock Metals, which is a public company listed on the TSX.Venture exchange.  Rasool Mohammad is also Chairman and a director in Comstock Metals.

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
