Global Tech Industries Group, Inc. to Attempt to Enforce Rights in 
      Contract Dispute with Hong Kong Partner






May 21, 2017 10:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--GLOBAL TECH INDUSTRIES GROUP, INC. (“OTC: PINK”), a Nevada Corporation 
      Inc., and its subsidiary G T International Group, Inc., having 
      previously executed a binding Stock Purchase Agreement on December 30, 
      2016 to acquire 100% of Go F & B Holdings, Ltd., a Hong Kong SAR 
      Corporation and a subsidiary of GoFun Group, Ltd. Corporation, (a BVI 
      Corporation), have been forced by the actions of the management of Go F 
      & B Holdings Ltd to file suit in the United States District Court for 
      the Southern District of New York, case # 17-CV-03727, (https://goo.gl/Js7HYa) 
      in regard to the contract entered into on December 30, 2016. GTII’s suit 
      specifically addresses the issues of contract breach, specific 
      performance, indemnification and fraud.
    

      At the time of entering the contract, Go F & B Holdings Ltd., purported 
      to own and operate three restaurants, and a Central Kitchen for an 
      Online-to-Offline food delivery business. Cheung Yee Man, Elaine a/k/a 
      Elaine Cheng and, Tam Yiu Chuen a/k/a Sam Tam on behalf of unnamed “unit 
      shareholders”, executed and signed the Agreement on December 30, 2016 at 
      their corporate offices in the Austin Tower in Hong Kong SAR. A senior 
      member of their staff, Fong Yat Sing, Vitus, a/k/a Victor Fong, also 
      signed the agreement, as did the Chairman of Global Tech, Mr. David 
      Reichman. Fong Yiu Yuen, Joseph a/k/a Joseph Fong, the project leader 
      throughout the acquisition & negotiation was also present, as well as 
      Angie Liu, executive assistant to Sam Tam, and witnessed the execution 
      of the agreement, but was not a signatory.
    

      Go F&B ceased making payments under the agreement in February, 2017 and 
      has not been heard from since that time, at which time several demands 
      were made by GTII relating to the matter. Go F&B’s failures include not 
      complying with document and corporate material production, failing to 
      provide consolidated financial information, and not complying with the 
      payment schedule laid out in the agreement. Finally, Go F & B did not 
      submit for inclusion in GTII's filings the 2016 PCAOB compliant audit as 
      stipulated, which resulted in GTII having to file its annual report 
      Form, 10-K without Go F & B’s numbers.
    

      GTII’s counsel, Warren R. Markowitz, Esq at The Markowitz Law Firm 
      intends to aggressively pursue all remedies available to it, and at its 
      disposal in this matter. http://www.WarrenMarkowitzEsq.com

Candle Trends for Fall and Winter 2009 
















 
Private Label Candles & Contract Candle ManufacturerGlobalTech –  A Passion for CandlemakingProudly made in the USA    




 

















































HomeCorporate ProfileOur FacilitiesContact Us 










Candle Trends for Fall and Winter 2009 The exceptional decorating and fragrance possibilities of candles continue to underscore their popularity with consumers, and define the key trends for fall and winter. As soon as the air turns crisp and leaves begin to turn, America’s love of candles comes to the forefront.  This year the tough economic times have made candles especially attractive to consumers, whether as an affordable self-indulgence or an appealing gift item. Overall, America’s love of fragrance shows no sign of slowing, and candles fit the bill for both “scenterior” decorating as well as aromatherapy-like relaxation. Nuanced colors and fragrances wrapped up in stylish designs mark a significant portion of the decorative candle market for fall and winter.   Asian and exotic design elements remain popular.  Textured and tone-on-tone finishes -- both for candles and candle containers -- are very strong. Perhaps the most notable trend in candle colors is the growing appearance of rich, deep colors. Overall the color palette is trending to the organic – earthen browns, clay grays and rich reds, deep purples, soft golds, botanical greens and deep blue-greens. Fragrance trends mirror the nuanced colors.  Subtle notes of verbena, ginger, pomegranate, and jasmine are adding a special sophistication to florals, citrus blends and vanillas, while hints of exotic spice like pepper and cardamom are adding both depth and elegance to gourmet kitchen scents.  Press Release by the National Candle Association

 More about CorneliaCornelia is the home to one of the world's largest apples. You can see it is displayed on top of an obelisk shaped monument. "Home of the BIG RED APPLE - Habersham County, Georga" The first industry in Cornelia was a tan yard located on the banks of Tanyard Creek on the highway from the mountains to Athens. During the 19th Century, the area became a shopping center when covered wagons, crossing the mountains en route to Athens, stopped at this tanyard to sell or exchange their goods for leather to be made into various articles.Other early industries were the result of the immigration to the area around 1880 of large numbers of Germans and Swiss. Although many were cobblers, watchmakers, and weavers, most of them were farmers and wine makers. Winemaking flourished until the State of Georgia adopted a strict prohibition law, and the vineyards were cut down to make room for farming.
