The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

SBSMonitoring Database is nearing maximum size

								by KW · Comments (0) 

May
29
2013




Chances are, if you have an SBS 2008 server, it is running very well. But this may lead you to become complacent in managing the server. For example, it is important that you run the SBS 2008 Best Practices Analyzer on your server on a regular basis. Whether that is monthly, or quarterly, run it!
On a recent SBS 2008 server that has been chugging along quite nicely, I discovered that BPA had not been run in quite awhile. When I did, I was greeted with this warning:
The SBSMonitoring database is nearing maximum size
The SBSMonitoring database is currently 3762487296 bytes in size

Wow, that’s nice … except for the fact that the warning message doesn’t tell you what to do to fix it or clean it up. It doesn’t even point you to a KB article.
The rest of this blog post identifies three different solutions to this problem.
 
Solution 1: KB 981939
If you do your due diligence in searching the web, you will come across Microsoft KB 981939. You can read through the KB article for the details, and you may want to give it a try.
When you run their PowerShell script, you may get an error about the execution of scripts. If so, simply type the following command at the PS> prompt:
Set-executionpolicy remotesigned and press Enter
But, wait — there’s a second solution!
 
Solution 2: Replace SBSMonitoring Database
If solution 1 fails, and you go back to search the Internet, you will discover a blog post from Third Tier titled: SBS 2008 Monitoring Database Fills to Capacity.
This solution has you replacing the current SBSMonitoring database with a new clean one. Only one problem: how many people keep a clean copy of their Monitoring database around???
No problem, there’s a third solution, which is the best!
 
Solution 3: Recreate the SBSMonitoring Database
Check out the SBS Blog site for How to Recreate the SBSMonitoring Database.
Simply download the provided zip file, extract the PowerShell script, start up an administrative PowerShell session, and run the script. Voila! It’s finished almost immediately.

All that is left is to rerun the BPA and verify that the warning message no longer appears!
Cheers!

Install Exchange 2010 SP3 on SBS 2011

								by KW · Comments (2) 

May
26
2013




Carl Gray (“Oxford SBS Guy”) has a very good, step by step blog on installing Exchange 2010 SP3 on SBS2011, including screen shots. So, there’s no need for me to replicate what he has already posted.
However, there are two critical steps he did not include: 


Before you start the SP3 upgrade, please go into Services and stop the Windows SBS Manager service.
Please make sure that you DO NOT have Windows Management Framework (WMF) 3.0 installed on the server. Look for KB2506143. You will need to uninstall this patch and then reboot the server before you install the SP3 upgrade.


Susan Bradley has previously posted on both of these issues (see Stop SBS Manager and Uninstall WMF 3.0)
I also offer some additional advice to add to his process, which you may find helpful:

When downloading the Exchange2010-SP3-x64.exe file, put it into an empty temp folder (say ..\Downloads\E2010SP3temp). Then when you double click on the .exe to extract all the files, it will extract the files to this same temp folder. Once the SP3 upgrade is completed, all you need to do for cleanup is to delete this one temp folder.
I highly recommend that you make sure that you have a full, recent backup of your server before you start.
I also recommend that you reboot the server BEFORE starting the upgrade process.
If you are installing SP3 remotely (using RWA), be aware that you will lose your remote connection during this process. DO NOT PANIC. The SP3 upgrade will stop the RDP/Gateway service. Just be patient. Give the upgrade about 30-40 minutes to complete. Eventually you will be able to connect back in via RWA, and when you do, you should find that the upgrade has completed.
If SP3 has been installed successfully, I would suggest rebooting the server again. It doesn’t hurt, and in some cases, it may help!
Finally, Carl says to check that the version of Exchange is correct. Here is how I perform that step:

Open up Exchange Management Shell
Type the following: get-exchangeserver | fl name,edition,admindisplayversion
The build number for Exchange 2010 SP3 is: 14.3.123.4

I sent the following email to all my business clients and friends today:

I hope each of you may be able to enjoy time with your family and friends this Memorial weekend. It’s also a time to pause and give thanks to all the men and women who have given their lives to protect us. I feel blessed and honored to know so many who have served in the military. My own father was a WWII veteran, and was there on the initial landing at Iwo Jima. I still cannot fathom their sacrifice.
Please enjoy the weekend and drive safe if you are traveling.

For several years the SBS MVP’s have been maintaining several Wiki-type “build” documents for the SBS and Essential server platforms, including SBS 2008, SBS 2011 Standard/Essentials, Windows 2012 Essentials and Storage Server 2008 R2 Essentials! 

These documents contain a wealth of real-world and time-tested hints and recommendations, collected from MVPs around the world. They contain information you need to know before, during, and after installing SBS or Essentials.
This link below will take you to the main page with links to each individual build document.

Extend Keyboard and Mouse with Synergy

								by KW · Comments (0) 

May
10
2013




Last August I wrote about a utility called Mouse Without Borders, developed in Microsoft’s “The Garage”, that allows you to use one keyboard and mouse to control multiple computers. And the utility works very great.
That is, unless you also have Linux or Mac OS X computers which you also want to control with a single keyboard and mouse.
So, here comes Synergy which offers to extend your mouse and keyboard to all three environments. And did I say that it is FREE??

I decided to take it for a spin today, and I was quite surprised at how easy it was to install and run it. For this first effort, I only installed it on two Windows computers. At a later date I will post my efforts to include a Linux or Mac workstation.
My scenario: I have a Windows 7 x86 workstation with three monitors, and a Windows 2008R2 x64 server, running Hyper-V.
INSTALL/SETUP FIRST WORKSTATION
My mouse and keyboard that I wish to use is on my Win7 workstation. So I first downloaded the Windows 32-bit version of Synergy and installed it. I designate this as my Synergy “server”.

It then asks what type on encryption I wish to use. That’s a really nice feature as it does provide some protection from anyone trying to intercept your keystrokes. You have a choice of four (4) different encryption modes, or you can disable encryption. For purposes of testing, I chose to not enable encryption.
   
The only other step to do is to click on the Configure Server… button. You will have a screen where you can describe your setup, indicating in which direction the monitor for each of the other workstation(s) is located.
      
 
INSTALL/SETUP ON NEXT WORKSTATION
In this case, my second workstation (which Synergy refers to as a client) is running Windows Server 2008 R2 x64. I am also running Hyper-V manager on this server, so I decided to install the Synergy client to the Hyper-V parent, so I can control all of my Hyper-V guests. 
So I download and install the 64 bit version of Synergy, and install it. This time, when it asks Server or Client, I’ll select “Client”. Then you need to tell the Synergy client the name of the computer that is the “Synergy “server”. 
   
I thought I was all done, but my mouse would not move over to the monitor attached to my server. At first I thought it was a firewall issue, but turning off the firewall on the W2K8R2 server did not fix it. In fact, if you check the firewall settings, you will find that Synergy had automatically added the proper Inbound TCP and UDP rules.

I then checked Services, and discovered that the Synergy service had not yet been started. 

After doing so, I immediately saw that Synergy was communicating between the two computers, and my single mouse and keyboard was now controlling both computers!
