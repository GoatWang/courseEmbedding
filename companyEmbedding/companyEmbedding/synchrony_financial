History[edit]
Synchrony traces its roots to 1932.[4]
Prior to its 2014 initial public offering, which raised $2.88 billion, Synchrony operated as a subsidiary of GE Capital.[6][4][7]
In March 2017, Synchrony acquired GP Shopper.[8][9]
Current operations[edit]
Synchrony is the largest provider of private label credit cards in the U.S. In 2014, the company comprised 42 percent of the private label credit card market.[10] The company provides private label credit cards for such brands as Amazon, Cathay Pacific, CheapOAir, OneTravel,[11] Walmart,[12] Lowe’s,[12] Guitar Center,[13] Gap,[14] BP,[15] Ashley HomeStores,[16] Discount Tire[16], JCPenney and P. C. Richard & Son.[16] The CareCredit credit card, also through Synchrony Bank, is for elective healthcare procedures or services, such as dental, veterinary, cosmetic, vision and audiology.[17]
Accusations of deceptive practices and CFPB consent decree[edit]
In June 2014, Synchrony agreed to pay $225 million after entering into a consent decree with the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The CFPB alleged "deceptive and discriminatory practices" regarding Synchrony's consumer credit cards.[18]
With regards to the practices that the CFPB called "deceptive," it was alleged that, while operating as GE Capital, Synchrony telemarketers had sold numerous credit card add-on services, such as debt cancellation agreements, to consumers without notifying the buyer in an upfront manner of the terms of the agreements. According to the CFPB, in many cases, consumers were unaware that they would be charged for these services.
With regards to the practices the CFPB called "discriminatory," it was found that Synchrony had discriminated against Latino Americans by excluding from two different promotional statement credit deals customers who had elected to receive communications in Spanish and customers with mailing addresses in Puerto Rico. The promotional deals were offered from 2009 until 2012 to customers with delinquent accounts and allowed them to settle their balance with Synchrony Financial by paying some amount which was less than the outstanding balance, under certain conditions. It is not known why Synchrony chose not to offer this promotion to its Hispanic customers, but the CFPB found that this practice constituted "discriminat[ion]... on the basis of... race and national origin."

Synchrony is the largest provider of private label credit cards in the U.S. In 2014, the company comprised 42 percent of the private label credit card market.[10] The company provides private label credit cards for such brands as Amazon, Cathay Pacific, CheapOAir, OneTravel,[11] Walmart,[12] Lowe’s,[12] Guitar Center,[13] Gap,[14] BP,[15] Ashley HomeStores,[16] Discount Tire[16], JCPenney and P. C. Richard & Son.[16] The CareCredit credit card, also through Synchrony Bank, is for elective healthcare procedures or services, such as dental, veterinary, cosmetic, vision and audiology.[17]
Accusations of deceptive practices and CFPB consent decree[edit]
In June 2014, Synchrony agreed to pay $225 million after entering into a consent decree with the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The CFPB alleged "deceptive and discriminatory practices" regarding Synchrony's consumer credit cards.[18]
With regards to the practices that the CFPB called "deceptive," it was alleged that, while operating as GE Capital, Synchrony telemarketers had sold numerous credit card add-on services, such as debt cancellation agreements, to consumers without notifying the buyer in an upfront manner of the terms of the agreements. According to the CFPB, in many cases, consumers were unaware that they would be charged for these services.
With regards to the practices the CFPB called "discriminatory," it was found that Synchrony had discriminated against Latino Americans by excluding from two different promotional statement credit deals customers who had elected to receive communications in Spanish and customers with mailing addresses in Puerto Rico. The promotional deals were offered from 2009 until 2012 to customers with delinquent accounts and allowed them to settle their balance with Synchrony Financial by paying some amount which was less than the outstanding balance, under certain conditions. It is not known why Synchrony chose not to offer this promotion to its Hispanic customers, but the CFPB found that this practice constituted "discriminat[ion]... on the basis of... race and national origin."

History[edit]
Synchrony traces its roots to 1932.[4]
Prior to its 2014 initial public offering, which raised $2.88 billion, Synchrony operated as a subsidiary of GE Capital.[6][4][7]
In March 2017, Synchrony acquired GP Shopper.[8][9]
Current operations[edit]
Synchrony is the largest provider of private label credit cards in the U.S. In 2014, the company comprised 42 percent of the private label credit card market.[10] The company provides private label credit cards for such brands as Amazon, Cathay Pacific, CheapOAir, OneTravel,[11] Walmart,[12] Lowe’s,[12] Guitar Center,[13] Gap,[14] BP,[15] Ashley HomeStores,[16] Discount Tire[16], JCPenney and P. C. Richard & Son.[16] The CareCredit credit card, also through Synchrony Bank, is for elective healthcare procedures or services, such as dental, veterinary, cosmetic, vision and audiology.[17]
Accusations of deceptive practices and CFPB consent decree[edit]
In June 2014, Synchrony agreed to pay $225 million after entering into a consent decree with the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The CFPB alleged "deceptive and discriminatory practices" regarding Synchrony's consumer credit cards.[18]
With regards to the practices that the CFPB called "deceptive," it was alleged that, while operating as GE Capital, Synchrony telemarketers had sold numerous credit card add-on services, such as debt cancellation agreements, to consumers without notifying the buyer in an upfront manner of the terms of the agreements.

Customer Reviewsevine  credit cardine
★★★★★ Aug 30, 2016 by HOWARD JONESI think this bank is uncooperative and poor customer service.I asked to speak a supervisor and was refused.I had a concern about a payment notification I did not receive. No one acted as if they were concerned. I have been a customer withThey suck
★★★★★ Oct 14, 2016 by MarciThink before you get any credit card through Synchrony Bank, I was approved for $800 in credit line for Walmart and paid off both $500 and paid off $230 in one lump sum and they lowered my credit line to $100. My credit score went up and they still drop the credit line and can't explain why they made that decision.  Their customer service sucks. Think before you open anything with them I think they are out to hurt your score and credit history then helping you.Letter
★★★★★ Oct 29, 2016 by HarryAttention all people who receive letters from this bank.  Do not, I repeat, do not give them any information when you call.  They want your social, and phone number and will not admit to anything in the letter you receive.  I gave them the last 4 of the account they sent, and can't look it up, and then they will not give any info unless I give them my social or phone number.  This is a SCAM to get info from you.  They told me I opened a Walmart master card and owe a balance.  Never did, and I never heard of this bank until I received this letter.
Do not tell them anything.  I hope I saved some people from having their identity stolen, because I'm very sure that's their objective.  Now the BBB will be notified and they will be ultimately be ousted as a fraud.   The call center is in the Philippines, not in the USA, so that says it all.dumb and dumber agents
★★★★★ Nov 21, 2016 by pat scanlonI have called three times to ask a simple question and have received three different answers.  This is an important transaction that will involve a lot of money, but they can't give me a straight answer and then they get mad at me for asking for a supervisor!they suck
★★★★★ Dec 01, 2016 by Robert ChoolagianI payed my bill just a bit early,but to early so my patment did not applie. instead of getting a call they already hit my credit score,and now it will take several months to fix my credit score. my credit score was at 690 now it dropped down to 640, and when I called them they kinda yelled at me,and the call center was over seas the asked for a regular amercan then they gave me someone in the us, then they yelled at me which was not nice.  my account was with amozom how are great but synchrony bank is a barrel monkey balls,so im going to pay them off and use my credit card from now on.  bottom line they really suck.Discrimination
★★★★★ 1Dec 12, 2016 by Jim B They have been calling my number and I keep telling them I'm deaf that they need to contact me another way.  In any event, they close 2 credit cards accounts and says I will continue to make payment until they are paid off.I will draft an official letter of complain and send copies to the retailers that uses this bank for store credit cards.Oh, social media s wonderful nowadays.SWITCHING THE RULES
★★★★★ Feb 15, 2017 by janieHAVE A LANDLINE AS PART OF MY TV SERVICE I CAN NOT AFFORD A CELL PHONE, I WAS TOLD I COULD CALL CUSTOMER SERVICE A MAKE A PAYMENT OVER THE PHONE BUT MY  LINE WAS NOT SECURE ENOUGH TO USE MY COMPUTER TO MAKE A PAYMENT, AT ANY RATE THIS IS NOT WHAT I SIGNED UP FOR, NO ONE EVER SAID I NEEDED A CELL PHONE OR MY COMPUTER WOULD BE BLOCKED WILL PAY MY BILL AND CLOSE THIS ACCOUNT BUT NOT BEFORE I GO ON FACEBOOK AND U-TUBE AND ADVISE PEOPLE NOT TO DEAL WITH THIS BANK, ALSO PLAN TO COMPLAIN TO VISA AND THE STATE BANKING OFFICIALSJust Horrible
★★★★★ 1Apr 26, 2017 by Angela MI had been approved for a Toys R Us  credit card with them. I made ONE charge for $ 30.00, and by the  time that everything g was said and  done, I ended up giving them $ 250.00. Every time that I called customer service, I always talked to someone with an Indian-sounding accent.They were rude as hell and acted like they didn't know what I was talking about.  This  company can NOT be allowed to do business with ANYONE again.
★★★★★ May 15, 2017 by They crazy
★★★★★ Jun 13, 2017 by MaryI had a Lowe's card and I was never late or behind , and the other day I received a letter in the mail saying they have reduced my credit limit and I don't have the slightest clue what in the hell they did that for. I have never heard of any one lowering your credit limit after they have raised it. Something sure isn't right with this company shady they are.Horrible
★★★★★ Jul 18, 2017 by Leigh Ann RaganI have used them to buy furniture, and with Care Credit.  Never again.  My bill was due on a Friday.  I paid it through my Chase account.  They did not apply my payment until the following Tuesday.  They then charged me $27 late fee.   I have never been late in the past.  Then since I did not know about the late charge, they charge me another $37.00 late payment.  This is all on ) interest future account.  What a scam, to try to earn interest and fees.  I know that they took funds from the Funture company for offering this financing.  I am very unhappy.Reviews Convinced Me
★★★★★ Jul 21, 2017 by LouiseI was so ready to open a CD with Synchrony Bank at 2.35 % interest and thought it was a great opportunity for me.  Now I just read all these reviews about damn RUDE customer service phone techs and with INDIAN ACCENTS???  And so many errors in their  bookkeeping records??  Ha ha ha!  F..U..Syncrony......There is NO way my 100K or even 50K is going to be given to outsourced nasty RUDE people who do not care about us!  You Lose, Sychrony......and thank you for all the honest reviews from unfortunate customers who already were stuck doing business with them.  If I wanted to be yelled at by RUDE Indian people.....I would be living in Phk*** India!  Go Blow!

      Public Company Information:          




NYSE:SYF 






STAMFORD, Conn. & INDIANAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF), 
      a premier consumer financial services company with more than 80 years of 
      heritage, today announced a multi-year renewal of its program to provide 
      consumer financing for hhgregg, 
      a leading specialty retailer of home appliances, televisions, computers 
      and tablets, consumer electronics, home furnishings, mattresses and 
      related services.
    

      Synchrony Financial has provided a consumer financing program for 
      hhgregg through the hhgregg 
      Credit Card for more than 17 years. Qualifying cardholders can 
      continue to access special financing offers, special in-store and online 
      deals, convenient online bill pay and other exclusive benefits1 
      with an hhgregg credit card for use in 220 hhgregg stores in 19 states, 
      and online at hhgregg.com.
    

      “The hhgregg credit card program has been a key component of our 
      customer experience,” said Kevin Kovacs, CFO, hhgregg, “Our customers 
      appreciate the flexible and convenient payment options that allow them 
      to get the quality products they want and need. We look forward to 
      working with Synchrony Financial for many more years to come.”
    

      A recent study2 conducted on behalf of Synchrony Financial by 
      a third party underscores the importance of financing when making major 
      purchases valued at $500+. Eighty-two percent of Synchrony Bank 
      cardholders surveyed said they always seek promotional financing options 
      when making a major appliance purchase, and 92% of cardholders surveyed 
      said promotional financing makes their large appliance purchases more 
      affordable.
    

      “We share hhgregg’s passion for superior customer service and industry 
      expertise,” said Glenn Marino, executive vice president and CEO, Payment 
      Solutions, Synchrony Financial. “Financing is an important factor in 
      purchasing decisions, and we look forward to continuing to work with 
      this great partner to support its business objectives.”

MARCH 2017 | INSIGHTSThe Future of RetailInsight and Influences Shaping Retail Innovation  The retail evolution of shopping expectations By the year 2030, the retail shopping experience is expected to look dramatically different than it does today.It’s being reshaped, say FinTech pioneers and futurists, by the accelerated pace of new technology and changing consumer shopping patterns. They urge retailers to begin planning for that future now. The following list of forward-looking trends is a good place to start.1. DIY Retail: the evolution of self-serviceTechnology will bring on a new era of DIY shopping—changing how we select and access products and the ways we pay. Self-service will make shopping faster, easier and fun.Retail insights The interactionless retail model  will become more mainstream. No need to interact with a sales associate. With sensors on all items, shoppers can pay with phone or fingerprint and then leave. The traditional checkout process will change. Sales associates will only be there for their expertise. If no expertise is required, there’s no need for an associate. Interactive mirrors in dressing room. Shoppers touch the mirror screen for product info, to request another size from associate, or to order and buy from dressing room. 24/7 stores—no more rules in retail. After hours, stores have a drive-thru window, robot assisted. Order on iPad at window, robot goes and gets item and delivers it.“Time and convenience...technology is really the driver that accelerates that for the consumer.”—Whit Goodrich CMO, Retail Card, Synchrony Financial2. Automation Nation: using smart data to deliver customizationAs customers willingly provide more personal information, they’ll demand that retailers use that information to deliver better, customized products and offers. This give and take will drive customer loyalty in a new world where old-school rules about loyalty will be thrown out the window.Retail insights Retailers will know shoppers well, from RFID in cell phones or biometrics like fingerprint scanners when they enter the store. Retailers will be able to serve up customized products and experiences. They can direct you to items you like and send unique, pop-up sales offers, determined by your profile, to your phone.In-home chatbot devices will become mainstream and more proactive—offering advice on the best brands to shop for and the latest offers.  Third-party, unbiased experts in the form of “digital assistants” will be popular. Shoppers can get honest opinions rather than rely on biased retail associate opinions—essentially an expert network on an app, curated to shoppers’ needs. Smart, connected car and home are non-retail examples of this technology.“What we really need when we’re out shopping in the physical world is to self-identify who we are so that we can associate ourselves with a purchase. You can do that without the use of a mobile device or any device, because we have our own unique physical identity that can be captured by various biometrics, making us the device.”——Wendy MacKinnon Keith Founder, Digital Retail Apps “I think consumers are going to be much more sophisticated, and when you get these digital natives or these born-digital generations, they’re going to look at information for what it is, an asset they’ve created that can be monetized.”——Ryan Matthews Futurist, Black Monk Consulting 3. Brick and Mortar’s reason for being: Entertainment and engagementBrick and mortar stores will exist in the future, but there will be fewer of them. A new model of delivering not only products, but also genuine brand experiences is emerging. People are social by nature and will be drawn to gathering places to share ideas and be entertained. It’s not just about making money. It’s about building trust. Retailers who tap into this trend will be rewarded.Retail insights Show me example: an in-store 3D Printer. Print customized products on the spot. It’s not only convenient, but also engages the customer—who now takes away both the product and knowledge.  Entertain me example: merge experiences. Bring other categories to the retail experience. Put a coffee shop, café, music experience, bar, or complimentary products or services inside the store. It’s a big reason why local “markets” are making a resurgence across America. Teach me example: a craft learning experience. Let shoppers see how a product (like a leather belt) is made from scratch. While the artisan experience is already being used, it will become more mainstream in the future.  Help me example: a retailer app. Pick out clothes and reserve a dressing room from the retailer’s app. It’s both a timesaver and a delighter. “People get overwhelmed. 47% of customers who don’t see an item they like will not ask for help. Service will be important and there will be a need to empower associates with tools that make the experience exceptional.” ——Healey Cypher Cofounder, Oak Labs, Inc.“So, the question then is, if you don’t need to go to a place to get stuff, what do you need to go to a place for? And that’s kind of what we call higher-engagement things: the experience, advice, consultation, fun. It’s moved beyond transactions into real relationships.”  ——Ryan Mathews,Futurist, Black Monk Consulting 4. Less is more: streamlining of brandsIn high-involvement categories, specialty retailers will remain a go-to, but variety will be important. With that said, shoppers are reaching a tipping point around American consumption. Feelings of angst about acquiring too much “stuff” is driving a shift toward purchasing experiences rather than things. Along with concern for the environment, consumers feel that retail must streamline and consolidate in the future. Retail insightsBrands in the future must have a strong “reason for being.”Purchasing everyday commodities through online retailers and automated reordering will reduce the need to visit traditional one-stop shop retailers.   “There is a countertrend around wanting to feel included, wanting to feel part of a community. The social piece is what we believe is fundamentally going to change the experience.”——Kristen Johnson,Futurist, Lowe’s Home Improvement“Retail will be about making the tedious stuff invisible and the fun stuff beautiful and immersive.”——Healey Cypher Cofounder, Oak Labs, Inc.5. Retail on demand: We want it now The evolution of technology is creating a more demanding shopper base—one that expects what they purchase to be instantly available. Retail insightsStores on wheels will come to you. The selection will be smaller, but shoppers can order on the spot and their purchase will be shipped to their house the same day from a local warehouse. Trunk stores, pop-up shops and subscription services will become more mainstream. Shoppers will see a consolidation of the number of brands in this space.Returns will be a snap. Purchaser hits the “return” button on the retailer’s app and and either a driverless car or a drone will appear within an hour to pick up your return. No need for repackaging, either.“Ship to store” option is gaining traction, but the process needs improvement. Often the purchaser shows up at the store and the order is not there.Proof of inventory. Not all retailers update their inventory in real time, causing shoppers to make a wasted trip to the store. In the future, shoppers will see a picture of the item on the shelf before getting in their cars.“Driverless cars will be here long before package delivery by drone. Once you have driverless cars and you have the sharing economy to be able to use the space in those cars to make various kinds of deliveries, I think that’s going to end up being more commonplace than package delivery by drone.”——Wendy MacKinnon KeithFounder, Digital Retail Apps“The biggest disrupter in retail in the future could be 3D printing—footprints to create shoes. Create things in a quick, cheap manner we never could before. It’s mass customization.”——Courtney GentlemanCMO, Payment Solutions, Synchrony Financial“In the future, shoppers will take a picture of the room and add things to it, whether it’s furniture or accessories, change the color of the walls, etc. From a technology and consumer standpoint, we’ll see that retailers might leverage augmented reality, for example, to help achieve this.”——John WilliamsSVP, Marketing Innovation, Synchrony Financial 6. Retail comes to you: bridging the gap between home and storeRetail insights Virtual reality and beyond. Shoppers will have access to an interface that allows them to see what a new sofa, paint, garage door, kitchen floor and so on would look like in their house. Service at home. Shoppers can order tires online and use an app to find mechanics who will come to their house to install them. For example, order tires online and use an app to find mechanics who will come to your house to install them. Purchase on demand. All items will come with barcodesor QR codes, so you can purchase them wherever you encounter them by scanning the code with a smartphone app. You can even do it at a friend’s house.  Shop in 3D. When shopping for apparel online, click on an outfit and a hologram appears showing the item in 3D. Instant try-on. Shoppers can upload pictures of themselves to a retailer app and see the clothes on their actual image rather than on a model.  “Disruptive distribution models are transforming the way things get to people.  The actual process of getting a product to a person is where I think we currently have the biggest pain points to solve and the biggest opportunities”——Kristen Johnson, Futurist, Lowe’s Home Improvement “Why have anything altered again? We’re going to take a picture and upload it. It’s going to be perfectly  dimensioned. It will know your body, type, form, etc. Your jeans are going to show up ready to go.”——Bart Schaller,CMO, Synchrony FinancialA Future Focus on Personalized EngagementToday, retail is at an exciting crossroads of virtually limitless possibility. New data insights, delivery methods and payment innovations can now provide a more personalized experience for every customer. We have an unprecedented chance to exceed customer expectations and cultivate strong loyalty.Synchrony Financial, a premier consumer financial services company with more than 80 years of retail experience, conducted this research to further evolve our retail and shopper understanding, and help our partners visualize the future of retail and opportunities to grow their business and drive customer loyalty.Study MethodologyThe Future of Retail report was developed from multiple research phases conducted January—February 2017 on behalf of Synchrony Financial with consumers and retail industry experts including: Consumers: A quantitative study with 1,016 consumers nationwide, and online discussions and half-day workshops—with participants comprising generational groups 18 years and older, different ethnic and socio-economic backgrounds, and online and in-store shoppers. Retail Experts: Input contributed from Synchrony retail partners of various industries and sizes, representing online-only, mass merchandisers and middle-market businesses.

It’s easy now to access financial institutions at their brick-and-mortar locations, online or on your phone.Financial institutions come in many forms, including local, regional, and national banks and credit unions. They offer bank accounts including savings accounts, checking accounts and certificates of deposit (CDs).
