      Ramius Capital Issues Letter to A. Schulman Stockholders
    



      Urges Stockholders Not To Be Distracted By The Company’s 
      Announcements Attempting To Create The Illusion Of Change
    

      Says New CEO Gingo’s Hastily Fabricated “100 
      Day Plan” Is Nothing More Than A Desperate, 
      Last Minute Attempt To Sway Stockholder Votes
    

      Calls On Stockholders To Vote for Ramius' Two Independent Nominees To 
      Ensure The Company Takes All Actions To Maximize Stockholder Value
    





January 04, 2008 09:52 AM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Starboard Value and Opportunity Master Fund Ltd., an affiliate of RCG 
      Starboard Advisors, LLC and Ramius Capital Group, L.L.C. (collectively, 
      "Ramius"), today issued a letter to all stockholders of A. Schulman Inc. 
      ("Schulman" or the "Company") (NASDAQ: SHLM) highlighting the Company’s 
      latest desperate effort to mislead stockholders. Ramius urges 
      stockholders to ignore the Company’s rhetoric 
      and elect both Michael Caporale, Jr. and Lee Meyer to the Company’s 
      Board of Directors at the upcoming 2007 Annual Meeting of stockholders 
      scheduled for January 10, 2008.
    


      The letter notes that Mr. Gingo’s “100 
      Day Plan” is nothing more than another 
      restructuring plan that has no tangible or substantive metrics by which 
      to hold management or the Board accountable, and questions whether the 
      Board is truly committed to exploring all strategic alternatives.
    

      Ramius Partner Mark Mitchell stated, “In our 
      view, Mr. Gingo’s ‘100 
      Day Plan’ has absolutely no substance and 
      creates nothing more than the illusion of change. Clearly it is a 
      desperate, last minute attempt to sway stockholder votes just before the 
      Annual Meeting. The only tangible aspect of Mr. Gingo’s 
      ‘100 Day Plan’ was 
      a decision to suspend further capital investment in Invision. Less than 
      a week ago in its presentation to stockholders, Schulman advertised 
      Invision as an important part of the Company’s 
      future success and an area for investment. The Company is clearly still 
      trying to find a direction”


      Mr. Mitchell added, “Ramius' independent 
      nominees have successful and proven track records with significant CEO, 
      board, and relevant industry experience. Stockholders deserve a board 
      comprised of knowledgeable, experienced and truly independent directors 
      who are committed to exploring all available strategic alternatives and 
      ensuring that the Company is run for the best interest of all 
      stockholders.”


      Ramius is the beneficial holder of approximately 7.4% of Schulman’s 
      outstanding shares.
    

      The full text of the letter follows:
    

      Dear Fellow Stockholders:
    

RECENT ACTIONS BY THE A. SCHULMAN BOARD ARE A LAST-DITCH EFFORT TO 
      SWAY YOUR VOTES


DO NOT BE DISTRACTED BY THE ILLUSION OF CHANGE


      As long-term stockholders of A. Schulman, Inc. (“Schulman” 
      or the “Company), we have seen Schulman take 
      actions time and time again to distract stockholders’ 
      attention from the real strategic and operating issues facing the 
      Company. These initiatives are designed to buy management and the board 
      of directors even more time to continue to implement their flawed 
      business strategy. The Company’s recent 
      announcement of the new CEO’s generic, 
      so-called “100 Day Plan” 
      and of Ramius’ unwillingness to settle the 
      Company’s third consecutive election contest 
      just one week before the Annual Meeting is unmistakably a product of 
      desperation designed to sway your vote.
    

PAST SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS HAVE NOT LED TO IMPROVED OPERATING 
      PERFORMANCE


      The time has come for this Board to stop using settlement agreements as 
      a tool to entrench itself and to continue its misguided business 
      strategy. Consecutive settlement agreements have not led to improved 
      operating performance. Glass Lewis & Co., a leading independent proxy 
      advisory firm, recognizing the fallibility of past settlement 
      agreements, recently stated that it is “troubled 
      by the lack of improvement in the Company’s 
      operational performance despite the presence of at least one Barington 
      nominee on the Board since 2005.” We will not 
      sit by any longer while this Board continues to fail to live up to its 
      promises under settlement agreements as both stockholder value and 
      operating performance continue to erode. If these settlement agreements 
      were really part of the solution at Schulman, ask yourself why would 
      three of them in a row even be necessary? We think the answer is clear: The 
      Schulman Board is only committed to settlement agreements to the extent 
      that they buy this Board more time for it to rubber-stamp its failed 
      strategies.


PLEASE DO NOT BE MISLED BY SCHULMAN’S 
      ACTIONS TO CREATE THE ILLUSION OF CHANGE


      Consider the following actions that, we believe, the Company is using to 
      influence your vote:
    

ILLUSION #1: The Company identified and hired a “highly 
      qualified” candidate to replace Terry Haines 
      as CEO.
    

THE REALITY: The Board failed to bring in “new 
      blood” to help turn around the Company and 
      instead hand-picked a Schulman insider with no apparent relevant 
      industry experience and who has been a Board member, and therefore a 
      part of the problem at Schulman, since 2000. Since Mr. Gingo joined the 
      Board, the Company’s North American segment 
      has been unprofitable in six of the past seven years and operating 
      margins have declined by approximately 400 basis points despite numerous 
      restructuring efforts. This Board did not run a comprehensive CEO 
      search process.


ILLUSION #2: Mr. Gingo has hatched a so-called “100 
      Day Plan” with a “real 
      sense of urgency” to position the Company for 
      success.
    

THE REALITY: The “100 Day Plan” 
      is yet another restructuring plan that has no tangible or substantive 
      metrics by which to hold management or the Board accountable, and is 
      simply, in our view, another guise under which the Company will continue 
      its failed business strategies. Where has Mr. Gingo’s 
      “real sense of urgency” 
      been while he has sat on a Board that has watched over significant 
      deterioration in the Company’s operating 
      performance for the past seven years? In our view, this “100 
      Day Plan” -- that provides for no 
      accountability -- is nothing more than a desperate, last minute attempt 
      to sway stockholder votes just before the Annual Meeting. It seems to us 
      that Mr. Gingo only feels a real “sense of 
      urgency” to say and do whatever it takes to 
      get past this election contest.
    

      The only tangible aspect of Mr. Gingo’s “100 
      Day Plan” was a decision to suspend further 
      capital investment in Invision. Less than a week ago, in its 
      presentation to stockholders, Schulman advertised Invision as an 
      important part of the Company’s future 
      success and an area for investment. Consider the fact that Mr. Gingo has 
      been the Board’s technical advisor on this 
      product since his appointment to the Board in 2000. Why did it take so 
      long for this Board to suspend capital investment and assess the 
      viability of this product?
    

ILLUSION #3: The Board is committed to exploring strategic 
      alternatives and has a “wholly-independent” 
      Special Committee already in place.
    

THE REALITY: The Company adamantly opposed such a strategic 
      alternatives review process in its initial response to our stockholder 
      proposal on November 2, 2007 and “flip-flopped” 
      its position, in our opinion, to get past this election contest. Despite 
      obvious conflicts as CEO, Mr. Gingo was selected to sit on the Special 
      Committee and only in the face of pressure from Ramius did the Company 
      recently announce that he would not participate as a “voting 
      member” on the Special Committee.
    

ILLUSION #4: The Company is “responsive 
      to stockholders’ interests” 
      and has “implemented numerous corporate 
      governance policy and practice improvements.”


THE REALITY: The only “improvements” 
      that the Company has implemented, such as the redemption of its “poison 
      pill” and the establishment of a “lead 
      independent director”, have been reactionary 
      responses in the face of proxy contests. In fact, the Company was 
      required to implement each of these reforms under the terms of past 
      settlement agreements.
    

YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROTECT YOUR INVESTMENT!


      By voting for BOTH of our highly qualified nominees, Michael Caporale, 
      Jr. and Lee Meyer, on the GOLD proxy card, you empower our
