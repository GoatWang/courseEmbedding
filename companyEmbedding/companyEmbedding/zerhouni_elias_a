Background[edit]
A resident of Pasadena, Maryland, Zerhouni was born in Nedroma, Algeria. Having earned his M.D. degree at the University of Algiers, School of Medicine in 1975, Dr. Zerhouni emigrated to the United States to take up a residency position in diagnostic radiology at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. He went on to positions of increasing responsibility, including Chief Resident and Assistant professor. He then served as vice chair of the Department of Radiology at Eastern Virginia Medical School and its affiliated DePaul Hospital from 1981 to 1985. In 1985, Zerhouni returned to Johns Hopkins as an associate professor. He was appointed Director of the MRI Division in 1988, subsequently becoming chair of the Russell H. Morgan Department of Radiology and Radiological Science, Martin Donner Professor of Radiology and Professor of Biomedical Engineering. Ultimately, Zerhouni was appointed as Executive Vice-Dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine[3] in 1996 and served as Dean of Research and Dean for Clinical Affairs until 2002 at which time he moved to the Directorship of the NIH.
Elias Zerhouni is a highly published scientist in his field, inventor and entrepreneur. His work led to advances in Computed Tomography (CAT scanning) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) that resulted in over 200 peer reviewed publications and 8 patents. Partly based on this research and research and subsequent inventions, Zerhouni founded or co-founded five start-up companies. He founded Computerized Imaging Reference Systems (CIRS) in 1982, where he served as Chairman for several years. He founded Advanced Medical Imaging in 1989, which was later sold to a major public company. He is a co-inventor and co-founder of Biopsys Corporation which became public before being acquired J&J in l997. He co-founded American Radiology Services in 1996 and served as its Chairman and CEO until 2002. He is also a co-inventor and co-founder of Surgivision, Inc., an MRI image-guided surgery company.
National Institutes of Health (2002-2008)[edit]
Zerhouni was appointed Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) by President George W. Bush and confirmed by the Senate in April 2002 and served until October, 2008.[4] Notably, soon after becoming Director, Zerhouni convened a series of meetings to chart a "Roadmap for Medical Research" in the 21st century.[5] The purpose was to identify major opportunities and gaps in biomedical research that no single Institute at NIH could tackle alone, but that the agency as a whole must address to make the biggest impact on the progress of medical research. Developed with input from more than 300 nationally recognized leaders in academia, industry, government, and the public, the NIH Roadmap provided a framework of priorities. Zerhouni also created the Research, Condition, and Disease Categorization Process (RCDC), an online system which reports NIH research investments visible to the public.
Working closely with Congressional leadership, Zerhouni successfully guided the passing of the NIH Reform Act of 2006, which codified a unique funding stream called the NIH Common Fund and new governance mechanisms designed to allow the agency to adapt more easily to changes in science. The NIH Director uses the Common Fund to support a series of short-term, exceptionally high impact, trans-NIH programs. The Reform Act also codified a new NIH division called the Division of Program Coordination, Planning, and Strategic Initiatives (DPCPSI) to administrate the Common Fund. During his tenure at NIH, Dr. Zerhouni led the effort to promote global health and global research and also created the Neuroscience Blueprint, a cooperative effort among 16 NIH Institutes, Centers and Offices. Zerhouni also led major efforts to revise aspects of the NIH peer review system to be less conservative and most particularly developed policies designed to specifically encourage promising and new investigators with novel ideas through the director’s Pioneer and New Innovator programs, as well as other programs throughout the NIH institutes . He led in the development of a groundbreaking new policy which provided public access to publications arising from NIH funded research which has now been adopted for all federal research agencies. During his time as NIH Director, he successful managed difficult political and social issues such as stem cell research and conflict of interest policies. Working with the Administration and Congressional leadership, Zerhouni steered policy makers toward win-win resolutions which involved relationship building during difficult negotiations.
Scientific Adviser[edit]
In 2009, under the Obama Administration, he served as one of the country’s first presidential science envoys to foster scientific and technologic collaboration with other nations.[1] He also served as a senior fellow for the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation from 2009 through 2010.[2]
Zerhouni has served as a science advisor reviewing several national research programs for France, Canada, Australia, Qatar, among others. In 2008, he was asked by the French minister of Health and the French Minister of Research and Higher Education to lead a Committee that led to the creation of the AVIESAN in 2009.
President, Global R&D of Sanofi (Since 2011)[edit]
Sanofi, a global pharmaceutical company, named Dr. Zerhouni as the Global Head of Research and Development in 2011.[6] In this position, he was asked to redesign and lead the R&D divisions of Sanofi one of the world’s largest biopharmaceutical companies. He is responsible for a portfolio that includes a range of therapies from drugs, biologics, devices, and vaccines targeting a range of diseases. His purview includes basic science all the way through development to regulatory approval, which means he is responsible for a multibillion-dollar budget and manages more than 10,000 employees. In this role, he must successfully interact with investors, academia, policy makers, regulators and business people around the world. In this role, he has been successful in bringing to market several important drugs and vaccines with over 43 products currently in development.
Awards and international recognition[edit]
Dr. Zerhouni has advised and been recognized by many world leaders and has won many awards for both his scientific accomplishments and his leadership.[7] In 1985, he was a consultant to the White House under President Ronald Reagan. In 1988, he was a consultant to the World Health Organization. In 2000, Zerhouni was elected to the National Academy of Sciences' Institute of Medicine and in 2013 was elected to the National Academy of Engineering, one of only a handful of scientists which have been elected to both august bodies. He received the Légion d'honneur from the French National Order and President Nicolas Sarkozy in 2008. Zerhouni has also served on the National Cancer Institute's Board of Scientific Advisors prior to his becoming NIH director. He has won several awards for his research including a Gold Medal from the American Roentgen Ray Society[8] and the Radiological Society of North American[9] and two Paul Lauterbur Awards for MRI research. Zerhouni received the honorary title Doctor Emeritus from the University of Algiers in 2005. Since leaving the NIH, Zerhouni has been appointed to the boards of the Lasker Foundation,[10] Research!America,[11] and the Mayo Clinic. He joined the board of trustees for King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) when the school opened in September,2009.

Background[edit]
A resident of Pasadena, Maryland, Zerhouni was born in Nedroma, Algeria. Having earned his M.D. degree at the University of Algiers, School of Medicine in 1975, Dr. Zerhouni emigrated to the United States to take up a residency position in diagnostic radiology at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. He went on to positions of increasing responsibility, including Chief Resident and Assistant professor. He then served as vice chair of the Department of Radiology at Eastern Virginia Medical School and its affiliated DePaul Hospital from 1981 to 1985. In 1985, Zerhouni returned to Johns Hopkins as an associate professor. He was appointed Director of the MRI Division in 1988, subsequently becoming chair of the Russell H. Morgan Department of Radiology and Radiological Science, Martin Donner Professor of Radiology and Professor of Biomedical Engineering. Ultimately, Zerhouni was appointed as Executive Vice-Dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine[3] in 1996 and served as Dean of Research and Dean for Clinical Affairs until 2002 at which time he moved to the Directorship of the NIH.
Elias Zerhouni is a highly published scientist in his field, inventor and entrepreneur. His work led to advances in Computed Tomography (CAT scanning) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) that resulted in over 200 peer reviewed publications and 8 patents. Partly based on this research and research and subsequent inventions, Zerhouni founded or co-founded five start-up companies. He founded Computerized Imaging Reference Systems (CIRS) in 1982, where he served as Chairman for several years. He founded Advanced Medical Imaging in 1989, which was later sold to a major public company. He is a co-inventor and co-founder of Biopsys Corporation which became public before being acquired J&J in l997. He co-founded American Radiology Services in 1996 and served as its Chairman and CEO until 2002. He is also a co-inventor and co-founder of Surgivision, Inc., an MRI image-guided surgery company.
National Institutes of Health (2002-2008)[edit]
Zerhouni was appointed Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) by President George W. Bush and confirmed by the Senate in April 2002 and served until October, 2008.[4] Notably, soon after becoming Director, Zerhouni convened a series of meetings to chart a "Roadmap for Medical Research" in the 21st century.[5] The purpose was to identify major opportunities and gaps in biomedical research that no single Institute at NIH could tackle alone, but that the agency as a whole must address to make the biggest impact on the progress of medical research. Developed with input from more than 300 nationally recognized leaders in academia, industry, government, and the public, the NIH Roadmap provided a framework of priorities. Zerhouni also created the Research, Condition, and Disease Categorization Process (RCDC), an online system which reports NIH research investments visible to the public.
Working closely with Congressional leadership, Zerhouni successfully guided the passing of the NIH Reform Act of 2006, which codified a unique funding stream called the NIH Common Fund and new governance mechanisms designed to allow the agency to adapt more easily to changes in science. The NIH Director uses the Common Fund to support a series of short-term, exceptionally high impact, trans-NIH programs. The Reform Act also codified a new NIH division called the Division of Program Coordination, Planning, and Strategic Initiatives (DPCPSI) to administrate the Common Fund. During his tenure at NIH, Dr. Zerhouni led the effort to promote global health and global research and also created the Neuroscience Blueprint, a cooperative effort among 16 NIH Institutes, Centers and Offices. Zerhouni also led major efforts to revise aspects of the NIH peer review system to be less conservative and most particularly developed policies designed to specifically encourage promising and new investigators with novel ideas through the director’s Pioneer and New Innovator programs, as well as other programs throughout the NIH institutes . He led in the development of a groundbreaking new policy which provided public access to publications arising from NIH funded research which has now been adopted for all federal research agencies. During his time as NIH Director, he successful managed difficult political and social issues such as stem cell research and conflict of interest policies. Working with the Administration and Congressional leadership, Zerhouni steered policy makers toward win-win resolutions which involved relationship building during difficult negotiations.
Scientific Adviser[edit]
In 2009, under the Obama Administration, he served as one of the country’s first presidential science envoys to foster scientific and technologic collaboration with other nations.[1] He also served as a senior fellow for the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation from 2009 through 2010.[2]
Zerhouni has served as a science advisor reviewing several national research programs for France, Canada, Australia, Qatar, among others. In 2008, he was asked by the French minister of Health and the French Minister of Research and Higher Education to lead a Committee that led to the creation of the AVIESAN in 2009.
President, Global R&D of Sanofi (Since 2011)[edit]
Sanofi, a global pharmaceutical company, named Dr. Zerhouni as the Global Head of Research and Development in 2011.[6] In this position, he was asked to redesign and lead the R&D divisions of Sanofi one of the world’s largest biopharmaceutical companies. He is responsible for a portfolio that includes a range of therapies from drugs, biologics, devices, and vaccines targeting a range of diseases. His purview includes basic science all the way through development to regulatory approval, which means he is responsible for a multibillion-dollar budget and manages more than 10,000 employees. In this role, he must successfully interact with investors, academia, policy makers, regulators and business people around the world. In this role, he has been successful in bringing to market several important drugs and vaccines with over 43 products currently in development.
Awards and international recognition[edit]
Dr. Zerhouni has advised and been recognized by many world leaders and has won many awards for both his scientific accomplishments and his leadership.[7] In 1985, he was a consultant to the White House under President Ronald Reagan. In 1988, he was a consultant to the World Health Organization. In 2000, Zerhouni was elected to the National Academy of Sciences' Institute of Medicine and in 2013 was elected to the National Academy of Engineering, one of only a handful of scientists which have been elected to both august bodies. He received the Légion d'honneur from the French National Order and President Nicolas Sarkozy in 2008. Zerhouni has also served on the National Cancer Institute's Board of Scientific Advisors prior to his becoming NIH director. He has won several awards for his research including a Gold Medal from the American Roentgen Ray Society[8] and the Radiological Society of North American[9] and two Paul Lauterbur Awards for MRI research. Zerhouni received the honorary title Doctor Emeritus from the University of Algiers in 2005. Since leaving the NIH, Zerhouni has been appointed to the boards of the Lasker Foundation,[10] Research!America,[11] and the Mayo Clinic. He joined the board of trustees for King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) when the school opened in September,2009.

Elias A. Zerhouni (Arabic: إلياس زرهوني‎‎ ; born April 12, 1951)is an Algerian-born American physician scientist radiologist and biomedical engineer. As a world-renowned national and international leader, Zerhouni is widely viewed as one of the leading authorities on emerging trends and issues in biomedical sciences and medical care.[citation needed] He spent much of his career on the faculty of the Johns Hopkins University school of Medicine. From 1995 to 2002, he served as Executive Vice-Dean of Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and, in 2002, was appointed by President George W. Bush and confirmed by the Senate as the 15th Director of the National Institutes of Health, serving until 2008. In 2009, under the Obama Administration, he served as one of the country’s first presidential science envoys to foster scientific and technologic collaboration with other nations.[1] He also served as a senior fellow for the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation from 2009 through 2010.[2] Since 2011, he is the President for Global Research and Development at Sanofi, one of the largest multinational pharmaceutical companies in the world.

Background[edit]
A resident of Pasadena, Maryland, Zerhouni was born in Nedroma, Algeria. Having earned his M.D. degree at the University of Algiers, School of Medicine in 1975, Dr. Zerhouni emigrated to the United States to take up a residency position in diagnostic radiology at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. He went on to positions of increasing responsibility, including Chief Resident and Assistant professor. He then served as vice chair of the Department of Radiology at Eastern Virginia Medical School and its affiliated DePaul Hospital from 1981 to 1985. In 1985, Zerhouni returned to Johns Hopkins as an associate professor. He was appointed Director of the MRI Division in 1988, subsequently becoming chair of the Russell H. Morgan Department of Radiology and Radiological Science, Martin Donner Professor of Radiology and Professor of Biomedical Engineering. Ultimately, Zerhouni was appointed as Executive Vice-Dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine[3] in 1996 and served as Dean of Research and Dean for Clinical Affairs until 2002 at which time he moved to the Directorship of the NIH.
Elias Zerhouni is a highly published scientist in his field, inventor and entrepreneur. His work led to advances in Computed Tomography (CAT scanning) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) that resulted in over 200 peer reviewed publications and 8 patents. Partly based on this research and research and subsequent inventions, Zerhouni founded or co-founded five start-up companies. He founded Computerized Imaging Reference Systems (CIRS) in 1982, where he served as Chairman for several years. He founded Advanced Medical Imaging in 1989, which was later sold to a major public company. He is a co-inventor and co-founder of Biopsys Corporation which became public before being acquired J&J in l997. He co-founded American Radiology Services in 1996 and served as its Chairman and CEO until 2002. He is also a co-inventor and co-founder of Surgivision, Inc., an MRI image-guided surgery company.
National Institutes of Health (2002-2008)[edit]
Zerhouni was appointed Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) by President George W. Bush and confirmed by the Senate in April 2002 and served until October, 2008.[4] Notably, soon after becoming Director, Zerhouni convened a series of meetings to chart a "Roadmap for Medical Research" in the 21st century.[5] The purpose was to identify major opportunities and gaps in biomedical research that no single Institute at NIH could tackle alone, but that the agency as a whole must address to make the biggest impact on the progress of medical research. Developed with input from more than 300 nationally recognized leaders in academia, industry, government, and the public, the NIH Roadmap provided a framework of priorities. Zerhouni also created the Research, Condition, and Disease Categorization Process (RCDC), an online system which reports NIH research investments visible to the public.
Working closely with Congressional leadership, Zerhouni successfully guided the passing of the NIH Reform Act of 2006, which codified a unique funding stream called the NIH Common Fund and new governance mechanisms designed to allow the agency to adapt more easily to changes in science. The NIH Director uses the Common Fund to support a series of short-term, exceptionally high impact, trans-NIH programs. The Reform Act also codified a new NIH division called the Division of Program Coordination, Planning, and Strategic Initiatives (DPCPSI) to administrate the Common Fund. During his tenure at NIH, Dr. Zerhouni led the effort to promote global health and global research and also created the Neuroscience Blueprint, a cooperative effort among 16 NIH Institutes, Centers and Offices. Zerhouni also led major efforts to revise aspects of the NIH peer review system to be less conservative and most particularly developed policies designed to specifically encourage promising and new investigators with novel ideas through the director’s Pioneer and New Innovator programs, as well as other programs throughout the NIH institutes . He led in the development of a groundbreaking new policy which provided public access to publications arising from NIH funded research which has now been adopted for all federal research agencies. During his time as NIH Director, he successful managed difficult political and social issues such as stem cell research and conflict of interest policies. Working with the Administration and Congressional leadership, Zerhouni steered policy makers toward win-win resolutions which involved relationship building during difficult negotiations.
Scientific Adviser[edit]
In 2009, under the Obama Administration, he served as one of the country’s first presidential science envoys to foster scientific and technologic collaboration with other nations.[1] He also served as a senior fellow for the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation from 2009 through 2010.[2]
Zerhouni has served as a science advisor reviewing several national research programs for France, Canada, Australia, Qatar, among others. In 2008, he was asked by the French minister of Health and the French Minister of Research and Higher Education to lead a Committee that led to the creation of the AVIESAN in 2009.
President, Global R&D of Sanofi (Since 2011)[edit]
Sanofi, a global pharmaceutical company, named Dr. Zerhouni as the Global Head of Research and Development in 2011.[6] In this position, he was asked to redesign and lead the R&D divisions of Sanofi one of the world’s largest biopharmaceutical companies. He is responsible for a portfolio that includes a range of therapies from drugs, biologics, devices, and vaccines targeting a range of diseases. His purview includes basic science all the way through development to regulatory approval, which means he is responsible for a multibillion-dollar budget and manages more than 10,000 employees. In this role, he must successfully interact with investors, academia, policy makers, regulators and business people around the world. In this role, he has been successful in bringing to market several important drugs and vaccines with over 43 products currently in development.
Awards and international recognition[edit]
Dr. Zerhouni has advised and been recognized by many world leaders and has won many awards for both his scientific accomplishments and his leadership.[7] In 1985, he was a consultant to the White House under President Ronald Reagan. In 1988, he was a consultant to the World Health Organization. In 2000, Zerhouni was elected to the National Academy of Sciences' Institute of Medicine and in 2013 was elected to the National Academy of Engineering, one of only a handful of scientists which have been elected to both august bodies. He received the Légion d'honneur from the French National Order and President Nicolas Sarkozy in 2008. Zerhouni has also served on the National Cancer Institute's Board of Scientific Advisors prior to his becoming NIH director. He has won several awards for his research including a Gold Medal from the American Roentgen Ray Society[8] and the Radiological Society of North American[9] and two Paul Lauterbur Awards for MRI research. Zerhouni received the honorary title Doctor Emeritus from the University of Algiers in 2005. Since leaving the NIH, Zerhouni has been appointed to the boards of the Lasker Foundation,[10] Research!America,[11] and the Mayo Clinic. He joined the board of trustees for King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) when the school opened in September,2009. He was also named by the Maryland Governor to the chairmanship of the Maryland Economic Development Commission. In 2010, Zerhouni received an honorary degree from Johns Hopkins University and the Woodrow Wilson award for service to the university and the nation.[12] He is a recipient of the Ben Franklin Medal. Zerhouni was the founding Chief Scientific Advisor of Science -Translational Medicine, a sister publication of Science Magazine of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). He served on the boards of Actelion Pharmaceuticals, a Swiss biotechnology company and Danaher, a US company comprising a family of more than 20 global operating companies in the fields of life sciences and the environment. He was appointed as Chair of Innovation at the College de France in 2011[13] and elected to membership at the French Academy of Medicine in 2010.

The NIH Almanac 









Elias A. Zerhouni, M.D.Director, National Institutes of Health, May 2, 2002 - October 31, 2008










Elias A. Zerhouni, M.D.
Elias A. Zerhouni, M.D., was named the 15th NIH Director by President George W. Bush in May 2002 and led the nation’s medical research agency until October 2008.
Dr. Zerhouni, a world renowned leader in the field of radiology and medicine, spent his career providing clinical, scientific, and administrative leadership. He is credited with developing imaging methods used for diagnosing cancer and cardiovascular disease. As one of the world’s premier experts in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), he had extended the role of MRI from taking snapshots of gross anatomy to visualizing how the body works at the molecular level. He pioneered magnetic tagging, a non-invasive method of using MRI to track the motions of a heart in three dimensions. He is also renowned for refining an imaging technique called computed tomographic (CT) densitometry that helps discriminate between non-cancerous and cancerous nodules in the lung. During his tenure as NIH Director, Dr. Zerhouni oversaw a number of milestones:
Reauthorization demonstrated renewed confidence in NIH
	Congress passed and President Bush signed into law the National Institutes of Health Reform Act of 2006. The agency's third reauthorization in history and first since 1993, it signaled renewed confidence in the NIH mission, its employees, and its leadership.
Initiated the NIH Roadmap for Medical Research
	In September 2003 Dr. Zerhouni launched a marquee initiative: The NIH Roadmap for Medical Research, a new research vision to accelerate medical discovery to improve health, immediately focused the attention of the biomedical research community on new pathways of discovery, research teams for the future, and the re-engineering of the clinical research enterprise.
Development of a new office to improve trans-NIH initiatives
	In 2005, NIH launched a new office within the Office of the NIH Director to transform the way NIH finds and funds cutting-edge research; improve the ability to identify public health challenges; and increase trans-NIH dialogue, decision-making and priority-setting. The office built upon the model of the NIH Roadmap for Medical Research and increases coordination with NIH ICs and external stakeholders to identify research priorities that will ultimately improve NIH’s ability to be nimble, dynamic, and responsive to emerging scientific opportunities and public health needs.
The new entity, eventually named the Division of Program Coordination, Planning, and Strategic Initiatives (DPCPSI), provides an “incubator space” to jump-start trans-NIH initiatives and support Institutes and Centers that take the lead on priority projects on a time-limited basis (5 to 10 years). These initiatives are supported by a Common Fund.
Established an NIH-wide research initiative to address the obesity epidemic
	The Strategic Plan for NIH Obesity Research addresses one of the nation’s most dramatic health changes with a multi-dimensional research agenda. The strategic plan enhances both the development of new research in areas of greatest scientific opportunity and the coordination of obesity research across the NIH. The plan called for interdisciplinary research teams to bridge the study of behavioral and environmental causes of obesity with the study of genetic and biologic causes.
Supported the NIH Neuroscience Blueprint
	Mental illness, neurological disorders, and a range of behavioral disorders are major causes of human suffering and contribute greatly to the burden of disease. The blueprint leverages the abilities of the Institutes and Centers to create new resources, tackle common scientific problems, and train the next generation of neuroscientists through collaboration and leadership.
Made health disparities a research priority
	Dr. Zerhouni’s commitment to eliminating health disparities and disparities in the burden of disease was evidenced by broadening the collaborative relationships developed through partnerships between NIH and institutions and researchers from all populations.
Ensured public access to NIH-funded research results
	February 3, 2005, Dr. Zerhouni announced a historic public access policy. For the first time, the public gained access to peer-reviewed research publications that resulted from studies funded by NIH. Dr. Zerhouni urged maximum participation by investigators, encouraging scientists to submit their publications as soon as possible and within twelve months of publication to the accessible archive.
Dr. Zerhouni was committed to earning the public’s trust and sought advice from the Council of Public Representatives (COPR).COPR held the first ever public trust workshop to inventory and respond to public needs.
	Prior to joining NIH, Dr. Zerhouni served as executive vice-dean of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, chair of the Russell H. Morgan department of radiology and radiological science, and Martin Donner professor of radiology, and professor of biomedical engineering. Before that, he was vice dean for research at Johns Hopkins.
Dr. Zerhouni’s imaging research has led to advances in Computerized Axial Tomography (CAT scanning) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). It has earned him a Gold Medal from the American Roentgen Ray Society for CT research and two Paul Lauterbur Awards for MRI research. Dr. Zerhouni has also received the Special Presidential Award of the European Congress of Radiology.
From 1998–2002, he served on the National Cancer Institute’s Board of Scientific Advisors. He was a consultant to both the World Health Organization (1988) and to the White House under President Ronald Reagan (1985).
In April 2008, France bestowed its highest honor on Dr. Zerhouni. In a ceremony at Elysée Palace in Paris, French President Nicholas Sarkozy made him a Knight of the Légion d'honneur (French National Order of the Legion of Honor).
He has been a member of the Institute of Medicine since 2000.
At the time Dr. Zerhouni left the NIH, he was the author of 212 publications and held 8 patents.

                           This study explored whether microscopic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could help to determine the nature of suspicious
                              breast lesions. After mammography identifies a suspicious lesion, there is currently no reliable, noninvasive way to determine
                              whether the lesion is malignant, which results in unnecessary biopsies. In this study, we developed a special set-up, to be
                              used in a GE Signa 1.5F magnet. The breast was gently compressed and small receiver coils were used to detect the MR signal
                              to produce very high resolution images of the breast lesions. Using these coils, as well as a contrast agent, several types
                              of images were obtained for all patients. There were 6 patients, all of whom underwent biopsies, and the biopsy results were
                              compared with the acquired images

In recent years, nationwide rates of new diagnoses and deaths from all cancers combined have fallen significantly.



Mission and Goals
NIH seeks to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability.



Budget
The NIH invests approximately $32.3 billion annually in medical research for the American people.

From New Vantage
Ex-Director Zerhouni Surveys Value of NIH Research
By Rich McManus







On the front page...






Former NIH director Dr. Elias Zerhouni gives remarks at June 4 SMRB meeting in Bldg. 1. 


Nearly 5 years removed from his NIH directorship, Dr. Elias Zerhouni returned to campus June 4 to offer his views about how to value NIH research economically in an era of flat federal research budgets. His remarks at the end of a day-long meeting on that topic, conducted by the scientific review management board (SMRB), included vintage observations from the veteran of academia (Johns Hopkins), government (he was NIH director from 2002 to 2008) and industry (he is president of global research and development at French pharmaceutical firm Sanofi).
For example, his comment that its not very smart to go to the grocery store in an F-16 [fighter jet] when you can go on a bike, both brought the house down and illustrated the occasional mismatch between drug costs and human benefit; he was especially critical of expensive cancer drugs, stacked one on top of another, that might buy a patient only a few months of time.
Continued...



Admitting at the outset that measuring NIH’s value is a very difficult topic, he added, “I am not here for an academic discussion of how medical research should be valued…[that] has been said today, I am sure, by the speakers you invited. I shared, for example, in Congress that the $4 per year invested per person in the United States since the 1970s on cardiovascular research now results in $2.5 trillion of economic value every year. The problem with these kinds of statements is that you can easily make them, but you can’t easily prove them.”                      
Zerhouni was asked to discuss “Value of Federally Funded Biomedical Research in the Development of Medical Interventions and Treatments.” In a 20-minute address followed by questions, he argued that “the notion of value changes over time” and that narrowly defined metrics tend to be misleading. The most important criteria, he said, is whether dollars are assigned in a way that satisfies societal expectations.  





Before giving his remarks, Zerhouni is greeted by NIH principal deputy director Dr. Lawrence Tabak and by NIDCR director Dr. Martha Somerman and (obscured) NIGMS acting director Dr. Judith Greenberg.

“The product of NIH should be knowledge, not products,” he said. “How do we achieve reduction in the burden of disease and reduction in the burden of health care costs? How do we transform knowledge into societal benefit?”
With the engineer’s cast of mind that distinguished his NIH leadership, Zerhouni said, “I have a simple matrix in my mind,” a series of pragmatic, measurable steps for “transforming ideas into knowledge.” He enumerated four steps in translation, T1 through T4.
“T1 is when you are truly on the edge of understanding some process or disease biology,” he explained. The criteria for valuing work at this stage “will be completely different” from how one values T4 research, which involves applying the fruits of basic research to the practice of public health. “This is getting mixed up in the public debate,” he said.
Zerhouni plumbed NIH history for examples of the interdependency of various translational steps in achieving an acknowledged public health success. It was the long-term Framingham Heart Study that picked up cholesterol as an important signal in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, he recounted. That work led to Drs. Michael Brown and Joseph Goldstein’s Nobel Prize-winning studies that “changed the practice of medicine.  
“How many times has NIH science done this?” Zerhouni asked, rhetorically. In stroke, there has been a 70 percent reduction (that’s T3, change in the practice of medicine) in recent decades. But what has been the value of NIH research when only 30 percent of patients with diabetes comply with their medications and 70 percent don’t, Zerhouni wondered? “And only 15 percent of patients with high blood pressure are compliant with their medication.”
He called implementation, or behavioral, research a worthy investment. “Look at a map of the United States,” he said. “Why are there all these pockets of disparity [in health outcomes] when the knowledge is the same everywhere?”                      
Zerhouni’s favorite example of NIH delivering on its promise to society is the Women’s Health Initiative’s finding, during his directorship, that hormone replacement therapy proved more harmful than helpful to women. “That’s value,” he declared, “and it’s important to quantify that value…This kind of impact is very valuable, and measurable. You can point to lives saved, quality of lives, number of years.”                        





Zerhouni also greets NIBIB director Dr. Roderic Pettigrew in Wilson Hall prior to his talk.


In any discussion of value, Zerhouni emphasized the need to personalize results. The goal, he said, is outcomes that relate directly to societal expectations. In a country where chronic diseases account for 80 percent of health care costs, he said, “federal investment needs to be tied to the societal needs of the day. Otherwise you risk academic isolation, or living in some theoretical realm…Patients measure, better than anybody, the value of research.”                        
Zerhouni said his personal view is that NIH should devote 60 percent of its budget to generate new knowledge. “I wouldn’t go below that, no matter what.”
He concluded with three lessons:                      

“Don’t damage young investigators. Give ’em a chance, and give it early. Don’t kill them with rigidity—4 years of this, then 6 years of that…They end up exhausted at the end of such combat.”


“We have moved away from studying human disease in humans,” he lamented. “We all drank the Kool-Aid on that one, me included.” With the ability to knock in or knock out any gene in a mouse—which “can’t sue us,” Zerhouni quipped—researchers have over-relied on animal data. “The problem is that it hasn’t worked, and it’s time we stopped dancing around the problem…We need to refocus and adapt new methodologies for use in humans to understand disease biology in humans.”


“Budget pressures are going to kill any inkling of innovation.” Zerhouni warned that there are 5 diseases that, if not solved within the next 5 years, will certainly bankrupt some societies.

                          Zerhouni took half a dozen questions from SMRB members assembled in Wilson Hall and made a number of other observations:


Game approaches to compliance fascinate him. “We’ve got to be able to engage the patient beyond a visit every 3 months, coupled with a series of ‘thou shalt nots.’”


The power of social networks, or so-called “influencers,” has been underutilized in public health.


Statins are phenomenally over-prescribed; only 10 percent of the patients who take them realize any benefit. “So 90 percent of what we do with statins is not helpful,” Zerhouni said.


Any consideration of the value of research that does not take the customer into account is doomed, he warned. “You’ve lost the debate if you lose sight of the taxpayers and the patients.”
