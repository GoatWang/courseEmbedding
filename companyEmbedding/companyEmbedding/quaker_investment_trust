WHITE PAPER:
Alternative Investments: Implementation Solutions By Sam Masemer, CFA, CFP® and Alyssa Ballin, CFS
 
The Alternative Investment Value Proposition
Heightened volatility and increased correlations1 across equity markets have investors searching for non-traditional methods to enhance diversification within asset allocation models.  Historically, alternative investments2 have satisfied this enhanced diversification desire, but were only available to wealthy individuals and institutions.  Today, alternative investments are available in a traditional mutual fund format for all investors.  So how does an investor transition from a highly correlated portfolio to one that is well-diversified by allocating to alternative investments?  One approach would be to study the asset allocation models of endowments.
 
Endowments and Alternative Investments
Endowments have utilized alternative investments for diversification purposes for decades.  In fact, the percentage by which they have allocated assets to alternative investments has recently spiked.
Figure 13 illustrates how endowments dramatically increased their allocation to alternative investments from 2007 to 2015.  The primary funding vehicle utilized to increase the allocation to alternative investments was the equity portfolio. During this nine-year period, the percentage of total allocation to alternative investments increased, at times, by as much as 19% while equities decreased by as much as 17%. These allocation trade-offs were made in response to the rising correlations of traditional equity asset classes, which spurred endowments’ efforts to pursue greater diversification within their asset allocation models.





 “The allocation shift from equities to alternative investments by endowments appears to coincide with rising equity correlations.”



 
Diversification Increasingly Difficult to Attain
Approximately a decade ago, a modicum of diversification was achieved by investing across domestic equity market capitalizations, foreign equities, and fixed income.
Figure 24 demonstrates how investors’ ability to achieve diversification in the equity portion of an allocation has clearly changed, as the correlations of all domestic equity market capitalizations and foreign equities have increased significantly versus large cap domestic equities.  The allocation shift from equities to alternative investments by endowments appears to coincide with rising equity correlations.





  “...investing in lower market capitalizations no longer achieves the same level of diversification.  The residual effect is primarily increased volatility.”



 
Are High Equity Correlations Here To Stay?
It is difficult to believe there could be a meaningful decrease in correlations in the near term.  It is our observation that one of the main causes of rising correlations in equities is the proliferation of exchange traded fund (ETF) assets.  There appears to be a causal effect between increasing assets under management of U.S. ETFs and rising correlations across equity market capitalizations.
Figure 35 illustrates the explosive increase in the growth rate of ETFs.  This continued growth year after year leads us to conclude that high equity correlations could be here to stay.





 “By redistributing a portion of the equity allocation to alternative investments, investors could improve their portfolio diversification while potentially creating a smoother return stream.”



 
How Can Investors Increase Their Allocation to Alternative Investments?
Pairing asset classes and investments that are lowly correlated can potentially reduce portfolio volatility.  We have demonstrated how endowments have decreased their exposure to equities by redistributing these assets to alternative investments.
An individual investor contemplating this same course of action must determine what equity risk profile is appropriate to achieve their goals and if they are comfortable with the associated risk.  Figure 47 illustrates the volatility (represented by rolling five-year beta8) of major equity asset classes as compared to the large-cap domestic equity asset class.  The graph illustrates how the highly correlated domestic equity sleeve becomes more volatile as market capitalizations decrease.  Therefore, assuming that most investors have an allocation to large-cap equities, investing in lower market capitalizations no longer achieves the same level of diversification.  The residual effect is primarily increased volatility.





 “Pairing asset classes and investments that are lowly correlated can potentially reduce porfolio volatility.”



One cannot invest directly in an index.  Diversification does not assure a profit or protect against loss in a declining market.  Alternative investments may result in additional risk due to their complexity and possible illiquidity and require specialized investment expertise.  Investments in smaller companies involve additional risk such as limited liquidity and greater volatility than larger companies.

EVENT-DRIVEN ASSET CLASS: A HISTORY OF STEADY PERFORMANCE

Market volatility associated with the post dot-com era of investing has amplified the need for increased portfolio diversification.  Presented below are the most recent twelve years of annual returns of major asset classes that are commonly used when constructing a diversified asset allocation mix. Investors in top performing asset classes of a given year saw them sink in some cases to last place the next year.
Specialized or alternative investments have generated renewed interest as a possible means to curb volatility while pursuing attractive returns. One such alternative is the Event Driven asset class. When measured against traditional as well as other alternative investments, Event Driven investing has delivered relatively steady performance.

Indexes do not incur expenses and are not available for investment.  Index performance is not illustrative of fund performance.  Click here for Fund performance current to the most recent month end or by call us toll free at 800.220.8888.
 



DETACHED FROM DIRECTIONAL MARKETS:EVENT-DRIVEN ASSET CLASS
Event-Driven investing attempts to exploit mispriced securities of companies that are experiencing corporate events such as a merger or buyout, bankruptcy, or activist situations.  Unlike market securities, the effects of market volatility on the price of event securities are all but eliminated.  Whether the market is up or down is irrelevant because this asset class is detached from directional markets.
Of the asset classes shown, none have taken similar or less risk and generated greater returns than the Event-Driven asset class.

Key Definitions
Diversification does not assure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market.
Event-Driven investing typically entails but is not limited to transactions in merger arbitrage, capital structure arbitrage or distressed securities which involves special risks and requires special investment expertise.
 
 
 







Mutual fund investing involves risk including the possible loss of principal.
Before investing, carefully consider a fund's objective, risks and expenses. Download a current prospectus containing this information or call 800.220.8888 for a copy. Read it carefully. Click here for important fund specific risk.

About Quaker Funds, Inc.
The premise upon which Quaker Funds, Inc. was founded is the desire to afford everyday investors access to the same tactical allocation strategies used by professional money managers to augment traditional investments within a holistic asset allocation mix.
Our commitment to this principle is still as strong today as it was the day we opened our doors in 1996. All Quaker Funds are actively managed with an entrepreneurial, hands-on style.
What you can expect from Quaker Funds:

Tactical allocation strategies in a mutual fund format
Products that provide significant diversification benefits
A solid foundation upon which to build your core portfolio that strives to maximize risk-adjusted returns

Our management team continually strives to provide our shareholders with innovative investment alternatives that are focused on the pursuit of superior returns.
About Our Founder
Jeffry H. King, Sr. began his investment career in 1963. His early years were spent on the trading floors of the New York Stock Exchange, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, and the Philadelphia Options Exchange. In 1990 Mr. King founded, and for 15 years, operated a securities trading firm that provided order execution to institutional clients, among them institutional money managers, hedge funds, mutual funds and trust companies.
Mr. King’s tenure spans five distinct secular markets:



Period
Secular Market
Dow Closing Prices For
Closing Price


1963 to 1966
End of 17 year secular bull
12/30/1966
785.69

2000 to Nov 2012
12 year secular bear
 11/15/2012
 12542.38


Nov 2012 to present
Current secular period





Mr. King's experience has shaped his beliefs about investing. He came to understand that profitable investment strategies differ based upon the prevailing secular market and the cyclical period within which that market resides. He saw a need for everyday investors to gain access to the same tactical allocation strategies that professional money managers have used to augment traditional investments within a holistic asset allocation mix.
It was in response to this need that Mr. King founded Quaker Funds, Inc. (QFI) in 1996. QFI has operated continuously under his guidance since then to deliver innovative strategies in mutual fund investing.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the Commission's Public Reference Branch, 100 F Street, NE., Washington, DC 20549-0102 (telephone (202) 551-5850). 
Applicants' Representations 
1. The Trust, a Massachusetts business trust, is registered under the Act as an open-end management investment company. The Trust currently is comprised of eight series (each a “Fund” and collectively, the “Funds”), each with a separate investment objective, policy and restrictions.[1] 
           The Adviser is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”) and serves as investment adviser to the Funds pursuant to an investment advisory agreement (“Advisory Agreement”) with the Trust. The Advisory Agreement has been approved by the Trust's board of trustees (the “Board”), including a majority of the trustees who are not “interested persons,” as defined in section 2(a)(19) of the Act, of the Trust or the Adviser (“Independent Trustees”), as well as by each Fund's shareholders. 
2. Under the terms of the Advisory Agreement, the Adviser provides investment advisory services to each Fund, supervises the investment program for each Fund, and has the authority, subject to Board approval, to enter into investment subadvisory agreements (“Subadvisory Agreements”) with one or more investment subadvisers (“Subadvisers”). The Adviser monitors and evaluates the Subadvisers and recommends to the Board their hiring, retention or termination. Subadvisers recommended to the Board by the Adviser must be selected and approved by the Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees. Each Subadviser to a Fund is, and any future Subadviser to a Fund will be, an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act. The Adviser compensates each Subadviser out of the fees paid to the Adviser under the Advisory Agreement. Start Printed Page 56200

3. Applicants request an order to permit the Adviser, subject to Board approval, to enter into and materially amend Subadvisory Agreements without obtaining shareholder approval. The requested relief will not extend to any Subadviser that is an affiliated person, as defined in section 2(a)(3) of the Act, of the Trust or of the Adviser, other than by reason of serving as a Subadviser to one or more of the Funds (“Affiliated Subadviser”). None of the current Subadvisers is an Affiliated Subadviser. 
4. Applicants also request an exemption from the various disclosure provisions described below that may require a Fund to disclose fees paid by the Adviser to each Subadviser. An exemption is requested to permit each Fund to disclose (as both a dollar amount and as a percentage of each Fund's net assets): (a) The aggregate fees paid to the Adviser and any Affiliated Subadvisers; and (b) the aggregate fees paid to Subadvisers other than Affiliated Subadvisers (“Aggregate Fee Disclosure”). For any Fund that employs an Affiliated Subadviser, the Fund will provide separate disclosure of any fees paid to the Affiliated Subadviser. 
Applicants' Legal Analysis 
1. Section 15(a) of the Act provides, in relevant part, that it is unlawful for any person to act as an investment adviser to a registered investment company except under a written contract that has been approved by the vote of a majority of the company's outstanding voting securities. Rule 18f-2 under the Act provides that each series or class of stock in a series company affected by a matter must approve such matter if the Act requires shareholder approval. 
2. Form N-1A is the registration statement used by open-end investment companies. Item 14(a)(3) of Form N-1A requires disclosure of the method and amount of the investment adviser's compensation. 
3. Rule 20a-1 under the Act requires proxies solicited with respect to an investment company to comply with Schedule 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“1934 Act”). Items 22(c)(1)(ii), 22(c)(1)(iii), 22(c)(8) and 22(c)(9) of Schedule 14A, taken together, require a proxy statement for a shareholder meeting at which the advisory contract will be voted upon to include the “rate of compensation of the investment adviser,” the “aggregate amount of the investment adviser's fees,” a description of the “terms of the contract to be acted upon,” and, if a change in the advisory fee is proposed, the existing and proposed fees and the difference between the two fees. 
4. Form N-SAR is the semi-annual report filed with the Commission by registered investment companies. Item 48 of Form N-SAR requires registered investment companies to disclose the rate schedule for fees paid to their investment advisers, including the Subadvisers. 
5. Regulation S-X sets forth the requirements for financial statements required to be included as part of investment company registration statements and shareholder reports filed with the Commission. Sections 6-07(2)(a), (b), and (c) of Regulation S-X require registered investment companies to include in their financial statements information about investment advisory fees. 
6. Section 6(c) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt any person, security, or transaction or any class or classes of persons, securities, or transactions from any provisions of the Act, or from any rule thereunder, if such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Applicants state that their requested relief meets this standard for the reasons discussed below. 
7. Applicants assert that the shareholders are relying on the Adviser's experience to select one or more Subadvisers best suited to achieve a Fund's investment objectives. Applicants assert that, from the perspective of the investor, the role of the Subadvisers is comparable to that of the individual portfolio managers employed by traditional investment company advisory firms. Applicants state that requiring shareholder approval of each Subadvisory Agreement would impose costs and unnecessary delays on the Funds, and may preclude the Adviser from acting promptly in a manner considered advisable by the Board. Applicants note that the Advisory Agreement will remain subject to section 15(a) of the Act and rule 18f-2 under the Act. 
8. Applicants assert that many Subadvisers charge their customers for advisory services according to a “posted” fee schedule. Applicants state that while Subadvisers are willing to negotiate fees that are lower than those posted on the schedule, they are reluctant to do so where the fees are disclosed to other prospective and existing customers. Applicants submit that the requested relief will allow the Adviser to negotiate more effectively with each Subadviser. 
Applicants' Conditions 
Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions: 
1. Before a Fund may rely on the order requested in the application, the operation of the Fund in the manner described in the application will be approved by a majority of the Fund's outstanding voting securities, as defined in the Act, or in the case of a Fund whose shareholders purchase shares on the basis of a prospectus containing the disclosure contemplated by condition 2 below, by the sole initial shareholder before offering that Fund's shares to the public. 
2. The prospectus for each Fund will disclose the existence, substance, and effect of any order granted pursuant to the application. Each Fund will hold itself out to the public as employing the management structure described in the application. The prospectus will prominently disclose that the Adviser has ultimate responsibility (subject to oversight by the Board) to oversee the Subadvisers and recommend their hiring, termination, and replacement. 
3. Within 90 days of the hiring of a new Subadviser, the affected Fund shareholders will be furnished all information about the new Subadviser that would be included in a proxy statement, except as modified to permit Aggregate Fee Disclosure. This information will include Aggregate Fee Disclosure and any change in such disclosure caused by the addition of the new Subadviser. To meet this obligation, the Fund will provide shareholders within 90 days of the hiring of a new Subadviser with an information statement meeting the requirements of Regulation 14C, Schedule 14C, and Item 22 of Schedule 14A under the 1934 Act, except as modified by the order to permit Aggregate Fee Disclosure. 
4. The Adviser will not enter into a Subadvisory Agreement with any Affiliated Subadviser without that agreement, including the compensation to be paid thereunder, being approved by the shareholders of the applicable Fund. 
5. At all times, at least a majority of the Board will be Independent Trustees, and the nomination of new or additional Independent Trustees will be placed within the discretion of the then-existing Independent Trustees. 
6. Whenever a Subadviser change is proposed for a Fund with an Affiliated Subadviser, the Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, will make a separate finding, reflected in the applicable Board minutes, that Start Printed Page 56201such change is in the best interests of the Fund and its shareholders and does not involve a conflict of interest from which the Adviser or the Affiliated Subadviser derives an inappropriate advantage. 
7. Whenever a Subadviser is hired or terminated, the Adviser will provide the Board with information showing the expected impact on the profitability of the Adviser. 
8. The Adviser will provide general management services to each Fund, including overall supervisory responsibility for the general management and investment of the Fund's assets, and, subject to review and approval of the Board, will: (a) Set each Fund's overall investment strategies, (b) evaluate, select and recommend Subadvisers to manage all or a part of a Fund's assets, (c) allocate and, when appropriate, reallocate a Fund's assets among one or more Subadvisers; (d) monitor and evaluate the performance of Subadvisers; and (e) implement procedures reasonably designed to ensure that the Subadvisers comply with the relevant Fund's investment objective, policies and restrictions. 
9. No trustee or officer of the Trust or a Fund, or director or officer of the Adviser, will own, directly or indirectly (other than through a pooled investment vehicle that is not controlled by such person), any interest in a Subadviser, except for: (a) Ownership of interests in the Adviser or any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the Adviser, or (b) ownership of less than 1% of the outstanding securities of any class of equity or debt of any publicly traded company that is either a Subadviser or an entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with a Subadviser. 
10. Each Fund will disclose in its registration statement the Aggregate Fee Disclosure. 
11. The requested order will expire on the effective date of rule 15a-5 under the Act, if adopted. 
12. Independent legal counsel, as defined in rule 0-1(a)(6) under the Act, will be engaged to represent the Independent Trustees. The selection of such counsel will be within the discretion of the then-existing Independent Trustees. 
13. The Adviser will provide the Board, no less frequently than quarterly, with information about the profitability of the Adviser on a per-Fund basis. The information will reflect the impact on profitability of the hiring or termination of any Subadviser during the applicable quarter.

     Applicants request that any relief granted pursuant to the application also apply to any future series of the Trust and any other existing or future registered open-end management investment company or series thereof that: (a) is advised by the Adviser; (b) uses the management structure described in the application; and (c) complies with the terms and conditions of the application (included in the term “Funds”).

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

About Quaker Funds, Inc.
The premise upon which Quaker Funds, Inc. was founded is the desire to afford everyday investors access to the same tactical allocation strategies used by professional money managers to augment traditional investments within a holistic asset allocation mix.
Our commitment to this principle is still as strong today as it was the day we opened our doors in 1996. All Quaker Funds are actively managed with an entrepreneurial, hands-on style.
What you can expect from Quaker Funds:

Tactical allocation strategies in a mutual fund format
Products that provide significant diversification benefits
A solid foundation upon which to build your core portfolio that strives to maximize risk-adjusted returns

Our management team continually strives to provide our shareholders with innovative investment alternatives that are focused on the pursuit of superior returns.
About Our Founder
Jeffry H. King, Sr. began his investment career in 1963. His early years were spent on the trading floors of the New York Stock Exchange, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, and the Philadelphia Options Exchange. In 1990 Mr. King founded, and for 15 years, operated a securities trading firm that provided order execution to institutional clients, among them institutional money managers, hedge funds, mutual funds and trust companies.
Mr. King’s tenure spans five distinct secular markets:



Period

Dow Closing Prices For
Closing Price


1963 to 1966
End of 17 year secular bull
12/30/1966

2000 to Nov 2012
12 year secular bear
 11/15/2012
 12542.38


Nov 2012 to present
Current secular period





Mr. King's experience has shaped his beliefs about investing. He came to understand that profitable investment strategies differ based upon the prevailing secular market and the cyclical period within which that market resides. He saw a need for everyday investors to gain access to the same tactical allocation strategies that professional money managers have used to augment traditional investments within a holistic asset allocation mix.
It was in response to this need that Mr. King founded Quaker Funds, Inc. (QFI) in 1996. QFI has operated continuously under his guidance since then to deliver innovative strategies in mutual fund investing.
