I started in the  Semiconductor industry in  working at General Precision where I worked in project management, product management and marketing; eventually the company was acquired by a Nasdaq company, Brooks Automation in 2001.I followed up this experience by establishing two Semiconductor companies, both with a focus on Automation and handling of substrates. I co-developed the worlds first Laser shock cleaning system for the Semiconductor industry. One company was acquired while the second had the product designs acquired.I am now a co-founder at Medely. We are the largest and fastest growing provider of Registered nurses and other healthcare professionals to medical facilities. Additionally I am an Importer and distributor of rare perfumes from around the world. I have a passion for everything Sartorial. I appreciate the artistry of bespoke menswear that has been lost throughout the years to mass produced clothing. Time and passion, in my opinion, are the most essential elements to everything in life.ExperienceCo FounderMedelyFebruary 2015  –  Present (2 years 6 months)Greater Los Angeles AreaCo-founder at Medely, a Los Angeles based startup founded in 2015 to disrupt the healthcare staffing industry.

 Khaled joined InterWest's IT team in 2005 and has focused on investments in mobile, cloud and data center infrastructure, including systems, software and semiconductors. In 2016, he became InterWest’s chief operating officer, and is responsible for all of the firm’s financial, fundraising, investor relations and administrative functions. Khaled will continue as a director of Aryaka, DataRPM, InVisage Technologies, Pivot3 and Xirrus.Prior to joining InterWest, Khaled invested in IT companies for Alta Partners where his investments included Synad (acquired by ST Microelectronics), Netli (acquired by Akamai), Celetronix (acquired by Jabil) and Occam Networks (OCNW; acquired by Calix). Prior to that, he spent 16 years in sales, marketing and general management positions with a succession of successful networking and telecommunications startups. He was president and chief executive officer of FlowWise Networks and general manager and vice president, International at Ipsilon. Before that, Khaled served as chief operating officer at Advanced Computer Communications (ACC), and as vice president of marketing and services with Premisys Communications. From 1987 to 1992, Khaled served as vice president of network services with Newbridge Networks.Khaled received his B.A. and M.A. in mathematics and social and political sciences from Cambridge University.Prior InvestmentsVirsto Software (acquired by VMWare, VMW in 2013) NexPlanar (acquired by Cabot Microelectronics Corporation, CCMP 9/2015)  
 I've spent the past 28 years in the exciting world of technology startups, the first 17 in a variety of senior operating roles, the last 11 as an investor. During that time, I've lived through three boom and bust cycles and experienced many ups and downs. I've learned that, with very few exceptions, the difference between success and failure comes down to the quality, commitment, focus and work ethic of the founders, management team and employees, and, of course, their ability to identify and address a large market with unmet needs. As an investor, my role is to be an accessible sounding board to management and to provide advice, encouragement and support. I'm very glad to be at InterWest, a firm that offers the right combination of intelligence, experience, relationships and enthusiasm to help entrepreneurs maximize their chances of success.

Patent number:  8311581

The apparatus includes an input switch to signal a command to the modem to disable the transmitter portion of the modem or to tune the transmitter to a null gateway on the wireless communications network.

System and Method for Sub-micron Level Cleaning of Surfaces



Publication number:  20120247504
                                            

Abstract:  An apparatus is used for removing contaminants from a surface and includes a chamber filled with a clean process gas, a surface positioning device, a carbon dioxide snow spray nozzle, a laser beam generator and focusing device and a process gas nozzle. The nozzles and a focal point of the laser beam are linearly aligned. The surface is held at a desired position and bombarded with carbon dioxide snow and with a high pressure wave to release the contaminants from the surface whereupon the released materials are swept to one side of the surface by a jet of the process gas. The process may proceed with point to point contamination removal based on prior surface examination and discovery of contamination sites, or may be scanned with essentially continuous contamination removal.

Laser Induced Shockwave Surface Cleaning



Publication number:  20110083696
                                            

Abstract:  An apparatus and method for cleaning the surface of a substrate using laser-induced plasma shockwaves and ultraviolet radiation is described. After defects such as organic, inorganic and metallic particles are detected during an inspection step, the substrate is mounted on a motorized stage inside a cleaning chamber. A laser beam is focused into a laser-cleaning nozzle within the chamber. The laser energy generates a laser-induced plasma shockwave inside the nozzle. The shockwave is amplified and exits the nozzle generating the necessary force to overcome the adhesion bond of the defects with the substrate. Coordinating defect locations from the preliminary inspection step the substrate is actively positioned only where defects are present for selective removal.

Apparatus and method for disabling RF signal transmissions from wireless network modems



Patent number:  7813763
                                            

Abstract:  An apparatus and method is provided for disabling radio frequency signal transmissions from a wireless communications network modem when in proximity to sites where explosive devices are being detonated. The apparatus includes an input switch to signal a command to the modem to disable the transmitter portion of the modem or to tune the transmitter to a null gateway on the wireless communications network. By disabling transmissions from the modem, accidental detonation of explosive devices is prevented When the modem is moved a safe distance away from the explosive devices, the transmitter is re-enabled automatically.

Robotic storage buffer system for substrate carrier pods



Patent number:  7039499
                                            

Abstract:  A storage/buffering system for the stocking and/or buffering of substrate and/or substrate carriers in a process environment includes a 6-axis robot. An end-effector is connected with the robot providing an additional one degree of freedom and a mechanism for grabbing and moving of substrate and/or substrate carriers. The robot is mounted in an inverted orientation to a removable service cart for easy removal of the robot to a service area in the event of breakdown. The robot receives commands from a programmable controller connected to control the robot and configured to direct the arm of the robot through a set of movements. Product is loaded in and out of the system through I/O load ports. Product is stored inside the storage/buffering system on a plurality of storage locations, each with product presence/absence detect sensor. The robot can alternatively be mounted directly to the storage system enclosure structure.
