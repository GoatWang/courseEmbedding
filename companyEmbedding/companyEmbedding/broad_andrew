Watch: Andrew Whitman Talks Brand ‘Platformation’ at NOSH Live
Jul. 25, 2017 at 3:41 PM by Meagan McGinnes







 
NOSH Live Summer 2017
Not every entrepreneur wants to sell the business, but for those who do, moving from branded product to brand platform is one way to add value.
Andrew Whitman, managing partner at 2X Consumer Products Growth Partners, talked about the process of what he called – and trademarked as – “Brand Platformation,” and the benefits and challenges that come with creating that kind of broad product suite during a presentation at NOSH Live in New York last month.


When deciding the ways a brand can form a broader business platform, or variety of product types, Whitman said “it always, always, always starts and ends with the consumer.” He advised businesses to consider packaging, ingredients, technology and distribution, as well as determining which potential pillar means the most to customers.
For flax-milk and yogurt maker Good Karma, a 2X Consumer Products Growth portfolio company, it was the “amazing nutrient profile” of flax seed that allowed the brand to build an alluring platform, which ultimately led to an investment by Dean Foods.
“They were hyper-focused on their consumer and where their supply chain was,” Whitman said. “So then Good Karma wasn’t just our name, but became inspiration for everything we do. That messaging led to our portfolio expansion.”
While Whitman noted that platforming a brand can make it more valuable, for brands to see that return “the devil’s in the details.” Platforming without catering to those details, Whitman said, can be potentially harmful.
“[Platforming] is not something you would do on day one, and a matter of fact if you do it too early, it will be the death of your business,” he said. “Just because you can do it, doesn’t mean you should.”
Watch below to see Whitman’s complete presentation.

Andrew Phillips, Ph.D. 







Director of the Center for the Development of Therapeutics 








	Andy Phillips is the director of the Center for the Development of Therapeutics at Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. Phillips began his career by establishing himself as a world-class synthetic chemist. He has developed novel methods and strategies for the construction of complex molecules and has applied these ideas to the total chemical synthesis of some of the most complex natural products known. Phillips then transitioned his research focus from synthetic chemistry towards developing new technologies for ligand discovery and identifying therapeutic leads that modulate otherwise intractable disease targets. He also brings to the Broad Institute expertise in NMR spectroscopy and ion-mobility mass spectrometry.


	Phillips completed a B. Sc. (Hons) and Ph. D. in biochemistry at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand. After a postdoctoral position with Peter Wipf in Pittsburgh, he joined the faculty at the University of Colorado in the Fall of 2001. Immediately prior to joining the Broad Institute, he was a Full Professor of Chemistry at Yale University. During the spring semester of 2009 he was a visiting faculty member in the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Harvard University and at the Broad Institute.


	His research has been recognized by a number of awards, including an ACS Cope Scholar Award, an Eli Lilly Grantee Award, an NSF Career Award, and an Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship.
