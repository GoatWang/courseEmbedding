We estimate that the net proceeds to Medley Management Inc. from this offering
at an assumed initial public offering price of $21.00 per share, which is the
midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus,
after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions, will be
approximately $117.2 million (or $134.8 million if the underwriters exercise in
full their option to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock). A
$1.00 increase or decrease in the assumed initial public offering price of
$21.00 per share would increase or decrease, as applicable, the net proceeds to
Medley Management Inc. from this offering by approximately $5.6 million,
assuming the number of shares offered by us remains the same as set forth on the
cover page of this prospectus and after deducting the estimated underwriting
discounts and commissions. Medley LLC will bear or reimburse Medley Management
Inc. for all of the expenses payable by it in this offering, which we estimate
will be approximately $3.3 million.

We intend to use all of the net proceeds from this offering (including from any
exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares of
Class A common stock) to purchase a number of newly issued LLC Units from Medley
LLC that is equivalent to the number of shares of Class A common stock that we
offer and sell in this offering.

We intend to cause Medley LLC to use these proceeds to repay $15.0 million of
indebtedness under the Term Loan Facility and the remainder for general
corporate purposes. The Term Loan Facility matures on June 15, 2019. As of
August 15, 2014, borrowings under the Term Loan Facility bore interest at a
variable rate equal to adjusted LIBOR plus an applicable margin of 5.50%.


The investment management industry is intensely competitive, and we expect it to
remain so. We face competition both in the pursuit of outside investors for our
funds and in acquiring investments in attractive investee companies and making
other investments. We compete for outside investors based on a variety of
factors, including:

. investment performance;  

. investor perception of investment managers' drive, focus and alignment of 
  interest;  

. quality of service provided to and duration of relationship with investors;  

. business reputation; and  

. the level of fees and expenses charged for services.

We expect to face competition in our lending and other investment activities
primarily from other credit-focused funds, specialized funds, BDCs, real estate
funds, hedge fund sponsors, other financial institutions and other parties. Many
of these competitors in some of our businesses are substantially larger and have
considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than are
available to us. Many of these competitors have similar investment objectives to
us, which may create additional competition for investment opportunities. Some
of these competitors may also have a lower cost of capital and access to funding
sources that are not available to us, which may create competitive disadvantages
for us with respect to investment opportunities. In addition, some of these
competitors may have higher risk tolerances, different risk assessments or lower
return thresholds, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of
investments and to bid more aggressively than us for investments that we want to
make. Lastly, institutional and individual investors are allocating increasing
amounts of capital to alternative investment strategies. Several large
institutional investors have announced a desire to consolidate their investments
in a more limited number of managers. We expect that this will cause competition
in our industry to intensify and could lead to a reduction in the size and
duration of pricing inefficiencies.

Competition is also intense for the attraction and retention of qualified
employees. Our ability to continue to compete effectively in our businesses will
depend upon our ability to attract new employees and retain and motivate our
existing employees.


Company Description
Medley is a rapidly growing asset management firm with approximately $3.3
billion of AUM as of June 30, 2014. We provide institutional and retail
investors with yield-oriented investment products that pay periodic dividends or
distributions that we believe offer attractive risk-adjusted returns. We


 focus
on credit-related investment strategies, primarily originating senior secured
loans to private middle market companies in the United States that have revenues
between $50 million and $1 billion. We generally hold these loans to maturity.

We manage two permanent capital vehicles, both of which are BDCs, as well as
long-dated private funds and SMAs. Our focus on senior secured credit, combined
with the permanent and long-dated nature of our vehicles, leads to predictable
management fee and incentive fee income. Our year over year AUM growth as of
June 30, 2014 was 62% and our compounded annual growth rate of AUM from December
31, 2010 through December 31, 2013 was 31%, which have been driven in large part
by the growth in our permanent capital vehicles. We believe our 31% compounded
annual growth rate of AUM from December 31, 2010 through December 31, 2013
compares favorably with both our small and middle market asset manager peers,
who had an average compounded annual growth rate of AUM of 18% for the same
period, and the 26 component BDCs of the Wells Fargo Business Development
Company Index, who had average total asset growth of 19% for the same period. As
we have grown our AUM in permanent capital vehicles over time, we also have
maintained a consistent presence in the institutional market, with AUM in
long-dated private funds and SMAs growing from $1.0 billion as of January 1,
2012 to $1.5 billion as of June 30, 2014.

Since the launch of our first permanent capital vehicle in January 2011,
permanent capital has grown to represent 55% of our AUM as of June 30, 2014. For
the six months ended June 30, 2014, 90% of our standalone revenues were
generated from management fee income and performance fee income derived
primarily from net interest income on senior secured loans.

Direct origination, careful structuring and active monitoring of the loan
portfolios we manage are important success factors in our business, which can be
adversely affected by difficult market and political conditions, such as the
turmoil in the global capital markets from 2007 to 2009. Since our inception in
2006, we have adhered to a disciplined investment process that employs these
principles with the goal of delivering strong risk-adjusted investment returns
while protecting investor capital. We believe that our ability to directly
originate, structure and lead deals enables us to consistently lend at higher
yields with better terms. In addition, the loans we manage generally have a
contractual maturity of between three and seven years and are typically floating
rate, which we believe positions our business well for rising interest rates.

Although we have a relatively short operating history, our senior management
team has on average over 20 years of experience in credit, including
originating, underwriting, principal investing and loan structuring. We have
made significant investments in our corporate infrastructure and have over 70
employees, including over 35 investment, origination and credit management
professionals, and over 35 operations, marketing and distribution professionals,
each with extensive experience in their respective disciplines.

We emphasize a culture of trust, respect, integrity, collaboration and
performance. We believe that an important part of our growth has been a result
of our ability to attract high caliber professionals and the emphasis we place
on training and developing our team. In addition, we believe our approach to 
compensation, which focuses on long-term investment performance, supports a 
strong credit culture and aligns the interests of employees, investors and 
shareholders.

We have made significant investments in our loan origination and underwriting
platform and believe it is scalable and can support our future growth within the
competitive investment management business. These capabilities, combined with
our active approach to credit management, have helped us generate attractive
risk-adjusted returns for our investors.

. Direct Origination. We focus on lending directly to companies that are 
  underserved by the traditional banking system and we generally seek to avoid 
  broadly marketed investment opportunities. We source investment opportunities 
  through direct relationships with companies, financial intermediaries such as 
  national, regional and local bankers, accountants, lawyers and consultants, 
  as well as through financial sponsors. As a leading provider of private debt, 
  we are often sought out as a preferred financing partner. Historically, the 
  majority of our annual origination volume has been derived from direct loan 
  origination. In 2013, we sourced 1,030 investments, which resulted in 66 
  investments and approximately $842 million of invested capital.  

. Disciplined Underwriting. We perform thorough due diligence and focus on 
  several key criteria in our underwriting process, including strong underlying 
  business fundamentals, a meaningful equity cushion, experienced management, 
  conservative valuation and the ability to deleverage through cash flows. We 
  are often the agent for the loans we originate and accordingly control the 
  loan documentation and negotiation of covenants, which allows us to maintain 
  consistent underwriting standards. Our disciplined underwriting process also 
  involves engagement of industry experts and third party consultants. This 
  disciplined underwriting process is essential as our funds have historically 
  invested in privately held companies, for which public financial information 
  is generally unavailable. Since our inception, we have invested in 242 
  borrowers, and experienced realized partial losses in 12 of these investments 
  through June 30, 2014. We believe our disciplined underwriting culture is a 
  key factor to our success and our ability to expand our product offerings.  

. Active Credit Management. We employ active credit management. Our process 
  includes frequent interaction with management, monthly or quarterly review of 
  financial information and attendance at board of directors’ meetings as 
  observers. Investment professionals with deep restructuring and workout 
  experience support our credit management effort.
