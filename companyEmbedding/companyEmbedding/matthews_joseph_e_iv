Lumens Low-Price Guarantee
In addition to our incredible specials and price promotions, Lumens is committed to offering you the lowest possible price on every product we sell, every day of the year. If you ever find the exact same product advertised for less anywhere, within 30 days of your Lumens purchase, please let us know and we will happily match that price. Keep in mind that shipping and handling fees will be taken into consideration. For example, if Lumens offers free shipping and the competitor charges for shipping, then the total price, including shipping, will be matched. We may require some form of verification of the offer and it must be made by an authorized dealer of the product, following manufacturer pricing guidelines and policies and it must be a stock item. The Low-Price Guarantee excludes clearance, closeout and returned items. Other restrictions may apply, but why not ask? For more information please contact Customer Service.



Orders $75 and more:
You pay no shipping fees (UPS or FedEx ground) to anywhere in the continental United States. Nice!
There are a few exceptions, though:

Special order, oversized and heavy items may need to be shipped by freight, and a freight shipping surcharge may be applied.
Also, some manufacturers require that we add a shipping surcharge to their products. When this is the case, you will see the shipping or freight charge listed on the product page.


Orders less than $75:
Orders that do not meet the $75 threshold are charged a $9.99 flat rate shipping fee.
There are a few exceptions, though:
Hawaii, Alaska & Puerto Rico
If you are shipping to Hawaii, Alaska or Puerto Rico, Lumens offers discounted standard shipping by UPS or FedEx standard shipping. The actual shipping charge (which at minimum is $24) will be calculated during checkout and is based on the order total.
Canada
When shipping to Canada, Lumens only uses Expedited and Express Saver which includes the brokerage fees in the shipping charge. This total does not include the Goods and Services Tax (GST) or customs duties which will be due upon receipt of delivery.
NOTE: Canadian orders will require additional lead times for these vendors: Blomus, Fanimation, Kichler, Marset and Minka Group (Minka Aire, Minka-Lavery, Metropolitan and George Kovacs).
You will receive an email with the adjusted estimated ship date within 2 business days of submitting your order.
