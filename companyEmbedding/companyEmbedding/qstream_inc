Qstream, Inc. Key Developments

Qstream Partners with Veeva to Help Life Sciences Organizations Maximize Crm Investment Potential
Jun 5 17
Qstream announced at the 46th LTEN Annual Conference the integration of its platform with Veeva CRM, an end-to-end CRM solution for the pharmaceutical and life sciences industries. Qstream's two-way integration with Veeva allows customers to leverage data insights to better measure, manage and coach sales performance, ensuring that every medical rep interaction with physicians is tailored for maximum impact. The CRM system for life sciences and pharmaceutical companies, Veeva CRM is used by 60% of the globe's medical sales reps to improve collaboration with healthcare professionals and help life sciences companies deliver more relevant, tailored information to physicians. With this integration, sales management can correlate Qstream data with Veeva data, instantly identifying links between proficiency, engagement and the Veeva KPIs they use to manage their business. When supplementing CRM data with relevant proficiency and engagement scores, managers get a predictive, real-time view of sales performance by individual, team or region. From within Veeva CRM, organizations can benefit from: Integrated Experience: Reps/participants respond to daily Qstream challenges directly in their Veeva CRM environment. Front-line managers can access the Qstream Coaching Hub, including sales fluency heat maps, targeted coaching actions, competency observations and ratings, and optional video scenarios submitted by their team. Reporting and Dashboards: Combining Veeva CRM data with a real-time view of medical sales capabilities " by individual, team or region " helps transform how Veeva is used to manage and measure sales performance and activity. Coaching and Enrollment Triggers: Customer-defined, conditional rules initiate targeted coaching actions and automated enrollment in Qstream challenges, which provide additional development support. Role Hierarchy Synchronization: Organizations reduce time spent keeping reporting lines up to date, which streamlines system management at scale. Single Sign-On: Participants and managers log-in just once to access Veeva and Qstream concurrently, improve engagement with both systems, and strengthen enterprise IT security controls.

Qstream in 2 Minutes




Qstream in 2 Minutes Video Transcript:
Companies spend millions building their sales and marketing funnels. The only thing missing are results. That’s because converting prospects to customers requires your salespeople to add value beyond just presentations and product facts.
They must be ready to talk about the problems that buyers actually have in markets that are constantly changing.
Qstream can help. Driven by science and data, Qstream offers an entirely new, proven approach to helping sales teams keep pace in just minutes a day.
Here’s how:
Qstream keeps things simple and engaging for your busy sales teams while reinforcing the capabilities that matter most. Responding to short text- or video-based challenge scenarios pushed to their mobile device or CRM.
Reps practice the best approaches to sales challenges and gain points for demonstrating their knowledge. Short explanations featuring rich media and links optimize your content investments and drive consistent messaging.
The platform’s data-driven Coaching Hub engages sales managers and field coaches in the process, too. A graphical dashboard combines system-generated insights with single-click observations and CRM triggers that instantly identify who and what to coach.
Sales leaders can view capabilities data in unlimited ways with real-time heat maps, progress trends, team comparisons, and coaching activity reports.
An end-to-end solution, Qstream closes the loop on revenue impact by combining capabilities data with any sales metric, giving you a predictive view of reps’ performance today not at the end of the quarter when it’s too late.
Whether your sales team is 50 or 5,000, Qstream delivers what you need at scale to prepare them for interactions that win customers.
And, with all the security and reliability that IT demands, Qstream is easy to deploy in 18 languages. See why the biggest, most innovative sales teams rely on Qstream. Request a live demo today.

Javascript is required to view this map.Company Overview 
	Developed at Harvard, Qstream is a radically new sales performance platform used by top brands to ignite high-performance sales teams. Combining science and data analytics in an easy-to-use mobile solution, Qstream is the first and only proven approach to building smarter, more confident sales teams at scale – with impact to the bottom line. 
	In minutes a day, sales reps use Qstream to respond to short scenario-based challenges pushed to their mobile device, allowing them to apply their knowledge and practice best approaches to selling. The platform’s analytics engine synthesizes response data to provide insights into team capabilities via a data-driven Coaching HubÔ that combines system-generated proficiency scores with observed competency and confidence ratings. Integration with CRM systems such as Salesforce.com allows users to correlate Qstream data against any KPI for triggered coaching actions and a richer picture of sales readiness.
	Today Qstream is used by 14 of the world’s top 15 pharmaceutical companies, as well as leaders in technology and financial services. The company is based outside Boston, MA, with additional locations in San Francisco, Oregon, UK, and Dublin, Ireland.

What is it like to work at your company in terms of your culture? 



	At Qstream, we prize our core values above all else. It’s more than words on paper; we put these values into action every day, and it shows in whom we hire, reward and promote. These values include passion, curiosity, intelligence and adaptability. We also value the drive to get stuff done, delight customers and have fun. It’s in our DNA. We take our work very seriously, but we don’t take ourselves too seriously. When you get to know us, you’ll see that we mean it. 

	Sure, everyone loves our extra vacation time, playing Xbox in the game room and our well-stocked kitchen. However, at the end of the day, Qstream work is meaningful work – and that’s the best perk. Our management team fosters a culture that enables the delivery of truly great products, inspires innovation, and stokes the passion of every employee. After all, they've done it before! With years of experience building world-class startups, our team has attracted some of the best talent and the support of top-notch investors. In late 2014, the company completed its Series A funding with a total investment of $6.85M from some of today's most progressive venture firms. 

 What’s the best way to get a job at Qstream?

	We’re looking for our next hire – someone who’s great for the role, great for Qstream and looking to apply and stretch their skills. We encourage interested candidates to submit their resumes and cover letters online to theQstream Career page or visit our VentureFizz BIZZpage. If you know someone who is currently an employee at Qstream, the Employee Referral Program is a great way to connect regarding job opportunities. The company’s External Referral Program lets you refer a candidate, who if hired, gets you a $500 referral bonus. 

What can someone expect during the interview process?

	The pace moves quickly around here, which means we have to be nimble, both in how we work and how we hire. We know your life is just as busy. We respect the process, and you can expect us to review cover letters and resumes quickly. We will not leave you hanging or disappear into a black hole. If we see a potential match, we’ll quickly schedule a phone call because nothing beats a conversation. If everyone – including you – likes what they are hearing, we’ll invite you to meet the team. Interviews often include an opportunity to join the team for lunch so that you can make sure we are a good fit. We understand that the candidate’s time is just as important as the hiring manager’s time. We strive to move the interview process along. We review applications daily. Typically, if there is a match, we start with a phone screen. If a mutual interest is determined, the candidate is asked to come in for a face-to-face interview. The candidate tours our office, interviews with the hiring manager, meets team members, and receives an in-depth perspective on the job and the company. You get to know us, and we get to know you. Duncan Lennox, our CEO, talks to all our best candidates before an offer is extended.

What can people expect over the course of their career at Qstream?

	Growth is at the heart of everything we do and everything you can expect from your Qstream career. Whether you are a recent graduate, new to the job market or have years of experience under your belt, we have a variety of rewarding opportunities to fit your talents and interests. We're committed to your success through training and networking programs designed to support lifelong personal and professional development. Our culture is designed to support meaningful work. Regardless of where you are in your career at Qstream, expect to solve problems, improve your skills and have eureka moments. Everyone at Qstream is fully engaged and empowered to make things happen. There is never a boring day, much less a typical day. In fact, we hope you never have one!    

Are there any favorite activities that the employees do outside of the office? 



		Qstream loves being part of all kinds of activities!

		Summer outing at Crane's Beach, a clam bake with employees and their families

		J.P. Morgan Corporate Challenge in Boston, supporting the Inner-City Scholarship Fund

		Team Outings: bowling, game night, pick-up basketball, fitness challenge

		Pub trivia nights led by our CEO, Duncan Lennox

		Holiday Party

		…And much more!

Are there any fun facts or unique stories that you can share about Qstream or individuals that work there?

	Did you know that Qstream is used by hundreds of thousands of sales reps in enterprise accounts across 144 countries, including more than 7,500 users in the Boston area? Qstream’s global customers include technology and financial services giants, including EMC, Xerox, and Wells Fargo as well as 12 of the world’s top 15 pharmaceutical companies, such as Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer. Our Boston-based customers include athenahealth, Nuance, Hologic, Biogen Idec, Boston Scientific, and Boston Children’s Hospital, to name just a few.

	But our best stories come from our individual employees!

Duncan Lennox, CEO and Co-Founder: “Like all of us, I had a choice about where to come to work. I joined Qstream in 2008 because I believed that we could do something truly game changing, as I still do today. I never tire of seeing the amazing difference we are making in the work life of our customers, the influence of our brand around the world, and the positive comments and accolades that continue to come our way as a result. We’re seeking the best and brightest to help fulfill our growth plans. I guarantee the journey will be challenging, rewarding…and most importantly, fun!

Mark Collins, Business Development Team Lead: Mark was Qstream’s first business development representative (BDR) and joined the team in late 2013. In this role, Mark is on the frontlines with prospects and has the job of quickly introducing our value proposition to land a meeting: “It's amazing how much our prospects and customers love the product. It makes it a lot easier to pitch to prospects when you know the product is something that will actually help them do their job better and that they are going to enjoy it. I got just what I was looking for at Qstream.” Mark did such a great job in his role, within six months, he was promoted to lead the global BDR team.

Bridget Jay, Client Services Manager: Bridget got a taste for implementing software as an internal project manager with her former employer. She was hooked and wanted more. Making sure that customers are truly delighted with Qstream comes as natural as breathing for Bridget. Her passion for helping others – whether they are clients, co-workers, friends, and family – is evident as soon as you meet her. “The best part about working at Qstream is that every day is different. Some days are spent getting to know new clients and understanding their challenges so that we are able to help them implement solutions. Other days are spent providing support and assistance to existing clients so that they can be more successful.” Harvard Business Review contributor, Scott Edinger, highlighted Bridget’s amazing Qstream contributions in a Forbes blog earlier this year – discussing the benefits of employees who act like business owners.  

What TV or movie would best describe the working environment and employees at Qstream?

	A cross between the “Incredibles” movie – where everyone is an undercover superhero itching to take action, and the “Lego” movie, where given the opportunity, everyone is an awesome “MasterBuilder.” At Qstream, we understand that everyone is capable of building extraordinary things. Individual success is linked to team success. No matter what role you are applying for, we are looking for superheroes looking to contribute and help make everyone around them better.   

Do you have any unique benefits or perks? 



	We’ve learned it can be challenging to find the right person for our team, so when we find our next inspiring coworker, we celebrate! We share our excitement by sending every new hire a little Mad Money – each new Qstreamer receives $100 before their start date so they can celebrate, too! As we grow, we also continue to enhance other benefits, such as four weeks of vacation for everyone – from day one.

	Other exceptional benefits and perks, include:

		Game Room – Xbox, putting green, and more

		Good Eats – Coffee, drinks, healthy and sweet snacks

		Health Benefits – Dental, vision, medical care on day one of your hire; Health Reimbursement Account (HRA), Flexible Spending Account (FSA)

		Compensation – Competitive salaries, 401(k)

		Time Off – Paid vacation and 11 holidays

		Company Events – Holiday parties, team outings, fitness contests

		Career Growth – Networking opportunities, career tracks, international exposure

What’s on tap or in your fridge?

	Our kitchen comes fully loaded with lots of goodies – from cereal and waffles to a rotating selection of microbrews. In summer, you’ll find popsicles, but every day, you’ll find chocolate.  Every Wednesday, lunch is on us.
