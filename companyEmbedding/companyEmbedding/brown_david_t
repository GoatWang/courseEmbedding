This T-shirt makes for a great Bar or Bat Mitzvah gift.

History[edit]
David Brown[edit]
Founded in 1860 as a pattern manufacturing company by 1873 David Brown had begun to concentrate on gear systems and by 1898 was specialising in machine-cut gears.
The company moved in 1902 to Park Works at Huddersfield, where the firm is based today.
David Brown & Sons, Huddersfield (the Huddersfield group)[edit]
When David Brown died in 1903, his sons Percy and Frank took over and began the manufacture of gears, complete gear units, gear cutting machines, tools and equipment, bearings and shafts and worm drive gears. Its foundry makes steel and non-ferrous castings. Including motor vehicles, aircraft, ships as well as a wide range of British industry.[1]
In 1951 the Huddersfield and Tractor groups freehold land and buildings at Huddersfield, Penistone and Meltham were on sites covering about 150 acres. Another 260,000 square feet of floor space were held under lease.[1]
Gearing manufactured by David Brown Ltd. and powered by electric motors manufactured by Brook Crompton (Electric) Motors, whose factory was in Brockholes are used to rotate the top of the BT Tower in London.[2]
From 1908 to 1915 David Brown and Sons designed and developed and made the Valveless car under engineer Frederick Tasker Burgess (1879-1929) later chief engineer at Humber and later still one of the team that developed the first 3-litre Bentley engine.
In 1913 they established a joint venture in America with Timken for Radicon worm drive units. By the end of World War I the workforce had increased from 200 to 1000 as they started building propulsion units for warships, and drive mechanisms for armaments. By 1921 the company was the largest worm gear manufacturer in the world.[3]
In 1930 the company took over P.R. Jackson Ltd, another local firm of gear manufacturers and steel founders. Percy's eldest son (Sir David Brown) became managing director in 1931 following Percy's death in June that year. W S Roe was appointed joint managing director with David but he died in April 1933. Percy was appointed chairman. The firm formed another overseas joint venture with Richardson Gears (Pty) Ltd of Footscray, Victoria, Australia in 1934. In 1934 the company moved into an old Silk Mill on a site at Meltham, on the south side of Huddersfield. Brown started building tractors with Harry Ferguson there in 1936.
The company obtained a patent for a tank transmission using controlled differential steering system, known as the Merritt-Brown system, devised by Dr. H. E. Merritt, Director of Tank Design at Woolwich Arsenal, in 1935.[3] The first vehicle to use this system was the Churchill tank, and it was subsequently used on the Centurion tank and the Conqueror tank, as well as the Tortoise heavy tank.
David Brown Tractors Group[edit]




David Brown Tractor Factory Meltham Mills 1981


Personally controlled since its inception by David Brown (1904–1993) the first venture into tractor production was in a joint project with Harry Ferguson in 1936 building the Ferguson-Brown tractor. David Brown became one of the biggest British tractor manufactures in the post war period, with a major manufacturing plant at Meltham, West Yorkshire England. The company broke new ground which others were only to follow later, but being a pioneering company ultimately lead to their downfall. The Ferguson-Brown had a lot of innovative features, including the use of cast alloy for many the components, which was light but prone to damage. The Ferguson-Brown used a Coventry Climax engine for the first 350 tractors. Browns developed their own engine which was fitted to subsequent production. Total production was 1350 + 1 built from parts in 1940 after production finished.[4]

Brown and Ferguson disagreed over tractor design details in the late 30s, which led David Brown to design his own version, the VAK1, in secret. This was launched at the 1939 Royal Show.[5] Ferguson split away from Brown and joined up with Henry Ford in 1938, after a 'handshake' agreement, to allow his 'Ferguson System' three-point linkage to be used on the Fordson N tractors. That agreement was eventually terminated by Ford's grandson in 1947 and Ferguson again split away to form Ferguson Tractors in 1948.[6]
During the Second World War Brown's new heavier tractor, the VAK1, was produced, with over 7,700 units eventually sold, making Brown a wealthy man. It is said the David Brown Tractor is the only one to be built onto a sturdy cast iron chassis where other makers bolt components together to form a chassis-less construction which is weaker, Brown also built aircraft tugs (VIG) for the Royal Air Force and for pulling the bomb trolleys used to re-arm aircraft. These tugs are distinctive, with truck like tyres, wrap round body work and HD bumpers front and rear, some being fitted with winches. In 1942 Brown started building a tracklayer version, the DB4. The DB4 was built for the army engineers and solved some of the problems found with the VTK, and got round an embargo on imported machines for military use. It was powered by a 38 h.p. Dorman diesel and a five speed gearbox. The DB4 was replaced in 1950 by the Trackmaster 30.

The tractors division took over the Lancashire firm of Harrison, McGregor & Guest Ltd, who produced the Albion brand of agricultural machinery to complement the tractor product line. After the takeover the company's badge was modified to incorporate the white rose of Yorkshire and the red rose of Lancashire. The Tractors division had ten subsidiaries around the world. At one stage 80% of production was exported. Sales were handled by 2,508 agents in 100 countries.[7]A worldwide recession saw tractor sales slump, and after braving the storm and with the debt of a brand new building and production line to finance, it was inevitable that the company was put up for sale, bought by JI Case of America; all hope to see the factory prosper was dashed when it was announced that survival was a competition between Huddersfield and the international Tractor plant in Doncaster, with the odds stacked in the latter's favour, especially with access to the motorway network on the doorstep. The Meltham factory ended production and a respected British name was erased.
Tractor Group's Lagonda and Aston Martin[edit]
In 1947, Brown saw a classified advertisement in The Times, offering for sale a High Class Motor Business. Brown acquired Aston Martin for £20,500 and, in the following year, Lagonda for £52,500, followed by the coachbuilder Tickford in 1955. He subsequently concentrated all the Aston Martin manufacturing at the Tickford premises in Newport Pagnell. The David Brown years led to the legendary DB series of Aston Martins, which were featured in some 007 James Bond films.
David Brown also had connections with Vosper shipbuilding, Delapina and Radyne machinery.
Both car companies were sold in 1972 to Company Developments Limited, when Aston Martin was in financial trouble, for a nominal £100.
Sale of David Brown Tractors to Case 1972[edit]
In 1972 the tractor operations were sold to Tenneco Inc. of America, who owned the J.I. Case tractor company. The sale was due to a combination of a reduction in the UK tractor market, increased product development costs, the need to meet new regulations on health and safety, and increased competition from imported machinery. Case applied the David Brown name and branding to some of its own tractor models in the UK market until the early 1980s before abandoning it in favour of the Case IH brand.
Sale by David Brown family – management buyout 1990[edit]
In 1990 the David Brown family disposed of its stake to the business's management. They then floated David Brown as a public company in 1993. David Brown was acquired by Textron Inc. in October 1998.
This business, trading as David Brown Engineering Ltd and headquartered in Huddersfield, remains a supplier of heavy transmission systems for industrial, defence, railway and marine applications. These include transmissions for the British Challenger 2 tanks and American Bradley Fighting Vehicles.[8] Railway transmissions are produced for their Chinese branch 'David Brown China', in a joint partnership called 'Jiangsu Shinri David Brown Gear Systems' at a factory in Changzhou near Shanghai.[9]
Sale by Textron 2008[edit]
In September 2008 it was announced that David Brown Gear systems and associated companies, David Brown Hydraulics based in Poole in Dorset, Maag Pumps of Switzerland, and Union Pumps of the USA were to be sold to Clyde Blowers of Scotland – owned by entrepreneur Jim McColl – in a £368 million deal.[10]
2016 David Brown was merged with Santasalo to form David Brown Santasalo. The joint company remains in the hands of Clyde Blowers Capital.

History[edit]
David Brown[edit]
Founded in 1860 as a pattern manufacturing company by 1873 David Brown had begun to concentrate on gear systems and by 1898 was specialising in machine-cut gears.
The company moved in 1902 to Park Works at Huddersfield, where the firm is based today.
David Brown & Sons, Huddersfield (the Huddersfield group)[edit]
When David Brown died in 1903, his sons Percy and Frank took over and began the manufacture of gears, complete gear units, gear cutting machines, tools and equipment, bearings and shafts and worm drive gears. Its foundry makes steel and non-ferrous castings. Including motor vehicles, aircraft, ships as well as a wide range of British industry.[1]
In 1951 the Huddersfield and Tractor groups freehold land and buildings at Huddersfield, Penistone and Meltham were on sites covering about 150 acres. Another 260,000 square feet of floor space were held under lease.[1]
Gearing manufactured by David Brown Ltd. and powered by electric motors manufactured by Brook Crompton (Electric) Motors, whose factory was in Brockholes are used to rotate the top of the BT Tower in London.[2]
From 1908 to 1915 David Brown and Sons designed and developed and made the Valveless car under engineer Frederick Tasker Burgess (1879-1929) later chief engineer at Humber and later still one of the team that developed the first 3-litre Bentley engine.
In 1913 they established a joint venture in America with Timken for Radicon worm drive units. By the end of World War I the workforce had increased from 200 to 1000 as they started building propulsion units for warships, and drive mechanisms for armaments. By 1921 the company was the largest worm gear manufacturer in the world.[3]
In 1930 the company took over P.R. Jackson Ltd, another local firm of gear manufacturers and steel founders. Percy's eldest son (Sir David Brown) became managing director in 1931 following Percy's death in June that year. W S Roe was appointed joint managing director with David but he died in April 1933. Percy was appointed chairman. The firm formed another overseas joint venture with Richardson Gears (Pty) Ltd of Footscray, Victoria, Australia in 1934. In 1934 the company moved into an old Silk Mill on a site at Meltham, on the south side of Huddersfield. Brown started building tractors with Harry Ferguson there in 1936.
The company obtained a patent for a tank transmission using controlled differential steering system, known as the Merritt-Brown system, devised by Dr. H. E. Merritt, Director of Tank Design at Woolwich Arsenal, in 1935.[3] The first vehicle to use this system was the Churchill tank, and it was subsequently used on the Centurion tank and the Conqueror tank, as well as the Tortoise heavy tank.
David Brown Tractors Group[edit]




David Brown Tractor Factory Meltham Mills 1981


Personally controlled since its inception by David Brown (1904–1993) the first venture into tractor production was in a joint project with Harry Ferguson in 1936 building the Ferguson-Brown tractor. David Brown became one of the biggest British tractor manufactures in the post war period, with a major manufacturing plant at Meltham, West Yorkshire England. The company broke new ground which others were only to follow later, but being a pioneering company ultimately lead to their downfall. The Ferguson-Brown had a lot of innovative features, including the use of cast alloy for many the components, which was light but prone to damage. The Ferguson-Brown used a Coventry Climax engine for the first 350 tractors. Browns developed their own engine which was fitted to subsequent production. Total production was 1350 + 1 built from parts in 1940 after production finished.[4]

Brown and Ferguson disagreed over tractor design details in the late 30s, which led David Brown to design his own version, the VAK1, in secret. This was launched at the 1939 Royal Show.[5] Ferguson split away from Brown and joined up with Henry Ford in 1938, after a 'handshake' agreement, to allow his 'Ferguson System' three-point linkage to be used on the Fordson N tractors. That agreement was eventually terminated by Ford's grandson in 1947 and Ferguson again split away to form Ferguson Tractors in 1948.[6]
During the Second World War Brown's new heavier tractor, the VAK1, was produced, with over 7,700 units eventually sold, making Brown a wealthy man. It is said the David Brown Tractor is the only one to be built onto a sturdy cast iron chassis where other makers bolt components together to form a chassis-less construction which is weaker, Brown also built aircraft tugs (VIG) for the Royal Air Force and for pulling the bomb trolleys used to re-arm aircraft. These tugs are distinctive, with truck like tyres, wrap round body work and HD bumpers front and rear, some being fitted with winches. In 1942 Brown started building a tracklayer version, the DB4. The DB4 was built for the army engineers and solved some of the problems found with the VTK, and got round an embargo on imported machines for military use. It was powered by a 38 h.p. Dorman diesel and a five speed gearbox. The DB4 was replaced in 1950 by the Trackmaster 30.

The tractors division took over the Lancashire firm of Harrison, McGregor & Guest Ltd, who produced the Albion brand of agricultural machinery to complement the tractor product line. After the takeover the company's badge was modified to incorporate the white rose of Yorkshire and the red rose of Lancashire. The Tractors division had ten subsidiaries around the world. At one stage 80% of production was exported. Sales were handled by 2,508 agents in 100 countries.[7]A worldwide recession saw tractor sales slump, and after braving the storm and with the debt of a brand new building and production line to finance, it was inevitable that the company was put up for sale, bought by JI Case of America; all hope to see the factory prosper was dashed when it was announced that survival was a competition between Huddersfield and the international Tractor plant in Doncaster, with the odds stacked in the latter's favour, especially with access to the motorway network on the doorstep. The Meltham factory ended production and a respected British name was erased.
Tractor Group's Lagonda and Aston Martin[edit]
In 1947, Brown saw a classified advertisement in The Times, offering for sale a High Class Motor Business. Brown acquired Aston Martin for £20,500 and, in the following year, Lagonda for £52,500, followed by the coachbuilder Tickford in 1955. He subsequently concentrated all the Aston Martin manufacturing at the Tickford premises in Newport Pagnell. The David Brown years led to the legendary DB series of Aston Martins, which were featured in some 007 James Bond films.
David Brown also had connections with Vosper shipbuilding, Delapina and Radyne machinery.
Both car companies were sold in 1972 to Company Developments Limited, when Aston Martin was in financial trouble, for a nominal £100.
Sale of David Brown Tractors to Case 1972[edit]
In 1972 the tractor operations were sold to Tenneco Inc. of America, who owned the J.I. Case tractor company. The sale was due to a combination of a reduction in the UK tractor market, increased product development costs, the need to meet new regulations on health and safety, and increased competition from imported machinery. Case applied the David Brown name and branding to some of its own tractor models in the UK market until the early 1980s before abandoning it in favour of the Case IH brand.
Sale by David Brown family – management buyout 1990[edit]
In 1990 the David Brown family disposed of its stake to the business's management. They then floated David Brown as a public company in 1993. David Brown was acquired by Textron Inc. in October 1998.
This business, trading as David Brown Engineering Ltd and headquartered in Huddersfield, remains a supplier of heavy transmission systems for industrial, defence, railway and marine applications. These include transmissions for the British Challenger 2 tanks and American Bradley Fighting Vehicles.[8] Railway transmissions are produced for their Chinese branch 'David Brown China', in a joint partnership called 'Jiangsu Shinri David Brown Gear Systems' at a factory in Changzhou near Shanghai.[9]
Sale by Textron 2008[edit]
In September 2008 it was announced that David Brown Gear systems and associated companies, David Brown Hydraulics based in Poole in Dorset, Maag Pumps of Switzerland, and Union Pumps of the USA were to be sold to Clyde Blowers of Scotland – owned by entrepreneur Jim McColl – in a £368 million deal.[10]
2016 David Brown was merged with Santasalo to form David Brown Santasalo. The joint company remains in the hands of Clyde Blowers Capital.

Bobbi Brown on Reinvention, YouTubers and the One Product She Can't Live Without | Allure































ToggleCloseSubscribeNewsletter Sign UpCloseGoMakeupFaceBobbi Brown on Reinvention, YouTubers and the One Product She Can't Live WithoutBy Kristen BatemankristenvbatemanJune 8, 2017facebook dialogPinterestfacebook dialogPinterestEmailMegan ThomasIt's been just a little over six months since Bobbi Brown announced she'd be leaving her namesake makeup line, yet already she's released her ninth book (Beauty From the Inside Out: Makeup, Wellness, Confidence) and announced her plan to renovate a hotel in her hometown of Montclair, New Jersey, with her husband, Steven Plofker.The iconic makeup artist, author, former editor and brand founder launched her brand at Bergdorf Goodman in 1991 and sold it to Estee Lauder just a few years later, in 1995. She made a name for herself with products that suited a wide variety of skin tones as well as products that were made to look more your real skin, lip color and cheeks than actual makeup. "I got a lot of inspiration, and I still do, from people's skin and their faces," she said, referring to the time she created a lip stain inspired by the way her three sons' lips looked after eating popsicles.You May Also LikeMakeupHayley Williams's Makeup Artist Spills Her Behind-the-Scenes Beauty SecretsMakeupThe Anastasia Beverly Hills Subculture Palette Was Just Leaked on Reddit"I think the most important thing is the overall message which, to me, is about how to take care of yourself from the inside out," said Brown of her brand new book, during a conversation with Christene Barberich at the "Fresh" themed pop-up concept shop Story on a grey and humid New York City night.Brown curated a few of her favorite wellness products for the shop, which rotates themes every four to eight weeks (this time was in partnership with Jet.com), and was in-person to talk about everything from her views of teenage beauty today to her morning routine. At the end of the talk, she responded to an audience member's question of "What's next?" with the possibly of doing more in the wellness space, too — though she couldn't divulge just what exactly she'll be up to yet.We sat down with Brown right before the event to talk about no-makeup makeup, YouTubers, beauty regrets and more:Your latest book is about beauty from the inside out, but there's also a bit about personal reinvention. Is there a specific moment in your life when you feel your reinvented yourself with makeup?I reinvented myself in October when I left the company. Now, I honestly wear so much less makeup than I normally would have worn. I kind of think I look better. Everyday is different, and it seems like everyday I’m either photographed or on TV, or Facebook Live or something. But normally I’ll do my makeup in the car. I always put moisturizer on, sometimes face oil because my skin is dry. Corrector concealer, mascara, eyebrows, sometimes I do liner. I’ve been skipping foundation though, and just putting blush on.If you could only wear one product, what would it be?I would say it would have to be a pink-y, bronze-y creamy formula that I could put on my lips, my cheeks and my eyes. One of my favorites was a Bobbi Brown cream blush and it was exactly that color. I never liked blushes that were cream-to-powder. I liked full-on cream.But I’ve been using a lot of coconut oil on my skin and I’ve been using a bunch of RMS’ under-the-eyes concealers, and they are really natural looking. I use coconut oil on everything though, I take my makeup off with it at night, then I put more of it on. I use it on my hair, my feet, my everything.You launched your makeup line in 1991 and have worked in beauty for decades. How do you think the concept of beauty as identity has changed over the years?It’s changed immensely. I was a middle schooler going into high school, and if you weren’t Barbie, or Cheryl Tiegs you weren’t considered attractive. With blonde hair and blue eyes — that was it. Then, as I got older, I started to look at some brunettes. Ali MacGraw, she had very strong eyebrows and not a lot of makeup. She was so natural. She was a beauty icon. Then, I moved to New York and girls from all over the world were modeling. The models started looking differently. They were mixed nationality. Things changed. Style has definitely evolved. Girls can walk in with green hair, piercings — it’s honestly about individuality, and I like that.If you started your makeup line today versus in the '90s, would it be different?It would be 100 percent different. It would be a lot smaller. My original idea was to have a really simple line. Because it was so successful, we had many opportunities and requests and it grew really big. It would probably be quite different, if I started today.Do you think it would still revolve around the concept of no-makeup makeup?Well, that's what I wanted it to be, but that’s not really what it ended up being. It was really about individual beauty. I think that when and if I ever go back in the cosmetics industry, it will definitely be my original concept, which is simplifying beauty.Do you think the concept of no-makeup makeup has evolved?I do, I think that a lot of companies and makeup people have “nude” makeup in their line. It’s not nude, it’s like beige, so it kind of takes the color out of people’s skin. So, for me, nude makeup is actually the color of people’s skin, whether you’re African American or you’re white or Asian, you have certain colors in your skin and if you take all the color away, that’s not nude. That’s kind of beige makeup.I think it’s what colors you choose from each line, because we all have different skin colors. We have different skin conditions, so it really just depends. The end result has to look like you’re not wearing a lot of makeup, but just that you’re vibrantly healthy. Hopefully, if you are vibrantly healthy and you take care of yourself, makeup is not that difficult.The YouTube beauty community has really changed the entire landscape of the industry — especially during the past few years. How do you feel about it?I think it’s fascinating, I think it’s interesting, I think some of it is just like a car wreck where you just can’t believe it. There’s some really talented teenagers that are doing these things to themselves. It’s crazy, but I personally like the way they look without makeup better than when they’re all done up. But it’s fascinating to watch. I don’t have that kind of talent, I can’t do that. So, I respect everyone that does.Would you ever start a YouTube channel?I’ve always done videos, both when I was at Bobbi Brown cosmetics and when I was a Yahoo Beauty. I just started doing then again, not tied to a makeup line, and I think it’s definitely a place I want to be. I like to teach.Do you have any favorite YouTubers?Besides Michelle Phan, there’s not one particular one that I watch. I’m much more of an Instagrammer. Beauty is Boring is one of my favorite sites. I actually got to work with her when I was at Yahoo. I’m always reaching out to people I like on Instagram and doing things with them. There’s some really talented people out there.Your own brand has been very inclusive in terms skin tones from the very beginning. How well do you think other brands have progressed in terms of that?I think it’s gotten a lot better. The reason it’s gotten better is a lot of marketing and sales people realize that it’s important to the business. But I think the essence of it is that I don’t want a woman to come up to the counter and not find a color of her, no matter what the range. Whether it’s lips or cheeks. I want the darkest of women to have a foundation that matches their skin.What's the biggest change you'd like to see in the beauty industry?I’m really not feeling contour. I honestly don’t think people need contour, and I think that young girls should feel beautiful as they are without makeup. I’m not saying not to wear makeup, but go both ways. I love the way you look, but I also bet you look great without makeup.I think it’s about being comfortable in your skin.Any makeup look you’ve done on yourself that you regret?So many, and luckily, it washes off. I regret taking my eyebrows off when it was popular and making them very thin, back in the ‘90s. As far as makeup, I look terrible with a red lip. I’ve tried. I don’t look good with a real smoky eye. I’m just someone that looks better with more natural makeup.I think I’ve always been really interested in makeup and what it does though. I was the person who was the only makeup artist in the room who would take a taupe eye pencil and put it on my lips to see what happens to it. I would just try things. I think I was always more of an entrepreneur than a transformer. I wanted to see what it was like. I lined my eyes once with a black mascara. You know what happened?
