			Mr. Valentine was employed by us from 1960 until his retirement in January 2006. He was named our President in December 1995. He served as our Secretary from 1969 to December 1995, as our Executive Vice President from 1987 to October 1991 and as our Senior Executive Vice President and Treasurer from October 1991 to December 1995. He has been a member of our Board of Directors since 1969. Mr. Valentine was also a member of our Compensation Committee until April 28, 2004 and was a member of the Stock Option Committee until February 27, 1997 (when that Committee was disbanded). Mr. Valentine retired from our company on January 3, 2006. Mr. Valentine is the father of Michael J. Valentine, a director and an executive officer of our company, and James A. Valentine, an executive officer of our company. Mr. Valentine is the uncle of Jasper B. Sanfilippo, Jr. and Jeffrey T. Sanfilippo, both of whom are executive officers and directors of our company, and James J. Sanfilippo, a director of our company. Mr. Valentine is also the uncle by marriage of Timothy R. Donovan, a director of our company. 



The holders of Class A Stock have concluded that Mr. Valentine should serve as a director as a result of his in-depth knowledge of our company and the nut industry and deep appreciation of our company's values and mission due to his service as an employee from 1960 until 2006, including as our former President. The holders of Class A Stock believe that he provides a unique perspective regarding our company's history and operations and is well-suited to provide guidance to the company as to the best methods to build our brands and provide long-term stockholder value.
