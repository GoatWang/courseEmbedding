By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Agriculture Business Week -- American Vanguard Corporation (NYSE:AVD), announced that its wholly owned subsidiary AMVAC Chemical Corporation has completed the acquisition of three crop protection product lines - abamectin, chlorothalonil and paraquat - from Adama Agricultural Solutions Ltd., which is part of the China National Chemical Corporation ("ChemChina") group. As reported on April 5, 2017, these product lines were sold pursuant to the terms of a consent decree from the FTC, as a condition for that agency's approval of the ChemChina/Syngenta merger. The acquisition includes the trademarks, product registrations, registration data, and commercial information that relate to the marketing and sale of these three product lines in the crop protection market within the United States. Financial details of the transaction were not disclosed.
Eric Wintemute, Chairman & CEO of American Vanguard commented: "Adding these proven, branded product lines will diversify and balance our crop and geographical segments, while adding sales opportunities for our channel partners and continued growth for our business. In addition, the technical registrations we are acquiring will provide us with a foundation of technologies upon which we can build additional premix value-added products. AMVAC will immediately begin the transition of manufacturing, selling and servicing these products."
Mr. Wintemute concluded: "We expect that these products will increase full year domestic sales by 10 to 15%. Further, we believe that our sales, marketing and product development capabilities will enable us to maintain all existing business and subsequently expand our sales of these product lines in the years ahead." About American Vanguard American Vanguard Corporation is a diversified specialty and agricultural products company that develops and markets products for crop protection and management, turf and ornamentals management and public and animal health. American Vanguard is included on the Russell 2000® and Russell 3000® Indexes and the Standard & Poor's Small Cap 600 Index.

      American Vanguard Corporation (NYSE:AVD), today announced that its 
      wholly owned subsidiary AMVAC Chemical Corporation has completed the 
      acquisition of three crop protection product lines – abamectin, 
      chlorothalonil and paraquat – from Adama Agricultural Solutions Ltd., 
      which is part of the China National Chemical Corporation (“ChemChina”) 
      group. As reported on April 5, 2017, these product lines were sold 
      pursuant to the terms of a consent decree from the FTC, as a condition 
      for that agency’s approval of the ChemChina/Syngenta merger. The 
      acquisition includes the trademarks, product registrations, registration 
      data, and commercial information that relate to the marketing and sale 
      of these three product lines in the crop protection market within the 
      United States. Financial details of the transaction were not disclosed.
    

      Eric Wintemute, Chairman & CEO of American Vanguard commented: “Adding 
      these proven, branded product lines will diversify and balance our crop 
      and geographical segments, while adding sales opportunities for our 
      channel partners and continued growth for our business. In addition, the 
      technical registrations we are acquiring will provide us with a 
      foundation of technologies upon which we can build additional premix 
      value-added products. AMVAC will immediately begin the transition of 
      manufacturing, selling and servicing these products.”
    

      Mr. Wintemute concluded: “We expect that these products will increase 
      full year domestic sales by 10 to 15%. Further, we believe that our 
      sales, marketing and product development capabilities will enable us to 
      maintain all existing business and subsequently expand our sales of 
      these product lines in the years ahead.”

Stop Sale, Use or Removal Order


(Washington, DC - August 12, 2010) American Vanguard Corporation (AMVAC) and AMVAC Chemical Corporation have been issued a Stop Sale, Use or Removal Order (SSURO) for potential violations of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). EPA took enforcement action after EPA laboratory analysis of AMVAC's registered pesticide product, Technical Grade PCNB 95%, revealed the presence of highly toxic impurities EPA considers to be of toxicological significance.

 Overview of Company and Facility Locations
American Vanguard Corporation (AMVAC) and AMVAC Chemical Corporation have been issued a Stop Sale, Use or Removal Order (SSURO) for potential violations of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). EPA took enforcement action after EPA laboratory analysis of AMVAC's registered pesticide product, Technical Grade PCNB 95%, revealed the presence of highly toxic impurities EPA considers to be of toxicological significance.
The products involved include AMVAC's technical grade and manufacturing-use pentachloronitrobenzene (PCNB) products, as well as numerous registered end-use products derived from the technical grade and manufacturing-use PCNB products. In addition, there are several downstream registrants of PCNB products that use AMVAC's technical grade and manufacturing-use products to formulate their own pesticides. EPA has reason to believe these downstream products also contain impurities and intends to issue SSUROs to those businesses as well.
AMVAC Chemical Corporation, along with its subsidiaries, is a global partner of American Vanguard Corporation, a diversified specialty and agricultural products company that develops and markets crop protection, turf and ornamental products, and public health insecticides. AMVAC products include insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, soil fumigants, defoliants, molluscides, and growth regulators. AMVAC specializes in working with agricultural businesses and marketing crop protection products in the agricultural marketplace. AMVAC products are marketed in liquid, powder, and granular formulations.
In 2009, AMVAC reported net sales of $209,320,000. AMVAC parent company is located in Newport Beach, California; AMVAC Chemical Corporation is located in Los Angeles, California; and AMVAC branches are located in Salt Lake City, Utah and Marsing, Idaho.

 Potential Violations
EPA has reason to believe AMVAC's PCNB products are in violation of FIFRA. Additionally, EPA believes AMVAC and AMVAC Chemical Corporation have distributed and sold, and intends to continue distributing and selling these pesticide products in violation of FIFRA.
Composition Differs - Any distribution or sale of any registered pesticide product for which the Confidential Statement of Formula (CSF) does not accurately reflect the composition of the product is a violation of FIFRA Section 12(a)(1)(C) , 7 U.S.C. § 136j(a)(1)(C). AMVAC's pesticide, Technical Grade PCNB 95% (EPA Reg. No. 5481-197) has been shown to contain impurities of toxicological significance and therefore its composition differs from the CSF under which it was registered.

 Health and Environmental Effects
Primary uses are as fungicides with a wide variety of uses to control fungal diseases on vegetable crops (such as beans, cole crops (i.e., cabbage), potatoes, peanuts, flowering bulbs and garlic, as well as products for seed treatment and controlling soil-borne diseases in turf. Based on recent studies of AMVAC's technical grade pesticide, impurities of toxicological significance are present at significant levels in AMVAC products. During the past year, Australia and Canada have taken steps to prohibit the distribution and sale of AMVAC's PCNB products due to these impurities.
