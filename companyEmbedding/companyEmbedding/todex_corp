(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this annual report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report. Our audited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses the Company's consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experiences and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Due to the limited level of operations, the Company has not made material assumptions or estimates other than the assumption that the Company is a going concern.  5 | Page  Development Stage Entity  The Company is a development stage company as defined by section 915-10-20 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification and among the additional disclosures required as a development stage company are that its financial statements were identified as those of a development stage company, and that the statements of operations, stockholders' deficit and cash flows disclosed activity since the date of its Inception (September 18, 2014) as a development stage company Although the Company has recognized nominal amounts of revenue, it is still devoting substantially all of its efforts on establishing the business. All losses accumulated since Inception (September 18, 2014) have been considered as part of the Company's development stage activities. Effective June 10, 2014 FASB changed its regulations with respect to Development Stage Entities and these additional disclosures are no longer required for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014 with the option for entities to early adopt these new provisions. The Company has not elected to early adopt these provisions and consequently these additional disclosures are included in these financial statements.  Revenue Recognition  The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned.  The Company's revenue consists of proceeds from sales of the designing, developing and implementing applications software.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  We have incurred recurring losses to date. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation.  We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities.  Revenues  During the year ended November 30, 2015, we earned revenue on software development of $2,000 compared with $0 during the period from September 18, 2014 (inception) through November 30, 2014. Software development and training was provided by the Company President at no charge to the company.  Operating expenses  During the year ended November 30, 2015, we incurred expenses of $16,495 compared to $556 incurred during the period from September 18, 2014 (inception) through November 30, 2014. The increase between the two periods was due to the increased scale and scope of our business operations.  Net Loss  Our net loss for the year ended November 30, 2015 was $14,495 compared to a net loss of $556 during the period from September 18, 2014 (inception) through November 30, 2014.  Liquidity And Capital Resources  As of November 30, 2015 our total assets were $20,435 compared to $6,430 in total assets at November 30, 2014. As of November 30, 2015, our current liabilities were $3,686 compared to $986 in current liabilities at November 30, 2014.  As of November 30, 2015, total assets comprised of cash of $20,105 `and deposit of $330 while as at November 30, 2014 total assets comprised cash of $6,100 and $330 in deposit. As of November 30, 2015, our current liabilities were entirely comprising of $3,686 in advances from a Director. As of November 30, 2014, our current liabilities were entirely comprising of $986 in advances from a Director.  6 | Page  Stockholders' equity was $16,749 as of November 30, 2015, compared to stockholders' equity of $5,444 as of November 30, 2014.  The weighted average number of shares outstanding was 6,389,260 for the year ended November 30, 2015 compared to 486,486 for the period from September 18, 2014 (inception) through November 30, 2014.  Cash Flows from Operating Activities  We have not generated positive cash flows from operating activities. For the year ended November 30, 2015, net cash flows used in operating activities was $14,495. Net cash flows used in operating activities was $886 for the period from September 18, 2014 (inception) through November 30, 2014. The increase between the two periods was due to the increased scale and scope of our business operations.  Cash Flows from Financing Activities  We have financed our operations primarily from either advancements or the issuance of equity and debt instruments. For the year ended November 30, 2015, net cash flows from financing activities was $28,500 due to proceeds from issuance of common stock and advances from our President and sole director. For the period from September 18, 2014 (inception) through November 30, 2014, net cash flows from financing activities was $6,986 due to proceeds from issuance of common stock to our founder and President, and advances from our President and sole director.  PLAN OF OPERATION AND FUNDING  We expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds and further issuances of securities. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business.  Existing working capital, further advances and debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next six months. We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) developmental expenses associated with a start-up business and (ii) marketing expenses. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities, and debt issuances. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations.  MATERIAL COMMITMENTS  As of the date of this Annual Report, we do not have any material commitments.  PURCHASE OF SIGNIFICANT EQUIPMENT  We do not intend to purchase any significant equipment during the next twelve months.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  As of the date of this Annual Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.  GOING CONCERN  The independent auditors' report accompanying our November 30, 2015 and November 30, 2014 financial statements contains an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared "assuming that we will continue as a going concern," which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Our Management's Discussion and Analysis contains not only statements that are historical facts, but also statements that are forward-looking (within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Forward-looking statements are, by their very nature, uncertain and risky. These risks and uncertainties include international, national and local general economic and market conditions; demographic changes; our ability to sustain, manage, or forecast growth; our ability to successfully make and integrate acquisitions; raw material costs and availability; new product development and introduction; existing government regulations and changes in, or the failure to comply with, government regulations; adverse publicity; competition; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results; changes in business strategy or development plans; business disruptions; the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; the ability to protect technology; and other risks that might be detailed from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Although the forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Statement reflect the good faith judgment of our management, such statements can only be based on facts and factors currently known by them. Consequently, and because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, the actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the forward-looking statements. You are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report and in our other reports as we attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and prospects.  The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the Company is based upon, and should be read in conjunction with, its unaudited financial statements and related notes elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  Summary Overview  Going Concern  As a result of our financial condition, we have received a report from our independent registered public accounting firm for our financial statements for the years ended November 30, 2015 and 2014 that includes an explanatory paragraph describing the uncertainty as to our ability to continue as a going concern. In order to continue as a going concern we must effectively balance many factors and begin to generate revenue so that we can fund our operations from our sales and revenues. If we are not able to do this we may not be able to continue as an operating company. At our current revenue and burn rate, our cash on hand will last less than one month, and thus we must raise capital by issuing debt or through the sale of our stock. However, there is no assurance that our existing cash flow will be adequate to satisfy our existing operating expenses and capital requirements.  Results of Operations  Introduction  On April 13, 2016, new management was appointed in connection with a change of control of the Company. At this time, we do not have an established business plan. However, we are taking steps to provide capital and minimize losses in the absence of a revenue producing business, including: (1) minimizing expenses, (2) raising equity financing, and (3) developing and implementing a new business model. Our management is actively seeking an operating business to acquire or with which to complete a merger.  Table of Contents  Three Month Period Ended August 31, 2016  Revenues  The Company was established on September 18, 2014 and had no revenues for the three months ended August 31, 2016 and revenues of $2,000 for the three months ended August 31, 2015.  General and Administrative  General and administrative expenses were $1,500 in both the three months ended August 31, 2016 and the three months ended August 31, 2015.  Professional Fees  Legal fees were $5,988 for the three months ended August 31, 2016, compared to $0 for the three months ended August 31, 2015, an increase of $5,988. The increase was primarily due to legal fees incurred for the purpose of developing a new business plan and re-organizing the capital structure.  Net Loss  Our net operating loss was $7,488 for the three months ended August 31, 2016, compared to $1,000 for the three months ended August 31, 2015, an increase of $6,488, or 648%. Net operating loss increased, as set forth above, primarily due to the increase in general and administrative costs and legal fees as referred to in the two preceding paragraphs.  Nine Month Period Ended August 31, 2016  Revenues  The Company was established on September 18, 2014 and had no revenues for the nine months ended August 31, 2016 and revenues of $2,000 for the nine months ended August 31, 2015.  General and Administrative  General and administrative expenses were $28,935 for the nine months ended August 31, 2016, compared to $8,995 for the nine months ended August 31, 2015, an increase of $19,940 or 222%. The increase is due to consulting fees incurred for the purpose of developing a new business model and the increased costs of maintaining the public vehicle.  Professional Fees  Legal fees were $20,807 for the nine months ended August 31, 2016, compared to $0 for the nine months ended August 31, 2015, an increase of $20,807. The increase was primarily due to legal fees incurred for the purpose of developing a new business plan and re-organizing the capital structure.  Table of Contents  Net Loss  Our net operating loss was $49,742 for the nine months ended August 31, 2016, compared to $8,495 for the three months ended August 31, 2015, an increase of $41,247, or 486%. Net operating loss increased, as set forth above, primarily due to the increase in general and administrative costs and legal fees as referred to in the two preceding paragraphs.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Introduction  During the three months ended August 31, 2016, because we did not generate any revenues, we had negative operating cash flows. Our cash on hand as of August 31, 2016 was $0. Our monthly cash flow burn rate for the nine months ended August 31, 2016 was approximately $4,500. Advances from related parties has been our primary source of capital for the nine months ended August 31, 2016; we have received $29,307 in loans from related parties over this period. Although we have moderate short term cash needs, as we implement our business plan and our operating expenses increase we will face strong medium to long term cash needs. We anticipate that these needs will be satisfied through the issuance of debt or the sale of our securities until such time as we can begin a business that will generate revenues and our cash flows from operations will satisfy our cash flow needs.  Our cash, current assets, total assets, current liabilities, and total liabilities as of August 31, 2016 and November 30, 2015, respectively, are as follows:   August 31, November 30, 2016 2015 Change Cash $ 0 $ 20,105 $ (20,105 ) Total Current Assets 0 20,435 (20,435 ) Total Assets 0 20,435 (20,435 ) Total Current Liabilities 29,307 3,686 25,621 Total Liabilities $ 29,307 $ 3,686 $ 25,621  Our cash and total current assets decreased because we paid operating expenses from cash on hand and did not generate revenues or raise additional capital. Our total current liabilities increased because without cash to pay our operating expenses, we have had to delay payment to our service providers. Our working capital decreased from $16,749 to a deficit of ($29,307), and our total stockholders' deficit increased by $46,056 to ($29,307).  We do not expect to generate revenues until we are able to develop and implement our business plan. In order to repay our obligations in full or in part when due, we will be required to raise significant capital from other sources. There is no assurance, however, that we will be successful in these efforts.  Cash Requirements  Our cash on hand as of August 31, 2016 was $0. Based on our lack of revenues and current monthly burn rate of approximately $4,500 per month, we will not be able to fund our operations for the next 12 months unless we are able to raise capital from the sale of our stock and debt financings.  Table of Contents  Sources and Uses of Cash  Operations  We had net cash used in operating activities of $(49,742) for the nine months ended August 31, 2016, compared to $(6,995) for the nine months ended August 31, 2015. For the nine months ended August 31, 2016, the net cash consisted primarily of our net loss of $(49,742), offset primarily by a decrease in deposits of $330. For the nine months ended August 31, 2015, the net cash used in operating activities consisted primarily of our net loss of $(8,495), offset primarily by an increase in accounts payable of $1,500.  Financing  Our net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended August 31, 2016 was $29,307, compared to $3,700 for the nine months ended August 31, 2015, all of which was cash advances from related parties.

Our offering is being made on a self-underwritten and “best-efforts” basis: no
minimum number of shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed. The
offering price per share is $0.01. The following table sets forth the uses of
proceeds assuming the sale of 25%, 50%, 60%, 75% and 100%, respectively, of the
securities offered for sale by the Company. There is no assurance that we will
raise the full $50,000 as anticipated and there is no guarantee that we will
receive any proceeds from the offering.

If we sell only 25% of the maximum offering amount, we will not able to pay the
estimated SEC reporting and compliance expenses, after paying for the cost of
the offering. To be eligible for quotation, issuers must remain current in their
filings with the SEC. If we are unable to find additional financing in this
scenario, we will not able to pay the expenses associated with our reporting
obligations and we will not be able to apply for quotation on the OTC Bulletin
Board. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to resell any shares
purchased in the offering, if at all.

The above figures represent only estimated costs. The estimated cost of this
registration statement is $8,000 which will be paid from offering proceeds. If
the offering proceeds are less than registration costs, Vladislav Ermolovich,
our president and director, has verbally agreed to loan the Company funds to
complete the registration process. Mr. Ermolovich’s verbal agreement to provide
us loans for registration costs is non- binding and discretionary. Also, these
loans would be necessary if the proceeds from this offering will not be
sufficient to implement our business plan and maintain reporting status and
quotation on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board when and if our common stocks
become eligible for trading on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. Mr.
Ermolovich will not be paid any compensation or anything from the proceeds of
this offering. There is no due date for the repayment of the funds advanced by
Mr. Ermolovich. Mr. Ermolovich will be repaid from revenues of operations if and
when we generate sufficient revenues to pay the obligation.


There are the few barriers of entry in the business and level of competition is
extremely high. There are many software developers in the world. We believe that
most of them specialize outside of our target market. We intend to develop our
software specifically for thecar distribution market. We intend to focus our
forces on the specifiv needs related to our potential clients


Company Description
We are a development stage company and we plan to organize a software
development business. We intend to develop special software for the car
dealership business sector. Our software will help to car dealerships in their
business activity by creating a platform for analyzing and controlling
and


 tracking inventory levels, orders, sales, deliveries, record and processing
sales and accounting transactions. Our business is on the development stage
level and we have no developed product, minimal revenues and identified just one
customer.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
