Illinois Power Holdings Completes Acquisition 
      of Ameren Energy Resources






December 02, 2013 12:30 PM Eastern Standard Time



HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, Dynegy (NYSE:DYN) subsidiary, Illinois Power Holdings (IPH) 
      completed its acquisition of New Ameren Energy Resources (AER), an 
      Ameren (NYSE:AEE) subsidiary. The transaction includes AER and its 
      subsidiaries Ameren Energy Generating Company (Genco), New AERG (AERG), 
      and Ameren Energy Marketing Company (AEM). Dynegy now owns more than 
      8,000 megawatts (MW) of generating capacity in Illinois, and nearly 
      14,000 MW nationally. The AEM retail and marketing businesses, doing 
      business as Homefield Energy, and the following plants are included in 
      the transaction: Duck Creek, Coffeen, E.D. Edwards, Newton, and Joppa.
    


      “This transaction creates value for Dynegy and IPH’s stakeholders - from 
      employees to local communities to investors - as Dynegy, through its 
      subsidiary IPH, brings a singular ability to operate these facilities in 
      the most economic and environmentally compliant manner. The AER fleet 
      and the Homefield Energy retail and marketing businesses are a natural 
      fit with Dynegy’s existing generation fleet,” said Dynegy President and 
      Chief Executive Officer Robert C. Flexon. “To date, we have identified 
      synergies in excess of $75 million and we will continue to seek ways to 
      further benefit from the increased scale of the combined fleet.”

      This press release contains statements reflecting assumptions, 
      expectations, projections, intentions or beliefs about future events 
      that are intended as “forward-looking statements” particularly those 
      statements concerning: the transaction creating value for stakeholders, 
      operating the portfolio in the most economic and environmentally 
      compliant manner, and the anticipated synergies resulting from the 
      transaction. Discussion of risks and uncertainties that could cause 
      actual results to differ materially from current projections, forecasts, 
      estimates and expectations of Dynegy is contained in Dynegy’s filings 
      with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Specifically, 
      Dynegy makes reference to, and incorporates herein by reference, the 
      section entitled “Risk Factors” in its 2012 Form 10-K and the 10-Q for 
      the quarters ended March 31, 2013, June 30, 2013 and September 30, 2013. 
      In addition to the risks and uncertainties set forth in Dynegy’s SEC 
      filings, the forward-looking statements described in this press release 
      could be affected by, among other things, (i) Dynegy’s inability to 
      obtain the anticipated benefits and expected synergies resulting from 
      the transaction; (ii) the industry may be subject to future regulatory 
      or legislative actions, including environmental, that could adversely 
      affect Dynegy; and (iii) Dynegy may be adversely affected by other 
      economic, business, and/or competitive factors. Any or all of Dynegy’s 
      forward-looking statements may turn out to be wrong. They can be 
      affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks, 
      uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond Dynegy’s 
      control.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
