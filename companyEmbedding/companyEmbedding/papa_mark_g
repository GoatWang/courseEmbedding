Papa, Mark G. - The Wall Street Transcript













































 





































Mark G. Papa
MARK G. PAPA is President and Chief Operating Officer of Enron Oil & Gas
Company (EOG), one of the leading independent exploration and production
companies. Since 1989, EOG has increased its worldwide natural gas
production from 344 to the current 950 million cubic feet per day and
has exceeded 100% reserve replacement through drilling for ten
consecutive years. EOG has operations throughout North America as well
as in India, Trindad, China and Venezuela. During the past several
years, EOG has ranked at or near the top for the number of U.S. gas
wells drilled each year and has consistently exhibited one of the
highest net incomes per unit of production of any of its peer companies.
Mr. Papa has a Petroleum Engineering degree from the University of
Pittsburgh and an MBA degree from the University of Houston. He started
his career in 1968 with Conoco in Corpus Christi and subsequently worked
for Conoco in New Orleans, Lake Charles, Houston and Dubai in the United
Arab Emirates. In 1981, he joined Belco Petroleum which, after several
mergers, was one of the predecessor companies to Enron Oil & Gas
Company. He served as EOG’s Senior Vice President, Operations from 1984
to 1993 and President, North America Operations from 1994 to 1996. In
December 1996, Mr. Papa was promoted to President of EOG. Most recently,
in September 1997, Mark was promoted to President and Chief Operating
Officer of EOG. Mr. Papa is a member of the Society of Professional
Engineers (SPE), American Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG),
Texas Independent Producers and Royalty Owners (TIPRO), and the
Independent Producers Association of America (IPAA), where he recently
served as Chairman of IPAA’s Electricity Task Force. Additionally, he
was recently appointed by Governor Bush as a Texas representative to the
Interstate Oil & Gas Compact Commission. In 1992, Mr. Papa was part of
the National Petroleum Council’s Study Team to assess the potential for
natural gas supply in the United States.
