Early life and education[edit]
Wellinghoff was born in Santa Monica, California on May 30, 1949, and moved to Reno, Nevada, at the age of four. He attended the University of Nevada-Reno, earning a B.S. in mathematics in 1971. The following year he earned a Master's degree in teaching mathematics from Howard University and stayed in Washington, D.C., to attend Antioch School of Law where he earned his J.D. in 1975.
Wellinghoff returned to Nevada where he would specialize in energy law for more than 30 years. In private practice, he focused exclusively on cases pertaining to renewable energy and energy efficiency, causes he continued to promote as FERC Chairman. He was the primary author of Nevada’s Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS), one of two state RPS programs to receive an “A” rating from the Union of Concerned Scientists.
Wellinghoff has also held a variety of positions in the public sector, providing legal counsel on energy issues to, among others, the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee, the Federal Trade Commission and the Nevada Public Utility Commission.
Consumer protection was another hallmark of Wellinghoff’s career prior to joining FERC. In his hometown of Reno, he held the position of Deputy District Attorney in the Washoe County District Attorney’s Consumer Fraud division. His work on behalf of consumers helped make him Nevada’s first Consumer Advocate for customers of public utilities. In that role, he argued for the public in cases before FERC, the Nevada Supreme Court and what is now the Nevada Public Utility Commission.
Career[edit]
FERC commissioner[edit]
In 2006, Wellinghoff was appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate as one of the five commissioners at the FERC.
As commissioner, Wellinghoff was influential in moving FERC towards prioritizing the removal of barriers to integration of renewable energy into the electric grid. He has been an advocate of “demand response” and “smart grid” technologies that will facilitate coordination and communication between electricity consumers and providers, allowing consumers to have greater control over their energy usage and the associated costs.
Wellinghoff was an early proponent of improving energy infrastructure to accommodate future demands from automobiles powered primarily by electricity. He coined the phrase “Cashback Car” in a contribution to the Brookings Institution publication, “Plug-In Electric Vehicles: What Role for Washington?” In it, he envisioned a future where drivers not only save money by switching from gasoline but are paid by utilities for use of their batteries to provide and store electricity. Wellinghoff explained that while the necessary technology already exists, improvements to infrastructure will be needed to make the “Cashback Car” a reality.
In 2008, the Alliance to Save Energy honored Wellinghoff with its prestigious Charles Percy Award for Public Service. The non-profit group bestowed the award “in recognition of [his] decades of outstanding public service and his expertise and leadership on energy efficiency as the nation confronts the dual challenge of electricity supply security climate change.”
During his time as commissioner, Wellinghoff also received the EnerNoc Thought Leadership Award at a summit on energy efficiency and the Award for Leadership in Demand Response from the U.S. Demand Response Coordinating Committee.
FERC chairman[edit]
On March 19, 2009, President Barack Obama named Wellinghoff as FERC Chairman. Wellinghoff quickly established three top priorities for his term: the integration of renewable energy sources, including wind, solar geothermal and hydrokinetic energy, into the electric grid; the implementation of advanced technologies aimed at making the use and distribution of energy more efficient; and the promotion of demand-side energy practices, including real-time electricity pricing and the use of electric cars. All three of these priorities will emphasize improvements to the overall efficiency of the nation’s energy infrastructure.
Wellinghoff has vowed to pursue his priorities through the implementation of regulatory practices that ensure a fair and competitive energy market, pointing out that it is through competitive energy markets that consumers will reap the full benefits of new technology.
To promote policies that will increase renewable energy and improve energy efficiency, Wellinghoff created a new office within the Commission: the Office of Energy Policy and Innovation. The office is tasked with providing leadership in the development and formulation of policies and regulations to address emerging issues affecting wholesale and interstate energy markets.
The potential of renewable energy resources to expand our energy supply while decreasing adverse environmental impact has been an interest of Wellinghoff throughout his career. Obstacles remain, however, to the full utilization of wind, solar, geothermal, and hydrokinetic energy. While these resources provide a growing share of America’s energy, they remain hampered by their often remote proximity to major population centers and other impediments. Wellinghoff has made the integration of these resources into the energy market a key aspect of his agenda.
Renewable integration will also be facilitated by another of the Wellinghoff’s priorities, the development and implementation of advanced broadband and digital technologies collectively referred to as “smart grid.” This push to modernize the nation’s energy infrastructure will allow consumers and providers to make more informed decisions about how they use electricity. Problems stemming from the variable nature of some renewable energy technologies would be reduced if grid operators could easily rely on alternatives when encountering high demand or unfavorable natural conditions.
On July 16, 2009, the Commission released a Smart Grid Policy Statement setting priorities for the adoption of new standards and practices that will best enable FERC to facilitate the widespread and expedited use of smart grid technology.
A major component of an effective smart grid will be improved demand response capabilities, the third of Wellinghoff’s top priorities. Wellinghoff has labeled demand response the “killer app” for the smart grid. This form of enhanced, two-way communication would allow electricity providers to pay consumers to use less electricity. At times of peak demand (and peak prices) and other times of grid stress or need, consumers could respond by modifying their usage. Grid operators could, in turn, respond with more efficient management of available resources and avoid the high expenses associated with putting another power plant on-line to generate the electricity necessary to meet demand. Less wasted electricity would help lower prices for everyone and foster a more efficient and environmentally sustainable market. FERC’s most recent assessment of the country’s demand response potential concluded that peak demand could be reduced by as much 188 GW, or roughly 20%, by 2019.
Wellinghoff has worked to create a receptive environment for new and emerging energy technologies such as hydrokinetic energy. Under his leadership, the Commission has continued to collaborate with the Department of the Interior to incubate the growth of this technology. This partnership will facilitate the development of offshore hydrokinetic projects as well as wind and solar projects. Similarly, the Commission has signed agreements with states such as Maine and Washington that will help fast-track new projects while ensuring that associated environmental concerns are given careful agreement.
Under Wellinghoff's leadership the Commission issued FERC Order 745 on March 15, 2011, which prescribes how providers of demand response are to be compensated in the organized wholesale markets. This order was opposed by energy economists including Professor William W. Hogan of Harvard's John F. Kennedy School. Professor Hogan and Robert Borlick asserted that Order 745 overcompensates demand response and is likely to produce excessive curtailment of electricity usage and U.S. economic output at a time of high unemployment. Furthermore, Borlick said that these subsidies will primarily benefit large industrial companies but will be paid for by residential customers and small businesses. Order 745 was approved by the Commission on a 4-1 vote; Commissioner Phillip D. Moeller filed a dissenting opinion. The order's compensation scheme was supported by the late Alfred Kahn, then Robert Julius Thorne Professor of Political Economy, Emeritus, at Cornell University, and Special Consultant to National Economic Research Associates, Inc. Dr. Kahn asserted that because demand response is in all essential respects economically equivalent to supply response, it should be treated and rewarded the same as generation in competitive power markets. All resources selected by the market should receive the same market-clearing price, he said. However, Order 745 also mandates the application of a complex and controversial cost-benefit test that limits excessive payments for demand response. Professor Kahn died before this test was introduced and some of his colleagues at NERA believe that he would have opposed such a test.
A debate regarding the economic efficiency and fairness of Order 745 appeared in a series of articles published in The Electricity Journal.[2][3][4]
The Edison Electric Institute, American Public Power Association, Electric Power Supply Association, the National Electric Cooperative Association and the Old Dominion Electric Cooperative have filed suit in the United States Court of Appeals, DC Circuit, against the FERC on grounds that Order 745 is anticompetitive and discriminatory. [5] Twenty one prominent energy economists, including Professor Hogan and Mr. Borlick, joined the plaintiffs as Amici Curiae.[6]
On May 23, 2014 a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit struck down FERC Order 745 on the grounds that the agency lacks jurisdiction over demand response because it is a retail activity and therefore exclusively subject to regulation at the state level. The panel further concluded that the FERC failed to properly consider Commissioner Moeller's persuasive arguments that Order 745 will result in unjust, discriminatory rates.[7] The FERC petitioned the court for an en banc review of the panel's decisions.
On May 4, 2015, the United States Supreme Court agreed to review the DC Circuit's ruling, addressing two questions:

Whether the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission reasonably concluded that it has authority under the Federal Power Act, 16 U. S. C. 791a et seq., to regulate the rules used by operators of wholesale electricity markets to pay for reductions in electricity consumption and to recoup those payments through adjustments to wholesale rates.
Whether the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the rule issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is arbitrary and capricious.[8]

On January 25, 2016, the Supreme Court upheld FERC 745, overruling the US Court of Appeals decision.[9] The Court affirmed that the FERC had jurisdiction over prices paid for wholesale demand response but did not endorse the specific compensation scheme prescribed by FERC 745, stating, " In upholding that action, we do not discount the cogency of EPSA’s arguments in favor of LMP-G. Nor do we say that in opting for LMP instead, FERC made the better call. It is not our job to render that judgment…. Our important but limited role is to ensure that the Commission engaged in reasoned decision making.[10]
Jon Wellinghoff submitted his resignation to U.S. President Barack Obama on May 5, 2013 and remained in the post until November 25, 2013, when the president appointed his successor, Cheryl A. LaFleur.[11]
For his work with the Energy Storage Community he received the Energy Storage Association's 2014 Phil Symons Award at their 24th Annual Conference.
SolarCity[edit]
On April 7, 2016, SolarCity announced Wellinghoff will join the company as Chief Policy Officer.[12]
Personal life[edit]
Wellinghoff is married to Karen Galatz and he has four children, Andrea, Sarah, Jules, and Jacob, and three grandchildren.
In October 2013, Jon joined the law firm Stoel Rives LLP as Co-Chair of the firm's Energy practice.

Mr. Wellinghoff is an internationally heralded champion of distributed energy resources and renewable energy and a Principal at Policy/DER. Most recently, Jon was the Chief Policy Officer for SolarCity. Jon was first appointed as a member of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) by President George W. Bush in 2006. He was named Chairman of FERC by President Barack Obama in 2009 and is perhaps best known for his authorship and implementation of FERC Order 745. FERC Order 745 catalyzed demand response as the "killer app" of the smart grid and was the subject of a Supreme Court of the United States battle that ultimately cemented demand response under the jurisdiction of FERC in wholesale energy markets. During his tenure at FERC, Jon also championed opening wholesale electric markets to renewable resources and various forms of distributed resources including energy efficiency, local energy storage systems, and plug-in electric vehicles.
Jon earned his bachelor's degree in mathematics from the University of Nevada, his masters in mathematics teaching from Howard University, and his law degree from Antioch University.
Mr. Giudice has more than 40 years of leadership experience across a broad spectrum of the energy industry, and is currently the CEO of Ambri, an energy storage company started at MIT, where it invented liquid metal batteries. Previously, Phil served the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as Undersecretary of Energy and as Commissioner of the Department of Energy Resources, the state agency with primary responsibility for fulfilling Governor Deval Patrick's vision for a clean energy future. Phil served as the National Association of State Energy Officers (NASEO) board chair as well as on the US Department of Energy's State Energy Advisory Board, Energy Efficiency and Renewables Advisory Committee, and State Energy Efficiency Action Network.
Prior to his service in the Patrick-Murray Administration, Phil was Senior Vice President and board member at EnerNOC. He was previously a senior partner and leader of Mercer Management Consulting's global energy utilities practice for 20 years. Phil is a geologist (B.S. from University of New Hampshire and M.S. in Economic Geology from the University of Arizona) and a management professional (M.B.A. from Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth).
"As we choose candidates for our strategic advisory board, we look for folks who combine tremendous experience and results with the kindred spirit of the Voltus culture: bright, gritty, and good. Jon and Phil exemplify the kinds of leaders we seek counsel from ... folks who think big, expect a lot from themselves and their teammates, and put potential into action. We're excited to drive results from the guidance they provide."

On July 16, 2009, the Commission released a Smart Grid Policy Statement setting priorities for the adoption of new standards and practices that will best enable FERC to facilitate the widespread and expedited use of smart grid technology.
A major component of an effective smart grid will be improved demand response capabilities, the third of Wellinghoff’s top priorities. Wellinghoff has labeled demand response the “killer app” for the smart grid. This form of enhanced, two-way communication would allow electricity providers to pay consumers to use less electricity. At times of peak demand (and peak prices) and other times of grid stress or need, consumers could respond by modifying their usage. Grid operators could, in turn, respond with more efficient management of available resources and avoid the high expenses associated with putting another power plant on-line to generate the electricity necessary to meet demand. Less wasted electricity would help lower prices for everyone and foster a more efficient and environmentally sustainable market. FERC’s most recent assessment of the country’s demand response potential concluded that peak demand could be reduced by as much 188 GW, or roughly 20%, by 2019.
Wellinghoff has worked to create a receptive environment for new and emerging energy technologies such as hydrokinetic energy. Under his leadership, the Commission has continued to collaborate with the Department of the Interior to incubate the growth of this technology. This partnership will facilitate the development of offshore hydrokinetic projects as well as wind and solar projects. Similarly, the Commission has signed agreements with states such as Maine and Washington that will help fast-track new projects while ensuring that associated environmental concerns are given careful agreement.
Under Wellinghoff's leadership the Commission issued FERC Order 745 on March 15, 2011, which prescribes how providers of demand response are to be compensated in the organized wholesale markets. This order was opposed by energy economists including Professor William W. Hogan of Harvard's John F. Kennedy School. Professor Hogan and Robert Borlick asserted that Order 745 overcompensates demand response and is likely to produce excessive curtailment of electricity usage and U.S. economic output at a time of high unemployment. Furthermore, Borlick said that these subsidies will primarily benefit large industrial companies but will be paid for by residential customers and small businesses. Order 745 was approved by the Commission on a 4-1 vote; Commissioner Phillip D. Moeller filed a dissenting opinion. The order's compensation scheme was supported by the late Alfred Kahn, then Robert Julius Thorne Professor of Political Economy, Emeritus, at Cornell University, and Special Consultant to National Economic Research Associates, Inc. Dr. Kahn asserted that because demand response is in all essential respects economically equivalent to supply response, it should be treated and rewarded the same as generation in competitive power markets. All resources selected by the market should receive the same market-clearing price, he said. However, Order 745 also mandates the application of a complex and controversial cost-benefit test that limits excessive payments for demand response. Professor Kahn died before this test was introduced and some of his colleagues at NERA believe that he would have opposed such a test.
A debate regarding the economic efficiency and fairness of Order 745 appeared in a series of articles published in The Electricity Journal.[2][3][4]
The Edison Electric Institute, American Public Power Association, Electric Power Supply Association, the National Electric Cooperative Association and the Old Dominion Electric Cooperative have filed suit in the United States Court of Appeals, DC Circuit, against the FERC on grounds that Order 745 is anticompetitive and discriminatory. [5] Twenty one prominent energy economists, including Professor Hogan and Mr. Borlick, joined the plaintiffs as Amici Curiae.[6]
On May 23, 2014 a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit struck down FERC Order 745 on the grounds that the agency lacks jurisdiction over demand response because it is a retail activity and therefore exclusively subject to regulation at the state level. The panel further concluded that the FERC failed to properly consider Commissioner Moeller's persuasive arguments that Order 745 will result in unjust, discriminatory rates.[7] The FERC petitioned the court for an en banc review of the panel's decisions.
On May 4, 2015, the United States Supreme Court agreed to review the DC Circuit's ruling, addressing two questions:

Whether the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission reasonably concluded that it has authority under the Federal Power Act, 16 U. S. C. 791a et seq., to regulate the rules used by operators of wholesale electricity markets to pay for reductions in electricity consumption and to recoup those payments through adjustments to wholesale rates.
Whether the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the rule issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is arbitrary and capricious.[8]

On January 25, 2016, the Supreme Court upheld FERC 745, overruling the US Court of Appeals decision.[9] The Court affirmed that the FERC had jurisdiction over prices paid for wholesale demand response but did not endorse the specific compensation scheme prescribed by FERC 745, stating, " In upholding that action, we do not discount the cogency of EPSA’s arguments in favor of LMP-G. Nor do we say that in opting for LMP instead, FERC made the better call. It is not our job to render that judgment…. Our important but limited role is to ensure that the Commission engaged in reasoned decision making.[10]
Jon Wellinghoff submitted his resignation to U.S. President Barack Obama on May 5, 2013 and remained in the post until November 25, 2013, when the president appointed his successor, Cheryl A. LaFleur.[11]
For his work with the Energy Storage Community he received the Energy Storage Association's 2014 Phil Symons Award at their 24th Annual Conference.
SolarCity[edit]
On April 7, 2016, SolarCity announced Wellinghoff will join the company as Chief Policy Officer.[12]
Personal life[edit]
Wellinghoff is married to Karen Galatz and he has four children, Andrea, Sarah, Jules, and Jacob, and three grandchildren.
In October 2013, Jon joined the law firm Stoel Rives LLP as Co-Chair of the firm's Energy practice.

Jon Wellinghoff (born May 30, 1949) is an American attorney who served as the chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) from 2009 to 2013. The FERC is a U.S. government agency that regulates the interstate transmission of electricity, natural gas, and oil. The FERC also reviews proposals to build liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals and interstate natural gas pipelines and licenses hydropower projects.
Wellinghoff's work in energy-related fields has included renewable integration, plug-in electric vehicles, and the modernization of the American electric grid. In November 2013, Wellinghoff stepped down from his post as the 13th FERC chairman.[1]

Early life and education[edit]
Wellinghoff was born in Santa Monica, California on May 30, 1949, and moved to Reno, Nevada, at the age of four. He attended the University of Nevada-Reno, earning a B.S. in mathematics in 1971. The following year he earned a Master's degree in teaching mathematics from Howard University and stayed in Washington, D.C., to attend Antioch School of Law where he earned his J.D. in 1975.
Wellinghoff returned to Nevada where he would specialize in energy law for more than 30 years. In private practice, he focused exclusively on cases pertaining to renewable energy and energy efficiency, causes he continued to promote as FERC Chairman. He was the primary author of Nevada’s Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS), one of two state RPS programs to receive an “A” rating from the Union of Concerned Scientists.
Wellinghoff has also held a variety of positions in the public sector, providing legal counsel on energy issues to, among others, the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee, the Federal Trade Commission and the Nevada Public Utility Commission.
Consumer protection was another hallmark of Wellinghoff’s career prior to joining FERC. In his hometown of Reno, he held the position of Deputy District Attorney in the Washoe County District Attorney’s Consumer Fraud division. His work on behalf of consumers helped make him Nevada’s first Consumer Advocate for customers of public utilities. In that role, he argued for the public in cases before FERC, the Nevada Supreme Court and what is now the Nevada Public Utility Commission.
Career[edit]
FERC commissioner[edit]
In 2006, Wellinghoff was appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate as one of the five commissioners at the FERC.
As commissioner, Wellinghoff was influential in moving FERC towards prioritizing the removal of barriers to integration of renewable energy into the electric grid. He has been an advocate of “demand response” and “smart grid” technologies that will facilitate coordination and communication between electricity consumers and providers, allowing consumers to have greater control over their energy usage and the associated costs.
Wellinghoff was an early proponent of improving energy infrastructure to accommodate future demands from automobiles powered primarily by electricity. He coined the phrase “Cashback Car” in a contribution to the Brookings Institution publication, “Plug-In Electric Vehicles: What Role for Washington?” In it, he envisioned a future where drivers not only save money by switching from gasoline but are paid by utilities for use of their batteries to provide and store electricity. Wellinghoff explained that while the necessary technology already exists, improvements to infrastructure will be needed to make the “Cashback Car” a reality.
In 2008, the Alliance to Save Energy honored Wellinghoff with its prestigious Charles Percy Award for Public Service. The non-profit group bestowed the award “in recognition of [his] decades of outstanding public service and his expertise and leadership on energy efficiency as the nation confronts the dual challenge of electricity supply security climate change.”
During his time as commissioner, Wellinghoff also received the EnerNoc Thought Leadership Award at a summit on energy efficiency and the Award for Leadership in Demand Response from the U.S. Demand Response Coordinating Committee.
FERC chairman[edit]
On March 19, 2009, President Barack Obama named Wellinghoff as FERC Chairman. Wellinghoff quickly established three top priorities for his term: the integration of renewable energy sources, including wind, solar geothermal and hydrokinetic energy, into the electric grid; the implementation of advanced technologies aimed at making the use and distribution of energy more efficient; and the promotion of demand-side energy practices, including real-time electricity pricing and the use of electric cars. All three of these priorities will emphasize improvements to the overall efficiency of the nation’s energy infrastructure.
Wellinghoff has vowed to pursue his priorities through the implementation of regulatory practices that ensure a fair and competitive energy market, pointing out that it is through competitive energy markets that consumers will reap the full benefits of new technology.
To promote policies that will increase renewable energy and improve energy efficiency, Wellinghoff created a new office within the Commission: the Office of Energy Policy and Innovation. The office is tasked with providing leadership in the development and formulation of policies and regulations to address emerging issues affecting wholesale and interstate energy markets.
The potential of renewable energy resources to expand our energy supply while decreasing adverse environmental impact has been an interest of Wellinghoff throughout his career. Obstacles remain, however, to the full utilization of wind, solar, geothermal, and hydrokinetic energy. While these resources provide a growing share of America’s energy, they remain hampered by their often remote proximity to major population centers and other impediments. Wellinghoff has made the integration of these resources into the energy market a key aspect of his agenda.
Renewable integration will also be facilitated by another of the Wellinghoff’s priorities, the development and implementation of advanced broadband and digital technologies collectively referred to as “smart grid.” This push to modernize the nation’s energy infrastructure will allow consumers and providers to make more informed decisions about how they use electricity. Problems stemming from the variable nature of some renewable energy technologies would be reduced if grid operators could easily rely on alternatives when encountering high demand or unfavorable natural conditions.
On July 16, 2009, the Commission released a Smart Grid Policy Statement setting priorities for the adoption of new standards and practices that will best enable FERC to facilitate the widespread and expedited use of smart grid technology.
A major component of an effective smart grid will be improved demand response capabilities, the third of Wellinghoff’s top priorities. Wellinghoff has labeled demand response the “killer app” for the smart grid. This form of enhanced, two-way communication would allow electricity providers to pay consumers to use less electricity. At times of peak demand (and peak prices) and other times of grid stress or need, consumers could respond by modifying their usage. Grid operators could, in turn, respond with more efficient management of available resources and avoid the high expenses associated with putting another power plant on-line to generate the electricity necessary to meet demand. Less wasted electricity would help lower prices for everyone and foster a more efficient and environmentally sustainable market. FERC’s most recent assessment of the country’s demand response potential concluded that peak demand could be reduced by as much 188 GW, or roughly 20%, by 2019.

This partnership will facilitate the development of offshore hydrokinetic projects as well as wind and solar projects.

Jon Wellinghoff (born May 30, 1949) is an American attorney who served as the chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) from 2009 to 2013. The FERC is a U.S. government agency that regulates the interstate transmission of electricity, natural gas, and oil. The FERC also reviews proposals to build liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals and interstate natural gas pipelines and licenses hydropower projects.
Wellinghoff's work in energy-related fields has included renewable integration, plug-in electric vehicles, and the modernization of the American electric grid. In November 2013, Wellinghoff stepped down from his post as the 13th FERC chairman.[1]

Early life and education[edit]
Wellinghoff was born in Santa Monica, California on May 30, 1949, and moved to Reno, Nevada, at the age of four. He attended the University of Nevada-Reno, earning a B.S. in mathematics in 1971. The following year he earned a Master's degree in teaching mathematics from Howard University and stayed in Washington, D.C., to attend Antioch School of Law where he earned his J.D. in 1975.
Wellinghoff returned to Nevada where he would specialize in energy law for more than 30 years. In private practice, he focused exclusively on cases pertaining to renewable energy and energy efficiency, causes he continued to promote as FERC Chairman. He was the primary author of Nevada’s Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS), one of two state RPS programs to receive an “A” rating from the Union of Concerned Scientists.
Wellinghoff has also held a variety of positions in the public sector, providing legal counsel on energy issues to, among others, the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee, the Federal Trade Commission and the Nevada Public Utility Commission.
Consumer protection was another hallmark of Wellinghoff’s career prior to joining FERC. In his hometown of Reno, he held the position of Deputy District Attorney in the Washoe County District Attorney’s Consumer Fraud division. His work on behalf of consumers helped make him Nevada’s first Consumer Advocate for customers of public utilities. In that role, he argued for the public in cases before FERC, the Nevada Supreme Court and what is now the Nevada Public Utility Commission.
Career[edit]
FERC commissioner[edit]
In 2006, Wellinghoff was appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate as one of the five commissioners at the FERC.
As commissioner, Wellinghoff was influential in moving FERC towards prioritizing the removal of barriers to integration of renewable energy into the electric grid. He has been an advocate of “demand response” and “smart grid” technologies that will facilitate coordination and communication between electricity consumers and providers, allowing consumers to have greater control over their energy usage and the associated costs.
Wellinghoff was an early proponent of improving energy infrastructure to accommodate future demands from automobiles powered primarily by electricity. He coined the phrase “Cashback Car” in a contribution to the Brookings Institution publication, “Plug-In Electric Vehicles: What Role for Washington?” In it, he envisioned a future where drivers not only save money by switching from gasoline but are paid by utilities for use of their batteries to provide and store electricity. Wellinghoff explained that while the necessary technology already exists, improvements to infrastructure will be needed to make the “Cashback Car” a reality.
In 2008, the Alliance to Save Energy honored Wellinghoff with its prestigious Charles Percy Award for Public Service. The non-profit group bestowed the award “in recognition of [his] decades of outstanding public service and his expertise and leadership on energy efficiency as the nation confronts the dual challenge of electricity supply security climate change.”
During his time as commissioner, Wellinghoff also received the EnerNoc Thought Leadership Award at a summit on energy efficiency and the Award for Leadership in Demand Response from the U.S. Demand Response Coordinating Committee.
FERC chairman[edit]
On March 19, 2009, President Barack Obama named Wellinghoff as FERC Chairman. Wellinghoff quickly established three top priorities for his term: the integration of renewable energy sources, including wind, solar geothermal and hydrokinetic energy, into the electric grid; the implementation of advanced technologies aimed at making the use and distribution of energy more efficient; and the promotion of demand-side energy practices, including real-time electricity pricing and the use of electric cars. All three of these priorities will emphasize improvements to the overall efficiency of the nation’s energy infrastructure.
Wellinghoff has vowed to pursue his priorities through the implementation of regulatory practices that ensure a fair and competitive energy market, pointing out that it is through competitive energy markets that consumers will reap the full benefits of new technology.
To promote policies that will increase renewable energy and improve energy efficiency, Wellinghoff created a new office within the Commission: the Office of Energy Policy and Innovation. The office is tasked with providing leadership in the development and formulation of policies and regulations to address emerging issues affecting wholesale and interstate energy markets.
The potential of renewable energy resources to expand our energy supply while decreasing adverse environmental impact has been an interest of Wellinghoff throughout his career. Obstacles remain, however, to the full utilization of wind, solar, geothermal, and hydrokinetic energy. While these resources provide a growing share of America’s energy, they remain hampered by their often remote proximity to major population centers and other impediments. Wellinghoff has made the integration of these resources into the energy market a key aspect of his agenda.
Renewable integration will also be facilitated by another of the Wellinghoff’s priorities, the development and implementation of advanced broadband and digital technologies collectively referred to as “smart grid.” This push to modernize the nation’s energy infrastructure will allow consumers and providers to make more informed decisions about how they use electricity. Problems stemming from the variable nature of some renewable energy technologies would be reduced if grid operators could easily rely on alternatives when encountering high demand or unfavorable natural conditions.
On July 16, 2009, the Commission released a Smart Grid Policy Statement setting priorities for the adoption of new standards and practices that will best enable FERC to facilitate the widespread and expedited use of smart grid technology.
A major component of an effective smart grid will be improved demand response capabilities, the third of Wellinghoff’s top priorities. Wellinghoff has labeled demand response the “killer app” for the smart grid. This form of enhanced, two-way communication would allow electricity providers to pay consumers to use less electricity. At times of peak demand (and peak prices) and other times of grid stress or need, consumers could respond by modifying their usage. Grid operators could, in turn, respond with more efficient management of available resources and avoid the high expenses associated with putting another power plant on-line to generate the electricity necessary to meet demand. Less wasted electricity would help lower prices for everyone and foster a more efficient and environmentally sustainable market. FERC’s most recent assessment of the country’s demand response potential concluded that peak demand could be reduced by as much 188 GW, or roughly 20%, by 2019.
Wellinghoff has worked to create a receptive environment for new and emerging energy technologies such as hydrokinetic energy. Under his leadership, the Commission has continued to collaborate with the Department of the Interior to incubate the growth of this technology. This partnership will facilitate the development of offshore hydrokinetic projects as well as wind and solar projects. Similarly, the Commission has signed agreements with states such as Maine and Washington that will help fast-track new projects while ensuring that associated environmental concerns are given careful agreement.
Under Wellinghoff's leadership the Commission issued FERC Order 745 on March 15, 2011, which prescribes how providers of demand response are to be compensated in the organized wholesale markets. This order was opposed by energy economists including Professor William W. Hogan of Harvard's John F. Kennedy School. Professor Hogan and Robert Borlick asserted that Order 745 overcompensates demand response and is likely to produce excessive curtailment of electricity usage and U.S. economic output at a time of high unemployment. Furthermore, Borlick said that these subsidies will primarily benefit large industrial companies but will be paid for by residential customers and small businesses. Order 745 was approved by the Commission on a 4-1 vote; Commissioner Phillip D. Moeller filed a dissenting opinion. The order's compensation scheme was supported by the late Alfred Kahn, then Robert Julius Thorne Professor of Political Economy, Emeritus, at Cornell University, and Special Consultant to National Economic Research Associates, Inc. Dr. Kahn asserted that because demand response is in all essential respects economically equivalent to supply response, it should be treated and rewarded the same as generation in competitive power markets. All resources selected by the market should receive the same market-clearing price, he said. However, Order 745 also mandates the application of a complex and controversial cost-benefit test that limits excessive payments for demand response. Professor Kahn died before this test was introduced and some of his colleagues at NERA believe that he would have opposed such a test.
A debate regarding the economic efficiency and fairness of Order 745 appeared in a series of articles published in The Electricity Journal.[2][3][4]
The Edison Electric Institute, American Public Power Association, Electric Power Supply Association, the National Electric Cooperative Association and the Old Dominion Electric Cooperative have filed suit in the United States Court of Appeals, DC Circuit, against the FERC on grounds that Order 745 is anticompetitive and discriminatory. [5] Twenty one prominent energy economists, including Professor Hogan and Mr. Borlick, joined the plaintiffs as Amici Curiae.[6]
On May 23, 2014 a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit struck down FERC Order 745 on the grounds that the agency lacks jurisdiction over demand response because it is a retail activity and therefore exclusively subject to regulation at the state level. The panel further concluded that the FERC failed to properly consider Commissioner Moeller's persuasive arguments that Order 745 will result in unjust, discriminatory rates.[7] The FERC petitioned the court for an en banc review of the panel's decisions.
On May 4, 2015, the United States Supreme Court agreed to review the DC Circuit's ruling, addressing two questions:

Whether the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission reasonably concluded that it has authority under the Federal Power Act, 16 U. S. C. 791a et seq., to regulate the rules used by operators of wholesale electricity markets to pay for reductions in electricity consumption and to recoup those payments through adjustments to wholesale rates.
Whether the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the rule issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is arbitrary and capricious.[8]

On January 25, 2016, the Supreme Court upheld FERC 745, overruling the US Court of Appeals decision.[9] The Court affirmed that the FERC had jurisdiction over prices paid for wholesale demand response but did not endorse the specific compensation scheme prescribed by FERC 745, stating, " In upholding that action, we do not discount the cogency of EPSA’s arguments in favor of LMP-G. Nor do we say that in opting for LMP instead, FERC made the better call. It is not our job to render that judgment…. Our important but limited role is to ensure that the Commission engaged in reasoned decision making.[10]
Jon Wellinghoff submitted his resignation to U.S. President Barack Obama on May 5, 2013 and remained in the post until November 25, 2013, when the president appointed his successor, Cheryl A. LaFleur.[11]
For his work with the Energy Storage Community he received the Energy Storage Association's 2014 Phil Symons Award at their 24th Annual Conference.
SolarCity[edit]
On April 7, 2016, SolarCity announced Wellinghoff will join the company as Chief Policy Officer.[12]
Personal life[edit]
Wellinghoff is married to Karen Galatz and he has four children, Andrea, Sarah, Jules, and Jacob, and three grandchildren.
In October 2013, Jon joined the law firm Stoel Rives LLP as Co-Chair of the firm's Energy practice.

SAN MATEO, Calif., April 7, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- SolarCity Corporation (NASDAQ:   SCTY) announced today that former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Chairman Jon Wellinghoff is joining SolarCity in the position of Chief Policy Officer. 
Wellinghoff will join SolarCity's executive management team and will report to Chief Executive Officer Lyndon Rive. His responsibilities will include advising on federal and state policy for SolarCity and the overseeing of both regulatory and legislative affairs for the company. 








He was the longest serving chair in FERC's history, serving in that role from 2009 to 2013. During his FERC tenure, Wellinghoff led efforts to integrate solar and wind resources into wholesale electric markets and ensure that behind the meter customer-owned resources like demand response and distributed generation were given an opportunity to participate in those markets. His efforts as Chairman were affirmed by the recent U.S. Supreme Court (6-2) decision in FERC v. ESPA upholding FERC jurisdiction in its Order 745 to include customer demand response in wholesale electric markets. Among his many honors, Wellinghoff was recently nominated to the Public Utility Fortnightly list of the 10 most influential leaders who have shaped the world of utilities since 1990.
"Decades before the electricity sector was seriously considering a future distributed grid, Jon was implementing smart policies that would, in 2016, put us right on the cusp of the most exciting shifts that sector has ever seen," said Rive. "With Jon leading our policy efforts, SolarCity will seek opportunities to collaborate and partner with utilities while ensuring that rooftop solar's full benefits to ratepayers and to the grid are considered and factored into all rate cases and resource discussions."
Wellinghoff also served as General Counsel at the Nevada Public Utilities Commission (1998-2000), and served two terms as the State of Nevada's first Advocate for Customers of Public Utilities. 
"I've devoted my career to advocating for the electricity consumers. And from my review there is great benefit to those consumers from distributed solar generation—clearly numerous studies have demonstrated it benefits all ratepayers, even those who don't install panels on their roof," said Wellinghoff. "SolarCity has done more than any other organization to advance rooftop solar in the United States, and I can think of no greater opportunity to continue my work to unlock the potential benefit of distributed solar generation for all consumers in this country."   
After establishing SolarCity's Policy and Electricity Markets team over the course of a distinguished, seven-year tenure at the company, John Stanton is departing to pursue other opportunities. Stanton helped recruit Wellinghoff, and will remain with SolarCity through this summer to ensure a smooth transition.
"John Stanton helped build SolarCity into what it is today, and he and his team helped lay the foundation for the rooftop solar industry's phenomenal growth," said Rive. "I thank him for his tireless, lifelong commitment to fighting fossil fuels and advancing the cause of clean energy."
Wellinghoff most recently served as Partner at the law firm Stoel Rives, where he provided expertise in energy law and the development of clean energy technology, consulting on energy policy with leaders in the U.S., China, Australia and Europe.

Jon Wellinghoff (born May 30, 1949) is an American attorney who served as the chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) from 2009 to 2013. The FERC is a U.S. government agency that regulates the interstate transmission of electricity, natural gas, and oil. The FERC also reviews proposals to build liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals and interstate natural gas pipelines and licenses hydropower projects.
Wellinghoff's work in energy-related fields has included renewable integration, plug-in electric vehicles, and the modernization of the American electric grid. In November 2013, Wellinghoff stepped down from his post as the 13th FERC chairman.[1]

Early life and education[edit]
Wellinghoff was born in Santa Monica, California on May 30, 1949, and moved to Reno, Nevada, at the age of four. He attended the University of Nevada-Reno, earning a B.S. in mathematics in 1971. The following year he earned a Master's degree in teaching mathematics from Howard University and stayed in Washington, D.C., to attend Antioch School of Law where he earned his J.D. in 1975.
Wellinghoff returned to Nevada where he would specialize in energy law for more than 30 years. In private practice, he focused exclusively on cases pertaining to renewable energy and energy efficiency, causes he continued to promote as FERC Chairman. He was the primary author of Nevada’s Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS), one of two state RPS programs to receive an “A” rating from the Union of Concerned Scientists.
Wellinghoff has also held a variety of positions in the public sector, providing legal counsel on energy issues to, among others, the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee, the Federal Trade Commission and the Nevada Public Utility Commission.
Consumer protection was another hallmark of Wellinghoff’s career prior to joining FERC. In his hometown of Reno, he held the position of Deputy District Attorney in the Washoe County District Attorney’s Consumer Fraud division. His work on behalf of consumers helped make him Nevada’s first Consumer Advocate for customers of public utilities. In that role, he argued for the public in cases before FERC, the Nevada Supreme Court and what is now the Nevada Public Utility Commission.
Career[edit]
FERC commissioner[edit]
In 2006, Wellinghoff was appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate as one of the five commissioners at the FERC.
As commissioner, Wellinghoff was influential in moving FERC towards prioritizing the removal of barriers to integration of renewable energy into the electric grid. He has been an advocate of “demand response” and “smart grid” technologies that will facilitate coordination and communication between electricity consumers and providers, allowing consumers to have greater control over their energy usage and the associated costs.
Wellinghoff was an early proponent of improving energy infrastructure to accommodate future demands from automobiles powered primarily by electricity. He coined the phrase “Cashback Car” in a contribution to the Brookings Institution publication, “Plug-In Electric Vehicles: What Role for Washington?” In it, he envisioned a future where drivers not only save money by switching from gasoline but are paid by utilities for use of their batteries to provide and store electricity. Wellinghoff explained that while the necessary technology already exists, improvements to infrastructure will be needed to make the “Cashback Car” a reality.
In 2008, the Alliance to Save Energy honored Wellinghoff with its prestigious Charles Percy Award for Public Service. The non-profit group bestowed the award “in recognition of [his] decades of outstanding public service and his expertise and leadership on energy efficiency as the nation confronts the dual challenge of electricity supply security climate change.”
During his time as commissioner, Wellinghoff also received the EnerNoc Thought Leadership Award at a summit on energy efficiency and the Award for Leadership in Demand Response from the U.S. Demand Response Coordinating Committee.
FERC chairman[edit]
On March 19, 2009, President Barack Obama named Wellinghoff as FERC Chairman. Wellinghoff quickly established three top priorities for his term: the integration of renewable energy sources, including wind, solar geothermal and hydrokinetic energy, into the electric grid; the implementation of advanced technologies aimed at making the use and distribution of energy more efficient; and the promotion of demand-side energy practices, including real-time electricity pricing and the use of electric cars. All three of these priorities will emphasize improvements to the overall efficiency of the nation’s energy infrastructure.
Wellinghoff has vowed to pursue his priorities through the implementation of regulatory practices that ensure a fair and competitive energy market, pointing out that it is through competitive energy markets that consumers will reap the full benefits of new technology.
To promote policies that will increase renewable energy and improve energy efficiency, Wellinghoff created a new office within the Commission: the Office of Energy Policy and Innovation. The office is tasked with providing leadership in the development and formulation of policies and regulations to address emerging issues affecting wholesale and interstate energy markets.
The potential of renewable energy resources to expand our energy supply while decreasing adverse environmental impact has been an interest of Wellinghoff throughout his career. Obstacles remain, however, to the full utilization of wind, solar, geothermal, and hydrokinetic energy. While these resources provide a growing share of America’s energy, they remain hampered by their often remote proximity to major population centers and other impediments. Wellinghoff has made the integration of these resources into the energy market a key aspect of his agenda.
Renewable integration will also be facilitated by another of the Wellinghoff’s priorities, the development and implementation of advanced broadband and digital technologies collectively referred to as “smart grid.” This push to modernize the nation’s energy infrastructure will allow consumers and providers to make more informed decisions about how they use electricity. Problems stemming from the variable nature of some renewable energy technologies would be reduced if grid operators could easily rely on alternatives when encountering high demand or unfavorable natural conditions.
On July 16, 2009, the Commission released a Smart Grid Policy Statement setting priorities for the adoption of new standards and practices that will best enable FERC to facilitate the widespread and expedited use of smart grid technology.
A major component of an effective smart grid will be improved demand response capabilities, the third of Wellinghoff’s top priorities. Wellinghoff has labeled demand response the “killer app” for the smart grid. This form of enhanced, two-way communication would allow electricity providers to pay consumers to use less electricity. At times of peak demand (and peak prices) and other times of grid stress or need, consumers could respond by modifying their usage. Grid operators could, in turn, respond with more efficient management of available resources and avoid the high expenses associated with putting another power plant on-line to generate the electricity necessary to meet demand. Less wasted electricity would help lower prices for everyone and foster a more efficient and environmentally sustainable market. FERC’s most recent assessment of the country’s demand response potential concluded that peak demand could be reduced by as much 188 GW, or roughly 20%, by 2019.
Wellinghoff has worked to create a receptive environment for new and emerging energy technologies such as hydrokinetic energy. Under his leadership, the Commission has continued to collaborate with the Department of the Interior to incubate the growth of this technology. This partnership will facilitate the development of offshore hydrokinetic projects as well as wind and solar projects. Similarly, the Commission has signed agreements with states such as Maine and Washington that will help fast-track new projects while ensuring that associated environmental concerns are given careful agreement.
Under Wellinghoff's leadership the Commission issued FERC Order 745 on March 15, 2011, which prescribes how providers of demand response are to be compensated in the organized wholesale markets. This order was opposed by energy economists including Professor William W. Hogan of Harvard's John F. Kennedy School. Professor Hogan and Robert Borlick asserted that Order 745 overcompensates demand response and is likely to produce excessive curtailment of electricity usage and U.S. economic output at a time of high unemployment. Furthermore, Borlick said that these subsidies will primarily benefit large industrial companies but will be paid for by residential customers and small businesses. Order 745 was approved by the Commission on a 4-1 vote; Commissioner Phillip D. Moeller filed a dissenting opinion. The order's compensation scheme was supported by the late Alfred Kahn, then Robert Julius Thorne Professor of Political Economy, Emeritus, at Cornell University, and Special Consultant to National Economic Research Associates, Inc. Dr. Kahn asserted that because demand response is in all essential respects economically equivalent to supply response, it should be treated and rewarded the same as generation in competitive power markets. All resources selected by the market should receive the same market-clearing price, he said. However, Order 745 also mandates the application of a complex and controversial cost-benefit test that limits excessive payments for demand response. Professor Kahn died before this test was introduced and some of his colleagues at NERA believe that he would have opposed such a test.
A debate regarding the economic efficiency and fairness of Order 745 appeared in a series of articles published in The Electricity Journal.[2][3][4]
The Edison Electric Institute, American Public Power Association, Electric Power Supply Association, the National Electric Cooperative Association and the Old Dominion Electric Cooperative have filed suit in the United States Court of Appeals, DC Circuit, against the FERC on grounds that Order 745 is anticompetitive and discriminatory. [5] Twenty one prominent energy economists, including Professor Hogan and Mr. Borlick, joined the plaintiffs as Amici Curiae.[6]
On May 23, 2014 a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit struck down FERC Order 745 on the grounds that the agency lacks jurisdiction over demand response because it is a retail activity and therefore exclusively subject to regulation at the state level. The panel further concluded that the FERC failed to properly consider Commissioner Moeller's persuasive arguments that Order 745 will result in unjust, discriminatory rates.[7] The FERC petitioned the court for an en banc review of the panel's decisions.
On May 4, 2015, the United States Supreme Court agreed to review the DC Circuit's ruling, addressing two questions:

Whether the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission reasonably concluded that it has authority under the Federal Power Act, 16 U. S. C. 791a et seq., to regulate the rules used by operators of wholesale electricity markets to pay for reductions in electricity consumption and to recoup those payments through adjustments to wholesale rates.
Whether the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the rule issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is arbitrary and capricious.[8]

On January 25, 2016, the Supreme Court upheld FERC 745, overruling the US Court of Appeals decision.[9] The Court affirmed that the FERC had jurisdiction over prices paid for wholesale demand response but did not endorse the specific compensation scheme prescribed by FERC 745, stating, " In upholding that action, we do not discount the cogency of EPSA’s arguments in favor of LMP-G. Nor do we say that in opting for LMP instead, FERC made the better call. It is not our job to render that judgment…. Our important but limited role is to ensure that the Commission engaged in reasoned decision making.[10]
Jon Wellinghoff submitted his resignation to U.S. President Barack Obama on May 5, 2013 and remained in the post until November 25, 2013, when the president appointed his successor, Cheryl A. LaFleur.[11]
For his work with the Energy Storage Community he received the Energy Storage Association's 2014 Phil Symons Award at their 24th Annual Conference.
SolarCity[edit]
On April 7, 2016, SolarCity announced Wellinghoff will join the company as Chief Policy Officer.[12]
Personal life[edit]
Wellinghoff is married to Karen Galatz and he has four children, Andrea, Sarah, Jules, and Jacob, and three grandchildren.
In October 2013, Jon joined the law firm Stoel Rives LLP as Co-Chair of the firm's Energy practice.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Jon Wellinghoff is the Chief Policy Officer of SolarCity, the number one provider of distributed solar energy in the United States, and the former chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Today, Jon advises SolarCity chairman Elon Musk on federal and state policy issues, and oversees SolarCity’s regulatory and legislative affairs. Hailed as one of the nation’s most influential voices on energy policy, Jon is an internationally recognized energy expert known for his forward-thinking approach to energy policy and his track record of moving the needle on the clean energy revolution. Exclusively represented by Leading Authorities speakers bureau, Jon draws on his decades experience in energy, policy, and business to discuss future opportunities in the fields of wind power, solar power, electric cars, and the development of smart cities, as well as implementing innovative business strategies and corporate cultures. His presentations reveal the promises and pitfalls of advanced energy technology coupled with eye-opening visuals and can’t-miss insights.
FERC Expertise. The longest serving chair in FERC history, Jon was instrumental in instituting visionary policies that opened the electric markets to competitive energy technologies including rooftop solar and electric vehicles. As a result, he has come to represent a monumental shift in energy policy and was dubbed a “new breed” of chairman by the Washington Post. During his tenure, he advocated for building a stronger national power grid through the use of renewable energies like wind and solar power, working to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign energy. He also backed the growth of U.S. hybrid vehicles and the creation of a national “smart grid” power source. He worked to make the U.S. power grid cleaner and more efficient, and championed the agency’s landmark Order 1000, which required grid planners and public utilities to coordinate regional power line projects and encouraged the integration of solar and wind installations.
As chairman, he also created FERC’s Office of Energy Policy and Innovation, which is responsible for investigating and promoting new efficient technologies and practices, and oversaw development of the National Assessment of Demand Response Potential and the National Action Plan for Demand Response. He also established three top priorities: the integration of renewable energy sources into the electric grid; the implementation of advanced technologies that make energy use and distribution more efficient; and the promotion of demand-side energy practices, including real-time electricity pricing and the use of electric cars. Jon has particular expertise in renewable integration, plug-in electric vehicles, energy storage and efficiency, demand response, and energy infrastructure security, including cyber security. He brings to the table experience in federal and state energy policy, regulation, and project development.  Legal Expertise. A renowned energy attorney, Jon is a partner at Stoel Rives LLP and co-chair of the firm’s energy team. He also served as general counsel at the Nevada Public Utilities Commission (1998–2000) and served two terms as the State of Nevada’s first Advocate for Customers of Public Utilities, where he authored the first comprehensive state utility integrated planning statute which later became a nationwide model. He was the primary author of the groundbreaking Nevada Renewable Portfolio Standard Act, and went on to assist six other states with the development of renewable portfolio standards.

The Future of Energy. In an engaging and smart presentation full of fascinating case studies and visuals, Jon Wellinghoff offers audiences a behind-the-scenes look at what the future of energy holds for the United States, detailing where we’ve been, where we are today, and, most importantly, where we’re going. Everything we depend upon is tied to energy. When the lights go out, we can’t get food, medicine, or gas. With no energy, we can’t extract ourselves from natural or man-made disasters like Hurricane Sandy or terrorism. How are we dealing with these issues? How are we preparing for the next steps? The future of energy will capitalize on the rapidly growing amount of distributed generation (ie energy produced by individuals via solar panels) and the connectivity of devices, utilities, and appliances to the “internet of everything.” This means that utilities must adapt their business models to the changing environment as we look to technology to facilitate this transition and improve our quality of life through increased energy efficiencies and control.
Energy Security. In an exciting – and sometimes hair-raising – presentation, Jon Wellinghoff shares insights into the state of our nation’s energy security. From the most significant domestic terror attack on the physical energy grid to how cyber security plays a role, he offers audiences a look at where we are now and where we need to be to prevent vulnerabilities. He shares the trends audiences need to know – from how big corporations and the military are moving to micro-grids so they’re not dependent on private infrastructure to how destroying nine substations can take down the entire country’s power for months (and how shoddy security both online and onsite feeds into the issue). With great visuals and stories, Wellinghoff lays out a plan and details what businesses and individuals can do to protect themselves.
Energy Politics, Policy, and Regulation. With interesting visuals and compelling anecdotes, Wellinghoff shares insights from his time as the head of the FERC to address the politics, policy, and regulation of energy. From introducing new standards for renewables to which key players will be affected most by upcoming policy changes, he offers an insider’s look into how energy policy gets made and details what organizations need to know about coming energy standards and practices.
A Day in the Life of the Grid. Wellinghoff takes audiences on an eye-opening tour of a “Day in the life of the energy grid.” With so much riding on the steady availability and cost of energy, this presentation is not to be missed. He looks at how the grid functions from an economic standpoint and how operators run independent whole sale markets in addition to managing substations and running operations. But if you could make the power grid more efficient you’d normalize the cost and drive it down for everyone. Wellinghoff shares fascinating anecdotes and slides of energy costs across time and looks at how we could change the grid’s efficiency/cost dynamic by consumers bidding products and technology into the system.

Jon Wellinghoff (born May 30, 1949) is an American attorney who served as the chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) from 2009 to 2013. The FERC is a U.S. government agency that regulates the interstate transmission of electricity, natural gas, and oil. The FERC also reviews proposals to build liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals and interstate natural gas pipelines and licenses hydropower projects.
Wellinghoff's work in energy-related fields has included renewable integration, plug-in electric vehicles, and the modernization of the American electric grid. In November 2013, Wellinghoff stepped down from his post as the 13th FERC chairman.[1]

Early life and education[edit]
Wellinghoff was born in Santa Monica, California on May 30, 1949, and moved to Reno, Nevada, at the age of four. He attended the University of Nevada-Reno, earning a B.S. in mathematics in 1971. The following year he earned a Master's degree in teaching mathematics from Howard University and stayed in Washington, D.C., to attend Antioch School of Law where he earned his J.D. in 1975.
Wellinghoff returned to Nevada where he would specialize in energy law for more than 30 years. In private practice, he focused exclusively on cases pertaining to renewable energy and energy efficiency, causes he continued to promote as FERC Chairman. He was the primary author of Nevada’s Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS), one of two state RPS programs to receive an “A” rating from the Union of Concerned Scientists.
Wellinghoff has also held a variety of positions in the public sector, providing legal counsel on energy issues to, among others, the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee, the Federal Trade Commission and the Nevada Public Utility Commission.
Consumer protection was another hallmark of Wellinghoff’s career prior to joining FERC. In his hometown of Reno, he held the position of Deputy District Attorney in the Washoe County District Attorney’s Consumer Fraud division. His work on behalf of consumers helped make him Nevada’s first Consumer Advocate for customers of public utilities. In that role, he argued for the public in cases before FERC, the Nevada Supreme Court and what is now the Nevada Public Utility Commission.
Career[edit]
FERC commissioner[edit]
In 2006, Wellinghoff was appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate as one of the five commissioners at the FERC.
As commissioner, Wellinghoff was influential in moving FERC towards prioritizing the removal of barriers to integration of renewable energy into the electric grid. He has been an advocate of “demand response” and “smart grid” technologies that will facilitate coordination and communication between electricity consumers and providers, allowing consumers to have greater control over their energy usage and the associated costs.
Wellinghoff was an early proponent of improving energy infrastructure to accommodate future demands from automobiles powered primarily by electricity. He coined the phrase “Cashback Car” in a contribution to the Brookings Institution publication, “Plug-In Electric Vehicles: What Role for Washington?” In it, he envisioned a future where drivers not only save money by switching from gasoline but are paid by utilities for use of their batteries to provide and store electricity. Wellinghoff explained that while the necessary technology already exists, improvements to infrastructure will be needed to make the “Cashback Car” a reality.
In 2008, the Alliance to Save Energy honored Wellinghoff with its prestigious Charles Percy Award for Public Service. The non-profit group bestowed the award “in recognition of [his] decades of outstanding public service and his expertise and leadership on energy efficiency as the nation confronts the dual challenge of electricity supply security climate change.”
During his time as commissioner, Wellinghoff also received the EnerNoc Thought Leadership Award at a summit on energy efficiency and the Award for Leadership in Demand Response from the U.S. Demand Response Coordinating Committee.
FERC chairman[edit]
On March 19, 2009, President Barack Obama named Wellinghoff as FERC Chairman. Wellinghoff quickly established three top priorities for his term: the integration of renewable energy sources, including wind, solar geothermal and hydrokinetic energy, into the electric grid; the implementation of advanced technologies aimed at making the use and distribution of energy more efficient; and the promotion of demand-side energy practices, including real-time electricity pricing and the use of electric cars. All three of these priorities will emphasize improvements to the overall efficiency of the nation’s energy infrastructure.
Wellinghoff has vowed to pursue his priorities through the implementation of regulatory practices that ensure a fair and competitive energy market, pointing out that it is through competitive energy markets that consumers will reap the full benefits of new technology.
To promote policies that will increase renewable energy and improve energy efficiency, Wellinghoff created a new office within the Commission: the Office of Energy Policy and Innovation. The office is tasked with providing leadership in the development and formulation of policies and regulations to address emerging issues affecting wholesale and interstate energy markets.
The potential of renewable energy resources to expand our energy supply while decreasing adverse environmental impact has been an interest of Wellinghoff throughout his career. Obstacles remain, however, to the full utilization of wind, solar, geothermal, and hydrokinetic energy. While these resources provide a growing share of America’s energy, they remain hampered by their often remote proximity to major population centers and other impediments. Wellinghoff has made the integration of these resources into the energy market a key aspect of his agenda.
Renewable integration will also be facilitated by another of the Wellinghoff’s priorities, the development and implementation of advanced broadband and digital technologies collectively referred to as “smart grid.” This push to modernize the nation’s energy infrastructure will allow consumers and providers to make more informed decisions about how they use electricity. Problems stemming from the variable nature of some renewable energy technologies would be reduced if grid operators could easily rely on alternatives when encountering high demand or unfavorable natural conditions.
On July 16, 2009, the Commission released a Smart Grid Policy Statement setting priorities for the adoption of new standards and practices that will best enable FERC to facilitate the widespread and expedited use of smart grid technology.
A major component of an effective smart grid will be improved demand response capabilities, the third of Wellinghoff’s top priorities. Wellinghoff has labeled demand response the “killer app” for the smart grid. This form of enhanced, two-way communication would allow electricity providers to pay consumers to use less electricity. At times of peak demand (and peak prices) and other times of grid stress or need, consumers could respond by modifying their usage. Grid operators could, in turn, respond with more efficient management of available resources and avoid the high expenses associated with putting another power plant on-line to generate the electricity necessary to meet demand. Less wasted electricity would help lower prices for everyone and foster a more efficient and environmentally sustainable market. FERC’s most recent assessment of the country’s demand response potential concluded that peak demand could be reduced by as much 188 GW, or roughly 20%, by 2019.
Wellinghoff has worked to create a receptive environment for new and emerging energy technologies such as hydrokinetic energy. Under his leadership, the Commission has continued to collaborate with the Department of the Interior to incubate the growth of this technology. This partnership will facilitate the development of offshore hydrokinetic projects as well as wind and solar projects. Similarly, the Commission has signed agreements with states such as Maine and Washington that will help fast-track new projects while ensuring that associated environmental concerns are given careful agreement.
Under Wellinghoff's leadership the Commission issued FERC Order 745 on March 15, 2011, which prescribes how providers of demand response are to be compensated in the organized wholesale markets. This order was opposed by energy economists including Professor William W. Hogan of Harvard's John F. Kennedy School. Professor Hogan and Robert Borlick asserted that Order 745 overcompensates demand response and is likely to produce excessive curtailment of electricity usage and U.S. economic output at a time of high unemployment. Furthermore, Borlick said that these subsidies will primarily benefit large industrial companies but will be paid for by residential customers and small businesses. Order 745 was approved by the Commission on a 4-1 vote; Commissioner Phillip D. Moeller filed a dissenting opinion. The order's compensation scheme was supported by the late Alfred Kahn, then Robert Julius Thorne Professor of Political Economy, Emeritus, at Cornell University, and Special Consultant to National Economic Research Associates, Inc. Dr. Kahn asserted that because demand response is in all essential respects economically equivalent to supply response, it should be treated and rewarded the same as generation in competitive power markets. All resources selected by the market should receive the same market-clearing price, he said. However, Order 745 also mandates the application of a complex and controversial cost-benefit test that limits excessive payments for demand response. Professor Kahn died before this test was introduced and some of his colleagues at NERA believe that he would have opposed such a test.
A debate regarding the economic efficiency and fairness of Order 745 appeared in a series of articles published in The Electricity Journal.[2][3][4]
The Edison Electric Institute, American Public Power Association, Electric Power Supply Association, the National Electric Cooperative Association and the Old Dominion Electric Cooperative have filed suit in the United States Court of Appeals, DC Circuit, against the FERC on grounds that Order 745 is anticompetitive and discriminatory. [5] Twenty one prominent energy economists, including Professor Hogan and Mr. Borlick, joined the plaintiffs as Amici Curiae.[6]
On May 23, 2014 a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit struck down FERC Order 745 on the grounds that the agency lacks jurisdiction over demand response because it is a retail activity and therefore exclusively subject to regulation at the state level. The panel further concluded that the FERC failed to properly consider Commissioner Moeller's persuasive arguments that Order 745 will result in unjust, discriminatory rates.[7] The FERC petitioned the court for an en banc review of the panel's decisions.
On May 4, 2015, the United States Supreme Court agreed to review the DC Circuit's ruling, addressing two questions:

Whether the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission reasonably concluded that it has authority under the Federal Power Act, 16 U. S. C. 791a et seq., to regulate the rules used by operators of wholesale electricity markets to pay for reductions in electricity consumption and to recoup those payments through adjustments to wholesale rates.
Whether the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the rule issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is arbitrary and capricious.[8]

On January 25, 2016, the Supreme Court upheld FERC 745, overruling the US Court of Appeals decision.[9] The Court affirmed that the FERC had jurisdiction over prices paid for wholesale demand response but did not endorse the specific compensation scheme prescribed by FERC 745, stating, " In upholding that action, we do not discount the cogency of EPSA’s arguments in favor of LMP-G. Nor do we say that in opting for LMP instead, FERC made the better call. It is not our job to render that judgment…. Our important but limited role is to ensure that the Commission engaged in reasoned decision making.[10]
Jon Wellinghoff submitted his resignation to U.S. President Barack Obama on May 5, 2013 and remained in the post until November 25, 2013, when the president appointed his successor, Cheryl A. LaFleur.[11]
For his work with the Energy Storage Community he received the Energy Storage Association's 2014 Phil Symons Award at their 24th Annual Conference.
SolarCity[edit]
On April 7, 2016, SolarCity announced Wellinghoff will join the company as Chief Policy Officer.[12]
Personal life[edit]
Wellinghoff is married to Karen Galatz and he has four children, Andrea, Sarah, Jules, and Jacob, and three grandchildren.
In October 2013, Jon joined the law firm Stoel Rives LLP as Co-Chair of the firm's Energy practice.

Early life and education[edit]
Wellinghoff was born in Santa Monica, California on May 30, 1949, and moved to Reno, Nevada, at the age of four. He attended the University of Nevada-Reno, earning a B.S. in mathematics in 1971. The following year he earned a Master's degree in teaching mathematics from Howard University and stayed in Washington, D.C., to attend Antioch School of Law where he earned his J.D. in 1975.
Wellinghoff returned to Nevada where he would specialize in energy law for more than 30 years. In private practice, he focused exclusively on cases pertaining to renewable energy and energy efficiency, causes he continued to promote as FERC Chairman. He was the primary author of Nevada’s Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS), one of two state RPS programs to receive an “A” rating from the Union of Concerned Scientists.
Wellinghoff has also held a variety of positions in the public sector, providing legal counsel on energy issues to, among others, the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee, the Federal Trade Commission and the Nevada Public Utility Commission.
Consumer protection was another hallmark of Wellinghoff’s career prior to joining FERC. In his hometown of Reno, he held the position of Deputy District Attorney in the Washoe County District Attorney’s Consumer Fraud division. His work on behalf of consumers helped make him Nevada’s first Consumer Advocate for customers of public utilities. In that role, he argued for the public in cases before FERC, the Nevada Supreme Court and what is now the Nevada Public Utility Commission.

Wellinghoff to utilities: Time to rethink your business model






Wellinghoff to utilities: Time to rethink your business modelGarrett HeringTuesday, May 27, 2014 - 7:00am














 




Jon Wellinghoff


Catch Jon Wellinghoff in person at VERGE SF 2014, October 27-30.
I first interviewed Jon Wellinghoff almost a decade ago — shortly after the well-known energy law attorney authored Nevada’s Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS). That was just before President George W. Bush appointed him to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), where, under President Obama, he eventually became the commission’s longest-serving chairman.
Since vacating his post late last year, Wellinghoff has been busy advancing a more competitive, more distributed and more efficient U.S. power grid as co-chair of Stoel Rives’ energy team. In this interview from Stoel Rives’ office in downtown San Francisco, Wellinghoff explains why utilities’ “entire model will be transformed.”
Garrett Hering: The last time we spoke, you had just helped to craft Nevada’s Renewable Portfolio Standard. That was shortly before you moved on to FERC, where you focused on making the U.S. power grid cleaner and more efficient. What are you doing for an encore?
Jon Wellinghoff: Well, I’m trying to move beyond policy to a point of actually implementing policy, implementing structures that I hope can be models for the new platforms of energy delivery services that we need to provide to customers. So I’ve got a number of clients. Some of them are large solar developers, for example, but not large in the sense of large systems, utility-sized systems. Mostly they develop distributed commercial and residential systems, but they’re very large companies. They’re interested in trying to collaborate with distribution utilities to develop new advanced models of those distribution platforms in ways to optimize the amount of distributed energy that would go on the platform.
So I’m working with them to see if we can first conceptualize what that model would look like and then sit down with distribution companies — whether they be municipal utilities or co-ops or investor-owned utilities — and see if we can collaborate with them to cooperatively develop this model. And we will do that, if need be, with the regulator, whether it be a state regulator or whomever, to see how these platforms can be optimized not only for distributed generation but also for the improvements in efficiency in those systems.
Hering: You’ve referred to demand response as the killer app of the smart grid. What do you mean by that exactly? 
Wellinghoff: Basically, I mean that consumer loads are resources that are almost totally untapped. As we start to have — and as we now do have — controls, control strategies and technologies that are so cost effective that all of these consumer loads can, in fact, be communicated to and controlled, then they become a huge resource for the grid. They become a resource for providing all types of grid services including energy, capacity and ancillary services that can be complimentary to traditional supply-side resources.
Once you have the ability to change the operation of your refrigerator or the freezer cases at Walmart, or the lighting in the local post office, you then have the ability to do many things that can make the system operate much, much more efficiently.
Hering: This is what you are working on together with the Advanced Energy Management Alliance?
Wellinghoff: Yes. That was my next point. We have a group that has been put together by a number of individual companies that is growing rapidly.
Hering: Big companies, too.
Wellinghoff: Very big companies. Walmart, one of the biggest companies in the world, is a member. There’s a number of big companies looking at joining, including Microsoft and others, and we also have big companies that do control work and demand response work, including Johnson Controls and EnerNOC and Comverge, and major people who are involved in the demand response service space are part of this group, as well.
The purpose of the group is to advocate for more advanced use of demand response throughout markets in the country and to work with both state regulators and the federal jurisdictional entities — the ISOs [independent system operators] and the RTOs [regional transmission organizations] that operate independent wholesale markets — and try to increase the amount of opportunities for consumer participation in those markets. It’s really very much a consumer-based organization.
The alliance only started in February, but we’ve got a very strong group. We’ve already met with PJM [the RTO for 13 mid-Atlantic states] and their upper management. We’ve met with the commissioners at FERC. We’ve met with members of Congress and Congressional committees. So we’ve really gotten the word out there that we are there to represent the demand response industry in providing information and assistance and expanding the opportunities for consumers to participate in markets.
Hering: How serious are competitive threats like battery-backed distributed solar and demand response to the U.S. electric utility industry that is generating nearly $400 billion in annual revenues? 
Wellinghoff: Well, there’s no question that it will transform their models. They will be forced to transform them into these distribution platforms that are primarily receiving revenues through a fixed fee, much like the cable companies that provide cable services to homes and businesses. So I think the entire model will be transformed. I think it will be a much more competitive model with competitive services on both sides of that platform.
On the supply side, there’ll be competitive services and competitive retail providers that will be acquiring energy from central station wind farms and other central station resources. Wind right now can be contracted for in Oklahoma at less than 3 cents a kilowatt-hour. It’s the least expensive central station resource that’s available on the grid bar none — on an incremental, new-resource basis. So there’ll be certainly people who will want to purchase power at those kinds of rates and then pay some incremental fixed fee for transmission and distribution delivery charges.
But the whole model of the utility as a vertically integrated entity, I think, will break down completely. I think the vertical integration will go away because there are no efficiencies in it anymore. The efficiencies are really in the competitive and distributed model — distributed in the sense of having separate parts and also the distributed options that consumers will have, including the ability to put solar on their house and also incorporate storage of some kind.
Those options will become very cost competitive. They are cost competitive now in Hawaii and California and other parts of the country. And that will only continue as the cost of those systems is driven down and electric prices for central station power continue to go up, as it’s delivered through a transmission and distribution system that continues to need more investment and more improvement. So I just foresee that the current central station and vertically integrated for-profit model for utilities will go away.
Hering: Do you see resistance to change out there among the more than 3,000 electric utilities in this country?
Wellinghoff: Oh, sure. Absolutely. I think most utilities, most utility executives, are fairly blind to the level of acceleration of these technologies and these changes that are occurring. I think they’re unaware of it. The only time they become aware of it is when they go out and do their load forecast and they keep seeing that the rate of load growth is decreasing and they keep saying to themselves, "Okay, is this a trend that’s going to change?" No, it’s not a trend that’s going to change. The level of rate of load growth is going to continue to decrease. It will get to zero at some point in time, but it will start going negative when you’ve got enough distributed generation put in.
Hering: So what do you do if you’re a utility? Can you innovate out of this crisis in your business model?
Wellinghoff: Well, you have to start rethinking what your business model is. No. 1: Do you want to maintain yourself as a platform operator of the distribution system? That’s one part of a business model. If you want to start providing additional services to your customers beyond that platform, then you're going to have to think about what those services are and figure out how those services are of value to your customers, and then start working on separate business lines that can develop that value.
Are you going to compete with the companies that are experts in putting in distributed solar around the country? I don’t think so. I don’t think you’re going to beat SolarCity or SunRun or Sungevity or the next 10 companies behind them. They have taken it down to a science. They can deliver a solar system like you deliver a FedEx package. I don’t think there’s any utility in this country that can touch the delivery expertise and the distributed solar marketing expertise that these companies have.
Hering: How do you view the current battles over net-metered rooftop solar that are playing out in states such as Arizona, California and Colorado?
Wellinghoff: Well, most of those battles the utilities have lost. They won a very small victory in Arizona, where they actually set the precedent for the ability to charge a subclass of residential customers — i.e., those residential customers who have solar on the roof — a specific separate charge for having that system installed. But the charge ultimately authorized was very small. I think there’ll continue to be those battles to the point that the utilities try to sort of beat back the inevitable. But at the end of the day, I think those battles will turn around to ones that are more rationale — which comes down to changing the rate structure by which utilities recover their costs for distribution asset investment.
Hering: We’re really just still at the beginning of this energy transition. Are you optimistic we’ll carry it through?
Wellinghoff: Oh, yeah, because the markets are so powerful that you can’t stop it. Look at Hawaii. Hawaii’s going through a lot of stops and starts over how much solar you put on the distribution system, et cetera. But ultimately all that’s going to be resolved in ways that will favor the markets and market solutions, and the market solution in Hawaii is to put solar on your house. This is the cheapest thing to do. So people are not going to let policy and regulation get in the way of a market solution.

As distributed energy resources come onto the grid in increasing numbers, the distribution system may need a new level of regulation to ensure new services get delivered efficiently, according to a proposal from Jon Wellinghoff, former FERC chair and current partner at Stoel Rives, and James Tong, vice president of strategy and government affairs at Clean Power Finance. 

Ex-FERC Chair Wellinghoff calls for the creation of IDSOs to operate the distribution grid

Regional Transmission Operators (RTOs) and Independent System Operators (ISOs) have, in partnership with utilities, expanded and streamlined the grid’s electricity markets over the last decade.
Now, utilities need a partner at the distribution system level to do the same for retail electricity, according to the proposal. 
Why the grids needs an Independent Distribution System Operator
In order for solar and other distributed energy resources (DERs) to add more value to the bulk system and cause less stress, Wellinghoff and Tong are calling for the creation of an Independent Distribution System Operator (IDSO) to handle the planning and operations of the distribution network. 
Today, utilities own and rate base transmission system assets while answering to the Federal Energy Regulatory System (FERC) and leaving day-to-day operations to RTOs and ISOs. Under the proposal, they can own and rate base distribution system assets while answering to state regulators and leaving moment-to-moment operations to the Independent Distribution System Operator.
The consolidation of balancing authorities and operational control of the wholesale market system through system operators has proved a much more efficient model, Wellinghoff, co-author of Rooftop Parity: Solar for Everyone, including Utilities, told Utility Dive in an interview.
The proof is a 2009 study by FERC and four Southeastern state commissions that showed Entergy could save a minimum of $700 million over ten years by joining the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, he said.
“Now we have the software tools and computing capability to bring those benefits down to the distribution level,” Wellinghoff said. That will grow the system and give DER entrepreneurs greater visibility into where the value is in technologies like solar PV and storage.  “They will go get that value. And that will benefit customers who use and invest in DERs.”
“And that also will create new incentives for innovation,” added co-author and Clean Power Finance VP James Tong.

What an Independent Distribution System Operator would do
“State commissions will still have complete authority, just like FERC has complete authority over the RTOs,” Wellinghoff said. 
But their role changes slightly, he explained. The IDSO would manage planning and operations. The commission would have ultimate approval authority and be “a market overseer, enforcer of market rules, and creator of market structures, much as FERC does now at the wholesale level.”
An IDSO would: 

maintain system safety and reliability
provide open and transparent system access
implement market mechanisms
oversee optimal DER deployment and dispatch
guard consumers’ access to all transactive energy services
allow regulated utilities, unregulated energy sellers, independent energy and service providers, and electricity customers equal opportunity to meet new electricity consumer needs.

Utilities now do the planning and set values at the distribution level, Tong said. “Because of that, the debates are about net energy metering. But the real threat to the existing utility model is that people are becoming more efficient. The EIA estimates load growth will only be 0.9% per year for the next 30 years.”

The opportunity for utilities
If utilities turn operation of the distribution system over to an IDSO, Tong said, they can focus on the opportunity to offset slowed load growth by investing in DER and DG on the regulated side and opening similar opportunities on the unregulated side.
“In a world that is all monopoly-owned assets, utilities could be effective distribution system gatekeepers,” Tong explained. “But in a world with a lot of DER and customer-owned assets, there is an inherent conflict of interest. It would be, to borrow an analogy, like an air traffic controller that also owns an airline.”
While FERC has begun turning the grid over to system operators, state commissions and utilities can similarly turn moment-to-moment distribution system operations over to IDSOs. That would free utilities, bolster unregulated energy suppliers and independent energy service providers, and empower electricity customers.
An IDSO would eliminate distribution system encumbrances for regulated utilities, the proposal explained, and free them from some reliability burdens. Utilities could then form partnerships with independent generation and service providers. Those businesses could offer profit opportunities in return for utility capabilities like customer outreach, billing, project implementation, local regulatory expertise, and access to capital.
California regulators have acknowledged the need for streamlining distribution system operations in a proceeding to oversee IOU’s implementation of mandated Distribution Resources Plans. California IOUs are mandated to integrate cost-effective DERs into their distribution systems “with the goal of yielding net benefits to ratepayers.”

Where the systems meet
There is an especially important opportunity at the intersection of wholesale transactions on the transmission system and retail transactions on the distribution system, Wellinghoff said.
An example is the recent decision by a D.C. district court that FERC has no jurisdiction over demand response because it is a retail product. “There are 15,000 megawatts of demand response in PJM and that is of tremendous benefit. According to PJM, it drove down capacity prices $12 billion last year,” Wellinghoff said. "If that decision stands, it could exclude all types of retail activities, including distributed generation, storage, and efficiency.”
The only way to prevent the loss of what are extremely valuable assets would be the creation of something like an IDSO, he said. It could aggregate those retail products and allow a market exchange through a wholesale-retail interface with the bulk system. “The states would have jurisdiction over what the court says are retail products and FERC would continue to have jurisdiction over the wholesale products.”
Even utilities that are now opposing the entry of demand response in capacity markets could see benefits. Instead of “frantically doing whatever they can to prevent customers from reducing usage through things like demand response,” Wellinghoff said, “they could be the owners and maintainers of a distribution system platform, upgraded to include demand response on IDSO plans, that they could build and rate base.”
An IDSO also would reduce a utility’s risk in the approval process, Wellinghoff added. The IDSO would do planning through a stakeholder process with the utilities at the table. It would then recommend the selected investments to the regulators. “That is in essence an independent third party recommending to the commission that upgrades be made that the utility could rate base,” Wellinghoff said.
