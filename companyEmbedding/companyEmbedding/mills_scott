Welcome
At Mills & Scott, we fully appreciate the heritage of traditional workmanship. Good practical designs, superior raw materials and beautifully crafted hardware - combine these ingredients with style and imagination and you'll have everything needed to ensure a desirable result. 
 Our products are based on these principles and together with a tailor-made design service we take projects from conception right through to final completion. The personal approach we offer our clients has helped us build and maintain our reputation for producing bespoke and individually crafted fitted furniture for over 30 years. 
 Meticulous attention to detail is central to all our projects. Whether we work directly with the client or via architects, builders or interior designers, we approach each commission with the same determination to achieve our ultimate goal - a delighted customer! 
 We invite you to browse the website and experience the range of fitted furniture we have developed in our family-run business over the past three decades. The result is a diverse, yet inspired collection, which can be individually made to our client's requirements. A visit 
    to our showroom will show you the possibilities for you home. Our enthusiasm for achieving a careful balance of traditional design and innovation will become clear when you talk with us.

Our Company
The original partnership was established back in 1982 by Phillip Mills and Adrian Scott with two simple aims;
    to produce furniture with the highest standard of traditional craftsmanship, using the finest quality
    raw materials, and to meet the demands of the most discerning home owners who insist on innovative style and design without compromising their need for the latest technology, appliances and accessories.
Some 30 years later and with hundreds of completed projects in our portfolio, we are proud of our 
    reputation for customer care & quality workmanship, and more importantly the relationships and friendships 
    we have made with our clientele; many are now on their second (even third or fourth) Mills & Scott kitchen.
Customer recommendation has always been extremely important to us, in fact seven out of every ten projects we undertake come as a direct result of client referrals. Although the majority of our customers are based in the North West, over the years we have designed and fitted furniture 
    in properties in London, Hampshire, Wales, Scotland, Devon, the Midlands, the Channel Islands and even in Portugal.
Why choose Mills & Scott? 




Adrian Scott - The Workshop
"The whole of my working life has involved the woodworking industry and it has always been my aim to make a product that encompasses traditional skills
            together with modern materials and technology. At Mills & Scott, we are able to create designs and realise our customers' ideas and dreams because we have the knowledge, experience, resources and above all else we are continually investing in technical innovation and improving our own skills.
            The fitted furniture market demands design that 
            gives comfort, ease of use and practicality, whilst complementing the customer's lifestyle. Our furniture is a blend of traditional cabinet making and high 
            quality German engineered hardware, the best of both worlds. More importantly we do not stand still; I am continually looking to keep our furniture at 
            the forefront of design, by introducing new hardware and material finishes, so ensuring we maintain our position and reputation in the local
            fitted furniture market."







Phillip Mills - Design, Installation & Customer Service
"My role is to design the furniture and look after each client's project; whether it's 10 rooms at one house or a single piece of furniture for a drawing
            room, I am involved from beginning to end, and everything in-between. It all starts with individual ideas and tastes. Kitchens especially, are such
            important rooms, often the focal point of the home. So before I create any drawings or make any suggestions I like to find out just what the family is 
            looking for, their thoughts, their opinions, likes and dislikes; it all goes on my notepad which becomes the starting point for my design solutions - I know 
            how to listen, but also when to use my knowledge and experience to advise and improvise. Bedrooms, Studies etc, are more personal to the individual
            but I treat them no differently; I find it a cliché but we really can create a room in any style or theme, whether it's a new build property
            or a listed building. Attention to detail is vital to all our projects, and being able to oversee every aspect, from building work, electrics,
            plumbing, to tiling, installation, hand painting, ensuring each job runs smoothly. Adrian and I have the same passions about our work - every part of every project matters"
