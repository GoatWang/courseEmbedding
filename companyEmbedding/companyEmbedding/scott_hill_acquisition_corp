Acquisitions are an important part of the RelaDyne strategy. We look for companies that provide us with new geographies as well as companies that are in our current footprint that make us stronger.
If you are interested in having your company join the RelaDyne family, please fill out this form, and a RelaDyne representative will contact you to discuss.

RelaDyne – Acquirer of Choice
Our M&A team at RelaDyne is focused on adding new geography, new capabilities and more density within our current footprint as we continue to create a national distribution platform. Here are examples of some of our most influential acquisitions. 
 
Hill Oil Company
Acquired: December 2011
RelaDyne acquired Hill Oil Company and its affiliate PetroClean Solutions, based in Farmerville, Louisiana to continue the expansion of its lubrication services and reliability solutions.  Hill Oil serves Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, and East Texas and is the region’s leading distributor of lubricants, fuel and comprehensive fluid purification and flushing solutions.  Hill Oil’s PetroClean Solutions division is now a segment of RelaDyne’s Field Reliability Management services division.  The owners of Hill Oil also play a major role in the operations of this RelaDyne branch.

“Our commitment to our customers begins with our employees. By joining the RelaDyne team, our employees have been able to grow and benefit from RelaDyne’s programs and experience allowing us to serve our customers with a larger selection of quality products and services that we could not have done alone.”
Scott Hill, former President of Hill Oil Company. Currently Vice President of RelaDyne Reliability Services.

 
Paulson Oil Company
Acquired: May 2013
RelaDyne acquired the lubricants and tank wagon fuel businesses from the Great Lakes division of Maxum Petroleum (comprised of Hartney Fuel Oil Company and Paulson Oil Company). This acquisition expanded RelaDyne’s density in the greater Chicago marketplace while also now extending the offering of FRM in the existing Great Lakes region to include fuel and a new line of products and services. Additional acquisitions include Craft Oil, located in south Texas, and the lubricants business of Newcomb Oil in Kentucky.

“We valued the opportunity to join the extensive and successful network of RelaDyne. This acquisition allowed us to better serve our customers through a larger product offering and higher levels of service.”
Paul McCusker, former Vice President and General Manager of Maxum Petroleum – Great Lakes. Currently head of RelaDyne Acquisitions.

 
Turbo Filtration Corporation (TFC)
Acquired: August 2014
RelaDyne acquired Turbo Filtration Corporation (TFC), a leader in the turbine and industrial reliability market, located in Mobile, Alabama. The acquisition of TFC significantly increased RelaDyne’s services capacity in terms of both people and equipment.

“We have seen many positive effects of joining the RelaDyne team. This acquisition gave us the ability to expand our services and capabilities and to continue the great work we’ve done for decades. We’ve built a great team of people over the years, and it’s important our customers know we are all sticking around.” 
Mike Enger, founder and previous owner of TFC. Currently RelaDyne Reliability Services Business Development Manager.

 
Industrial Action Services
Acquired: January 2016
RelaDyne acquired Industrial Action Services, Inc. of Texas. IAS serves as an integral part of the RelaDyne platform to further expand the RelaDyne Reliability Services division. It has expanded our service footprint into Canada, Alaska, and the East Coast.

“With RelaDyne’s support, we’ve been able to provide additional products and services to our customers that would not have been able to do on our own. Their extensive network of resources makes the unattainable achievable.” 
Kevin Sapp, founder and previous owner of Industrial Action Services. Currently RelaDyne Reliability Services Business Development Manager.

 
Hollingsworth Lubricants
Acquired: June 2016
RelaDyne acquired the lubricants division of Hollingsworth Oil Company. Hollingsworth Lubricants, a distributor of premium lubricants in Tennessee and Alabama, significantly expanded RelaDyne’s geographic density and capabilities within the Nashville and Birmingham markets. 

“RelaDyne is such a great fit for our people and our customers. Because of RelaDyne, we are able to provide our associates with expanded opportunities, and our customers with new products and services we could not previously provide with our resources.” 
Ronnie Hollingsworth, owner and President of Hollingsworth Oil Company (the parent company of Hollingsworth Lubricants)

Notes to
Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements

NOTE 1
NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES

NATURE OF
OPERATIONS

Scott Hill
Acquisition Corporation (the "Company") was incorporated on
December 11, 2015 under the laws of the state of Delaware to engage
in any lawful corporate undertaking, including, but not limited to,
selected mergers and acquisitions. The Company has been in the
developmental stage since inception and its operations to date have
been limited to issuing shares to its original shareholders. The
Company will attempt to locate and negotiate with a business entity
for the combination of that target company with Scott Hill. The
combination will normally take the form of a merger,
stock-for-stock exchange or stock-for-assets exchange. In most
instances the target company will wish to structure the business
combination to be within the definition of a tax-free
reorganization under
Section 351 or Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended. No assurances can be given that the Company will be
successful in locating or negotiating with any target company. The
Company has been formed to provide a method for a foreign or
domestic private company to become a reporting company with a class
of securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934.

BASIS OF
PRESENTATION

The
summary of significant accounting policies presented below is
designed to assist in understanding the Company's unaudited
condensed financial statements. Such unaudited condensed financial
statements and accompanying notes are the representations of the
Company's management, who are responsible for their integrity and
objectivity. These accounting policies conform to accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America
("GAAP") in all material respects, and have been consistently
applied in preparing the accompanying unaudited condensed financial
statements.

Certain
information and footnote disclosures normally present in annual
financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America
("U.S. GAAP") were omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.
The results for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, are not
necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year
ending December 31, 2016.

USE OF
ESTIMATES

The
preparation of unaudited condensed financial statements in
conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the condensed financial statements, and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

CASH

Cash and
cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit at banking
institutions as well as all highly liquid short-term investments
with original maturities of 90 days or less. The Company did not
have cash equivalents as of September 30, 2016.

CONCENTRATION
OF RISK

Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations
of credit risk consist principally of cash. The Company places its
cash with high quality banking institutions. The Company did not
have cash balances in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation limit as of September 30, 2016.

Notes to Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements

INCOME
TAXES

Under ASC
740, "Income Taxes," deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
temporary differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years
in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered
or settled. Valuation allowances are established when it is more
likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will
not be realized. As of September 30, 2016 there were no deferred
taxes due to the uncertainty of the realization of net operating
loss or carry forward prior to expiration.

LOSS PER
COMMON SHARE

Basic loss
per common share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net
loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted loss per common share reflect the
potential dilution that could occur if securities or other
contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into
common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then
shared in the loss of the entity. As of September 30, 2016, there
are no outstanding dilutive securities.

FAIR VALUE
OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The
Company follows guidance for accounting for fair value measurements
of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value
measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed
at fair value in the unaudited condensed financial statements on a
recurring basis. Additionally, the Company adopted guidance for
fair value measurement related to nonfinancial items that are
recognized and disclosed at fair value in the unaudited condensed
financial statements on a nonrecurring basis. The guidance
establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to
valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy
gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements)
and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant
unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the
fair value hierarchy are as follows:

Level 1
inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to
access at the measurement date.

Level 2
inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1
that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or
indirectly.

Level 3
inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. The
carrying amounts of financial assets such as cash approximate their
fair values because of the short maturity of these
instruments.

RECENT
ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

On
November 20, 2015, FASB issued ASU-2015-17-Income Taxes. The Board
is issuing this Update as part of its initiative to reduce
complexity in accounting standards (the Simplification Initiative).
The objective of the Simplification Initiative is to identify,
evaluate, and improve areas of generally accepted accounting
principles (GAAP) for which cost and complexity can be reduced
while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information
provided to users of financial statements. Current GAAP requires an
entity to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into
current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of
financial position. To simplify the presentation of deferred income
taxes, the amendments in this Update require that deferred tax
liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified
statement of financial position. The amendments in this Update
apply to all entities that present a classified statement of
financial position. The current requirement that deferred tax
liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of an entity be
offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by the
amendments in this Update. For public business entities, the
amendments in this Update are effective for financial statements
issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and
interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is
permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or
annual reporting period. The Company is still in the process of
evaluating future impact of adopting this standard.

On June
12, 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-10-Technical Corrections
and Improvements. The amendments in this Update cover a wide range
of Topics in the Codification. The amendments in this Update
represent changes to make minor corrections or minor improvements
to the Codification that are not expected to have a significant
effect on current accounting practice or create a significant
administrative cost to most entities. This Accounting Standards
Update is the final version of Proposed Accounting Standards Update
2014-240-Technical Corrections and Improvements, which has been
deleted. Transition guidance varies based on the amendments in this
Update. The amendments in this Update that require transition
guidance are effective for all entities for fiscal years, and
interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December
15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an
interim period. All other amendments will be effective upon the
issuance of this Update. Management is in the process of assessing
the impact of this ASU on the Company's financial
statements.

Notes to Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements

On April
30, 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-06 Earnings Per Share
(Topic 260):
Effects on Historical Earnings per Units of Master Limited
Partnership Dropdown Transactions. Under Topic 260, Earnings Per
Share, master limited partnerships (MLPs) apply the two-class
method to calculate earnings per unit (EPU) because the general
partner, limited partners, and incentive distribution rights
holders each participate differently in the distribution of
available cash. When a general partner transfers (or "drops down")
net assets to a master limited partnership and that transaction is
accounted for as a transaction between entities under common
control, the statements of operations of the master limited
partnership are adjusted retrospectively to reflect the dropdown
transaction as if it occurred on the earliest date during which the
