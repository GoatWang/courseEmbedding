The Fiduciary Role
Executive Summary
To better understand the role of the fiduciary advisor as it relates to the investor, please read our complimentary executive summary.
→ Read more about the fiduciary role (PDF)
Why pay a fee for investment advice and management?
We charge our clients a management fee to supervise their portfolio. This is in contrast to investment advice offered by financial advisers who receive commissions related to transactions and product sales. (Though the term has become unfashionable, commission-based advisers are technically considered “brokers” under the regulatory laws.) This contrast may beg the question: Am I better off paying once in the form of a commission compared to paying an ongoing management fee? In the early days of Linscomb & Williams, we acted as brokers and received commissions for investment transactions. In 1985, we decided our clients would be better served if we changed to the fee-based model. We believe our clients are best served by this model for several reasons:

Foremost, fee-based compensation eliminates an unavoidable conflict of interest inherent in the commission method of compensation. The broker is incentivized to create activity in the portfolio and must forego compensation to advise in favor of holding an existing position. The fee-based adviser does not face this conflict of interest. Under the professional standards regulating Certified Financial Planners engaged in financial planning, fee-based advisers are considered “fiduciaries” which is a higher legal standard of business conduct than the “suitability” standard applicable to commissioned brokers. In recent years, many brokers have begun offering some services for fee-based compensation which blurs this distinction. When in doubt, ask an adviser to represent in writing to you whether he or she is acting as a “fiduciary”.
Commission-based advisers must, by law, be affiliated with a brokerage or insurance firm. In almost all cases, this creates additional conflicts in the form of investment selection. Most brokerage firms create proprietary products that can be sold by their brokers. Since these products offer additional income potential to the brokerage firm, they may offer special incentive compensation that encourages their use by brokers. Needless to say, such incentives may cloud the broker’s judgment when making a recommendation. By contrast, the fee-based adviser is compensated by a single fee calculated on portfolio value. It is unaffected by the choice of particular investments in the portfolio. The incentive is to increase the value of the portfolio, not to favor particular investments within it.
The fee-based method of compensation is a “pay-as-you-go” system, in contrast to commissions which represent an “up-front” method of paying for advice. We can testify from experience that this contrast affects how an adviser prioritizes daily activities. Because of up-front compensation, brokers have a particular economic advantage to acquire clients who bring new assets which generate commission income or to turn over investments in the portfolios of existing clients. Of course, fee-based advisers also like to acquire new clients. However, compensation associated with new clients is earned over time, not up front. The economic incentive to fee-based advisers is to retain clients. One can draw the logical conclusion about which method likely best serves long-term clients. We believe the commission-based system emphasizes marketing to new clients over taking care of existing clients.

None of this is offered to impugn the integrity of those who operate within the commission-based system. However, while there are many honest brokers, overcoming these conflicts of interest can often present a quandary. We believe charging an ongoing management fee for advice and portfolio supervision more closely aligns our clients’ interests with our own. As fiduciaries, we constantly strive to eliminate conflicts of interest wherever possible.

Financial Planning
Why Linscomb & Williams?
Your choice of the right financial professional is not a simple one. It could also be the most significant investment decision you will make in your lifetime. At Linscomb & Williams, our main objective is to help provide you with financial security today and far into the future. We conduct an in-depth evaluation of your current situation in order to create a structured plan based on saving and investing. Your financial goals will always dictate which financial strategies we will recommend in order to obtain financial success. We will help you maximize your financial efforts with a well-organized plan and continue to provide you details and recommendations throughout your relationship with us.

What is Financial Planning?
Financial planning is the gathering of information relating to the financial health and well-being of a client. Through an interview process, a client’s financial concerns and future goals are established. The information gathered is then analyzed and compared with the client’s stated goals. From this comparison, recommendations can be made to help a client adjust their current financial behavior so that any gaps can be filled and/or any current plans can be altered to meet goals. In some cases, it can simply validate the path they are currently on is the correct one.
Is a Financial Planner right for me?
Whether you have very limited resources or a sizable estate, you may be able to benefit from the services of a financial planner.
Today, it is very difficult for anyone not working in the financial field to keep up with the rapidly changing financial products, tax laws, and the volatile economy.
Financial product information and planning ideas abound… each claiming to be the best. You are given financial advice in articles, radio talk shows, and advertisements, but, this information is often fragmented and not related to your total, personal, financial situation and individual goals.
Putting all this information together into a workable plan can be a daunting project for individuals. We strive to explain your options in easy-to-understand terms showing how each option could affect you.
The busier you are, the less time you have to devote to sorting out these issues, and yet, a comprehensive financial plan can be the key to your financial success. Good planning always costs less than good reacting.
Benefits of working with a Financial Planner?
The benefits of taking some time and sitting down with us to create that financial planning road map can be numerous and will depend on your individual circumstances. However, one of the key benefits of a well laid-out financial plan that is implemented and monitored is that it may enable you to reach financial independence sooner than if you had not formulated a plan of action.
Financial independence can mean different things for different people, but for most people it means the ability to cease regular employment knowing that they have enough assets and retirement income to maintain a certain lifestyle for the rest of life and provide for their beneficiaries after death.
What are the Services to Expect from a Financial Planner?
As Linscomb & Williams we take the time to get to know you, your financial situation, your financial goals and your risk tolerance. Once you decide to work with us, the following are examples of the types of services that may be appropriate:
Personal attention:
We will take the time to go through a full interview with you, asking questions to understand your financial situation, your risk tolerance and your goals before setting up a customized financial plan.
Help develop an asset allocation strategy:
Once you’ve worked with us to establish your risk tolerance, we can help you allocate your money based on a mix of asset classes with varying degrees of risk that fit your time horizon and comfort level.
Advice on specific investments that match your goals:
Once we have mutually agreed upon an appropriate asset allocation strategy, we can then make specific recommendations on the types of investments which will best meet your needs.
Answers to your financial questions:
When the financial markets become volatile, we will help you understand the reasons behind the instability. As changes occur in your life which affect your finances, we invite you to call upon us for advice.  Fine-tuning of your financial plan over time is usually a good idea.
Proactive management of your account:
If you desire professional ongoing management of your investment assets, Linscomb & Williams offers this service.
Ongoing, regular check-ups:
We recommend a review of your plan on a regular basis to see if your financial situation has changed. If you’ve gotten married, switched jobs, had a child or purchased a home, your financial plan may need to be adjusted to account for these changes. We are available to meet and review your current situation with you and make any adjustments necessary to ensure your plan continues to meet your situation and goals.
What is the Personal Financial Planning Process?
The financial planning process can be thought of as a science, where a logical step-by-step process is taken to assist you in achieving your financial goals. Our primary focus will be to coordinate all areas of your total planning picture to achieve a successful outcome for all concerned – emotionally and financially.
1. Initial Interview:
We will meet to discuss how our company will be able to impact your personal, family and business goals.
2. Data Gathering:
As a first step towards working together, we spend time with you in a fact-finding interview. This conversation provides us with sufficient information to conduct an accurate analysis. We begin to discover more specifics about your goals and values, and your current financial situation.
Examples of the information that will be discussed includes:


Current income taxation
Investment and Asset Management
Wealth Accumulation or Preservation
Income/Cash Flow Planning
Education Funding Goals
Financial Independence
Business Continuation or Disposition
Estate Planning and Gift & Estate Tax Planning


3. Analyze and evaluate your financial status:
We evaluate the data collected to gain a better understanding of your situation and your unique requirements in order to create your Financial Plan. Using the information gathered in Step 2 we start the process of determining if you can meet your stated financial goals and objectives. If you are unable to meet your goals then current problem areas will be identified that are hindering you in meeting these goals.
4. Recommending a Plan:
This step simply involves meeting with us to discuss the analysis and plan recommendations. We determine the direction of plan development and prioritize issues to resolve. We are here to help you with the accomplishment of your goals in the way you desire and see fit.
You should ensure that you understand and are comfortable with our recommendations presented. That is, you should feel that you would have the ability and discipline to execute the recommendations on a current and ongoing basis if required.
5. Implementing the Plan:
This step is absolutely crucial to ensure that the recommendations in Step 4 are put into action so you can commence your journey to achieving financial independence. At this time you will have a solid understanding of what needs to be done to maximize income and assets in order to have the greatest impact on your desires, goals and objectives. This will act as the implementation guide as well as a benchmark for monitoring the project as we all move forward in time. As a point of service, often noted in the financial plan are future implementation strategies that will come up for review. Comprehensive planning is always an ongoing process and we are here to help and serve.
6. Monitoring the Plan for changes and progress:
We encourage you to come back for periodic reviews. We also invite your input, encouraging you to keep us informed as any questions, concerns or significant financial developments occur. We may recommend adjustments when your situation or objectives change or when an opportunity arises to maximize investment performance.

Into the Future: How to secure your financial future while transitioning out of ownership
For business owners and entrepreneurs, wealth mangagment, and planning is not a project, it is a process. “It’s something you never complete; it’s ongoing in nature,” says J. Harold Williams, CPA/PFS, CFP, President and CEO, Linscomb & Williams, an affiliate of Cadence Bank.
He says that too many people approach wealth management erroneously, thinking, “I’ll get a financial plan done and check that off my list.” However, financial planning is much like designing a blue print for a house, building it and maintaining it – a process that never ends.
