	NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


	FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015


	(IN U.S. $) (UNAUDITED)








	1.      


	ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS



	Winha International Group Limited ("Winha International") was incorporated in Nevada on April 15, 2013. The subsidiaries of the Company and their principal activities are described as follows:


	Winha International and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the "Company". The Company initially retailed its local specialty products through its seven self-operated physical stores.  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company entered into agreements with six individuals to assume the operations of six of its seven retail stores located in Sanshui, Shunde, Chancheng, Xiaolan, Dongguan and Guangzhou, which the Company had itself previously operated. The stores continue to operate under the Company's trade name. The Company derives revenues from wholesaling its products to these six stores. The stores are supplemented by two restaurants, the first of which the Company opened in April 2015. In addition, the Company has granted 44 franchises to use the Company's tradename, store style and its other resources. The Company plans to open additional restaurants and add additional franchisees during fiscal 2018.


	Until November 27, 2015, the Company operated its business through a variable interest entity, Zhongshan Winha Electronic Commerce Company Limited ("Zhongshan Winha"), which had two wholly owned limited liability subsidiaries, Zhongshan Supermarket Limited ("Zhongshan Supermarket") and Zhongshan Winha Catering Management Co., Ltd. ("Winha Catering"), as well as three incorporated branches.  The Company had the controlling interest in Zhongshan Winha via its wholly owned subsidiary Shenzhen Wanha Information Technologies Company Ltd. ("Shenzhen Wanha") through a series of contractual arrangements. On November 27, 2015, the shareholders of Zhongshan Winha transferred their stock to Shenzhen Wanha upon the exercise of its option to purchase all of the registered equity. The purchase price was 1 Renminbi (RMB), approximately US $0.16.  Zhongshan Winha, therefore, is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Shenzhen Wanha.


	In May 2015, C&V International Company Limited ("C&V"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Winha International, set up a wholly owned subsidiary, Australia Winha Commerce and Trade International Limited ("Australian Winha"). In February 2016, Sanmei International Investment Co., Ltd ("Sanmei Investment"), a company incorporated in Anguilla on April 23, 2013, transferred 100% of its shares to Winha International. Subsequently, Winha International transferred the shares of C&V to Sanmei Investment, and C&V transferred the shares of Australian Winha to Sanmei Investment.

The Company used the Australian Winha offering price for its initial public offering in Australia to approximate the fair value of the 40% stock issued. The Company recognized stock compensation expense of approximately $21,883,000 during the year ended March 31, 2016.

	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES



	Basis of Accounting and Presentation





	The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") which apply to interim financial statements

	.

	Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes normally required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for annual financial statements. In the opinion of management, such information contains all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the periods presented. The interim consolidated financial information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, included in the Company's Form 10-K filed with the SEC. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future quarters or for the year ending March 31, 2017.



	Until November 27, 2015, the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its wholly owned subsidiaries and Zhongshan Winha, its VIE, for which it was deemed the primary beneficiary.  On November 27, 2015, the VIE structure was terminated upon Shenzhen Wanha exercising its option to purchase all of the registered equity of Zhongshan Winha.  Shenzhen Wanha became the sole owner of Zhongshan Winha.  All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.


	All consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements are presented in United States dollars ("US Dollar" or "US$" or "$").


	Foreign Currency Translation



	Almost all Company assets and operations are located in either the PRC or Australia.  The functional currency for the majority of the Company's operations is the

	Renminbi ("RMB"). For Winha International Investment Holdings Company, the functional currency is the Hong Kong Dollar ("HKD"). For Australian Winha, the functional currency is the Australian Dollar ("AUD").  The Company uses the United States Dollar ("US Dollar" or "US$" or "$") for financial reporting purposes.  The financial statements of the Company have been translated into US dollars in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 830, "Foreign Currency Matters".

	2.      


	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

	(CONTINUED)




	Foreign Currency Translation (continued)


	For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, foreign currency translation adjustments of $(798,871)

	and $

	(279,514), respectively, $(1,501,616) and $(526,358), respectively have been reported as other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) of the Company consists entirely of foreign currency translation adjustments.  Pursuant to ASC 740-30-25-17, "Exceptions to Comprehensive Recognition of Deferred Income Taxes", the Company does not recognize deferred U.S. taxes related to the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries and, accordingly, recognizes no income tax expense or benefit from foreign currency translation adjustments.


	Although government regulations now allow convertibility of the RMB for current account transactions, significant restrictions still remain.  Hence, such translations should not be construed as representations that the RMB could be converted into US dollars at that rate or any other rate.


	The value of the RMB against the US dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in the PRC's political and economic conditions. Any significant revaluation of the RMB may materially affect the Company's financial co

	ndition in terms of US dollar reporting.  The PRC has devalued the RMB by approximately 6% subsequent to March 31, 2016. Further devaluations could occur in the future.



	Vulnerability Due To Operations in the PRC


	The Company's operations may be adversely affected by significant political, economic and social uncertainties in the PRC.  Although the PRC government has been pursuing economic reform policies for more than twenty years, no assurance can be given that the PRC government will continue to pursue such policies or that such policies may not be significantly altered, especially in the event of a change in leadership, social or political disruption or unforeseen circumstances affecting the PRC's political, economic and social conditions.  There is also no guarantee that the PRC government's pursuit of economic reforms will be consistent, effective or will continue.

	2.      


	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

	(CONTINUED)




	Use of Estimates


	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.


	Prepaid Expenses


	Prepaid expenses as of December 31, 2016 mainly represent the prepayments of approximately $2,231,000 for the land lease and crop planting expenses. Prepaid expenses as of March 31, 2016, mainly represent the prepayment of approximately $174,000 for prepaid decoration expenses of the Company's new stores. The non-current portion of prepaid expense of approximately $2,501,000 is for the land lease.


	Advances from Customers



	Advances from customers represents prepaid cards purchased by customers at our retail locations. Advances from customers was $54,353 and $769,814 as of

	December 31, 2016 and March 31, 2016

	, respectively. These cards are no longer being issued.



	Website Development Costs


	The Company accounts for website development costs in accordance with ASC 350-50, "Accounting for Website Development Costs", wherein website development costs are segregated into three activities:





	1.




	Initial stage (planning), whereby the related costs are expensed.





	 


	 





	2.




	Development stage (web application, infrastructure, graphics), whereby the related costs are capitalized and amortized once the website is ready for use. Costs for development of content for the website may be expensed or capitalized depending on the circumstances of the expenditures.

	Website Development Costs (continued)





	3.




	Operating stage, whereby the related costs are expensed as incurred. Upgrades are usually expensed, unless they add additional functionality.





	The Company had website costs of $6,349 and $45,676 as of December 31, 2016 and March 31, 2016

	, respectively. The Company wrote off the net book value of website and development costs of $34,140 due to the discontinuance of the website

	 

	during the three months ended September 30, 2016. The remaining $6,349 was the cost for the restaurant website. Amortization expense was $957 and $196, $2,360 and $599 for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.



	Revenue Recognition



	The Company's revenue recognition policies comply with FASB ASC 605 "Revenue Recognition." The Company recognizes product revenue when the following fundamental criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred, (iii) the price paid by the customer is fixed or determinable and (iv) collection of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured.

	The Company recognizes revenue from the following channels: 


	1.   Wholesale


	The Company recognizes sales revenue from its retail stores, net of sales taxes and estimated sales returns at the time it sells merchandise to the customer. Customer purchases of shopping cards are not recognized as revenue until the card is redeemed when the customer purchases merchandise by using the shopping card.


	When the current fiscal year began, the Company had operated seven retail stores. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company assigned the operation of six of its retail stores in Sanshui, Shunde, Chancheng, Xiaolan, Dongguan and Guangzhou to six independent individuals. Revenues are now derived from the sale of food products to these six stores and one store that the Company operates. The Company recognizes wholesale revenue for product sales upon transfer of title to the six stores. Purchase orders and/or contracts are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement. Shipping documents and the completion of any store acceptance requirements, when applicable, are used to verify product delivery. The Company assesses whether a price is fixed or determinable based upon the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment.

	2.       SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)


	Revenue Recognition (continued)


	  During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2016, wholesale revenue of $3,097,941 and $4,965,320 was generated from these six stores.


	 


	2.  Custom-made sales


	 


	The target customers are commercial customers who can order online or in the Company's local stores and make full payment on site. All orders are forwarded to Zhongshan Winha immediately, which arranges the delivery. Revenue from the sale of products is recognized upon delivery to customers provided that there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance, there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, and the sales price is fixed and determinable. Revenue generated from custom-made sales was $10,017,018 and $7,051,713, $29,713,348 and $17,851,673, respectively, for three and nine months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.


	 


	3.  Franchise and management fees


	 


	During the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company commenced franchising the use of the Company's trademark, name identification and other business resources. The franchisee is required to pay franchise fees and management fees to Zhongshan Winha. Franchise fee revenue from franchise sales is recognized only when all material services or conditions relating to the sale have been substantially performed or satisfied by the Company. The franchise and management fees recognized by the Company were $1,036,656 and $941,292, $4,322,366 and $1,458,744, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, and are included in revenue.


	 


	Zhongshan Winha grants certain commercial customers limited rights to return products and provides price protection for inventories held by resellers at the time of published price reductions. Zhongshan Winha establishes an estimated allowance for future product returns based upon historical return experience when the related revenue is recorded and provides for appropriate price protection reserves when pricing adjustments are approved.


	 


	Zhongshan Winha's return policy allows customers to return their merchandise in the original box and/or packaging within 7 days of purchase.  The Company has not experienced material returns or price adjustments.

	2.      SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)


	Fair Value of Financial Instruments


	FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement

	,

	specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based upon whether the inputs to those valuation techniques reflect assumptions other market participants would use based upon market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs).  In accordance with ASC 820, the following summarizes the fair value hierarchy:



	Level 1 Inputs – Unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets and liabilities in an active market that the Company has the ability to access.


	 


	Level 2 Inputs – Inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly.


	 


	Level 3 Inputs – Inputs based on prices or valuation techniques that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurements.



	ASC 820 requires the use of observable market data, when available, in making fair value measurements.  When inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  Valuation techniques used need to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.  As of December 31, 2016 and March 31, 2016, none of the Company's assets and liabilities were required to be reported at fair value on a recurring basis.  Carrying values of non-derivative financial instruments, including cash, accounts receivable, inventory, prepaid expenses, advances to suppliers, accounts payable, accrued expenses, advanced proceeds, convertible debt, taxes payable, advances from customers, and loan from stockholder approximate their fair values due to the short term nature of these financial instruments.  There were no changes in methods or assumptions during the periods presented.


	Cash and Cash Equivalents



	The Company considers all demand and time deposits and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents

	.

	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

	(CONTINUED)




	Accounts Receivable


	Accounts receivable is stated at cost, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts, if required.  Receivables outstanding longer than the payment terms are considered past due.  The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses when necessary resulting from the failure of customers to make required payments.  The Company reviews the accounts receivable on a periodic basis and makes allowances where there is doubt as to the collectability of individual balances.


	In evaluating the collectability of individual receivable balances, the Company considers many factors, including the age of the balance, the customer's payment history, its current credit-worthiness and current economic trends.  The Company considers all accounts receivable at December 31, 2016 and March 31, 2016 to be fully collectible and, therefore, did not provide an allowance for doubtful accounts.  For the periods presented, the Company did not write off any accounts receivable as bad debts.


	Inventories



	Inventories, comprised of merchandise and food products, are stated at the lower of cost or market. The value of inventory is determined using the weighted average cost method.  Inventories also include approximately

	$67,000 of the

	costs for growing crops on the leased farmland.



	The Company estimates an allowance for excess or unusable inventories.  Inventory is reported net of such allowances, if any. There was no allowance for excess or unusable inventories as of December 31, 2016 and March 31, 2016.

	Property, Plant and Equipment


	Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation.  Cost includes the price paid to acquire the asset, and any expenditure that substantially increases the asset's value or extends the useful life of an existing asset. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Major repairs and betterments that significantly extend original useful lives or improve productivity are capitalized and depreciated over the periods benefited. Maintenance and repairs are generally expensed as incurred.


	During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company acquired various fruit orchards for $9,425,559. The fruit orchards grow 41 different kinds of fruits in various areas in China. The book value of the orchards includes costs related to saplings, fertilizer, pesticide, water, electricity, labor and land leasing. The planting costs are capitalized. In addition, the Company also capitalized $453,134 for ten greenhouses utilized in the process of growing vegetables.


	The estimated useful lives for property, plant and equipment categories are as follows:





	Furniture, fixtures and equipment




	3 to 5 years








	Leasehold improvements




	Over the shorter of the remaining lease term or estimated useful life of the improvements.






	Motor vehicles




	5 years






	Greenhouses




	3 years






	Fruit orchards




	Not yet producing






	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets


	The Company follows FASB ASC 360, "Accounting for the Impairment and Disposal of Long-Lived Assets", which addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the recognition and measurement of impairment losses for long-lived assets.  In accordance with ASC 360, long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  The Company may recognize the impairment of long-lived assets in the event the net book value of such assets exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows attributable to those assets. The Company wrote off its website development costs of $34,140 during the three months ended September 30, 2016.

	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)



	Income Taxes


	The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC 740, "Income Taxes",

	("ASC 740")

	which requires the recognition of deferred income taxes for differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax consequences for those differences, which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled.  Deferred taxes are also recognized for operating losses that are available to offset future taxable income.  A valuation allowance is established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.

	  ASC 740 addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements.



	Under ASC 740, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.  The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position would be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.  ASC 740 also provides guidance on the de-recognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, and accounting for interest and penalties associated with these tax positions.  As of December 31, 2016 and March 31, 2016, the Company did not record any liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits.


	The income tax laws of various jurisdictions in which the Company and its subsidiaries operate are summarized as follows:


	United States



	The Company is subject to United States tax at graduated rates from 15% to 35%.  No provision for income tax in the United States has been made as the Company had no U.S. taxable income

	(CONTINUED)




	Net Income (Loss) Per Common Share


	The Company computes net income (loss) per common share in accordance with FASB ASC 260, "Earnings Per Share."  Under the provisions of ASC 260, basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.  Diluted income per common share is computed by dividing the net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus the effect of any potential dilutive shares outstanding during the period. There were no dilutive shares outstanding during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.  Accordingly, the number of weighted average shares outstanding as well as the amount of net income per share are presented for basic and diluted per share calculations for the periods reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income.


	Statutory Reserve


	The Company's China-based subsidiaries and related entities are required to make appropriations of retained earnings for certain non-distributable reserve funds.


	Pursuant to the China Foreign Investment Enterprises laws, the Company's China-based subsidiaries, are required to make appropriations from their after-tax profit as determined under generally accepted accounting principles in the PRC (the "after-tax-profit under PRC GAAP") to a general non-distributable reserve fund. Each year, at least 10% of each entities after-tax-profit under PRC GAAP is required to be set aside as a general reserve fund until  the fund equals 50% of the registered capital of the applicable entity.


	The statutory reserve fund is restricted as to use and can only be used to set-off against losses, expansion of production and operations and increasing registered capital of the respective company. The fund is not allowed to be used by the Company for cash dividends, loans or advances, nor is it allowed for distribution except under liquidation.


	The required transfer to the statutory reserve fund was $329,937 and $967,741, respectively, for the nine months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

	3.       RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS




	In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. This ASU addresses the classification of certain specific cash flow issues including debt prepayment or extinguishment costs, settlement of certain debt instruments, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of certain insurance claims and distributions received from equity method investees. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. The Company is currently evaluating the effect this ASU will have on its consolidated statement of cash flows.


	In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The new standard requires financial assets measured at amortized cost be presented at the net amount expected to be collected, through an allowance for credit losses that is deducted from the amortized cost basis. The standard will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2020, with early application permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting guidance on its consolidated financial statements.


	 In May, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue with Contracts with Customers: Narrow-scope Improvements and Practical Expedients, which is an amendment to ASU No. 2014-09 that clarifies the objective of the collectability criterion, to allow entities to exclude amounts collected from customers from all sales taxes from the transaction price, to specify the measurement date for noncash consideration at contract inception. Variable consideration guidance applies only to variability resulting from reasons other than the form of the consideration, and clarification on contract modifications at transition. The implementation guidelines follow ASU No. 2014-09.

	3.       RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (CONTINUED)


	In April 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). This guidance supersedes current guidance on revenue recognition in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. In addition, there are disclosure requirements related to the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue recognition. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No.2015-14 to defer the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 for all entities by one year. For public business entities that follow U.S. GAAP, the deferral results in the new revenue standard being effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard on its consolidated financial statements.


	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which supersedes the existing guidance for lease accounting, Leases (Topic 840). ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize leases on their balance sheets, and leaves lessor accounting largely unchanged. The amendments in this ASU are effective for the Company beginning April 1, 2020 and interim periods within that fiscal year. Early application is permitted for all entities. ASU 2016-02 requires a modified retrospective approach for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application, with an option to elect to use certain transition relief. The Company is currently assessing the impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on its financial statements.

	11.    PARENT COMPANY ONLY CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION (CONTINUED)


	Basis of Presentation


	The Company records its investment in its subsidiaries under the equity method of accounting.  Such investments are presented as "Investment in subsidiaries" on the condensed balance sheet and the subsidiaries' profits are presented as "Share of earnings from investment in subsidiaries" in the condensed statement of operations.


	Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted. The parent only financial information has been derived from the Company's consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements.


	There were no cash transactions in the US parent company during the twelve months ended March 31, 2016.


	Restricted Net Assets


	Under PRC laws and regulations, the Company's PRC subsidiaries are restricted in their ability to transfer certain of their net assets to the Company in the form of dividend payments, loans or advances. The restricted net assets of the Company's PRC subsidiaries was approximately $11,051,000 as of March 31, 2016.


	The Company's operations and revenues are conducted and generated in the PRC, and all of the Company's revenues being earned and currency received are denominated in RMB.  RMB is subject to the foreign exchange control regulations in China, and, as a result, the Company may be unable to distribute any dividends outside of China due to PRC foreign exchange control regulations that restrict the Company's ability to convert RMB into US Dollars.


	12.    SUBSEQUENT EVENT


	On January 4, 2017, the Company's 60% owned subsidiary, Australian Winha, was admitted to the ASX Limited Exchange in Australia and there were 24,271,191 ordinary shares issued at an issue price of AUD$0.35 per share and raised a total of AUD$8,494,917 (approximately USD$6,123,000).  After the offering, the Company's 60% ownership of Australian Winha was diluted to 44.87%.

	ITEM 2.     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


	 


	The following management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. The discussion should be read along with our financial statements and notes thereto. This section includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Forward-looking statements are often identified by words like believe, expect, estimate, anticipate, intend, project and similar expressions, or words which, by their nature, refer to future events. You should not place undue certainty on these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our predictions.




	Events Affecting Consolidation


	We operate our business in China through Zhongshan Winha. We expect that virtually all of our revenue will be derived from Zhongshan Winha. On August 1, 2013, our subsidiary, Shenzhen Wanha, entered into a set of contractual agreements with Zhongshan Winha and its equity owners, including an exclusive business cooperation agreement, exclusive option agreement, loan agreement, share pledge agreement, power of attorney and spousal consents. Shenzhen Wanha, through these arrangements, assumed operational control of Zhongshan Winha and became the primary beneficiary of those operations. As a result, Zhongshan Winha was considered a variable interest entity with respect to Shenzhen Wanha and, as a result, from August 1, 2013 through November 27, 2015, the financial statements of Zhongshan Winha were consolidated with our Company's financial statements.


	On November 27, 2015, Shenzhen Wanha exercised its option to purchase the registered equity of Zhongshan Winha from the shareholders of Zhongshan Winha.  Upon the exercise of the purchase option, Zhongshan Winha became a wholly owned subsidiary of Shenzhen Wanha. The financial statements of Zhongshan Winha remain consolidated with our Company's financial statements, but now as a subsidiary.


	In May 2015, C&V International Company Limited ("C&V"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Winha International, set up a wholly owned subsidiary, Winha Commerce and Trade International Limited ("Australian Winha"). In February 2016, 100% of the outstanding shares of Sanmei International Investment Co., Ltd ("Sanmei Investment"), a company incorporated in Anguilla on April 23, 2013, were transferred to Winha International Group Limited. Winha International Group Limited then transferred the shares of its wholly owned subsidiary, C&V, to Sanmei Investment.


	In March 2016, C&V transferred the shares of Australian Winha to Sanmei Investment. Subsequently, Sanmei Investment transferred 29% of the outstanding shares of Australian Winha to persons and entities who were either affiliates of, or consultants to,  the Company (5% to Beijing Ruihua Future, 5% to Donghe Group, 7% to Zhuowei Zhong, 5% to Xinxi Zhong, 4% to Zhifei Huang and 3% to Chun Yan Winne Lam), and transferred 11% of the shares of Australian Winha to persons who are  suppliers to Zhongshan Winha. The effect of above transaction reduced the interest of the Company in its Australian subsidiary, and indirectly in Zhongshan Winha, by 40%.

	 The following tables set forth key components of our results of operations during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the percentage changes between 2016 and 2015.

	Revenue


	Our revenue grew during fiscal year 2016 and the first nine months of fiscal year 2017, as recognition of our brand developed and we introduced additional revenue streams. During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2016, our total revenue increased to $16,686,167 and $45,470,149, respectively, an increase of 46% and 69% over the revenue of $11,458,651 and  $26,855,768 that we realized during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2015. In addition to continuing expansion of our custom-made sales operations, two new channels for product distribution contributed to revenue during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2016:

	·






	During the year ended March 31, 2016 we initiated franchising operations, and sold 26 franchises, which were supplemented by an additional 18 franchises during the nine months ended December 31, 2016. During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2016,franchise operations contributed $ 1,036,656 and $4,322,366 to revenue, consisting of upfront franchise fees of and monthly administrative fees, respectively, an increase of 10% and 196% over the revenue of $941,292 and $1,458,744 that we realized during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2015.

	At June 30, 2016 our retail operations consisted of seven stores and two restaurants. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we transferred control of six of the retail stores (those in Sanshui, Shunde, Chancheng, Xiaolan, Dongguan and Guangzhou) to six unrelated individuals. We now market to those six stores as a wholesale provider. As a result, our retail sales for the nine months ended December 31, 2016 fell by $1,076,236 compared to the comparable period of fiscal year 2016 (with a reduction of $931,094 for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 from the quarter ended December 31, 2015); but we recorded wholesale sales of $4,965,320 in the recent nine month period, with no comparable sales in the nine months ended December 31, 2015.









	During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2016, we had total revenue of $16,686,167 and $45,470,149, respectively, representing an increase of 46% and 69%, respectively, when compared with the three and nine months ended December 31, 2015.

	Gross profit


	Gross profit for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2016 increased to $7,150,266 and $20,940,813, respectively, due to the increase in revenue. Our gross margin decreased to 43% and 46%, respectively, as compared to the 54% gross margin, respectively, that we realized during both the three and nine months ended December 31, 2015. Gross margin, excluding franchise-related revenue, was only 39% and 40%, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2016. The reduction in gross margin reflected the increased portion of our revenue attributable to the retail stores and wholesale, which have lower margins than our custom-made sales. We expect the gross margin to change as additional revenue streams are added, although the direction will depend on the relative volume of high-margin revenue sources (e.g. custom made sales, franchising) versus lower margin sources (e.g. retail stores and wholesale).

	Operating Expenses





	Selling Expenses.

	Selling expenses represent the labor cost for our marketing department and retail store, as well as expenses directly related to our marketing efforts. Selling expense for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2016 were $449,185 and 1,970,981, respectively, an increase of 90% and 122%, respectively, over the three and nine months ended December 31, 2015. Selling expenses increased primarily due to the addition of a second restaurant in fiscal year 2016. We expect our selling expenses to increase in proportion to the number of additional restaurants that we open.




	General and Administrative Expenses.

	General and administrative expenses for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2016 totaled $890,906 and $1,970,981, respectively, representing an increase of 76.5% and 73.9% respectively, from three and nine months ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to the expansion of our overall operations, including the introduction of franchise operations and a second restaurant. In addition, our 60%-owned Australian subsidiary incurred $299,047 in expenses in connection with its preparation for listing on the Australian Stock Exchange ("ASX") that initially was rejected. As we expand our operations, particularly as we initiate our multi-faceted marketing program, we expect general and administrative expenses to increase, reflecting the staffing requirements of more complex and expanded operations.




	Net Income


	After taking into account insignificant amounts of other income (loss), we recorded pre-tax net income of $5,802,234 and $5,490,056, respectively, $17,053,494 and $12,708,191, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. Corporate income in China is subject to income tax at a rate of 25%. Our provision for income taxes was $1,529,319 and $1,401,247, respectively, and $4,477,314 and $3,218,501, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, primarily representing the enterprise income tax on the income of our Chinese operating entities. After deducting the income tax, we had a net income before non-controlling interests of $4,272,915 and $4,088,809, respectively, and $12,576,180 and $9,489,690, respectively, during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. However, because of the 40% of Australian Winha that we do not own, we are required to allocate 40% of the net income (loss) realized by Australian Winha and its subsidiaries to the non-controlling interest. As a result, net income attributable to the common stockholders of the Company (i.e. after the allocation to the non-controlling interest) was $2,563,749 and $4,088,809, respectively, representing $0.05 per share and $0,08 per share, respectively, and $7,545,708 and $9,489,690, respectively, representing $0.15 per share and $0.19 per share, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.


	Foreign Currency Translation Adjustment


	Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Our local currency, Renminbi, is our functional currency. All asset and liability accounts have been translated using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date.  Equity accounts have been translated at their historical exchange rates when the capital transactions occurred.    Statements of income and other comprehensive income and cash flows have been translated using the average exchange rate for the periods presented.  Adjustments resulting from the translation of our consolidated financial statements are recorded as other comprehensive income.    Transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in the results of operations as incurred. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, foreign currency translation adjustments of $(798,871) and $(279,514), respectively, and $(1,501,616) and $(526,358), respectively, have been reported as other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income (loss), respectively. The significant increase in the translation adjustments was due to the PRC's devaluation of its currency. Further devaluation could occur.

	Liquidity and Capital Resources 


	As of December 31, 2016, the Company had cash and cash equivalent of $13,258,063, compared to $21,548,630 as of March 31, 2016. The following table summarizes our cash flows for the nine months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:

	During the nine months ended December 31, 2016, our operations yielded $12,576,180 in net income but only provided cash totaling $1,208,794. The discrepancy between net income and cash was primarily due to our prepayment of $4,732,252 to lease farm land over the next several years. In addition, our accounts receivable increased by $6,958,589 during the nine months ended December 31, 2016 due to the period-to-period increase in sales, and the balance of advances from customers decreased by $668,436. All of this was partially offset by a $872,509 decrease in inventory, due to our outsourcing of control over six of our retail stores. During the nine months ended December 31, 2015, our operations yielded $9,489,690 in net income and provided cash totaling $11,748,983. The difference between net income and cash provided by operations was primarily caused by an increase in taxes payable of $1,300,201 and a decrease in inventory of $1,131,273 during that period.





	During the nine months ended December 31, 2015 our Australian subsidiary sold convertible debentures for net proceeds of $5,596,055. The Australian subsidiary repaid those debentures in full during the nine months ended December 31, 2016, funded by cash received from the pre-sale of 24,271,191 ordinary shares of $6,123,137 - the sale was completed on January 4, 2017, reducing the equity interest of our U.S, parent in the Australian subsidiary (and, indirectly, in our Chinese operating company) to 44.87%. During the nine months ended December 31, 2016, we also received loans of $1,260,804 from a stockholder who paid our professional fees in the United States and in Australia during that period. As a result of these transactions, net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended December 31, 2016 was $2,275,946. For the nine months ended December 31, 2015, the proceeds from sale of the convertible debt combined with a capital contribution to our Chinese operating company of $816,001 and proceeds from the stockholder loans of $42,987 resulted in net cash provided by financing activities of $6,455,043.


	With the cash from operations and financing activities, we used $9,623,726 to purchase fixed assets, including $9,425,559 expended to purchase fruit orchards. We also used $720,800 as the initial payment towards the acquisition by the Australian subsidiary of an Australian company named Flavours Fruit & Veg Pty Ltd. ("Flavours"). Completion of our purchase of that company will require an additional payment of approximately $1.57 million plus an additional payment in an amount determined by Flavours' net profit for the year ended March 31, 2019. During the nine months ended December 31, 2015, we purchased fixed assets for $378,154 and spent $7,569 to further develop our website, resulting in total cash used in investing activities of $385,723.





	39








	We had working capital of approximately $14,000,000 as of December 31, 2016, a decrease of approximately $2,000,000 compared to March 31, 2016. The decrease was principally the result of the investment in the fruit orchards and prepayment of the long-term leases related to the orchards.


	Our debt obligations at December 31, 2016 consisted of $1,731,124 in stockholder loans payable on demand. Since our cash balance far exceeds our debt obligations, we believe that our capital resources will be adequate to fund the Company's operations for at least the next 12 months.





	Transfer of Cash


	According to PRC laws and regulations, in the event that we need to finance the PRC operations in the future, we are allowed to provide funding by means of capital contributions to Shenzhen Wanha and/or loans to Zhongshan Winha. The loans would be subject to applicable government registration and approval requirements. We may not be able to complete the registration or obtain these government approvals on a timely basis. If we fail to complete such registration or receive such approvals, our ability to finance the PRC operations may be negatively affected, which could adversely affect liquidity and the Company's ability to fund and expand its business.


	Current PRC regulations permit the PRC subsidiaries to pay dividends.  However, payment of dividends is subject to applicable regulatory requirements. Furthermore, cash transfers from the PRC subsidiaries to their parent companies outside of China are subject to PRC government control of currency conversion. The Company receives substantially all of its revenues in RMB. Under the current corporate structure, income is primarily derived by the PRC subsidiaries. Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments and expenditures from trade-related transactions can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange ("SAFE") by complying with certain procedural requirements. As profits and dividends are current account items, any revenue generated in the PRC may be paid to shareholders outside of the PRC as profit or dividends without prior approval from SAFE so long as we comply with certain procedural requirements. However, the PRC government may also, at its discretion, restrict access in the future to foreign currencies for current account transactions. If the foreign exchange control system prevents us from obtaining sufficient foreign currency to satisfy our currency demands, the Company may not be able to pay dividends in foreign currencies to the shareholders. The inability to obtain the requisite approvals for converting RMB into foreign currencies, any delays in receiving such approvals or any future restrictions on currency exchanges may restrict the ability of the PRC subsidiary to remit sufficient foreign currency to pay dividends or other payments, or otherwise satisfy its foreign currency denominated obligations. 


	The Company currently intends to reinvest only earnings in expanding the operations and currently has no plans to pay any dividends.


	Future Reporting


	It should be noted that based upon the additional sale of shares by Australian Winha on January 4, 2017, the Company will  no longer be consolidating Australian Winha and its wholly owned subsidiaries that represent the operations of the Company through December 31, 2016. As the sale of shares reduced the Company's ownership to 44.87%, the Company will be reporting its share of the earnings (loss) of Australian Winha and subsidiaries utilizing the equity method of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

	Impact of Accounting Pronouncements





	Leases.

	In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") ASU 2016-02 – Leases.  The new standard establishes a right-of-use ("ROU") model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months.  Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement.  The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of the new standard on our financial statements.



	Revenue Recognition.

	In April 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). This guidance supersedes current guidance on revenue recognition in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. In addition, there are disclosure requirements related to the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue recognition. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No.2015-14 to defer the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 for all entities by one year. For public business entities that follow U.S. GAAP, the deferral results in the new revenue standard being effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard on its consolidated financial statements.



	Except as set forth above, there were no recent accounting pronouncements that we expect to have a material effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations.


	Off Balance Sheet Transactions 


	We do not currently have any off-balance sheet arrangements.

	CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES






	Disclosure Controls and Procedures



	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

	.  Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule13a-15(e) promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission) as of December 31, 2016.  The evaluation revealed that there are material weaknesses in our disclosure controls, specifically:




	41











	·




	We have not achieved the desired level of corporate governance with regard to identifying and measuring the risk of material misstatement. Because of our limited internal resources, we lack key monitoring mechanisms such as independent directors and audit committee to oversee and monitor the Company's risk management, business strategies and financial reporting procedures.





	 


	 





	·




	We have not designed and implemented controls to maintain appropriate segregation of duties in our manual and computer-based business processes which could affect the Company's purchasing controls, the limits on the delegation of authority for expenditures, and the proper review of manual journal entries.





	 


	 





	·




	Our accounting department personnel have limited knowledge and experience in US GAAP and reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").  To remediate the material weakness, the management has hired an external consultant with extensive experience in US GAAP and reports to the SEC, who is responsible for assisting the Company with (i) the preparation of its financial statements in accordance with US GAAP and (ii) its periodic reports with the SEC.





	Based on their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company's system of disclosure controls and procedures was not effective as of December 31, 2016.


	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting





	There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

	ITEM 1.     BUSINESS.



	 


	In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms "Company," "we," "us," and "our" refer to Winha International Group Limited ("Winha International") and its subsidiaries, through which Winha International owns a 60% equity interest in a single operating company, Zhongshan Winha Electronic Commerce Company Limited ("Zhongshan Winha",) and Zhongshan Winha's several subsidiaries.


	 


	Overview


	 


	Zhongshan Winha retails specialty food products drawn from many regions across China through its chain of dedicated  stores. We provide customers with access to a large variety of local food products that can otherwise only be found in the producer's region. Our vision is to promote cultures and traditions that exist throughout China, while bolstering local economies and raising awareness of the cultural heritage.





	To date, our marketing has occurred exclusively in our retail stores, which were seven in number at the end of our last fiscal year, on March 31, 2016. During the current fiscal year, we expect to add several new retail stores, and during the next two years, we also plan to develop a multi-channel marketing program, which will include an online store and a mobile app. In this manner, we plan to become a source for specialty food products throughout China.





	In the summer of 2015 we expanded the scope of our brand by initiating a franchising program. To date we have granted 26 franchises to stores that purchase food products from our suppliers and retail the products under our brand and trade dress. The franchisees pay us a start-up fee and monthly management fee for the right to participate in our franchise program.


	 


	Our Corporate History and Structure


	 


	Winha International was incorporated in Nevada on April 15, 2013. On August 1, 2013, we obtained control of Zhongshan Winha through a series of contracts (the "VIE Agreements") executed on August 1, 2013 by Zhongshan Winha, the equity-holders in Zhongshan Winha, and our subsidiary, Shenzhen Winha. The practical effect of the six VIE Agreements was to guarantee that any benefit or loss realized from the operations of Zhongshan Winha would be ultimately realized by our subsidiary, Shenzhen Winha Information Technology Company, Ltd. ("Shenzhen Winha"). Because Shenzhen Winha was to realize the ultimate benefit or loss from the operations of Zhongshan Winha, Zhongshan Winha was considered a variable interest entity with respect to Shenzhen Winha under U.S. accounting principles. For that reason, the balance sheet of Zhongshan Winha and its financial results have been consolidated with those of the Company since August 1, 2013.





	On November 27, 2015 Shenzhen Winha exercised its option to purchase the registered equity of Zhongshan Winha for a price equivalent to US$0.16. Since that date, therefore, Zhongshan Winha has been a subsidiary of Winha International.





	On May 24, 2016 we completed a reorganization of our subsidiaries, the purpose of which was to introduce an Australian subsidiary into our corporate structure, which will subsequently effect a public offering of its securities on the Australian Stock Exchange. Winha International owns only 60% of the outstanding shares in the Australian subsidiary. Therefore, the result of the reorganization was that our equity interest in Zhongshan Winha was reduced by 40%. That 40% interest was distributed to members of the Company's management, consultants to the Company's management, and suppliers to Zhongshan Winha.

	After completion of the reorganization in May 2016, the following chart demonstrates our current corporate structure.

	Products


	 


	With nearly 5,000 years of history and 56 ethnic groups, China is known for the variety of its cultures, in particular its diverse locally-produced specialty goods. As China covers almost 9.6 million square kilometers of land, the variation of climate and environment nourished many distinct local folk cultures and traditions that produced myriad local specialty goods.


	 


	Since the turn of the century, as the living standard in China has drastically improved, the demand for diversified consumer products has risen every year. Specialty goods, which reflect local cultures, history, and tradition, have become increasingly popular gifts for families and friends. However, due to factors such as limited business investment, incomplete infrastructure in certain rural areas, low brand awareness, lack of sales channels and ineffective marketing, the local specialty product business is still at its early stage.  In addition, with the goal to promote local cultures, China's State Council has been actively working to stimulate domestic demand for local specialty goods.





	Our business was founded to meet the demand for local specialty goods, both fresh and manufactured. We rely on direct suppliers across the country to supply products to us. We have established supply relationship with 85 direct suppliers across 15 provinces of China. We expect that our product sourcing will expand in proportion with the expansion of our business.

	During the past fiscal year, which ended on March 31, 2016, most of our best selling products were fresh produce, generally delivered direct from the farm to our customer. Our ten best selling products during fiscal year 2016 were:

	As the table indicates, our sales were dominated during the past fiscal year by fresh produce, most of which we sold to the hotel industry. However, three of the four products that generated the most sales were packaged goods, which shows the effect of our retail stores selling from inventory. By contrast, during fiscal year 2015 all ten of the best selling products were fresh produce. In the future, as we increase the number of our retail stores, our sales of packaged goods will increase as well.



	 


	On May 23, 2016 we entered into a sales contract with Shenzhen Zhongbai Supply Chaim Co., Ltd., which will import and deliver to us 3,000 boxes of honeycomb honey from Australia. We intend to highlight this product in our marketing to introduce the Chinese market to the special quality of Australian honey. Our expectation, then, is that sales of honeycomb honey will represent a growing portion of our revenue in the future.





	Retail Distribution


	 


	We currently have seven retail stores - we expect to add more during the current fiscal year. Each store holds a variety of manufactured food products in inventory, and offers farm-to-kitchen delivery of a wide variety of fresh and manufactured food products. All orders placed at a retail store are filled from our central office, using our proprietary stock-sell-storage software system. This system enables us to find products for each store with the optimal delivery performance and best pricing, while also monitoring the inventory at each store and its sales performance.





	During fiscal year 2016, only 22% of our revenue was the result of purchases of inventory located at a retail store. 71% was the result of custom orders placed at one of our retail stores. Most of these orders were placed by other business establishments, primarily hotels with restaurant services. In our standard relationship, the hotel has entered into a long-term purchase contract with our local retail store. As its needs develop, the hotel places orders with the local retail store by fax, phone or email.  The order is placed into our software system, and a purchaser at our central office sends a purchase order, usually with instructions for the supplier to deliver to the hotel at a designated time.





	Our custom-order business has grown quickly, as we offer significant advantages to our commercial customers over traditional food distribution systems:








	·




	We make available a wide variety of interesting food options, which allow our commercial customers to offer upscale menus to their clientele.





	 


	 





	·




	Zhongshan Winha involves itself directly in the planting decisions of our suppliers, with a goal of offering the freshest possible produce on schedules that are favorable to the needs of our commercial customers.





	 


	 





	·




	Our retail stores endeavor to facilitate ease of business for our customers, allowing them to pre-schedule visits to our store and obtain back-door delivery of their purchases.

	In April of 2015, we expanded the marketing channels by opening our Restaurant at 19 Changyi Road in Wuguishan. The purpose of the Restaurant is less food service than food sampling. Potential customers are invited to visit the Restaurant, where our staff of chefs will prepare foods using the produce and products available at our retail stores. In this manner, our customers can preview both the quality of our products and creative ideas for incorporating our products into the customers' menus. A small retail store is located onsite at the Restaurant, where customers can place orders for our products. However, we expect the Restaurant experience to yield sales throughout our system. With the success of the Restaurant in Wuguishan, we recently opened a catering business in Shaxi Town, Yunnan Province Our plan is to open additional restaurants during the current fiscal year. 





	Our proprietary software enables the administrative staff in our central office to monitor our stores and control inventory and cash flow efficiently. Although each point-of-purchase has its own bank account, all are integrated online, so that our finance department can monitor cash balances and cross-check against inventory turnover.







	Franchises





	We initiated our franchising program in the summer of 2015. Today we have 26 franchisees, each operating a single store under our trademark and trade dress. Our franchisees are geographically distributed as follows:

	Each franchisee signs a Joint Cooperation Agreement with Zhongshan Winha for a term of five years, renewable on application. The agreement gives the franchisee the right and obligation to use Zhongshan Winha's trademarks and trade name to operate its store as part of Zhongshan Winha's unified operating system. The franchisee is required to purchase its inventory from the suppliers engaged by Zhongshan Winha, and to otherwise comply with management policies developed by Zhongshan Winha for its franchisees. The franchisee is required to pay to Zhongshan Winha an initial franchise fee and then a monthly management fee, both of which are determined by the class of city in which the franchisee is located and the size of its store:

	Since initiating our franchise program in the summer of 2015 and through March 31, 2016, we recorded $3,055,692 in franchise and management fees. We intend to increase the number of franchised stores during fiscal 2017, and expect revenue from our franchise operations to represent an increasing portion of our total revenue.

	Plans for Expansion of Market Channels


	 


	Our goal is to become the leading provider of regional food products throughout China. Toward that end, we intend to open up retail stores as our financial and personnel resources permit. To supplement the retail stores, however, we are developing an online marketing capability, consisting of an online store and a mobile app.  We expect both channels to become functional during calendar year 2016.


	 





	·





	Online Store. 

	Consumers will be able to access our products at our website 


	www.winha.com


	. Our goal is to build our website into a one-stop shop for local specialty products of all kinds. Towards that end, we have been recruiting employees in areas such as graphic design, photography, and online business administration.





	 


	 





	·





	Mobile Store.

	 We unveiled the prototype for our mobile app at the end of August 2013. Our mobile app will be searchable on WeChat, a social network platform that was developed by Tencent and has gained its popularity among China-based smart phone users. We worked with a third-party developer in creating a sophisticated interface for the mobile app, and obtained a public account with WeChat that so that our mobile app can be searched and "friended" by the public at large. Our mobile app will have two segments: pages introducing local cultures throughout China and a virtual store that will provide exclusive deals, such as free samples and special discounted items.





	 


	Our goal is to integrate our online presence with our physical presence. We anticipate that customers will be introduced to our products at our retail stores and/or restaurants, then utilize our online store and/or mobile app for repeat orders. But we will also direct customers in the other direction, by periodically sending registered users push notifications regarding featured products and sales items, which will in most cases have a direct link for them to easily review and purchase, but may also direct them to our local retail store.


	  


	Government Regulation


	 


	Foreign Exchange Regulation Relating to Foreign Invested Enterprises


	 


	Under current Chinese regulations, RMB are freely convertible for trade and service-related transactions denominated in foreign currency, including the distribution of dividends, interest payments, trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not for direct investment, loans, repatriation of investments or investments in securities outside China without the prior approval of the SAFE or its local branches. In May 2013, SAFE promulgated SAFE Circular 21 which provides for and simplifies the operational steps and regulations on foreign exchange matters related to direct investment by foreign investors, including foreign exchange registration, account opening and use, receipt and payment of funds, and settlement and sales of foreign exchange.


	 


	Foreign-invested enterprises in China may execute foreign exchange transactions without the SAFE approval for trade and service-related transactions denominated in foreign currency by providing commercial documents evidencing these transactions. Foreign exchange transactions related to direct investment, loans and investment in securities outside China are still subject to limitations and require approval from the SAFE.


	 


	On August 29, 2008, the SAFE issued the Circular on the Relevant Operating Issues Concerning the Improvement of the Administration of the Payment and Settlement of Foreign Currency Capital of Foreign-Invested Enterprises, or Circular 142. Pursuant to Circular 142, RMB capital derived from the settlement of a foreign-invested enterprise's foreign currency capital must be used within the business scope approved by the applicable government authority and cannot be used for domestic equity investment, unless specifically provided for otherwise. Documents certifying the purposes of the settlement of foreign currency capital into RMB, including a business contract, must also be submitted for the settlement of such foreign currency. In addition, foreign-invested enterprises may not change how they use such capital without the SAFE's approval and may not in any case use such capital to repay RMB loans if they have not used the proceeds of such loans. Violation of Circular 142 can result in severe penalties, including heavy fines as set forth in the Foreign Exchange Administration Rules. The SAFE promulgated a circular on November 9, 2010, or Circular 59, which tightens the regulation over settlement of net proceeds from overseas offerings like this offering and requires that the settlement of net proceeds must be consistent with the description in the prospectus for the offering. Furthermore, the SAFE promulgated the Circular on Further Clarification and Regulation of the Issues Concerning the Administration of Certain Capital Account Foreign Exchange Businesses, or Circular 45, on November 9, 2011, which expressly restricts a foreign-invested enterprise from using RMB converted from its registered capital to provide entrusted loans or repay loans between non-financial enterprises. Circular 142, Circular 59 and Circular 45may significantly limit our ability to transfer the net proceeds from this offering to our PRC subsidiary and convert the net proceeds into RMB, which may adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business in the PRC.

	Regulation of Dividend Distributions


	 


	The principal regulations governing dividend distributions of wholly foreign owned companies include: the Companies Law (2005), the Wholly Foreign Owned Enterprise Law (2000), and the Wholly Foreign Owned Enterprise Law Implementing Rules (2001).


	 


	Under these regulations, wholly foreign owned companies in China may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, wholly foreign owned companies are required to set aside at least 10% of their respective accumulated profits each year, if any, to fund certain reserve funds, until the aggregate amount of these funds reaches 50% of the company's registered capital. Wholly foreign owned companies may, at their discretion, allocate a portion of their after-tax profits based on PRC accounting standards to staff benefits and bonus funds. These reserve funds and staff benefits and bonus funds are not distributable as cash dividends.


	 


	Regulations on Product Liability and Consumers Protection


	 


	Product liability claims may arise if the products sold have any harmful effect on the consumers. The injured party may claim for damages or compensation. The Product Quality Law of the PRC, which was enacted in 1993 and amended in 2000, strengthens the quality control of products and protects consumers' rights and interests. Under this law, manufacturers and distributors who produce or sell defective products may be subject to confiscation of earnings from such sales, revocation of business licenses and imposition of fines, and in severe circumstances, may be subject to criminal liability.


	 


	The Law of the PRC on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Consumers was promulgated on October 31, 1993 and became effective on January 1, 1994 to protect consumers' rights when they purchase or use goods or services. All business operators must comply with this law when they manufacture or sell goods and/or provide services to customers.


	 


	The Tort Law of the PRC effective on July 1, 2010 requires that when the product defect endangers people's life or property, the injured party may hold the producer or the seller liable in tort and require that it remove obstacles, eliminate danger, or take other action. The Tort Law also requires that when a product is found to be defective after it is put into circulation, the producer and the seller shall give timely warnings, recall the defective product, or take other remedial measures.





	Regulation of Franchise Operations





	Article 7 of the Regulations on Administration of Commercial Franchise (State Council No. 485) requires that a franchisor, before initiating franchise operations, must operate at least two direct sale stores that have had continual operations for over one year, and must have the ability to provide operational guidance, technical support, business training, and related services to its franchisees. Zhongshan Winha met these requirements in the summer of 2015, when it initiated its franchise program.

	ITEM 1A.       RISK FACTORS


	 


	Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. The risks below are those that we believe are the material risks that we currently face, but are not the only risks facing us and our business. If any of the events contemplated by the following discussion should occur, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected, and you could lose all or part of your investment.


	 



	Risks Related to Our General Business Operation



	 





	We May Encounter Substantial Competition in Our Business and Our Failure to Compete Effectively May Adversely Affect Our Ability to Generate Revenue.


	 


	We are a recently organized company. A number of our competitors, including Taobao, Gongtianxia.com and Techan.com, are established and have greater resources than we do. Our competitive strategy is to implement our innovative business model of selling local specialty goods retail on a shopping platform that utilizes both physical stores and virtual stores. However, we believe that new competitors will enter the market and adopt our business model to introduce new websites, mobile applications and services with competitive characteristics. We expect that we will be required to continue to invest in improving our services to compete effectively in our markets. Our competitors could develop a more efficient business model or undertake more aggressive and costly marketing campaigns than ours, which may adversely affect our marketing strategies and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.


	 


	From Time to Time, We Need to Identify New Suppliers of Local Specialty Products. If We Cannot Obtain Sufficient Supply That Meet Our Standards at a Reasonable Cost or at All, Our Sales Could Be Interrupted, Our Financial Performance Could Suffer.


	 


	Though each local region generally has abundant sources of specialty products, we cannot assure that the specialty products will continue to be available or in the sense of quality and prices, accessible to us. Numerous factors, most of which are beyond our control, can influence the prices of the supply for local specialty products. These factors include, to name a few, general economic conditions, manufacturer capacity utilization, vendor backlogs and transportation delays, and other uncertainties.


	 


	If we experience insufficiency of the supply of local specialty products, our sales could be interrupted if we do not have inventory to meet the demand, which will directly lead to a decrease in our revenue and profit.


	 



	8







	We May Not Be Able To Market Our Website and Mobile Store Successfully.


	 


	Once we establish a stable and comprehensive supply of specialty products across the country, we plan to launch a marketing campaign to fully promote and advertise our website and mobile store. The e-commerce industry is extremely competitive. Though very few, if any, specialize in local specialty goods, there are currently many general online shopping websites both in China and worldwide that sell local products.  An effective marketing plan will need to be executed in order to establish a loyal client base, and to get our website and mobile application known in the marketplace. If we fail to develop such an effective marketing plan, and if we are unable to market our website and mobile application successfully to consumers, we may not be able to sustain online business operations.


	 


	We May Not Be Able to Find Suitable Software Developers at an Acceptable Cost.


	 


	We contract with software developers to further develop and upgrade our website and mobile store and associated backend interface. Due to the current demand for skilled technological developers, we run the risk of not being able to find or retain suitable personnel at an acceptable price. We would also need to ensure that the candidates are adequately qualified to develop a website or mobile application that is user friendly, free of errors and seamless in design. Without these developers, we may not be able to further develop and upgrade the software, which is the most important aspect of our business development.


	 


	Food Safety Events Involving Us or Our Supply Chain Could Create Negative Publicity and Adversely Affect Sales And Operating Results.


	 


	Because some of our items are perishable food products, food safety is a top priority, and we dedicate resources to ensure that our customers enjoy safe and quality food products. However, food safety events, including instances of food-borne illness have often occurred in the Chinese food industry in the past, and could occur in the future. As a result, our stores could experience a significant increase in supply costs if there are food safety events whether or not such events involve our stores or those of competitors.


	 


	In addition, food safety events, whether or not involving us, could result in negative publicity for Winha or for the industry or market segments in which we operate. Increased use of social media could create and/or amplify the effects of negative publicity. This negative publicity, as well as any other negative publicity concerning types of food products we serve, may reduce demand for our products and could result in a decrease in guest traffic to our online, mobile store and physical stores as consumers shift their preferences to our competitors or to other products or food types. A decrease in traffic to our stores, website and/or mobile store as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity could result in a decline in sales.


	 


	We May Be Subject to Product Liability Claims if People or Properties Are Harmed By the Products We Sell.


	 


	Products sold through our stores, and those to be sold through our website and mobile store are manufactured by third parties. Some of those products may be defectively produced or manufactured. As a result, sales of such products through our stores, website or mobile store could expose us to product liability claims relating to personal injury or property damage and may require product recalls or other actions. Third parties subject to such injury or damage may bring claims or legal proceedings against us as the distributor of the products. We do not currently maintain any third-party liability insurance or product liability insurance in relation to products sold through our stores. As a result, any material product liability claim or litigation could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even unsuccessful claims could result in the expenditure of funds and managerial efforts in defending them and could have a negative impact on our reputation.


	 



	Risks Related to Doing Business in China



	 


	Uncertainties With Respect to the PRC Legal System Could Adversely Affect Us.


	 


	We conduct all of our business through our subsidiary in China. Our operations in China are generally subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investments in China and, in particular, laws and regulations applicable to wholly foreign-owned enterprises. The PRC legal system is based on statutes. Prior court decisions may be cited for reference but have limited precedential value.


	 



	9







	Since 1979, PRC legislation and regulations have significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investments in China. However, China has not developed a fully integrated legal system and recently enacted laws and regulations may not sufficiently cover all aspects of economic activities in China. In particular, because these laws and regulations are relatively new, and because of the limited volume of published decisions and their nonbinding nature, the interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations involve uncertainties. In addition, the PRC legal system is based in part on government policies and internal rules (some of which are not published on a timely basis or at all) that may have a retroactive effect. As a result, we may not be aware of our violation of these policies and rules until sometime after the violation. In addition, any litigation in China may be protracted and result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management's attention.


	 


	Under the Enterprise Income Tax Law, We May Be Classified as a "Resident Enterprise" of China. Such Classification Will Likely Result in Unfavorable Tax Consequences to Us and Our Non-PRC Stockholders.


	 


	China passed a new Enterprise Income Tax Law, or the EIT Law, and its implementing rules, both of which became effective on January 1, 2008. Under the EIT Law, an enterprise established outside of China with "de facto management bodies" within China is considered a "resident enterprise," meaning that it can be treated in a manner similar to a Chinese enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes. The implementing rules of the EIT Law define de facto management as "substantial and overall management and control over the production and operations, personnel, accounting, and properties" of the enterprise.


	 


	On April 22, 2009, the State Administration of Taxation of China (the "SAT"), issued the Notice Concerning Relevant Issues Regarding Cognizance of Chinese Investment Controlled Enterprises Incorporated Offshore as Resident Enterprises pursuant to Criteria of de facto Management Bodies, or the Notice, further interpreting the application of the EIT Law and its implementation to offshore entities controlled by a Chinese enterprise or group. Further to the Notice, the SAT issued the Administrative Measures for Enterprise Income Tax on Chinese-controlled Offshore Incorporated Resident Enterprises (Trial) on July 27, 2011, or Bulletin No. 45, which took effect on September 1, 2011, to provide more guidance on the implementation of the Notice. Pursuant to the Notice, an enterprise incorporated in an offshore jurisdiction and controlled by a Chinese enterprise or group will be classified as a "non-domestically incorporated resident enterprise" if (i) its senior management in charge of daily operations perform their duties mainly in China; (ii) its financial or personnel decisions are made or approved by bodies or persons in China; (iii) its substantial assets and properties, accounting books, corporate stamps, board and stockholder minutes are kept in China; and (iv) at least half of its directors with voting rights or senior management often reside in China. The Bulletin No. 45 provides clarification on the resident status determination, post-determination administration and competent tax authorities. It also specifies that when provided with a copy of PRC resident determination certificate from a Chinese-controlled offshore-incorporated resident enterprise, the payer should not withhold 10% income tax when paying certain Chinese-sourced income such as dividends, interest and royalties to the Chinese-controlled offshore-incorporated resident enterprise. A resident enterprise would be subject to an enterprise income tax rate of 25% on its worldwide income and must pay a withholding tax at a rate of 10% when paying dividends to its non-PRC stockholders. However, it remains unclear as to whether the Notice is applicable to an offshore enterprise controlled by a Chinese natural person. Therefore, it is unclear how tax authorities will determine tax residency based on the facts of each case.


	 


	If the PRC tax authorities determine that we are a "resident enterprise" for PRC enterprise income tax purposes, a number of unfavorable PRC tax consequences could follow. First, we may be subject to the enterprise income tax at a rate of 25% on our worldwide taxable income as well as PRC enterprise income tax reporting obligations. In our case, this would mean that income such as non-China source income would be subject to PRC enterprise income tax at a rate of 25%. Currently, we do not have any non-China source income. Second, under the EIT Law and its implementing rules, dividends paid to us from our PRC subsidiary would qualify as "tax-exempt income." Finally, it is possible that future guidance issued with respect to the new "resident enterprise" classification could result in a situation in which a 10% withholding tax is imposed on dividends we pay to our non-PRC stockholders and with respect to gains derived by our non-PRC stockholders from transferring our shares. We are actively monitoring the possibility of "resident enterprise" treatment for the 2013 tax year and are evaluating appropriate organizational changes to avoid this treatment, to the extent possible.


	 


	If we were treated as a "resident enterprise" by PRC tax authorities, we would be subject to taxation in both the U.S. and China, and our PRC tax may not be creditable against our U.S. tax.

	PRC Regulation of Loans and Direct Investment by Offshore Holding Companies to PRC Entities May Delay or Prevent Us From Making Loans or Additional Capital Contributions to Our PRC Operating Subsidiary, Which Could Materially and Adversely Affect Our Liquidity and Our Ability to Fund and Expand Our Business.


	 


	As an offshore holding company of our PRC operating subsidiary, we may make loans to our PRC subsidiary, or we may make additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiary. Any loans to our PRC subsidiary are subject to PRC regulations. For example, loans by us to our subsidiary in China to finance its activities cannot exceed statutory limits which is the difference between the total investment and the registered capital of our PRC subsidiary and must be registered with the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE. On August 29, 2008, SAFE promulgated Circular 142, a notice regulating the conversion by a foreign-invested company of foreign currency into RMB by restricting how the converted RMB may be used. Circular 142 requires that RMB converted from the foreign currency-denominated capital of a foreign-invested company may only be used for purposes within the business scope approved by the applicable governmental authority and may not be used for equity investments within the PRC unless such investments are otherwise provided for in the business scope. The foreign currency-denominated capital shall be verified by an accounting firm before converting into RMB. In addition, SAFE strengthened its oversight over the flow and use of RMB funds converted from the foreign currency-denominated capital of a foreign-invested company. To convert such capital into RMB, the foreign-invested company must report the use of such RMB to the bank, and the RMB must be used for the reported purposes. According to Circular 142, change of the use of such RMB without approval is prohibited. In addition, such RMB may not be used to repay RMB loans if the proceeds of such loans have not yet been used. Violations of Circular 142 may result in severe penalties, including substantial fines as set forth in the Foreign Exchange Administration Rules. In addition, the SAFE promulgated the Notice on Relevant Issues Concerning Strengthening the Administration of Foreign Exchange Business, or Circular 59, on November 9, 2010, which requires the government to closely examine the authenticity of settlement of net proceeds from offshore offerings and the net proceeds to be settled in the manner described in the offering documents. 


	 


	We may also decide to finance our subsidiary by means of capital contributions. These capital contributions must be approved by the Ministry of Commerce of China, or MOFCOM, or its local counterpart. We may not be able to obtain these government approvals on a timely basis, if at all, with respect to future capital contributions by us to our PRC subsidiary. If we fail to receive such approvals, our ability to capitalize our PRC operations may be negatively affected, which could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business.


	 


	Governmental Control of Currency Conversion May Affect the Value of Your Investment.


	 


	The PRC government imposes controls on the convertibility of RMB into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of China. Prior approval from SAFE is required where RMB is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay certain capital account items, such as the repayment of loans denominated in foreign currencies as well as the proceeds of the liquidation of assets.


	 


	We receive substantially all of our revenues in RMB. Under our current corporate structure, our cash flow is primarily derived from dividend payments from our PRC subsidiary. Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments and expenditures from trade-related transactions can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from SAFE by complying with certain procedural requirements. As profit and dividend are current account items, our revenues generated in the PRC may be paid to shareholders outside of the PRC as profit or dividend without prior approval from SAFE so long as we comply with certain procedural requirements.


	 


	However, the PRC government may at its discretion restrict access in the future to foreign currencies for payments of profit and dividend. If the foreign exchange control system prevents us from obtaining sufficient foreign currency to satisfy our currency demands, we may not be able to pay dividends in foreign currencies to our shareholders.


	 


	Our inability to obtain the requisite approvals for converting RMB into foreign currencies, any delays in receiving such approvals or any future restrictions on currency exchanges may restrict the ability of our PRC subsidiary to remit sufficient foreign currency to pay dividends or other payments to us, or otherwise satisfy its foreign currency denominated obligations.


	 



	11







	Fluctuation in the Value of the RMB May Have a Material Adverse Effect on the Value of Your Investment.


	 


	The value of the RMB against the U.S. dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in political and economic conditions. On July 21, 2005, the PRC government changed its decade-old policy of pegging the value of the RMB to the U.S. dollar. Under the new policy, the RMB is permitted to fluctuate within a narrow and managed band against a basket of certain foreign currencies. Provisions on Administration of Foreign Exchange, as amended in August 2008, further changed China's exchange regime to a managed floating exchange rate regime based on market supply and demand. From 2008 to 2015 the exchange rate between the RMB and the U.S. dollar remained relatively stable. Since September of 2015, however, the Chinese government has reduced the value of the RMB three times, for an aggregate reduction of almost four percent. Substantially all of our revenues and costs are denominated in RMB, and a significant portion of our financial assets are also denominated in RMB. We principally rely on dividends and other distributions paid to us by our subsidiary in China. Any significant revaluation of the RMB may materially and adversely affect our cash flows, revenues, earnings and financial position, and the value of, and any dividends payable on, our ordinary shares in U.S. dollars. Any fluctuations of the exchange rate between the RMB and the U.S. dollar could also result in foreign currency translation losses for financial reporting purposes.


	 


	PRC Regulations Relating to the Establishment of Offshore Special Purpose Companies by PRC Residents May Subject Our Potential PRC Resident Shareholders to Penalties and Limit Our Ability to Inject Capital Into Our PRC Subsidiary, Limit Our PRC Subsidiary's Ability to Distribute Profits to Us, or Otherwise Adversely Affect Us.


	 


	The SAFE has promulgated several regulations, including the Notice on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Residents' Financing and Roundtrip Investment through Offshore Special Purpose Vehicles, or Circular 75, effective on November 1, 2005 and its implementation rules. These regulations require PRC residents and PRC companies to register with local branches of the SAFE before SPVs conduct any overseas financing, have any change in equity interest, conduct any round-trip investments or have any other material changes in capital or equity interest in SPVs. An amendment to registration or filing with the local SAFE branch by such PRC residents or PRC companies is also required for the injection of equity interests or assets of an onshore enterprise in the offshore special purpose company or overseas funds raised by such offshore company, or any other material change involving a change in the capital of the offshore special purpose company.  Any PRC resident shareholders holding direct or indirect interest in our company may be subject to Circular 75 and its implementation rules. Failure by any such PRC residents to comply with Circular 75 and its implementation rules could subject themselves to fines or legal sanctions, restrict our overseas or cross-border investment activities, limit our ability to inject capital into our PRC subsidiary, limit our PRC subsidiary's ability to distribute profits to us or affect our ownership structure, which could adversely affect our business and prospects.


	  



	Risks Related To Our Securities



	 


	The Company's Shares Currently Trade for Less Than $5.00 Per Share, and Thus are a Penny Stock. Trading in Penny Stocks Has Many Restrictions and These Restrictions Could Severely Affect the Price and Liquidity of the Company's Shares.


	 


	Since commencing trading in August 2014, our stock has traded below $5.00 per share. Our stock, therefore, is known as a "penny stock", which is subject to various regulations involving disclosures to be given to you prior to the purchase of any penny stock. The SEC has adopted regulations which generally define a "penny stock" to be any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. A penny stock is subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker/dealers who sell these securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. For transactions covered by these rules, the broker/dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of these securities. In addition, the broker/dealer must receive the purchaser's written consent to the transaction prior to the purchase. He must also provide certain written disclosures to the purchaser. Consequently, the "penny stock" rules may restrict the ability of broker/dealers to sell our securities, and may negatively affect the ability of holders of shares of our common stock to resell them. These disclosures require a potential purchaser to acknowledge that he understands the risks associated with buying penny stocks and that he can absorb the loss of his entire investment. Penny stocks are low priced securities that do not have a very high trading volume. Consequently, the price of the stock is often volatile and you may not be able to buy or sell the stock when you want to.


	 


	We Do Not Anticipate Paying Dividends in the Foreseeable Future.


	 


	We have never declared or paid any cash dividends or distributions on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to support operations and to finance expansion and therefore we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.


	 


	The declaration, payment and amount of any future dividends will be made at the discretion of the board of directors, and will depend upon, among other things, the results of our operations, cash flows and financial condition, operating and capital requirements, and other factors as the board of directors considers relevant. There is no assurance that future dividends will be paid, and, if dividends are paid, there is no assurance with respect to the amount of any such dividend.


	 



	12







	The Lack of Public Company Experience of Our Management Team Could Adversely Impact Our Ability to Comply With the Reporting Requirements of U.S. Securities Laws.


	 


	Our management lacks public company experience, which could impair our ability to comply with legal and regulatory requirements such as those imposed by Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Our management has never been responsible for managing a publicly traded company. Such responsibilities include complying with federal securities laws and making required disclosures on a timely basis. Our management may not be able to implement programs and policies in an effective and timely manner that adequately respond to such increased legal, regulatory compliance and reporting requirements, including establishing and maintaining internal controls over financial reporting.  Any such deficiencies, weaknesses or lack of compliance could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") which is necessary to maintain our public company status. If we were to fail to fulfill those obligations, our ability to continue as a U.S. public company would be in jeopardy in which event you could lose your entire investment in our company.

	ITEM 7.           MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.


	 






	Events Affecting Consolidation


	We operate our business in China through Zhongshan Winha. We expect that virtually all of our revenue will be derived from Zhongshan Winha. On August 1, 2013, our subsidiary, Shenzhen Winha, entered into a set of contractual agreements with Zhongshan Winha and its equity owners, including an exclusive business cooperation agreement, exclusive option agreement, loan agreement, share pledge agreement, power of attorney and spousal consents. Shenzhen Winha, through these arrangements, assumed operational control of Zhongshan Winha and became the primary beneficiary of those operations. As a result, Zhongshan Winha was considered a variable interest entity with respect to Shenzhen Winha and, as a result, from August 1, 2013 through November 27, 2015, the financial statements of Zhongshan Winha were consolidated with our Company's financial statements.


	The control of our operations through these contractual arrangements created risks for our business. If Zhongshan Winha and its shareholders failed to perform their obligations under the contractual arrangements, or if we suffered significant delay or other obstacles in the process of enforcing these contractual arrangements, or if legal remedies under PRC laws that we relied on were not available or effective, our business and operations could have been severely disrupted, which could have materially and adversely affected our results of operations and our ability to generate revenue in the PRC and could have damaged our reputation. To avoid such risk, on November 27, 2015, Shenzhen Winha exercised its option to purchase the registered equity of Zhongshan Winha from the shareholders of Zhongshan Winha.  Upon the exercise of the purchase option, Zhongshan Winha became a wholly owned subsidiary of Shenzhen Winha. The financial statements of Zhongshan Winha remain consolidated with our Company's financial statements, but now as a subsidiary.


	In May 2015, C&V International Company Limited ("C&V"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Winha International, set up a wholly owned subsidiary, Australia Winha Commerce and Trade Limited ("Australian Winha"). In February 2016, Sanmei International Investment Co., Ltd ("Sanmei Investment"), a company incorporated in Anguilla on April 23, 2013, transferred 100% of its shares to Winha International Group Limited. Winha International Group Limited then transferred the shares of its wholly owned subsidiary, C&V, to Sanmei Investment.


	In March 2016, C&V transferred the shares of Australian Winha to Sanmei Investment. Subsequently, Sanmei Investment transferred 29% of the outstanding shares of Australian Winha to persons and entities who were either affiliates of, or consultants to,  the Company (5% to Beijing Ruihua Future, 5% to Donghe Group, 7% to Zhuowei Zhong, 5% to Xinxi Zhong, 4% to Zhifei Huang and 3% to Chun Yan Winne Lam), and transferred 11% of the shares of Australian Winha to persons who are  suppliers to Zhongshan Winha. The effect of above transaction reduced the interest of the Company in its Australian subsidiary, and indirectly in Zhongshan Winha, by 40%.

	Revenue


	We commenced operations during the quarter ended June 30, 2014, and recorded $118,749 in revenue for that quarter. By the year ended March 31, 2015, our revenue had increased significantly to $9,023,642 due to the opening of new retail stores and the initiation of custom-made sales. Our revenue continued to grow during fiscal year 2016, as recognition of our brand developed and we introduced additional revenue streams. In particular, during the year ended March 31, 2016 we sold 26 franchises and recognized revenue of $3,055,692, consisting of upfront franchise fees and monthly administrative fees.






	During the year ended March 31, 2016, we had total revenue of $42,442,485, representing an increase of 370% when compared with the year ended March 31, 2015. The following table shows the components of revenue:

	Gross profit


	Gross profit for the year ended March 31, 2016 increased dramatically to $22,449,732 due to the dramatic increase in revenue. Our gross margin increased to 53% as compared to the 52% gross margin that we realized during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. However, gross profit, excluding franchise-related revenue, was only 47% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. The reduction reflected the increased portion of our revenue attributable to our retail stores, which have lower margins than our custom-made sales.  We expect our gross margin to change as additional revenue streams are added, although the direction will depend on the relative volume of high-margin revenue sources (e.g. custom made sales, franchising, online and mobile) versus lower margin sources (e.g. retail stores).







	Operating Expenses


	Selling Expenses


	Selling expenses represent the labor cost for our marketing department and retail stores, as well as expenses directly related to our marketing efforts. Selling expense for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 was $2,492,594, an increase of 341% over fiscal 2015. Selling expenses increased primarily due to the expanded operations of our retail stores and the addition of a restaurant in fiscal year 2016.



	We expect our selling expenses to increase in proportion to the number of additional retail stores and restaurants that we open.


	General and Administrative Expenses


	General and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 totaled $23,605,484, representing an increase of 2,233% from fiscal year 2015. The increase was due to a stock compensation expense of $21,882,816 that we incurred when we distributed 40% of Australian Winha (and, indirectly, 40% of Zhongshan Winha) to persons who are either affiliates of the Company, consultants to the Company, or suppliers to Zhongshan Winha. Excluding the stock compensation expense, general and administrative expenses increased by only 70%, which was due to the expansion of our overall operations, including the introduction of franchise operations and two restaurants. As we expand our operations, however, particularly as we initiate our multi-faceted marketing program, we expect general and administrative expenses to increase, reflecting the staffing requirements of more complex and expanded operations.


	Net Income


	After taking into account insignificant amounts of other income and other expenses, we recorded pre-tax net income (loss) of $(3,722,845) and $3,106,080 for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Corporate income in China is subject to income tax at a rate of 25%. Our provision for income taxes was $4,542,327 and $739,528 for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, primarily representing the enterprise income tax on the income of our Chinese operating entity. After deducting the income tax, we had a net income (loss) before non-controlling interests of $(8,265,172) and $2,366,552, respectively, during the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. However, because of the 40% of  Australian Winha that we do not own, we are required to allocate 40% of the net income (loss) realized by Australian Winha and its subsidiaries to the non-controlling interest. As a result, net income attributed to the non controlling interests was $3,039,948 and $0 for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our net income (loss) attributable to the common stockholders of the Company (i.e. after the allocation to the non-controlling interest) was $(11,315,120), representing $(0.23) per share and $2,366,552, representing $0.05 per share, for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

	Foreign Currency Translation Adjustment


	Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Our local currency, Renminbi, is our functional currency. All asset and liability accounts have been translated using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date.  Equity accounts have been translated at their historical exchange rates when the capital transactions occurred.    Statements of income and other comprehensive income and cash flows have been translated using the average exchange rate for the periods presented.  Adjustments resulting from the translation of our consolidated financial statements are recorded as other comprehensive income (loss).    Transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in the results of operations as incurred. For the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, foreign currency translation adjustments of $(414,183) and $31,732, respectively, have been reported as other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income (loss), respectively. The significant increase in the translation adjustments was due to the PRC's devaluation of their currency. Further devaluation could occur.










	Liquidity and Capital Resources 


	As of March 31, 2016, the Company had cash and cash equivalent of $21,548,630, compared to $1,103,726 as of March 31, 2015. The increase of $20,444,904 in cash was principally due to (a) $16,083,400 in net cash provided by operating activities, (b) additional capital contributions by our stockholders totaling $816,001, and (c) proceeds from the sale by our Australian subsidiary of convertible debt for $5,537,359

	.



	The following table summarizes our cash flows for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015:

	The net loss of $(8,265,172) that we incurred in fiscal 2016 was primarily attributable to the $21,882,816 stock compensation expense that we incurred when we distributed 40% of the equity in our Australian subsidiary to affiliates, consultants and suppliers. Disregarding that expense, our operations yielded $13,617,644 in net income, which provided cash totaling $16,083,400, as we decreased our inventory balance by $1,097,696 and increased our taxes payable account by $1,203,370.


	As noted, our shareholders made additional capital contributions of $816,001 during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. We also received loans of $404,971 from a stockholder who paid our professional fees in the United States and in Australia during the year. In addition, our Australian subsidiary received $5,537,359 from the sale of convertible debt.


	With the cash from operations and financing activities, we used $1,705,551 to purchase fixed assets - primarily the leasehold improvements in our new stores and restaurants, $10,234 to further develop our website and $1,550 to acquire our subsidiary, for a total of $1,717,335 in cash used in investing activities.



	17







	We had working capital of approximately $16,000,000 as of March 31, 2016, an increase of approximately $12,300,000 compared to March 31, 2015. The increase was principally the result of the cash provided by operations and from the convertible debt issued by our Australian subsidiary.


	Our debt obligations at March 31, 2016 consisted of $477,199 in stockholder loans payable on demand and convertible debt of $5,435,466, which is due during fiscal year 2017. Since our cash balance far exceeds our debt obligations, we believe that our capital resources will be adequate to fund our Company's operations for at least the next 12 months.


	Transfer of Cash


	According to PRC laws and regulations, in the event that we need to finance our PRC operations in the future, we are allowed to provide funding by means of capital contributions to Shenzhen Winha and/or loans to Zhongshan Winha. The loans would be subject to applicable government registration and approval requirements. We may not be able to complete the registration or obtain these government approvals on a timely basis. If we fail to complete such registration or receive such approvals, our ability to finance our PRC operations may be negatively affected, which could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business.



	 Current PRC regulations permit our PRC subsidiaries to pay dividends to us. However, payment of dividends is subject to applicable regulatory requirements. Furthermore, cash transfers from our PRC subsidiaries to their parent companies outside of China are subject to PRC government control of currency conversion. We receive substantially all of our revenues in RMB. Under our current corporate structure, our income is primarily derived by our PRC subsidiaries. Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments and expenditures from trade-related transactions can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange ("SAFE") by complying with certain procedural requirements. As profits and dividends are current account items, any revenue generated in the PRC may be paid to shareholders outside of the PRC as profit or dividends without prior approval from SAFE so long as we comply with certain procedural requirements. However, the PRC government may also, at its discretion, restrict access in the future to foreign currencies for current account transactions. If the foreign exchange control system prevents us from obtaining sufficient foreign currency to satisfy our currency demands, we may not be able to pay dividends in foreign currencies to our shareholders. Our inability to obtain the requisite approvals for converting RMB into foreign currencies, any delays in receiving such approvals or any future restrictions on currency exchanges may restrict the ability of our PRC subsidiary to remit sufficient foreign currency to pay dividends or other payments to us, or otherwise satisfy its foreign currency denominated obligations.

	 


	The Company currently intends to reinvest its earnings in expanding its operations and currently has no plans to pay any dividends.



	 

	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates


	In preparing our financial statements we are required to formulate working policies regarding valuation of our assets and liabilities and to develop estimates of those values.  In our preparation of the financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2016, there were no estimates made which were (a) subject to a high degree of uncertainty and (b) material to our results.  


	Impact of Accounting Pronouncements


	There were no recent accounting pronouncements that have or will have a material effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM








	To the Board of Directors and



	Stockholders of Winha International Group Limited

	 

	and subsidiaries







	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Winha International Group Limited

	 

	and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of March 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, changes in stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two year period ended March 31, 2016.  These consolidated financial statement are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.



	 


	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement.  The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.  Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion.  An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall consolidated financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

	ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS






	 


	Winha International Group Limited ("Winha International") was incorporated in Nevada on April 15, 2013.  The subsidiaries of the Company and their principal activities are described as follows:


	Winha International and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the "Company". The Company retails local specialty products from different regions across China through its seven self-operated physical stores.  The stores are supplemented by two restaurants, the first of which the Company opened in April 2015. In addition, the Company has granted 26 franchises to use the Company's tradename, store dress, other resources. The Company plans to open additional stores and restaurants and add additional franchisees during fiscal 2017. The Company also plans to develop its website and mobile store, as it expands its sales platform. The Company's business model utilizes a multi-channel shopping platform to sell locally-produced food, beverages, and arts and crafts that are well-known across China. Through this comprehensive shopping platform, the Company will provide customers with access to a variety of local products that can typically only be found in local stores or markets in specific regions of China.


	 


	Until November 27, 2015, the Company operated its business through a variable interest entity, Zhongshan Winha Electronic Commerce Company Limited ("Zhongshan Winha")

	,

	which has two wholly owned limited liability subsidiaries, Zhongshan Supermarket Limited ("Zhongshan Supermarket") and Zhongshan Winha Catering Management Co., Ltd. ("Winha Catering"), as well as three incorporated branches.  The Company had the controlling interest in Zhongshan Winha via its wholly owned subsidiary Shenzhen Winha Information Technologies Company Ltd. ("Shenzhen Winha") through a series of contractual arrangements. On November 27, 2015, the shareholders of Zhongshan Winha transferred their stock to Shenzhen Winha upon the exercise of its option to purchase all of the registered equity

	.

	The purchase price was $

	0

	.16.  Zhongshan Winha, therefore, is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Shenzhen Winha.


	 


	In May 2015, C&V International Company Limited ("C&V"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Winha International, set up a wholly owned subsidiary, Australia Winha Commerce and Trade Limited ("Australian Winha"). In February 2016, Sanmei International Investment Co., Ltd ("Sanmei Investment"), a company incorporated in Anguilla on April 23, 2013, transferred 100% of its shares to Winha International. Subsequently, Winha International transferred theshares of C&V to Sanmei Investment, and C&V transferred the shares of  Australian Winha to Sanmei Investment.

	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES



	Basis of Accounting and Presentation


	The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared on the accrual basis.


	Until November 27, 2015, the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its wholly owned subsidiaries and Zhongshan Winha, its VIE

	,

	for which it was deemed the primary beneficiary.  On November 27, 2015, the VIE structure was terminated upon Shenzhen Winha exercising its option to purchase all of the registered equity of Zhongshan Winha.  Shenzhen Winha became the sole owner of Zhongshan Winha.  All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.


	All consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements are presented in United States dollars ("US Dollar" or "US$" or "$").


	Foreign Currency Translation



	Almost all Company assets and operations are located in the PRC.  The functional currency for the majority of the Company's operations is the

	Renminbi ("RMB"). For Winha International Investment Holdings Company, the functional currency for the majority of its operations is the Hong Kong Dollar ("HKD"). For Australian Winha, the functional currency is the Australian Dollar ("AUD").  The Company uses the United States Dollar ("US Dollar" or "US$" or "$") for financial reporting purposes.  The financial statements of the Company have been translated into US dollars in accordance with FASB ASC 830,

	"Foreign Currency Matters."



	All asset and liability accounts have been translated using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date.  Equity accounts have been translated at their historical exchange rates when the capital transactions occurred.  Statements of operations, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flow amounts have been translated using the average exchange rate for the periods presented.  Adjustments resulting from the translation of the Company's financial statements are recorded as other comprehensive income (loss).

	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

	(CONTINUED)





	          

	Foreign Currency Translation (continued)


	For the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, foreign currency translation adjustments of $(414,183)

	and $

	31,732, respectively, have been reported as other comprehensive (loss) income. Other comprehensive (loss) income of the Company consists entirely of foreign currency translation adjustments.  Pursuant to ASC 740-30-25-17,

	"Exceptions to Comprehensive Recognition of Deferred Income Taxes,"

	the Company does not recognize deferred U.S. taxes related to the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries and, accordingly, recognizes no income tax expense or benefit from foreign currency translation adjustments.


	Although government regulations now allow convertibility of the RMB for current account transactions, significant restrictions still remain.  Hence, such translations should not be construed as representations that the RMB could be converted into US dollars at that rate or any other rate.


	The value of the RMB against the US dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in the PRC's political and economic conditions. Any significant revaluation of the RMB may materially affect the Company's financial co

	ndition in terms of US dollar reporting. The PRC has devalued the RMB by approximately 3.5 % subsequent to June 30, 2015. Further devaluations could occur in the future.



	Vulnerability Due To Operations in PRC



	The Company's operations may be adversely affected by significant political, economic and social uncertainties in the PRC.  Although the PRC government has been pursuing economic reform policies for more than twenty years, no assurance can be given that the PRC government will continue to pursue such policies or that such policies may not be significantly altered, especially in the event of a change in leadership, social or political disruption or unforeseen circumstances affecting the PRC's political, economic and social conditions.  There is also no guarantee that the PRC government's pursuit of economic reforms will be consistent, effective or will continue.

	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

	(CONTINUED)





	Use of Estimates


	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.


	 


	Prepaid Expenses


	 


	Prepaid expenses as of March 31, 2016 and 2015 mainly represent the prepayments of approximately $174,000 and $146,000, respectively

	,

	for prepaid decoration expenses of the Company's new stores.


	Advances from Customers


	Advances from customers represents prepaid cards purchased by customers at our retail locations. We believe that prepaid cards are principally purchased for gift purposes and usually used quickly. Accordingly the Company records the related obligation as a current liability.



	Advances from customers was $769,814 and $732,212 as of

	March 31, 2016 and 2015

	, respectively.



	Website Development Costs


	The Company accounts for website development costs in accordance with ASC 350-50, "Accounting for Website Development Costs", wherein website development costs are segregated into three activities:





	1.




	Initial stage (planning), whereby the related costs are expensed.





	 


	 





	2.




	Development stage (web application, infrastructure, graphics), whereby the related costs are capitalized and amortized once the website is ready for use. Costs for development content of the website may be expensed or capitalized depending on the circumstances of the expenditures.

	          Operating stage, whereby the related costs are expensed as incurred. Upgrades are usually expensed, unless they add additional functionality.





	 


	The Company has a website and ongoing website development costs of $45,676 and $39,014 as of March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The online sales platform is currently in use and the related costs are being amortized over five years. Amortization expense was $790 and $812 for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.


	  Revenue Recognition


	The Company recognizes revenue from the following channels: 





	a)




	Retail stores - The Company recognizes sales revenue from its seven retail stores, net of sales taxes and estimated sales returns at the time it sells merchandise to the customer. Customer purchases of shopping cards are not recognized as revenue until the card is redeemed when the customer purchases merchandise by using the shopping card.





	 


	 





	b)




	Custom-made sales - The Company started "Custom-made" sales in August 2014. The target customers are commercial customers who can order online or in the Company's local stores and make full payment on site. All orders are forwarded to Zhongshan Winha immediately, which arranges the delivery. Revenue from the sale of products is recognized upon delivery to customers provided that there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance, there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, and the sales price is fixed and determinable. Revenue generated from custom-made sales was $29,943,950 and $8,215,064, respectively, for years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively





	 


	 





	c)




	Franchise and management fees - During the quarter ended September 30, 2015, the Company commenced franchising the use of the Company's trademark, name identification and other business resources. The franchisee is required to pay franchise fees and management fees to Zhongshan Winha. Franchise fee revenue from franchise sales is recognized only when all material services or conditions relating to the sale have been substantially performed or satisfied by the Company. The franchise and management fees recognized by the Company were $3,055,692 for the year ended March 31, 2016 and are included in revenue.

	 Revenue Recognition (continued)


	Zhongshan Winha grants certain commercial customers limited rights to return products and provides price protection for inventories held by resellers at the time of published price reductions. Zhongshan Winha establishes an estimated allowance for future product returns based upon historical return experience when the related revenue is recorded and provides for appropriate price protection reserves when pricing adjustments are approved.


	Zhongshan Winha's return policy allows customers to return their merchandise in the original box and/or packaging within 7 days of purchase.  The Company has not experienced material returns

	.



	Fair Value of Financial Instruments


	FASB ASC 820,

	"Fair Value Measurement,"

	specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based upon whether the inputs to those valuation techniques reflect assumptions other market participants would use based upon market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs).  In accordance with ASC 820, the following summarizes the fair value hierarchy:



	Level 1 Inputs – Unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets and liabilities in an active market that the Company has the ability to access.





	Level 2 Inputs – Inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly.





	Level 3 Inputs – Inputs based on prices or valuation techniques that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurements.



	ASC 820 requires the use of observable market data, when available, in making fair value measurements.  When inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  Valuation techniques used need to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.  As of March 31, 2016 and 2015, none of the Company's assets and liabilities were required to be reported at fair value on a recurring basis.  Carrying values of non-derivative financial instruments, including cash, accounts receivable, inventory, advances to suppliers, accounts payable and accrued expenses, and advances from customers approximate their fair values due to the short term nature of these financial instruments.  There were no changes in methods or assumptions during the periods presented.

	 Cash and Cash Equivalents


	The Company considers all demand and time deposits and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.


	 


	Accounts Receivable


	 


	Accounts receivable is stated at cost, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts, if required.  Receivables outstanding longer than the payment terms are considered past due.  The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses when necessary resulting from the failure of customers to make required payments.  The Company reviews the accounts receivable on a periodic basis and makes allowances where there is doubt as to the collectability of individual balances.


	 


	In evaluating the collectability of individual receivable balances, the Company considers many factors, including the age of the balance, the customer's payment history, its current credit-worthiness and current economic trends.  The Company considers all accounts receivable at March 31, 2016 and 2015 to be fully collectible and, therefore, did not provide an allowance for doubtful accounts.  For the periods presented, the Company did not write off any accounts receivable as bad debts.


	Inventory


	Inventory, comprised principally of merchandise and food products, is stated at the lower of cost or market.  The value of inventory is determined using the weighted average cost method.


	The Company estimates an inventory allowance for excessive or unusable inventories.  Inventory amounts are reported net of such allowances, if any.  There was no allowance for excessive or unusable inventories as of March 31, 2016 and 2015

	.



	Property, Plant and Equipment


	Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation.  Cost includes the price paid to acquire the asset, and any expenditure that substantially increases the asset's value or extends the useful life of an existing asset.  Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.  Major repairs and betterments that significantly extend original useful lives or improve productivity are capitalized and depreciated over the periods benefited.  Maintenance and repairs are generally expensed as incurred.

	  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets



	The Company applies FASB ASC 360,

	"Accounting for the Impairment and Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,"

	which addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the recognition and measurement of impairment losses for long-lived assets.  In accordance with ASC 360, long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  The Company may recognize the impairment of long-lived assets in the event the net book value of such assets exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows attributable to those assets.  No impairment of long-lived assets was recognized for the periods presented.


	Income Taxes


	The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC 740,

	"Income Taxes"

	("ASC 740"), which requires the recognition of deferred income taxes for differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax consequences for those differences, which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled.  Deferred taxes are also recognized for operating losses that are available to offset future taxable income.  A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.

	  ASC 740 addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements.



	Under ASC 740, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.  The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position would be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.  ASC 740 also provides guidance on the de-recognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, and accounting for interest and penalties associated with these tax positions.  As of March 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company did not record any liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits.

	The Company computes net income (loss) per common share in accordance with FASB ASC 260, "Earnings Per Share" ("ASC 260").  Under the provisions of ASC 260, basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.  Diluted income per common share is computed by dividing the net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus the effect of any potential dilutive shares outstanding during the period. There were no dilutive shares outstanding during the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015.  Accordingly, the number of weighted average shares outstanding as well as the amount of net income per share are presented for basic and diluted per share calculations for the period reflected in the accompanying consolidated statement of income and other comprehensive income.

	The statutory reserve fund is restricted as to use and can only be used to set-off against losses, expansion of production and operations and increasing registered capital of the respective company. The fund is not allowed to be transferred to the Company in terms of cash dividends, loans or advances, nor is it allowed for distribution except under liquidation.


	 


	The required transfer to the statutory reserve fund was $258,336 and $252,053, respectively, for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015.

	3.        RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS






	In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases. The new standard establishes a right-of-use ("ROU") model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements.


	 


	In November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (ASU 2015-17), which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. This accounting standard update is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.


	 


	In September 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2015-16: Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments ("ASU 2015-16"), which eliminates the requirement to restate prior period financial statements for measurement period adjustments. The new guidance requires that the cumulative impact of a measurement period adjustment (including the impact on prior periods) be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment is identified. ASU 2015-16 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. This accounting standard update is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.


	 


	In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date. The amendment in this ASU defers the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 for all entities for one year. Public business entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. This accounting standard update is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

	3.        RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (CONTINUED)


	In March 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") ASU 2015-03 – Interest – Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30). This ASU addressed the simplification of debt issuance costs presentation by presenting debt issuance costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt, consistent with debt discounts or premiums. This accounting standard update is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.


	In January 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") ASU 2015-01 – Income Statement – Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20).  This ASU addressed the simplification of income statement presentation by eliminating the concept of extraordinary items.  The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015.  A reporting entity may apply the amendments prospectively.  A reporting entity also may apply the amendments retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements.  Early adoption is permitted provided that the guidance is applied from the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption.  This accounting standard update is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

	8.  INCOME TAXES (CONTINUED)


	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for expected future tax consequences of differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The laws of China permit the carry-forward of net operating losses for a period of five years. U.S. federal net operating losses can generally be carried forward twenty years.


	Deferred tax assets are comprised of the following:

	At March 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had unused operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $16,214,870 and $161,000 respectively, expiring in various years through 2019.  The Company has established a valuation allowance of $6,303,650 and $60,928 against the deferred tax asset related to net operating loss carry-forwards at March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, due to the uncertainty of realizing the benefit. The carryforwards are principally in China and the United States.


	 


	The Company's tax filings are subject to examination by the tax authorities.  The tax years for 2015, 2014 and 2013 remain open to examination by the tax authorities in the PRC.  The Company's U.S. tax returns are subject to examination by the tax authorities for the years ended March 31, 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012. In August, 2015, the Company was assessed a penalty of $30,000 by the Internal Revenue Service for failure to file timely Form 5471's.  The penalty was waived by IRS on March 14, 2016.

	MARCH 31, 2016 AND 2015





	10.      PARENT COMPANY ONLY CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION (CONTINUED)


	Basis of Presentation





	The Company records its investment in its subsidiaries under the equity method of accounting.  Such investments are presented as "Investment in subsidiaries" on the condensed balance sheet and the subsidiaries' profits are presented as "Share of earnings from investment in subsidiaries" in the condensed statement of income.


	 


	Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted.  The parent only financial information has been derived from the Company's consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements.


	 


	There were no cash transactions in the US parent company during the twelve months ended March 31, 2016.


	 


	 Restricted Net Assets


	Under PRC laws and regulations, the Company's PRC subsidiaries are restricted in their ability to transfer certain of their net assets to the Company in the form of dividend payments, loans or advances. The restricted net assets of the Company's PRC subsidiaries amounted to approximately $11,050,554 as of March 31, 2016.


	 


	The Company's operations and revenues are conducted and generated in the PRC, and all of the Company's revenues being earned and currency received are denominated in RMB.  RMB is subject to the foreign exchange control regulations in China, and, as a result, the Company may be unable to distribute any dividends outside of China due to PRC foreign exchange control regulations that restrict the Company's ability to convert RMB into US Dollars.

	ITEM 9A.          CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.


	 



	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures


	 




	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

	.  Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule13a-15(e) promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission) as of March 31, 2016.  The evaluation revealed that there are material weaknesses in our disclosure controls, specifically:





	·




	We have not achieved the desired level of corporate governance with regard to identifying and measuring the risk of material misstatement. Because of our limited internal resources, we lack key monitoring mechanisms such as independent directors and audit committee to oversee and monitor the Company's risk management, business strategies and financial reporting procedures.





	 


	 





	·




	We have not designed and implemented controls to maintain appropriate segregation of duties in our manual and computer-based business processes which could affect the Company's purchasing controls, the limits on the delegation of authority for expenditures, and the proper review of manual journal entries.





	 


	 





	·




	Our accounting department personnel have limited knowledge and experience in US GAAP and reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").  To remediate the material weakness, the management has hired an external consultant with extensive experience in US GAAP and reports to the SEC, who is responsible for assisting the Company with (i) the preparation of its financial statements in accordance with US GAAP and (ii) its periodic reports with the SEC.





	 


	Based on their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company's system of disclosure controls and procedures was not effective as of March 31, 2016.


	 



	Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.


	 



	Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  We have assessed the effectiveness of those internal controls as of March 31, 2016, using the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO") Internal Control – Integrated Framework (1992) as a basis for our assessment.


	Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.  All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.  Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.


	A material weakness in internal controls is a deficiency in internal control, or combination of control deficiencies, that adversely affects the Company's ability to initiate, authorize, record, process, or report external financial data reliably in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America such that there is more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements that is more than inconsequential will not be prevented or detected. In the course of making our assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting, we identified four material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.  These material weaknesses consisted of the material weaknesses in our disclosure controls itemized above.

	.






	Because of the above conditions, management's assessment is that the Company's internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of March 31, 2016.


	 



	49








	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting


	 



	There were no changes that occurred during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2015 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act).

	Family Relationship


	 


	There are no family relationships between any of our directors or executive officers.


	 


	Employment Agreements


	 


	We have not entered into an employment agreement with our executive officer and director.


	 


	Board of Directors


	 


	Our director holds office until the next annual meeting of shareholders and until her successor has been duly elected and qualified. Officers are elected by and serve at the discretion of the board of directors.


	 


	Code of Ethics

	Board Committees


	 


	We have not formed an Audit Committee, Compensation Committee or Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Our Board of Directors performs the principal functions of each such committee. We currently do not have an audit committee financial expert on our Board of Directors.  We believe that the cost of hiring an audit committee financial expert to act as one of our directors and to be a member of an Audit Committee outweighs the benefits of having an audit committee financial expert at this time.

The selling shareholders are selling the common stock covered by this 
prospectus for their own account. We will not receive any of the proceeds from 
the sale of these shares. We have agreed to bear the expenses relating to the 
registration of the shares for the selling security holders, but we will not 
pay any of the selling commissions, brokerage fees and related expenses.


Several major e-commerce websites, such as Amazon, Taobao and Tmall.com, offer 
products similar to what we intend to specialize in. These websites vary in 
size. The larger, more established websites have key competitive advantages 
with existing customer bases, bargaining power to negotiate product supply 
prices, and experience in managing inventory. 

Though we are a small company at this stage, we specialize in the growing 
niche market of selling local specialty goods. We differentiate ourselves by 
combining the local specialty good retail with a multi-channel shopping 
platform consisting of physical stores, our online store, mobile store and 
set-top boxes for television sets. We also provide in-person customer services 
both pre-sales and post-sales through our self-operated physical stores, which 
is an offering to our customers not commonly available when shopping with 
other e-commerce companies.


Company Description
WINHA retails local specialty products from different regions across China
through its self-operated physical store, website, mobile store, set-top boxes
for television sets, and also carries on wholesale of local specialty products
to a regional distributor. Our innovative business model utilizes


 a
multi-channel shopping platform to sell locally-produced food, beverages, and
arts and crafts that are well-known across China. Through our comprehensive
shopping platform, we provide customers with access to a large variety of local
products that can typically only be found in local stores or markets in specific
regions.

We do not directly own our business operation in China. We conduct retail
business through our variable interest entity, Zhongshan WINHA, which we control
by a series of contractual arrangements. 

---

We market and sell the local specialty goods to customers through four retail 
channels: self-operated physical store, online store, mobile store, set-top 
box store and a wholesale channel: a regional distributor. Our revenue comes 
from the sales of local specialty goods made through these channels, at prices 
including10% gross profit margin. 

. Self-operated Physical Store . We established a self-operated storefront in 
  December 2013 in Zhongshan city in China. We plan to establish a second 
  self-operated storefront in the first quarter of 2014. Our self-operated 
  storefront retails local specialty goods to customers.  

. Online Store. Our products are available for purchase at our online store 
  at www.winha.com . Our goal is to build our website into a one-stop shop 
  for local specialty products of all kinds. We are working to recruit 
  employees in areas such as graphic design, photography, and business 
  administration.  

. Mobile store. We unveiled the mobile store at the end of August 2013. Our 
  mobile store is searchable on WeChat, a social network platform that is 
  developed by Tencent and has gained its popularity among China-based smart 
  phone users.  

. Set-Top Box Store. Customers can browse our products on a television set 
  (TV) screen if they choose to install a pre-programmed set-top box on their 
  TVs. A set-top box turns a TV into a display device. Customers with a set-
  top box pre-programmed with our product information will be able to view 
  and select products and complete purchases on a TV screen. In addition, 
  customers will be able to utilize other functions of set-top boxes such as 
  accessing internet web pages, streaming videos and movies, and playing games. 
  We have worked with a third-party developer and completed programing our 
  store of local specialty products into set-top boxes. We plan to make our 
  set-top boxes available for purchase at our self-operated stores.  

. Wholesale. We utilize a regional distributor in Hunan province to promote 
  our products to local retail stores. We are in the trial stage of the 
  wholesale channel and yet to decide if we plan to engage additional regional 
  distributors.  

VIP Club Program

At our existing and any future self-operated physical retail store(s) in
Guangdong Province, we offer prepaid cards to customers for purchase. The
prepaid cards are only available for purchase at our self-operated physical
store(s) in Guangdong Province, not any of our online, mobile, and set-top box
stores. Customers can use the prepaid cards to purchase local specialty products
at all of our self-operated physical retail store(s), online, mobile or set-top
box stores. In connection with prepaid card sales, we offer club memberships
(VIP Club Memberships”) to qualified VIP customers (the “VIP Club Members). To
receive one VIP Club Membership, a customer is required to purchase at once
prepaid cards in an amount of RMB 30,000 (approximately US $4,958) and, recruit
30 registered members (the “Registered Members”) to our self-operated physical
store(s). Registered Members receive special promotions and discounts as do VIP
Club Members, but unlike VIP Club Members, they do not have to meet the
thresholds of prepaid card purchase or member recruiting and are not entitled to
profit sharing discussed below. We plan to grant up to 2,500 VIP Club
Memberships at the self-operated physical retail store(s) in total. Each
individual customer can receive up to three VIP Club Memberships. In return for
joining the VIP club, the VIP Club Members receive in cash each quarter, a total
of 40% of the quarterly net income of all of our self-operated physical retail
store(s) in Guangdong Province on an aggregated basis, if these self-operated
physical retail store(s), on an aggregated basis, record net income (under the
U.S. GAAP standard) for that quarter. The cash award is distributed within 15
calendar days after each quarter end among the VIP Club Members pro rata
according to the number of their membership(s). If any adjustment is made to the
net income amount of the self-operated physical retail store(s) after the review
or audit by our auditor, we reflect the difference in the next immediate
distribution. In addition, when a VIP Club Member refers a new member to the VIP
club, the referrer is awarded in the form of prepaid cards, 10% of the amount
that the referee spends on his or her first-time purchase.

This VIP Club Membership program is designed to improve the cash flow of our
self-operated physical retail store(s) at the development stage and enhance
their operating performance in the long run by utilizing the VIP club members as
a marketing force. Both “net income” and “referral” awards are treated as
promotional expenses to promoting self-operated physical retail store(s).

Because the Company is in a development stage, it has incurred considerable
expenses with very limited revenue. As a result, the Company has historically
reported a net loss and is currently operating on a going concern basis. The
Company’s expenses at this stage are principally professional fees, relating to
organizing the Company and its subsidiaries. Our self-operated physical retail
store(s), which are controlled and managed by Zhongshan Supermarket, is not
expected to incur substantial expenses of professional fees as the Company does,
and rather, they are only expected to incur costs of sales, operating and other
expenses in line with revenues generation. Therefore, we expect that when the
self-operated physical retail stores(s) record net income there will most likely
be positive cash flow to fund the distribution to our VIP Club Members. If the
self-operated physical retail stores(s) encounter insufficient cash and cash
equivalents to fund the distribution of cash awards, the shareholders of
Zhongshan Supermarket will fund the distribution pro rata in accordance with
their shareholdings. However, they are not under any contractual obligations to
do so. If any distribution due is not promptly funded, we may face legal actions
taken by the VIP Club Members and the operation of our self-operated physical
retail store(s) may be severely disrupted.
