User documentation for the Software for Assisted Habitat Modeling (SAHM) package in VisTrailsProduct Type: Software DocumentationYear: 2012Author(s): Talbert, C. and M. TalbertSuggested Citation: Talbert, C. and M. Talbert. 2012. User documentation for the Software for Assisted Habitat Modeling (SAHM) package in VisTrails. Fort Collins, CO: USGS Fort Collins Science Center. 69 p. The Software for Assisted Habitat Modeling (SAHM) has been created to both expedite habitat modeling and help maintain a record of the various input data, pre-and post-processing steps and modeling options incorporated in the construction of a species distribution model. The four main advantages to using the combined VisTrail: SAHM package for species distribution modeling are: 1. formalization and tractable recording of the entire modeling process 2. easier collaboration through a common modeling framework 3. a user-friendly graphical interface to manage file input, model runs, and output 4. extensibility to incorporate future and additional modeling routines and tools. This user guide provides detailed instructions on how to install the SAHM package within VisTrails and then presents information on the use of the package. A step-by-step tutorial to create cheatgrass habitat suitability maps for Rocky Mountain National Park, USA, is provided in appendix A.
