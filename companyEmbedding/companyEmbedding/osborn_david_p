David L. Osborn

Distinguished Member of Technical StaffCombustion Research Facility, Combustion Chemistry

Short Bio
My research focuses on understanding the mechanisms of unimolecular and bimolecular chemical reactions.  To obtain the greatest level of detail, we study these reactions in the gas phase using powerful tools such as time-resolved infrared spectroscopy (TR-FTIR) and multiplexed photoionization mass spectrometry (MPIMS).  Much of this work uses tunable vacuum ultraviolet radiation produced by synchrotron light sources.  These techniques probe a wide range of reactants, intermediates, and products simultaneously, providing a global view of a chemical reaction.
The rate coefficients and product branching ratios from kinetics work, or the quantum state product distributions from dynamics experiments, provide insight into the shape and energetics of the potential energy surface that ultimately controls a chemical reaction.  By defining and constraining the mechanisms of chemical reactions, we provide both specific reaction data for predictive chemical models, and general tests of theoretical approaches that can be applied to reactions where experiments are too difficult to perform.
Accurate, predictive models of combustion and atmospheric chemistry are critical to our national and international interests, impacting, for example, tools to lower pollutant emissions from automobiles and policies to promote a more sustainable environment.
Research Interests
Gas phase chemical dynamics and kinetics, photodissociation dynamics, time-resolved photoionization mass spectrometry, combustion chemistry, atmospheric chemistry, science education.

PenFed Credit Union


                                            HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! They do not work with you at all to satisfy the customer. Other credit unions help you ESPECIALLY if you have great credit. This CU doesn't tell you everything so verify everything with two other reps. Total Nightmare!

If the company isn't reporting the account correctly, you can submit a dispute to the credit bureaus asking them to correct it.

If you were a grad victim you don't need to fill out a fraud package. Google it. And send it to the credit bureaus.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.

Are there really companies you can pay that guarantee to raise your credit score in 2 months or less or they'll double your money back?
