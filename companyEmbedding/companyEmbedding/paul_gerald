Mosier Plateau: A New(ish) Trail in the Columbia River Gorge

It’s not often we get a new hiking trail in the Columbia River Gorge. But the Mosier Plateau Trail is just that, and a most welcome one as well. Since I moved to Oregon in 1996, I can think of only handful of trails that have come online in the area: Cape Horn is an obvious […]

Hiking the New Trail at Tom McCall Point

Usually, I would hike Tom McCall Point in spring, when it’s one of the best wildflower hikes in the Columbia River Gorge. But I missed that this year. Still, there is a new piece of trail up there, and it’s always a nice hike, so I went to check it out at the end of […]

Peaceful Place: Rocky Butte

Whenever I give folks my one-day tour of Portland, we always wind up at Rocky Butte. Whether we’ve been up to Timberline Lodge, wandering the Gorge, or walking the city’s neighborhoods, I always want to close the day with the view from the little park on top of the Butte. It’s the best overall view […]

Old Mileage Markers on Oregon’s Eagle Creek Trail

Back in May, I led a hike for the Trailkeepers of Oregon along the Eagle Creek Trail in the Columbia River Gorge. That hike, which I wrote up for my blog, was all about trail maintenance and the issues facing trails — the stuff that Trailkeepers is all about. It was also about the history […]

Big Hills and Big Rewards in the Columbia Gorge: Hiking the Nick Eaton Way to Indian Point

If you’re looking to see what kind of shape you’re in, or start hiking yourself into better shape, go tackle the Nick Eaton Way in the Columbia River Gorge. It’s part of an 8-mile loop that gains about 3,000 feet — much of it in two particularly steep miles towards the middle. Near the top is one of the more […]

Triple Falls: A Great Hike for a Hot Day in the Columbia River Gorge

If you’re looking for a good Columbia Gorge hike to tackle on a hot day, or just a good get-away walk after a workday, the Triple Falls hike is one of the best options out there. The drive to the trailhead at Horsetail Falls should take an hour, tops, from the middle of Portland — […]

Monster Hike in the Oregon Coast Range: The Elk Mountain – Kings Mountain Loop

If you are looking for a real conditioning hike, something that offers more effort and challenge than classic scenery, you can’t do much better (or worse) than the Elk Mountain to Kings Mountain Loop in the Oregon Coast Range. Many people are familiar with the Kings Mountain hike, because it is a pretty straightforward deal: […]

Hike the Oregon Coast: Cape Lookout State Park in May (with whale video)

It’s amazing enough that we in the Portland area can drive about 90 minutes and go hiking at the beautiful Oregon coast. We can walk among old-growth forest, gaze down at waves crashing against rocky shorelines, and cross meandering streams as they spread onto sandy beaches. But when we start seeing whales from hundreds of feet […]

Touring Villa Park 


 
































An  American's  Guide  to  English  SoccerAn Obsession Today, A Book in 2017
You are here: Home / Clubs / Aston Villa / Touring Villa ParkTouring Villa Park
January 13, 2016 by Paul Gerald I’ve been to games at 30 English soccer stadiums and toured about a dozen of them, and I think my favorite is Villa Park, home of Aston Villa Football Club.
The players’ tunnel at Villa Park.
That’s even more true now that I’ve toured it. It’s big, it’s old, and it’s classy. I like their colors. I like their tour guides. I like the occasional stained glass. I like their tradition of having Americans play for them, including their current goalkeeper.
All in all, I basically can’t get enough of the place, even though when I toured there in December 2015 they were about as locked-in to get relegated as a team could be. I think they had one win the whole first half of the season! I guess that just means tickets will be easier to come by next year, even if the crowds will be smaller and the opponents less interesting.
I have been to a game there, by the way — a good one against Tottenham last year, in which Harry Kane got the winner and I got a cracking video of it, with the Spurs fans going wild. Read that post here.

I’ve put together this list of Frequently Asked Questions to help you get started planning your soccer adventure. I also have a more detailed blog post full of starter tips. But now I have something even cooler:
Consulting services!

Here’s a video from the tour, walking out into the rain-soaked stadium. The lights on the pitch are basically grow lights, by the way. Impressive, but they sure mess with a camera’s settings!

Anyway, some images from a tour of lovely Villa Park:

Meet Paul Gerald | Author Paul Gerald


















































































Hike, Travel, Write 


















 









Meet Paul Gerald 























So, who am I?
Well, we could go by craft and say writer. Or traveler. Or hiker. English soccer nut. Former Portland Breakfast Guy. All true.
We could get all spiritual and say I came from the light into this human experience in order to displace darkness with light. Also true.
Professionally, I am a freelance writer, author, and publisher. I’ve written for The Oregonian and Willamette Week, and I’ve done something like 300 travel and food articles for the Memphis Flyer. I write hiking and camping guidebooks for Menasha Ridge Press and Wilderness Press, and I wrote and published an all-breakfast guide to Portland called Breakfast in Bridgetown. I am the owner et al of Bacon and Eggs Press, an assumed business name of Second Cup Productions LLC. I am Second Cup Productions. And here’s why I call it Second Cup Productions.
There’s all sorts of links on this site to stuff I’ve written.
These days I also am the Marketing and Travel Editor for Embark Adventures, which is to say I write copy for the website and help out on lots of other stuff. I also lead trips for them. For example: Hiking and Touring in Tuscany in September 2015. I’m also working on books about the Portland Heritage Trees and English soccer.
So I’m busy. And I still try to get out and go hiking or get on the road.
My goal remains the same: go to interesting places, do interesting things, meet interesting people, and then tell the story.

                      Please upload a second, white version of your hand-written name.
                      The background should be 100% transparent.

                      This photo will appear at the top of the category page
                      when customers search for you on the site. Please upload
                      a photograph of yourself, not a logo.

                    designs. This note will be displayed to customers after

Mosier Plateau: A New(ish) Trail in the Columbia River Gorge

It’s not often we get a new hiking trail in the Columbia River Gorge. But the Mosier Plateau Trail is just that, and a most welcome one as well. Since I moved to Oregon in 1996, I can think of only handful of trails that have come online in the area: Cape Horn is an obvious […]

Hiking the New Trail at Tom McCall Point

Usually, I would hike Tom McCall Point in spring, when it’s one of the best wildflower hikes in the Columbia River Gorge. But I missed that this year. Still, there is a new piece of trail up there, and it’s always a nice hike, so I went to check it out at the end of […]

Peaceful Place: Rocky Butte

Whenever I give folks my one-day tour of Portland, we always wind up at Rocky Butte. Whether we’ve been up to Timberline Lodge, wandering the Gorge, or walking the city’s neighborhoods, I always want to close the day with the view from the little park on top of the Butte. It’s the best overall view […]

Old Mileage Markers on Oregon’s Eagle Creek Trail

Back in May, I led a hike for the Trailkeepers of Oregon along the Eagle Creek Trail in the Columbia River Gorge. That hike, which I wrote up for my blog, was all about trail maintenance and the issues facing trails — the stuff that Trailkeepers is all about. It was also about the history […]

Big Hills and Big Rewards in the Columbia Gorge: Hiking the Nick Eaton Way to Indian Point

If you’re looking to see what kind of shape you’re in, or start hiking yourself into better shape, go tackle the Nick Eaton Way in the Columbia River Gorge. It’s part of an 8-mile loop that gains about 3,000 feet — much of it in two particularly steep miles towards the middle. Near the top is one of the more […]

If you’re looking for a good Columbia Gorge hike to tackle on a hot day, or just a good get-away walk after a workday, the Triple Falls hike is one of the best options out there. The drive to the trailhead at Horsetail Falls should take an hour, tops, from the middle of Portland — […]

Monster Hike in the Oregon Coast Range: The Elk Mountain – Kings Mountain Loop

If you are looking for a real conditioning hike, something that offers more effort and challenge than classic scenery, you can’t do much better (or worse) than the Elk Mountain to Kings Mountain Loop in the Oregon Coast Range. Many people are familiar with the Kings Mountain hike, because it is a pretty straightforward deal: […]

Hike the Oregon Coast: Cape Lookout State Park in May (with whale video)

It’s amazing enough that we in the Portland area can drive about 90 minutes and go hiking at the beautiful Oregon coast. We can walk among old-growth forest, gaze down at waves crashing against rocky shorelines, and cross meandering streams as they spread onto sandy beaches. But when we start seeing whales from hundreds of feet […]

Paul Gerald Health is dedicated too, but not solely a holistic non-pharmacological understanding of health extending the individuals threshold enabling them to manage their lives through encouraging the acquisition or retrieval of coping skills/ strategies we all processed but have been exchanged for the short term and short lived conveniences of immediate apparent advantages that by treating symptoms alone creates more symptoms.
The danger of which pushes cause and just as importantly potential solutions further outside of the awareness of the sufferer; it is only through  a careful and shared introspection that a chief compliant and any comorbidity that may have arisen from the neglect of that compliant be established.
As a curative process formulated based entirely around the individuals personal
frame of reference and priorities. Having worked with many clients privately
and consulting with charities both locally and overseas with those presenting with
stress, anxiety, post traumatic stress disorder, depression & bereavement.
Those suffering from these conditions and disorders have reported great success
after engaging in a number of programmes I have developed and presented.
Delivered in the format of hourly sessions, one day workshops, and processes
extending to eight weeks. Appointments are held in the scenic Mourne mountains
approx one hour from Belfast and Dublin which has received people from throughout
Ireland, the British Isles Europe and the USA.
Consideration is also given to those who feel unable to travel, to be visited depending
on dairy and the provision of a suitable secure environment; if unresolved issues are
burdening your daily life and making you fearful of the future use your enquiry with me
as your first step of reorienting or just making a change.
“When you come to a complete standstill, you have to start again,
If you need help incorporating perspective and priorities starting again – get it!”
