About Company









Overview
Next Graphite, Inc. is an exploration development stage company targeting the growing global graphite production industry with the Company's 96,000-acre African-based Aukam Graphite Project. Aukam contains a special form of graphite known as “lump” or vein graphite. This high-end, clean graphite with its low sulphur content is highly sought after for important industrial applications, and worldwide supply is constrained since it is available in only a few locations worldwide, including our Aukam site in Namibia.
The Company anticipates revenue from our existing inventory of unprocessed graphite to commence in the third quarter of 2016, based on a recent Letter of Intent to initially purchase 5,000 tonnes of graphite. This sale of unprocessed graphite from our site will precede the Company going into production of its high-grade, processed lump graphite in 2017-18. The stage was set for this on-site production when the Company entered into a joint venture agreement in 2015 with a seasoned mining partner committed to building and paying for a graphite processing circuit facility at Aukam. Construction is scheduled to commence the first quarter 2017. Production of high-grade processed graphite could begin as early as the end of 2017.
The Aukam Graphite Mine was established in 1940 in the current Republic of Namibia, and has produced USD $30 million of graphite at today's prices. The Aukam property is estimated to still contain a significant amount of high-grade, vein type graphitic material. In 2014-2015 third party research laboratories validated the high quality of our on-site samples and an outside geologist report stated there are “an estimated 4 million tonnes of reserve of high-grade graphite from hydrothermal source” at Aukam. The current market value of the processed vein graphite samples at Aukam is approximately $2,800 - $3,500 per tonne.
The global graphite market was valued at $15.06 billion in 2014 and it is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4% during the period 2015 - 2020. Graphite demand is being driven by the development of new markets for clean and efficient energy alternatives, smart grid infrastructure and military capabilities. The Company’s lump graphite is a preferred source of graphite for many end users. It has unique characteristics suitable for use in 20 important value-added applications, particularly electric foils. It is also used in crucibles, brake pads, electrodes, refractories, lubricants, electric car lithium ion batteries, and nuclear reactors.

Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure and Physiography
Accessibility
Access to the property farm gate is via a 52.6 km graded gravel road (D446 and D727) from the main tar road (B4 Highway). This road is accessible to conventional cars. From the farm gate to the foot of the range that hosts the deposit (another 1km) is accessible by four-wheel drive gravel track, but essentially all-weather. The mine site workings are on a rugged slope and there is limited access by a bulldozed road. Access to the upper adits and open pit is by foot.
Climate
The Aukam Graphite deposit is located in an area of southern Namibia with both summer and winter rainfall. In the austral summer, daytime temperatures peak in the mid 40° Celsius, while in winter temperatures can go as low as freezing. Rainfall in winter is generally light drizzle with occasional harder falls and sometimes flurries. In summer, the rainfall is associated with occasional thunderstorms and is of short duration, but can be of very high intensity. All of the streams within the area are ephemeral and can flow very strongly after summer rainfall. Average annual rainfall is 50-150 mm.
Infrastructure
The infrastructure in the area is good with access to the site possible throughout the year. The Aukam Graphite deposit is relatively close to a main tar road and well graded so the only construction required would be a ±2 km long access road to site. There is a national power grid that passes 2 km from the property. A link would likely be required. Water is available in large amounts from underground aquifers (there is an old pump station at the foot of the mountain which was used previously to supply operations with water). The nearest rail link is located next to the main highway (some 70 km from site). Suitable areas for tailings dams and flotation plants are available dependent on eventual plant design. The nearest town of Aus is some 87 km away by road. The area is very arid farmland. 
Physiography
The Aukam Graphite deposit lies at an elevation between 1150m and 1300m above sea level. The surrounding area is up until 1450m above sea level at the highest point. The area is rugged with steep sided valleys and abrupt changes in local relief caused by differential erosion.
Geological Setting
The Aukam graphite deposit daylights in an erosional window incised through the hard layers of sedimentary rocks that mantle southern Namibia. The older hosting rocks, known as the Namaqualand Complex, are assemblage of gneisses, marbles, schists, quartzites, amphibolites with nested intrusive rocks including granite and gabbros. This suite of rocks indicates that the entire complex was once deeply buried. Intrusive events of charnockites have been dated between 1300 and 900 million years ago (Kroner and Blignault, 1976). Steep dipping shear zones are common and some are dated by Joubert (1974) around 1200 million years ago.
A prominent flat-lying and resistant sediment layer overlies the erosional unconformity at the top of the Namaqualand Complex. The specific formation has yet to be confirmed; however, it is likely to be the lowest most member of the Nama Group (Dabis Formation).

This figure shows the regional geological setting above the unconformity and identifies the Dabis formation as the lowest most member above the Namaqua Complex.
Hydrothermal alteration is common to some rocks in the window as is pegmatite veining. Both are evidence of hot water flowing through the rock. The graphite occurs at one such site where over-pressured hot waters evidently carrying carbon dioxide and maybe methane mineralized carbon into a zone of broken rock. This hosting “shear zone” is exposed for 350 m.
Reimer (1984) identified the sheared host rock at Aukam as Proterozoic granite hydrothermally altered to kaolinite and speculated on a biogenic origin to the graphite. However, he also considers Mueller’s (1971) opinion that veins from an unspecified location in Namibia sounding like Aukam was an “inorganic derivation of the hydrocarbons”.
Schneider and Genis [2001] have published a brief description of the graphite deposit:
“The zone comprises three parallel lodes. Veins, lenses and pockets of ore, several centimeters wide, dip 70 to 90 degrees to the south. The graphite, which is of the fine-flakey to lumpy type, usually contains malachite specs, while sulphur occurs along cracks. The graphite veins are flanked by a pale-green, highly epidotized and kaolinized granite which is soft and highly decomposed.”
The grayish rock and lineaments in the Aukam shear zone are clearly visible in satellite imagery. An inspection of the satellite data has yet to find a similar structure, although there are multiple locations demonstrating alteration that need to be investigated.

(OTC Markets: GPNE) ("Next Graphite," "GPNE," or the "Company"), an exploration/development stage company in Africa's Republic of Namibia targeting the growing global graphite production industry and market demand, today announced plans to bulk sample one of the Company's graphite veins on its 125,000-acre Aukam property.The 50-tonne bulk sampling program is planned to begin the last week of May 2015. The goal of the Company's sampling program is to infer graphitic content occurring within the former underground workings. In a former work program, the Company discovered a series of underground vein lodes on the property which appeared to be well mineralized and easily accessible. According to Company expectations, these vein lodes are anticipated to produce grades equal to leading graphite projects worldwide."As we continue with our near term strategy to screen, process and sell graphite in our surface mine dumps, our team is equally optimistic about the potential of high grade graphitic bearing vein lodes in the underground workings of our property," began Cliff Bream, CEO of Next Graphite, Inc. "If these grades are reproducible, they will significantly increase our output and can reduce our budgeted costs and expenses of our future mining operations," Bream concluded.The Company has committed to continually report its progress and results on all of its sampling, testing and grading programs currently underway.About Next Graphite, Inc.:Next Graphite, Inc. is an exploration/development stage company targeting the growing global graphite production industry with the Company's 125,000-acre Africa-based Aukam Graphite Project.

The Graphite property is estimated to still contain a significant amount of high grade, vein type graphitic material. Global graphite demand is being driven by the development of new markets for clean and efficient energy alternatives, smart grid infrastructure and military capabilities. Next Graphite has an immediately available, surface-visible, estimated 140,000-tonne mine heaps along with competitive projected mining and processing costs.

CKR Announces Signing of Farm Out Agreement Next Graphite Inc
Sep 14 16
CKR Carbon Corporation announced the signing of a binding Farm Out agreement with Next Graphite Inc. for the Aukam graphite project in Namibia. Under the terms of the Agreement CKR will earn a direct 63% interest in the License and the Project upon completion of investing USD 1.1 million in cash or the completion of the plant and infrastructure set up and government authorization to begin commercial operations. Completion of the plant and infrastructure setup may be less than USD 1.1 million, in which case CKR will have earned its 63% interest prior to investing the full amount. CKR has spent over USD 400,000 to date on the project and has consequently earned a 23% interest in the project so far. CKR must also make quarterly payments for a total of USD 180,000 (USD 85,000 paid to date) during the Farm-Out period which began on June 8, 2015 (on signing of the Joint Venture Agreement) and ends when CKR has earned its 63% ownership as outlined above. Should the Farm-Out Period need to be extended beyond the time in which CKR has invested its USD 1.1 million, Next will continue to be paid USD 25,000 per Quarter (or pro-rata for a partial Quarter) until the completion of the plant and Infrastructure set up and government authorization to begin commercial operations. In addition, in the case where the Farm-Out period is extended, and the revenue stream from graphite sales is less than USD 100,000 per month, CKR will loan Next Graphite USD 25,000 per quarter. Interest on the loan will be compounded monthly at a rate equal to one month term, London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 1%.
