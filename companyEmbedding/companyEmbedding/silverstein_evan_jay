SilversteinWrap™










Improve Outcomes in Breast Surgery
The SilversteinWrap, a post-surgical, post-biopsy bias compression dressing, improves outcomes in breast surgery.
Complications such as hematomas, ecchymosis and seromas are common following breast surgery; they can delay healing and adjuvant therapy.
Validated with 25+ years of clinical use, the SilversteinWrap can improve patient satisfaction and help to prevent up to 24% of these complications.

“Our study showed a 24% reduction in seroma formation post-breast cancer surgery with the use of a compression belt."
Dharmawan, R.; Nagalingam, S.; Tay, L..; Wong, C.; and Tan, B.“The Use of Compression Belt in the Prevention of Seroma Formation Post-Breast Cancer Surgery: A Randomized Trial.” 1Poster session presented at: Milan Breast Cancer Conference; 2013 June 20-21; Milan, Italy.
“Our findings are supportive of pressure dressing as an effective, cheap and easy-to-apply method for the reduction (a) of the time with drains in situ after MRM, (b) of the number of patients developing seromas and (c) of the seroma aspirations. This can potentially reduce further complications, needed medical care and cut expenditure.”

"My patient began bleeding badly during a minimally invasive breast biopsy. Thanks to the SilversteinWrap, we were able to prevent a significant complication for the patient."
Dr James Koness MDRoger Williams MedicalProvidence, Rhode Island 
Clinical Benefits


The SilversteinWrap is a sterile bias compression dressing. Unlike traditional compression bandages, the SilversteinWrap is more effective:


Larger width and longer length; over six times larger than traditional compression dressings
Bias weave stretches/compresses from multiple angles, conforming to body shape
Adhesion to skin not required
Edges stay flat, increasing patient comfort
Made of latex-free breathable 100% cotton

Applications
The SilversteinWrap is used in minimally invasive or vacuum assisted breast biopsy, breast lumpectomy, mastectomy, oncoplastic breast excision and reduction mammoplasty cases.
