        10 Reasons to Buy Veeva Systems Inc. Stock and Never Sell
    


newsfeedback@fool.com (Brian Stoffel)

A little over a decade ago, Peter Gassner was an executive at salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM). While he was out pushing the company's cloud services, he noticed something: The pharmaceutical industry had very specific needs that salesforce.com couldn't easily meet.Taking that information, he left salesforce.com to found Veeva Systems (NYSE: VEEV), where he still functions as the company's CEO. He started his work with Veeva CRM, a customer relationship management tool for Big Pharma. Then he really hit it out of the park with Veeva Vault, a product that helps companies manage -- in the simplest sense -- all of the data that they need to track to obtain FDA approval for their drugs.Image source: Getty Images
I first purchased shares of Veeva in January of 2014, have added to it since, and have no plans to sell. Here are 10 reasons why:1. It's got a strong moatImagine having all of your customer information on one platform. Then imagine having all of the data that you've collected from test results on the same platform. Now imagine you have to transfer all of that data to another platform.The horror!Not only would this be prohibitively expensive, it would also create massive headaches. Entire workforces would have to be retrained on a new system. And if any of this mission-critical data were lost, it would be a major liability. In the investing world, we call those high switching costs.2. Momentum is strongOf course, high switching costs mean absolutely nothing if you can't win over customers in the first place. Luckily for Veeva investors, however, momentum has been very strong.Veeva's Growth Across Service ProductsCreate column chartsPerhaps most importantly, the number of Vault customers using more than one Vault application grew 70% by the end of the first quarter of 2017.3. Optionality aboundsOptionality is a complicated word for a simple concept: Make lots of small bets and look for just one or two to hit it big. After you see how a small bet performs, you have the option to either pursue it further or kill it.For the first time, Veeva is really branching out on a small bet it recently made. Word of mouth about the ease and functionality of Veeva Vault has led companies outside of Big Pharma to start asking for a version that they can use. Specifically, this demand has come from industries that are heavily regulated: consumer packaged goods (CPG), chemicals, and manufacturing.Starting this year, Vault QualityOne, a hybrid Vault product, is on the market for companies outside of life sciences to use. Already, a top-five CPG company has signed on.4. Management has skin in the gameNo one knows more about the hidden risks of a company than those that are managing it. That's why I think it's so important to invest in companies where management has their own skin in the game via stock ownership.Peter Gassner owns almost 15 million Class B shares, while co-founder Gordon Ritter owns nearly 7 million. Combined, these two control just under 50% of all voting rights, and their stake is currently worth $1.4 billion.5. I love founder-led companiesAs you can tell, I'm a fan of skin in the game. But there's a class above skin in the game. Best-selling author and trader Nassim Taleb calls it having your "soul in the game." That's when someone takes risks on behalf of the greater community.That's what we have with Gassner: Most of his wealth is tied up in Veeva. But beyond that, founders often view their companies as extensions of themselves, and are committed to building lasting value.6. Employees seem to like itWhile some think culture isn't important and impossible to measure, I'd point you toward Glassdoor.com. While the site isn't perfect -- and is certainly open to manipulation -- it offers an important data point for those wanting to learn about the morale of a company.Currently, Veeva has pretty solid marks across the board.

Those that have solid balance sheets and positive cash flows can often emerge from these times even stronger. That's because they can acquire weaker rivals, buy back shares on the cheap, or -- most importantly -- offer deals that the competition can't, and steal long-term market share.Here's what the story looks like for Veeva right now.CashDebtNet IncomeFree Cash Flow$664 million$0$93 million$168 millionData source: Yahoo! FinanceThat's financial fortitude!
8. Customer concentration is lowCompanies that have solid balance sheets like that are in great shape. But they sometimes hide a dangerous risk -- relying on just a few customers for a huge part of their revenue. When that's the case, all it takes is one decision coming from one person to sink a company overnight.Luckily for Veeva, that's not the current situation. As the chart in the second point above shows, it has hundreds of different customers, and no single customer currently accounts for more than 10% of total revenues for the past three years.9. Who knows what will be next?Three years ago, CRM accounted for virtually all sales. Almost overnight, Vault has become an enormous contributor.Veeva Revenue by SegmentCreate column chartsVeeva's two newer products -- OpenData and Network -- probably won't hit the ball out of the park quite like Vault, but they don't have to. The company continues to innovate, and with each new customer, the moat surrounding Veeva widens.10. A takeover candidate?Personally, I wouldn't be a very big fan of a takeover. I think Veeva has enormous potential moving forward -- with the move outside of Big Pharma being a cherry on top.But the fact remains that Veeva clearly has a lot of momentum going for it. That's tempting to a lot of deep-pocketed competitors in the cloud space. While the stock certainly seems expensive right now, I wouldn't at all be surprised to see a cloud giant swoop in and pay around $10 billion for Veeva.So there you have it, 10 reasons I own and plan to hold on to Veeva Systems stock -- and why you might want to consider the stock as well.10 stocks we like better than Veeva SystemsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        10 Reasons to Buy Veeva Systems Inc. Stock and Never Sell
    


newsfeedback@fool.com (Brian Stoffel)

            Jul 22, 2017
        Updated Jul 22, 2017





























































































A little over a decade ago, Peter Gassner was an executive at salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM). While he was out pushing the company's cloud services, he noticed something: The pharmaceutical industry had very specific needs that salesforce.com couldn't easily meet.Taking that information, he left salesforce.com to found Veeva Systems (NYSE: VEEV), where he still functions as the company's CEO. He started his work with Veeva CRM, a customer relationship management tool for Big Pharma. Then he really hit it out of the park with Veeva Vault, a product that helps companies manage -- in the simplest sense -- all of the data that they need to track to obtain FDA approval for their drugs.Image source: Getty Images
I first purchased shares of Veeva in January of 2014, have added to it since, and have no plans to sell. Here are 10 reasons why:1. It's got a strong moatImagine having all of your customer information on one platform. Then imagine having all of the data that you've collected from test results on the same platform. Now imagine you have to transfer all of that data to another platform.The horror!Not only would this be prohibitively expensive, it would also create massive headaches. Entire workforces would have to be retrained on a new system. And if any of this mission-critical data were lost, it would be a major liability. In the investing world, we call those high switching costs.2. Momentum is strongOf course, high switching costs mean absolutely nothing if you can't win over customers in the first place. Luckily for Veeva investors, however, momentum has been very strong.Veeva's Growth Across Service ProductsCreate column chartsPerhaps most importantly, the number of Vault customers using more than one Vault application grew 70% by the end of the first quarter of 2017.3. Optionality aboundsOptionality is a complicated word for a simple concept: Make lots of small bets and look for just one or two to hit it big. After you see how a small bet performs, you have the option to either pursue it further or kill it.For the first time, Veeva is really branching out on a small bet it recently made. Word of mouth about the ease and functionality of Veeva Vault has led companies outside of Big Pharma to start asking for a version that they can use. Specifically, this demand has come from industries that are heavily regulated: consumer packaged goods (CPG), chemicals, and manufacturing.Starting this year, Vault QualityOne, a hybrid Vault product, is on the market for companies outside of life sciences to use. Already, a top-five CPG company has signed on.4. Management has skin in the gameNo one knows more about the hidden risks of a company than those that are managing it. That's why I think it's so important to invest in companies where management has their own skin in the game via stock ownership.Peter Gassner owns almost 15 million Class B shares, while co-founder Gordon Ritter owns nearly 7 million. Combined, these two control just under 50% of all voting rights, and their stake is currently worth $1.4 billion.5. I love founder-led companiesAs you can tell, I'm a fan of skin in the game. But there's a class above skin in the game. Best-selling author and trader Nassim Taleb calls it having your "soul in the game." That's when someone takes risks on behalf of the greater community.That's what we have with Gassner: Most of his wealth is tied up in Veeva. But beyond that, founders often view their companies as extensions of themselves, and are committed to building lasting value.6. Employees seem to like itWhile some think culture isn't important and impossible to measure, I'd point you toward Glassdoor.com. While the site isn't perfect -- and is certainly open to manipulation -- it offers an important data point for those wanting to learn about the morale of a company.Currently, Veeva has pretty solid marks across the board.

Those that have solid balance sheets and positive cash flows can often emerge from these times even stronger. That's because they can acquire weaker rivals, buy back shares on the cheap, or -- most importantly -- offer deals that the competition can't, and steal long-term market share.Here's what the story looks like for Veeva right now.CashDebtNet IncomeFree Cash Flow$664 million$0$93 million$168 millionData source: Yahoo! FinanceThat's financial fortitude!
8. Customer concentration is lowCompanies that have solid balance sheets like that are in great shape. But they sometimes hide a dangerous risk -- relying on just a few customers for a huge part of their revenue. When that's the case, all it takes is one decision coming from one person to sink a company overnight.Luckily for Veeva, that's not the current situation. As the chart in the second point above shows, it has hundreds of different customers, and no single customer currently accounts for more than 10% of total revenues for the past three years.9. Who knows what will be next?Three years ago, CRM accounted for virtually all sales. Almost overnight, Vault has become an enormous contributor.Veeva Revenue by SegmentCreate column chartsVeeva's two newer products -- OpenData and Network -- probably won't hit the ball out of the park quite like Vault, but they don't have to. The company continues to innovate, and with each new customer, the moat surrounding Veeva widens.10. A takeover candidate?Personally, I wouldn't be a very big fan of a takeover. I think Veeva has enormous potential moving forward -- with the move outside of Big Pharma being a cherry on top.But the fact remains that Veeva clearly has a lot of momentum going for it. That's tempting to a lot of deep-pocketed competitors in the cloud space. While the stock certainly seems expensive right now, I wouldn't at all be surprised to see a cloud giant swoop in and pay around $10 billion for Veeva.So there you have it, 10 reasons I own and plan to hold on to Veeva Systems stock -- and why you might want to consider the stock as well.10 stocks we like better than Veeva SystemsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Veeva Systems, Inc. Network Product Master Delivers Foundation For Effective Product Management And Enterprise Visibility In Life Sciences  











Tweet








5/18/2016 2:22:41 PM


New application makes it easier to manage, use, and access trusted product information globally
PLEASANTON, CA – May 18, 2016 – Veeva Systems (NYSE: VEEV) today introduced Veeva Network Product Master, the latest addition to the Veeva Network suite of master data management (MDM) applications built specifically for life sciences. Veeva Network Product Master is a cloud-based solution that provides a flexible global view of product information. Alongside Veeva Network Customer Master for customer data, Veeva Network Product Master signals the company’s expansion into multi-domain MDM for life sciences.

Managing pharmaceutical products through their lifecycle can be difficult, costly, and complex across multiple teams, stakeholders, and geographies. Elements such as brand information, trade names, groupings, and configurations can vary by country, system, and business area. Consequently, life sciences organizations cannot easily understand markets, launch new products, analyze market performance, or ensure coordinated global branding and messaging.

Veeva Network Product Master solves this by helping enterprise teams manage, use, and access accurate product information across geographies. Now life sciences companies can have a clear view into product definitions, groupings, and hierarchies for effective product management and better enterprise visibility wherever the product is used worldwide. 

Veeva Network Product Master can be used as a commercial product master or as a R&D product master. With a central and authoritative product view, life sciences can achieve many benefits, including, for example, the ability to accurately calculate the global market potential and market share of a drug or comply with reporting requirements.

“Veeva Network Product Master provides a better approach to managing product data and establishing consistency in global branding, product launches, and competitive analysis,” said Harte Nielson, director of Veeva Network Strategy. “Life sciences can move beyond spreadsheets and legacy MDM systems with a trusted product master reference to scale go-to-market programs globally and streamline local execution in every country.”

Veeva’s continued innovation in industry-specific MDM is informed by the requirements of leading life sciences companies worldwide. With more than 40 customers, Veeva Network is steadily replacing legacy toolkits as a multi-domain MDM solution built specifically for life sciences.

Veeva Systems Inc: Buy at the High?
The stock is undeniably expensive. Here's why that shouldn't stop you.











                Brian Stoffel
            

                (TMFCheesehead)



            
            Apr 11, 2017 at 9:02AM
            
            





The story behind Veeva Systems (NYSE:VEEV) is pretty simple. Peter Gassner, founder of the company, used to be an executive at Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM). While he was convincing companies to try out Salesforce's cloud solutions, he realized that the pharmaceutical industry had some very unique needs that Salesforce's build-it-yourself infrastructure couldn't meet.
So, in 2007, he decided to strike out on his own, leaving Salesforce to found Veeva. His first product for the market was Veeva CRM (customer relationship management), which helped drug companies track what their sales force was doing and who was buying their drugs. The company then expanded out to Veeva Vault -- focused on recording, storing, sharing, and abiding by regulatory laws. The strategy has worked, and the stock has responded in kind.

VEEV data by YCharts.
If you want a piece of the company now, it might seem like you've missed the boat. Does that mean you should avoid buying shares while they're at all-time highs? Or should you bite the bullet and pay up for quality? Here's how to think about it.
There's no denying this is expensive
Without a doubt, Veeva is expensive. By almost every traditional metric, shares are pricey. Consider the following, and compare it to Veeva's much larger peer, Salesforce.







 Company
Forward P/E

P/FCF

PEG Ratio





Veeva

55


3.1




Salesforce

35


2.3




Data source: Yahoo! Finance, E*Trade.
While the two look comparable in terms of what they'll earn in 2017, Veeva trades at a 50% premium in terms of free cash flow, and a 35% premium relative to its growth rates. And this completely ignores how Veeva is valued relative to the typical S&P 500 stock: While the average stock in the S&P 500 trades for about 26 times trailing earnings, Veeva's P/E ratio is over 100. 

Image source: Getty Images.

The bottom line is this: Veeva stock is expensive. Any troubles the company might experience with competition, weaker-than-expected outlooks, or even increased investments for the future could cause the stock to drop somewhat dramatically... at least over the short run.
That's why I don't think it's wise to "back up the truck" at this point.





But there's so much going in the company's favor
At the same time, Veeva has so much going for it. Chief among everything else is the company's moat. When a drug company signs on to Veeva CRM, it would be loath to switch to another CRM provider. Doing so would not only be expensive, but it would be cumbersome and likely lead to lots of headaches. We call that kind of a moat "high switching costs."
And if switching costs with a CRM platform seem high, imagine how much higher it would be if a company like Veeva was storing all of your mission-critical data from clinical trials! That's why, once a company signs on with Veeva and starts using multiple products, they will likely only switch away if (1) the service becomes awful or (2) it becomes prohibitively expensive.
Therefore, its important to see what kind of business momentum Veeva has going for it. Since 2012, revenue has grown at a compounded rate of 43% per year! That alone speaks to the company's success.
But if you still aren't convinced, it's worth taking a look at how many drug companies are signing up to use Veeva's services.






Data source: Veeva annual report.
And keep in mind, this is just a single year's growth. CRM used to be the company's bread and butter, and Vault has only been available at scale for a little over three years now.
And all of this ignores the huge announcement Veeva made last year: It is looking to offer its cloud solution outside of the pharmaceutical market. Specifically, the company will be offering a solution called Vault QualityOne. The service will be focused initially on industries that tend to be heavily regulated, like chemicals, manufacturing, or consumer packaged goods.
As a recent interview with The Motley Fool by Veeva president Matt Wallach highlights, this move has the potential to drastically expand Veeva's total addressable market.
So, how should you approach the situation? I suggest that if you're truly interested in this high-growth, high-moat business, you should open a "starter" position and set aside cash for buying at better and better value points in the future. Such value points might not necessarily mean "lower share price," but instead a lower P/FCF ratio, or some other measure.
By doing so, you have skin in the game to keep you exposed to the upside, while still having some dry powder to use should the stock fall. That's my approach now. Veeva makes up 3.5% of my real-life holdings, but I would have no problem increasing that significantly if the market gave me the opportunity.

Leading cloud innovators build upon successful 10-year relationship
      to help life sciences companies deliver a better customer experience



 PLEASANTON, Calif. & BARCELONA, Spain--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
      Veeva
      Systems (NYSE:VEEV) today announced new integration between Salesforce
      Marketing Cloud and Veeva
      CRM, as well as support for Salesforce
      Service Cloud with Veeva
      Vault. The companies are building upon their long-standing
      partnership to help life sciences deliver a more coordinated and
      consistent experience for healthcare professionals. For the past 10
      years, Veeva has been Salesforce’s preferred worldwide CRM provider for
      the pharmaceutical and biotech industry. Over this time, the two
      companies have extended their innovation and leadership positions in
      cloud and together now have more than 250 joint customers.
    

      “Veeva has been an outstanding partner over the past decade, and Peter
      has been an outstanding CEO," said Marc Benioff, chairman and CEO at
      Salesforce. “Our expanded collaboration is a great next step for our
      joint customers and we look forward to working with Veeva into the next
      decade to help move the life sciences industry forward.”
    

      “Salesforce is a cloud pioneer that has transformed how companies
      connect with their customers,” said Peter Gassner, founder and CEO of
      Veeva. “We’re excited to build upon our 10-year partnership and,
      together, help life sciences companies develop deeper relationships with
      healthcare professionals and create a better customer experience.”
    

Veeva and Salesforce Deliver More Effective Customer Interactions


      Built on the Salesforce Platform, Veeva CRM is core to Veeva Commercial
      Cloud, which brings together customer data, compliant content, and
      multichannel engagement for life sciences companies to deliver the
      experience healthcare professionals have come to expect. The integration
      of Veeva CRM and Salesforce Marketing Cloud allows information to be
      shared between the two cloud solutions so that sales and marketing teams
      can have a complete view of customer engagement.
    

      Marketing activities and data from Salesforce Marketing Cloud are
      available in Veeva CRM, while all Veeva CRM data and multichannel
      interactions, including Veeva
      CRM Approved Email, Veeva
      CLM, and Veeva
      CRM Suggestions, flow directly into Salesforce Marketing Cloud. Now
      life sciences customers that use both cloud solutions can have full
      visibility into face-to-face and digital interactions so they can
      deliver a cohesive and consistent experience to healthcare professionals.
    

Veeva Vault for Compliant Content to Salesforce Service Cloud


      Veeva Vault is a unified suite of applications that delivers a single
      source of truth for regulated content and data across the enterprise.
      Life sciences companies that use both Veeva Vault and Salesforce Service
      Cloud can respond to and fulfill customer service requests through
      Salesforce Service Cloud with approved, compliant content from Veeva
      Vault.
    

      Healthcare professionals rely on fast, accurate information from pharma
      and biotech customer service teams. Through the Veeva Vault API, teams
      can author, search, and access compliant documents without ever leaving
      Salesforce Service Cloud. Additionally, all doctor interactions are
      logged so that customer service and support can track progress through
      analytics tools in Salesforce Service Cloud and Veeva Vault.
