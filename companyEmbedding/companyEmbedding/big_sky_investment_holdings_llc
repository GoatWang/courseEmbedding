Over the past four decades, Alan Siegel has become one of the best-known figures in the branding business. He has achieved the stature of both pillar of the establishment and provocative iconoclast, while building a leading brand consultancy, Siegel+ Gale, devoted to positioning global companies for competitive success. As consultant, author and commentator, Alan’s influence extends to advising such diverse organizations as Xerox, American Express, the National Basketball Association, Caterpillar, the Girl Scouts and Carnegie Mellon University; creating guides for The Wall Street Journal on understanding financial markets and serving on the boards of numerous business and cultural organizations.
Alan pioneered the practice of simplification, bringing clarity to such daunting documents as insurance policies, bank loan notes, mutual fund prospectuses and all types of government communications, including the 1040EZ tax form. Alan’s latest book, Simple: Conquering the Crisis of Complexity (Hachette), which he co-wrote with longtime colleague Irene Etzkorn, was released in April of 2013 to critical acclaim.
During the 1980s, Alan popularized the concept of “brand voice” and in the 1990s his firm championed the Internet as a powerful expression of brand strategy. In all he does, Alan is known for the plain speaking he demands of clients and for the excellence in individual and organizational communications that his own firm has come to embody.

Alan served on the executive committee of the Document Design Project, which was funded by the National Institute of Education, where he worked on simplifying federal government regulations.
Alan developed a brand identity program for the Legal Aid Society, where he served on the Board of Directors. Working with Jeremy Travis, the dynamic President of John Jay College of Criminal Justice and chair of the Committee on Causes and Consequences of High Rates of Incarceration (National Research Council of the National Academies), Alan developed the “Fierce Advocates for Justice” identity to change the perception of John Jay as a “cop college” to a preparer of fervent, liberally educated professionals in forensics, law and law enforcement, social science and academia. John Jay honored Alan by creating the Alan Siegel Writing Center to help all matriculated students become more effective writers.
Alan has a passion for helping educational institutions articulate their vision, develop a distinctive identity and attract top-flight faculty and students. He served as adjunct associate professor at Carnegie Mellon University, where he conducted research and was the founder and co-director of a popular graduate program, The Communications Design Center. When Bob Kerrey was President of The New School, Alan created its brand identity program, headed up the Business Advisory Board for the New Media program and was interim director of the data visualization center. For six years Alan served as the president of the Advisory Council for the College of Art, Architecture and Planning at Cornell University.

Investing involves risks. Since no one investment program is suitable for all types of investors you need to review your  investment objectives, risk tolerance, and liquidity needs before selecting an investment program. It is possible to lose money. You should periodically review your investment allocations particularly if your circumstances change. There is no assurance that an investment will achieve their objectives. Asset allocation does not assure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.

Save a little more today, 


	  

	  for the things you’ll love forever.

	  
Think about the things you love to do the most. Would you ever want to give them up? That’s the tough financial choice a lot of us could face when we retire. But if we start saving a little more today – even 1% more of our annual income – we could keep doing all the things we love.
It’s all part of Prudential’s goal to help everyone reach their own goals for retirement. We can help with everything from mutual funds to annuities to life insurance. And you can check out our tools for helpful insights on Social Security, ideal places to retire, and more.
Want to see how we can help you? Great – let’s keep going.

How did we calculate this?
 To calculate how many years it might take to spend your guessed amount 
              in retirement, we used your age, years until retirement, and inflation rate 
              of 3%, and average spending data from the 2012 Expenditure Survey.

Based on national spending averages,
$1,500,000 will likely be spent by the age of 76.
How did we calculate this?
 Come up a little short? Guessing how much money you might
            need 
            to save for retirement that could last 30 or 40 years
            is pretty hard. 
            A good place to start: Think about how
            many years you may live in 
            retirement and how much income
            you'll need each year.

Disclaimers: The 1983 Social Security Amendments included a provision to raise the full retirement age gradually to 67, beginning with people born in 1938 or later. The FRA for those born prior to 1943 is 65 and are past the mandated distribution age. For those between 1955 and 1959 the FRA goes up in increments of 2 months beyond age 66. For example the FRA for those born in 1955 is 66 and 2 months, for those born in 1956 is 66 and 4months, and so on. Source: http://www.socialsecurity.gov/planners/retire/agereduction.html
