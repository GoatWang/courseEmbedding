Equity Multiplier

What is the 'Equity Multiplier'
The equity multiplier is calculated by dividing a company's total asset value by total net equity, and it measures financial leverage. Companies finance their operations with equity or debt, so a high equity multiplier indicates that a larger portion of asset financing is attributed to debt. The equity multiplier is a variation of the debt ratio, and its definition of debt financing includes all liabilities.!--break--Calculation of the equity multiplier is relatively simple and straightforward. Consider the balance sheet of Apple Inc. as of March 2016. The company's total assets were $305 billion, and the book value of shareholder equity was $130 billion. The company's equity multiplier was therefore 2.34. Verizon Communications Inc. operates a very different business model with more financial leverage. The company's total assets were $245 billion as of March 2016, with $19 billion of shareholder equity. The equity multiplier was 13.1, based on these values.Leverage AnalysisVerizon's much lower proportionate shareholder equity value indicates that the business relies more heavily on financing from debt and other liabilities. The company's telecommunications business model is reminiscent of utilities firms, which have stable, predictable cash flows and typically carry high debt levels. Verizon's closest peer, AT&T Inc. also has one of the highest equity multipliers among the largest companies traded on U.S. exchanges, though it is much lower at 3.3 than Verizon's ratio of 13.1.Apple is an established, mature business that can comfortably service debt, and it has issued notes to gain access to capital at relatively attractive costs. However, the company is more susceptible to changing economic conditions or evolving industry standards than utilities or large telecommunications firms. As a result, Apple has less financial leverage. These differences in business models mean that higher financial leverage does not necessarily indicate superior financial health.DuPont AnalysisThe equity multiplier is an important factor in DuPont analysis, which is a method of financial assessment devised by the DuPont Corporation for the purpose of internal review. The DuPont model breaks return on equity (ROE) into its constituent pieces, which are popular financial ratios and metrics. Net profit margin, asset turnover and the equity multiplier are combined to calculate ROE, which allows analysts to consider the relative of each impact separately. If ROE changes over time or diverges from normal levels for the peer group, DuPont analysis indicates how much of this is attributable to financial leverage. If the equity multiplier fluctuates, it can significantly impact ROE. Higher financial leverage drives ROE upward, all other factors remaining equal.

		EQUITYMULTIPLE - Business Continuity	






















































































Business Continuity Planning













Our broker dealer Growth Capital Services has developed a Business Continuity Plan (BCP) as part of our ongoing contingency planning efforts to mitigate the impacts of business interruptions. Since disasters and disruptions are unpredictable, we will have to be flexible in responding to actual events as they occur. With that in mind, we are providing you with this information on our business continuity plan.
We plan to quickly recover and resume business operations after a Significant Business Disruption and respond by safeguarding employees’ lives and firm property, protecting the firm’s books and records, and allowing our customers to transact business. In short, our business continuity plan is designed to permit our firm to resume operations as quickly as possible, given the scope and severity of the significant business disruption.
Our business continuity plan addresses:

data back up and recovery;
mission critical systems
financial and operational assessments;
alternative communications with customers, employees, and regulators;
alternate physical location of employees;
critical supplier, contractor, bank and counter-party impact; and
regulatory reporting

Significant business disruptions can vary in their scope. For example, an SBD could affect only our firm, a single building housing our firm, the business district where our firm is located, the city where we are located, or the whole region. Within each of these areas, the severity of the disruption can also vary from minimal to severe.
In any situation, we plan to continue in business, and notify you through our web site or our main customer number regarding how to contact us. This plan is reviewed periodically and subject to modification without notice. A written copy of the summary of this plan is provided to customers at account opening, posted on the firm’s website, and provided to customers upon request. If you have questions about our business continuity planning, please contact us at your convenience.

Customer Identification Program
To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money-laundering activities, and to verify your identity, federal law may require Growth Capital Services (GCS) to obtain your name, date of birth, address and a government-issued identification number before opening your account. If you are acting on behalf of a corporate entity, we may be required to obtain your name and title, and the corporation’s address and government-issued identification number. In certain circumstances, GCS may obtain and verify this information with respect to any person(s) authorized to effect transactions in an account. Your account may be restricted and/or closed if GCS cannot verify this information. GCS will not be responsible for any losses or damages (including but not limited to lost opportunities) resulting from any failure to provide this information, or from any restriction placed upon, or closing of, your account.
Conflicts of Interest
GCS and its affiliates may from time to time engage in activities that are in conflict with their securities customers. The employees of GCS, its contract consultants, and its affiliates are bound to the customer’s best interests and are required to notify GCS of any possible or potential conflict of interest which may result from their other activities, and may commence such other activities only after the prior, written approval of GCS, which may not be unreasonably withheld.
Risk
IMPORTANT: All investing is risky, and no investor should decide to commit funds without first consulting with a competent professional adviser. Some or all invested funds can be lost. The past performance of any investment, investment strategy or investment style is not indicative of future performance. Future results may vary, and are not guaranteed. The value of investments and their income may increase or decrease, and a loss of principal – including all principal – may occur.
Private Placements
GCS is primarily a private placement banker and broker. A private placement is the sale of registered or unregistered securities to a limited number of qualified private investors, including institutional investors, accredited individuals, and entities that meet certain investor eligibility requirements. Securities purchased through private placements typically fall into the category of alternative assets – investments that often have a low correlation to public markets and offer essential diversification to portfolios dominated by traditional stocks and bonds.
However, private placements generally are highly illiquid, and are not subject to public disclosure obligations. Investors should consult professional advisers, perform deep due diligence, and engage in careful deliberation before investing.
Qualified Investors
Investing in private placements requires high risk tolerance, low liquidity concerns, and long-term commitment. Investors must be able to afford to lose their entire investment. For those reasons, these offerings may be made available only to certain institutional investors and high net worth individuals and entities. As with all alternative investments, investors must meet certain eligibility tests to qualify as purchasers. Currently, entities must have assets of at least $5 million (or all individual owners meet accredited investor tests). Individuals must have a net worth of more than $1 million or gross income for each of the last two years of at least $200,000 ($300,000 with spouse) with the expectation of the same income in the current year, excluding one’s residence.
Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC)
Growth Capital Services is a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), which provides protection for owners of securities accounts. Our firm does not hold securities; all accounts and assets are held by our issuers, sponsors, or their clearing brokers or qualified custodians. No coverage protects against a decline in the market value of securities. An explanatory brochure about the SIPC protection is available upon request through the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, www.sipc.org.

Get Started








STEP
1 / 4




We Identify Sponsors and Lenders with Stellar Track Records

Our national network of real estate companies is constantly seeking opportunities across the country and across property types. They diligence each project and invest with their own funds, aligning their interests with EQUITYMULTIPLE investors and providing a first layer of diligence. 
                We work with:

National and regional lenders with significant experience & low default rates
Real estate companies operating in thriving primary, secondary, and/or tertiary markets
Sponsors with a proven record of meeting and exceeding return projections - a network bolstered by longtime clients of our real estate team, and our strategic partner - Mission Capital









STEP

We Focus on Opportunities Projected to Deliver Attractive Risk-Adjusted Returns

After vetting the project Sponsor we focus on evaluating the market and key transaction metrics, bringing decades of in-house experience and data to bear. Each deal must pass our proprietary scoring matrix before entering the next phase of diligence.
                We look for:

Commercial properties in thriving markets with current cash flow
Short term senior loans with robust APR to investors and a promising exit strategy
Value-add projects with construction components and more aggressive business plans









STEP

We Diligence the Specific Project, Selecting Less than 5% of Submissions

For projects that survive initial due diligence, we stress test underwriting assumptions, review key legal documents and third party reports and consider transaction structure. A select few are presented on our platform. 
                We strive to:

Offer a highly curated set of deals, presented comprehensively and transparently
Collaborate with the sponsor or lender to optimize risk-adjusted returns for our investors

Still Have Questions?
View all frequently asked questions





Do I have to be accredited to invest?


Yes, currently only accredited investors can invest through EQUITYMULTIPLE. You will also need to provide evidence that you are an accredited investor. While traditional private placement investments allow investors to self-certify that they're accredited, we utilize a new regulation that was part of the JOBS Act, which requires that we take must take “reasonable steps” to verify that you are accredited.  We make it as easy as possible for you to verify that you're accredited by providing you two simple methods: 1) have your lawyer, CPA, investment advisor or broker-dealer sign a simple form that we provide stating that you're verified; or 2) submit documentation demonstrating your income or net worth to our trusted third party partner, InvestReady, which specializes in verifying accreditation. Any information you provide will be held strictly confidential in accordance with our privacy policy.




When will I be paid distributions on my investments?


Distribution schedules vary by deal and are typically either monthly or quarterly. Debt deals typically offer a fixed monthly rate of return throughout the loan's term and a return of principal at maturity of the loan. Similarly, preferred equity offer a fixed monthly rate of return throughout the term of the investment and may provide for an additional accrued return when the investment is paid off and principal is returned. Equity deal cashflows are generally not fixed and their frequency and amount will vary based on the performance of the underlying investment.






How are you different from other platforms?


While there are several established platforms for real estate investing, we offer a unique approach and a management team with far reaching industry experience. We focus almost exclusively on institutional commercial real estate and offer a range of opportunities across the country from experienced lenders and sponsors. For debt deals, we work with experienced lenders (rather than operating as a lender ourselves), giving investors an important extra layer of due diligence and servicing expertise. For equity deals, our primary compensation is a participation in investor profits (10%), which we only receive after your full initial investment has been returned. This helps incentivize us to find the best opportunities for EquityMultiple. For more information on our fees see our full FAQs. For more information on the experience of our team, check out the About Us page.




What happens if EquityMultiple goes out of business?


While we have no intention of going out of business, we realize the necessity of protecting your investments in the event that we go bankrupt or otherwise dissolve. Each investment offered on EquityMultiple is made through a deal specific LLC. These investment vehicles are set up to help ensure bankruptcy remoteness, meaning they can continue to exist independently even if their parent company goes into bankruptcy. Each investment vehicle will continue to be entitled to receive distributions from its underlying investment and each investor will continue to be entitled to their portion of that distribution.








Can I trade shares, or transfer ownership, after making an investment?


You may be able to transfer ownership to another EQUITYMULTIPLE investor, though this is never guaranteed and handled on a case-by-case basis.




What is the legal structure of EquityMultiple deals?


For each investment opportunity we create a separate LLC (i.e., EquityMultiple 20, LLC). When you invest in a particular deal you’re actually purchasing an ownership interest in the deal specific LLC, which in turn invests into the underlying project. As an owner of that LLC you’re entitled to your share of any income or losses generated by its investment in the underlying deal. This structure provides an important layer of protection for investors, as it helps insulate each investment from financial issues related to other investments or the parent company.






How does EquityMultiple protect my personal information and keep it secure?


Keeping investor information secure is a top priority for EquityMultiple. EquityMultiple’s physical infrastructure is hosted and managed as a Heroku application within Amazon’s secure data centers and utilize the Amazon Web Service (AWS) technology. All sensitive data is encrypted and stored within databases to meet security requirements. Data encryption is deployed using industry standard encryption and the best practices for our technology stack. Here's more on our security practices.




Why should I trust EquityMultiple?


Our team, along with our partners at Mission Capital, has been involved in billions of dollars in real estate transactions. Our fee structure ensures that we only earn a profit when investors earn a profit. We can't promise that every deal on our platform will exceed return projections (and you shouldn't listen to anyone who makes such claims), but we will work tirelessly to find and diligence projects that deliver compelling risk-adjusted returns; indeed, we've staked our business on it. We're also committed to transparency and customer service - we're always happy to field questions frankly and thoroughly, and to discuss any concerns over the phone.











Investing in Real Estate should be easy





Whether you're new to real estate investing or a seasoned pro, our goal is to simplify your investment process.
                    Everything is streamlined through our online platform, and our dedicated customer support team is always standing by.

Automatic fire detection and suppression equipment has been installed to reduce risk. The fire detection system utilizes smoke detection sensors in all data center environments, mechanical and electrical infrastructure spaces, chiller rooms and generator equipment rooms. These areas are protected by either wet-pipe, double-interlocked pre-action, or gaseous sprinkler systems.
Power
The data center electrical power systems are designed to be fully redundant and maintainable without impact to operations, 24 hours a day, and seven days a week. Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) units provide back-up power in the event of an electrical failure for critical and essential loads in the facility. Data centers use generators to provide backup power for the entire facility.
Climate and Temperature Control
Climate control is required to maintain a constant operating temperature for servers and other hardware, which prevents overheating and reduces the possibility of service outages. Data centers are conditioned to maintain atmospheric conditions at optimal levels. Monitoring systems and data center personnel ensure temperature and humidity are at the appropriate levels.
Management
Data center staff monitor electrical, mechanical and life support systems and equipment so issues are immediately identified. Preventative maintenance is performed to maintain the continued operability of equipment.

Network Security
Firewalls
Firewalls are utilized to restrict access to systems from external networks and between systems internally. By default all access is denied and only explicitly allowed ports and protocols are allowed based on business need. Each system is assigned to a firewall security group based on the system’s function. Security groups restrict access to only the ports and protocols required for a system’s specific function to mitigate risk.
Host-based firewalls restrict user applications from establishing localhost connections over the loopback network interface to further isolate user applications. Host-based firewalls also provide the ability to further limit inbound and outbound connections as needed.
DDoS Mitigation
Our infrastructure provides DDoS mitigation techniques including TCP Syn cookies and connection rate limiting in addition to maintaining multiple backbone connections and internal bandwidth capacity that exceeds the Internet carrier supplied bandwidth. We work closely with our providers to quickly respond to events and enable advanced DDoS mitigation controls when needed.
Spoofing and Sniffing Protections
Managed firewalls prevent IP, MAC, and ARP spoofing on the network and between virtual hosts to ensure spoofing is not possible. Packet sniffing is prevented by infrastructure including the hypervisor which will not deliver traffic to an interface which it is not addressed to. EQUITYMULTIPLE utilizes application isolation, operating system restrictions, and encrypted connections to further ensure risk is mitigated at all levels.
Port Scanning
Port scanning is prohibited and every reported instance is investigated by our infrastructure provider. When port scans are detected, they are stopped and access is blocked.
Data Security
Stored data is encrypted by EQUITYMULTIPLE in order to meet data security requirements.
Encrypted Data in Transit
EQUITYMULTIPLE requires browser connections over HTTPS and SSL database connections to protect sensitive data transmitted to and from applications.
Encrypted Data at Rest
All sensitive data is encrypted and stored within databases to meet security requirements. Data encryption is deployed using industry standard encryption and the best practices for our technology stack.
Vulnerability Management
Our vulnerability management process is designed to remediate risks without user interaction or impact. EQUITYMULTIPLE is notified of vulnerabilities through internal and external assessments, system patch monitoring, and third party mailing lists and services. Each vulnerability is reviewed to determine if it is applicable to EQUITYMULTIPLE’s environment, ranked based on risk, and assigned to the appropriate team for resolution.
New systems are deployed with the latest updates, security fixes, and EQUITYMULTIPLE configurations and existing systems are decommissioned as users are migrated to the new instances. This process allows EQUITYMULTIPLE to keep the environment up-to-date. Since user applications run in isolated environments, they are unaffected by these core system updates.
To further mitigate risk, each component type is assigned to a unique network security group. These security groups are designed to only allow access to the ports and protocols required for the specific component type. For example, user applications running within an isolated dyno are denied access to the EQUITYMULTIPLE management infrastructure as each is within its own network security group and access is not allowed between the two.
Application Security
We undergo penetration tests, vulnerability assessments, and source code reviews to assess the security of our application, architecture, and implementation. Our third party security assessments cover all areas of our platform including testing for OWASP Top 10 web application vulnerabilities and user application isolation. EQUITYMULTIPLE works closely with external security assessors to review the security of the EQUITYMULTIPLE platform and applications and apply best practices.
Issues found in EQUITYMULTIPLE applications are risk ranked, prioritized, assigned to the responsible team for remediation, and EQUITYMULTIPLE’s security team reviews each remediation plan to ensure proper resolution.
Backups
From our instance images to our databases, each component is backed up to secure, access-controlled, and redundant storage. The platform allows for recovering databases to within seconds of the last known state, restoring system instances from standard templates, and deploying user data. In addition to standard backup practices, EQUITYMULTIPLE’s infrastructure is designed to scale and be fault tolerant by automatically replacing failed instances and reducing the likelihood of needing to restore from backup.
Deployment Backup
EQUITYMULTIPLE is automatically backed up as part of the deployment process on secure, access controlled, and redundant storage. We use these backups to deploy across our platform and to automatically bring the application back online in the event of an outage.
Databases
Every change to the data is written to write-ahead logs, which are shipped to multi-datacenter, high-durability storage. In the unlikely event of unrecoverable hardware failure, these logs can be automatically ‘replayed’ to recover the database to within seconds of its last known state.
Disaster Recovery
User Information and Databases
The platform automatically restores the EQUITYMULTIPLE application and databases in the case of an outage. The platform is designed to dynamically re-deploy the application(s), monitor for failures, and recover failed platform components including the user application and databases.
The Platform
EQUITYMULTIPLE is designed for stability, scaling, and inherently mitigates common issues that lead to outages while maintaining recovery capabilities. The platform maintains redundancy to prevent single points of failure, is able to replace failed components, and utilizes multiple data centers designed for resiliency. In the case of an outage, the platform is deployed across multiple data centers using current system images and data is restored from backups. EQUITYMULTIPLE reviews platform issues to understand the root cause, impact to users, and improve the platform and processes.
Privacy
EQUITYMULTIPLE has a published privacy policy that clearly defines what data is collected and how it is used. EQUITYMULTIPLE is committed to user privacy and transparency.
We takes steps to protect the privacy of our users and protect data stored within the platform. Some of the protections inherent to EQUITYMULTIPLE’s application include authentication, access controls, data transport encryption, HTTPS support for user applications, and encrypted stored data.
For additional information see: https://www.equitymultiple.com/privacy
Employee Screening and Policies
As a condition of employment all EQUITYMULTIPLE employees undergo pre-employment background checks and agree to company policies including security and acceptable use policies.
Secure Development Practices
EQUITYMULTIPLE applies best practices to mitigate known vulnerability types such as those on the OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks.

Three Ways to Invest
Find the right balance of risk and return to meet your investing goals








Higher Upside





Downside Protection




Syndicated Debt
Preferred Equity
Equity




Equity
Our equity raises are structured to align our success with yours, and maximize investor returns. We work with sponsors to ensure that our investors are on the same economic terms as the other individual or institutional investors in the project.

Target Annual Cash Return: 6-12%
Target Internal Rate of Return (IRR) to Investors: 14%+
Typical Term: 3-7 years
Risk: As the last party to get paid, equity investors have limited downside protection. However, they enjoy uncapped upside if the deal performs well.



Preferred Equity
Our preferred equity deals offer investors a fixed monthly or quarterly return, combined with a fixed portion of the project upside upon repayment. We employ this structure to provide shorter, fixed terms and to help protect against downside risk.

Target Current Preferred Return: 6-12%
Target Total Preferred Return: 10-14%
Typical Term: 1-3 years
Risk: Preferred equity investors are entitled to repayment before the equity holders and project Sponsor are paid. This lets investors reduce risk but also tap into a portion of the upside.



Syndicated Debt
Our approach to debt is unique - you invest side by side with experienced lenders in loans secured by real estate. Our partner lenders originate and fund each loan and typically keep skin in the game, aligning their interests with yours.

Target APR to Investors: 7-12%
Typical LTV: 50-75%
Typical Term: 6-24 months
Risk: Each loan is a first lien loan secured by a mortgage or deed of trust. Investors do not participate in the upside of the project but enjoy significant downside protection because their investment is backed by a secured interest in the property.

EQUITYMULTIPLE's value proposition lies within the passion, dedication, and real estate expertise of it's core team members, and providing busy folks like myself the key insights to quickly understand opportunities and confidently invest alongside experienced developers.











Ben Cooper
Investment Banker




I've been in the commercial real estate industry for more than a decade - and EQUITYMULTIPLE is one of the most exciting innovations I've seen.  Their deal quality is very high and is backed by a screening and diligence process that clearly explains the investment thesis and the data needed make a decision. EQUITYMULTIPLE gives me the ability to choose my own deals, including high-yield debt and growth-oriented properties, that I would otherwise never have access to.  It's so easy to use, it makes real estate investing just as easy as buying a stock online.

Real Estate Crowdfunding Platform EquityMultiple Expects Investment Volume to Grow by an Order of Magnitude

January 6, 2017 @ 1:20 pm By JD Alois 




Real estate crowdfunding may possess the biggest potential within the sector of online investment marketplaces. The ability to make a popular asset class more accessible to a wider audience simply makes sense. Both debt and equity investment opportunities in real estate are available across multiple platforms but some of the early entrants have struggled while others have thrived.
Inman, in their 2017 Real Estate Industry Outlook, says there is solid optimism for 2017. The majority of their survey respondents expect the incoming Trump administration to have a positive effect on the US housing market.  Of course, if the economy holds, commercial real estate should do well too. Rising interest rates will certainly play a role that could temper growth but many industry participants are positive about the coming year. This holds true even more in vibrant metropolitan markets like New York.  Where everyone agrees is the fact that emerging technology will play an increasingly important role for investors, developers and sellers.
 

With @EquityMultiple we have a pretty amazing product. Crowdfunding is just the beginning.

EquityMultiple, a real estate crowdfunding platform, describes itself as the only online investing platform backed by an established real estate company – Mission Capital. This relationship provides a solid backstop that can help with access to deals and institutional horsepower. While Mission Capital does big deals, EquityMultiple sees itself as a perfect fit in matching accredited investors to opportunity in the $2 million to $30 million range.
Crowdfund Insider last spoke with EquityMuliple CEO and co-founder Charles Clinton at the beginning of 2016. At that time he said that in a few years it will seem ridiculous that we weren’t managing our real estate portfolio in an ETrade type environment.
Crowdfund Insider caught up with Charles just before the end of the year to get an update on EquityMultiple and their expectations for the coming year.

Crowdfund Insider: Since we last spoke (early 2016) how has EquityMultiple grown? How much investment has been transacted by your platform?
Charles Clinton: It’s been a very exciting year. To date, EquityMultiple investors have invested in 18 offerings (16 closed, two still live). Total investment for Q4 looks like it will more than double Q3 and, overall, total investment on the platform has tripled since the end of Q2 of this year.
Crowdfund Insider: How is deal flow? We are hearing that it has become more competitive to find good deals?
Charles Clinton: Our pipeline of deals and opportunities remains strong; in fact, in Q4 and going into Q1 of 2017 we have more deals lined up than in our entire first year of business.  
Finding good deals is never easy but our segment of the market – commercial real estate as opposed to single family – isn’t the focus of many other major platforms. We also continue to benefit from our partnership with Mission Capital Advisors, which has afforded us access to institutional-level sponsorship and opportunities.  
More broadly speaking, we’re also seeing increased institutional appetite and acceptance for the online capital space. We’re now having conversations with sponsors who wouldn’t have considered online capital raising even a year ago – they’re interested, but also selective about who they’ll partner with.  
They’re looking for people that speak their language and can understand the nuances of deal and that’s where we stand out; between our team and our partnership with Mission, there’s a lot of real estate knowledge to leverage.  
As the market has gotten frothy, deals have become competitive and we see some valuations that just don’t make sense — so we pass on those opportunities.  
We remain focused on finding the right operators that share our view on appropriate risk-adjusted returns.  Quality over quantity is and will remain our mantra, but there is no shortage of opportunities we are seeing. 
Crowdfund Insider: How are net returns holding up for debt & equity investors? Are investors becoming more selective?
Charles Clinton: Our investors have been very pleased.
For deals that are already cash-flowing, annualized cash returns are over 10%. This includes fixed-rate investments in senior loans, fixed rate preferred equity investments and distributions from cash-flowing equity deals. This year, investors have already been fully repaid principal on three deals and we have zero loss of principal to date. Many of our equity projects are longer hold periods, with upside coming at sale or refinance after several years.
We encourage our investors to be selective and to ask questions.
Many of our initial (and now repeat) investors are from the real estate industry and, if anyone is likely to be selective, that’s the group. We learned very early on that being responsive to investor questions and concerns was essential and it’s really become a mantra of our company.
I think, if anything, the more we interact with our investors and the more performing deals we have behind us, the easier it is for new investors to come on board.
Crowdfund Insider: What percentage of the investment is from individuals vs. institutional money?
Charles Clinton: Nearly 100% of our investors are individuals and non-institutional entities and trusts. That may change as our deal size gets larger, but we remain focused on providing individuals with the best institutional real estate opportunities in the market.
Crowdfund Insider: Can you quantify the importance of your relationship with Mission Capital? Not all platforms have a relationship like this.
Charles Clinton: It’s difficult to quantify, but we believe it’s a huge leg up on other platforms.
Investors have the added comfort of knowing that the Mission Capital senior leadership in involved in the sourcing and vetting of our deals. Despite technological advances, real estate is still so much about boots-on-the-ground experience and relationships. We believe that our partnership with Mission really strengthens the value we provide to our investors.
Crowdfund Insider: Last time we spoke you said you were looking at Reg A+. Since that time several platforms have leveraged the updated security exemption. Will you do the same?
Charles Clinton: We have no immediate plans to, but we will continue to evaluate new ways to provide value to investors.
Crowdfund Insider: Can you make a prediction for EquityMultiple and 2017?
Charles Clinton: We’re excited about our 2017 growth and expansion plans.  We believe that 2017 will see the broader acceptance of online funding not just by emerging managers but by far more established operators that recognize the potential of the space.
This will be a positive development for both investors and the long-term health of the industry. Online investing is a long tail business – investors aren’t buying widgets, so deal and sponsor quality are essential for long-term success.
With our partnership with Mission and focus on commercial transactions, we believe we’re well-positioned to attract top deals and sponsors.
In 2017, we expect to increase the average EquityMultiple allocation into the deals we do and ramp up our overall deal count. We expect total investment volume through our platform to grow by an order of magnitude. To do this, we’ll continue to expand our investor network and we plan to explore some creative benefits for our repeat investors.
Finally, we have some exciting improvement plans for our technology platform and investor experience.
Crowdfund Insider: How well funded is EquityMultiple? I am hearing some chatter that some under-capitalized platforms may disappear.
Charles Clinton: I can’t speak to the capitalization of some of our competitors, but our focus is certainly on the long term.
Our partnership with Mission, a well-capitalized and successful firm, gives us the comfort and confidence to weather any blips and short-term shocks in the economy.  That said, we’re currently raising a funding round for EquityMultiple in order to help us grow and expand the team — we’re actually in advanced discussions with several new potential investors from both the VC and real estate realms.
