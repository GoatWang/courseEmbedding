A Method for Marketing Madness

by Bryan Rhoads

I sat in on the New York Times “Page One” meeting the editor holds twice a day. Section editors gathered, the Foreign Desk called in from Paris and laptops opened as I sat against the back wall of a round room. A fly on a wall at the center of the media universe.

Perfect your brand marketing process
See it in action 





Teams that work better together produce better work 
The Opal Platform connects your team throughout the brand marketing process so everyone is always on the same page. Teams work together seamlessly to produce consistent, cohesive campaigns. The result is a more efficient and effective execution of your strategy, with campaign details clearly visualized across all channels, in their final context — all before you launch.





Visibility See brand marketing efforts from any distance, at every angle 
Whether you need to see the big picture or the smallest details, give your team the ability to create in harmony, with a clear line of sight into brand marketing production. Cross-functional teams see how their work is connected to the strategy – so everyone gets it right the first time.

















Alignment Everything moving in sync 
Ensure that everyone is working from the same page. The Opal Platform, with the StoryFirst™ framework, reduces the complexities of marketing production. Create authentic brand experiences for every consumer touchpoint with consistency across channels and regions.













 





Efficiency Liberate your team’s full potential 
When your people, processes, and tools stay connected from start to finish, they unlock creative and strategic potential — producing more effective marketing and improved results. Opal enables a seamless process from brief to deployment so teams can do more with less.









StoryFirst Unite around the story 
Key messages and goals. Concepts and audience profiles. The desired look and feel. These elements create the story brief—the basis for a powerful enterprise campaign. Opal’s StoryFirst framework allows you to make the story your organizing principle from the start. With the story at the heart of your campaigns, you can keep everyone on the same page no matter how big or complex your campaigns grow.




The StoryFirst™ Advantage A Framework
A framework enabling the entire organization with an efficient structure throughout the brand marketing process. Everyone involved in the campaign can easily apply it to their work, ensuring teams, channels and regions are always on the same page.
A Method
A method for producing and orchestrating brand marketing for the omni-channel ecosystem.  StoryFirst™ aligns teams by breaking down communication barriers and simplifying channel and regional complexities. Working in Opal with StoryFirst™, every brand marketing effort can start organized and stay organized.
An Opportunity
An opportunity to make your brand stories more consistent and powerful. Give your campaigns a boost. Give your teams the gift of collaboration and allow them to work smarter, together
