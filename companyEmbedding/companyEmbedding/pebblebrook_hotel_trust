Overview














 












Pebblebrook Hotel Trust (NYSE: PEB) is a publicly traded real estate investment trust ("REIT") organized in December 2009 to opportunistically acquire and invest in upper upscale, full service hotel and resort properties located in or near urban markets in major United States gateway cities.
Our mission is to deliver long-term industry-leading total returns to our shareholders, including a reliable stream of income, through opportunistic investment in high-quality lodging properties, utilizing a conservative capital structure.  We aim to achieve this mission through investing based on extensive research; focusing on properties with operational and redevelopment opportunities;  and staffing for intensive asset management and operational involvement. 
We have elected and are qualified to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes and operate as an internally managed and administered REIT.  As a REIT, we hold interests in real estate assets and strive to reduce our federal taxable income by distributing a significant portion of our federal taxable income in the form of taxable dividends to our shareholders.  The Company currently pays a quarterly dividend to its common shareholders.

      “During the second quarter, our hotels generated better than expected 
      revenues, primarily non-room revenues, and lower than forecasted 
      expenses in order to deliver better than expected Same-Property EBITDA, 
      Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share. We 
      achieved these results with in-line room revenues despite greater than 
      expected disruption from the redevelopment of Hotel Zoe San Francisco,” 
      said Jon E. Bortz, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of 
      Pebblebrook Hotel Trust. “Overall, our hotels in Seattle, Boston, 
      Washington, D.C. and San Diego experienced solid demand growth during 
      the second quarter, which helped to partly offset the anticipated 
      softness in San Francisco caused by the Moscone Center building 
      closures. Although many leading economic indicators remain positive, 
      business travel demand remained soft in the quarter as companies 
      continue to exercise restraint with discretionary spending such as 
      travel. As a result, we will remain cautious in our outlook for the 
      remainder of 2017 until we are positively impacted by a reacceleration 
      in business investment and spending.”
    

Second Quarter Highlights



Net Income: The Company’s net income was $43.7 million in the 
        second quarter of 2017, declining $30.8 million as compared to the 
        same period of 2016. The decline in net income was due to $40.3 
        million from gains on sale in 2016 compared with $14.6 million in the 
        current period of 2017.
      

Same-Property RevPAR and Same-Property Total Revenue per Available 
        Room: Same-Property RevPAR in the second quarter of 2017 declined 
        2.4 percent to $218.19 compared with the same period of 2016. 
        Excluding San Francisco, Same-Property RevPAR grew 2.0 percent over 
        the prior year. Same-Property ADR dropped 1.7 percent from the prior 
        year quarter to $251.08, and Same-Property Occupancy decreased 0.8 
        percent to 86.9 percent. Same-Property Total Revenue per Available 
        Room declined 0.3 percent from the same period of 2016.
      

Same-Property EBITDA: The Company’s hotels generated $71.6 
        million of Same-Property EBITDA for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, 
        declining 4.0 percent from the same period of 2016. Same-Property 
        Revenues decreased by 0.2 percent, while Same-Property Expenses grew 
        by 2.1 percent. As a result, Same-Property EBITDA Margin declined 142 
        basis points to 35.8 percent for the second quarter of 2017, as 
        compared to the same period last year.
      

Adjusted EBITDA: The Company’s Adjusted EBITDA declined to 
        $67.2 million from $78.9 million in the prior year period, a decrease 
        of $11.8 million, or 14.9 percent. The decline in Adjusted EBITDA was 
        primarily attributable to the property dispositions completed in 2016.
      

Adjusted FFO: The Company’s Adjusted FFO declined 11.5 percent 
        to $52.1 million from $58.9 million in the prior year period. The 
        Company’s Adjusted FFO per diluted share decreased 7.4 percent to 
        $0.75 compared with the same period of 2016.
      

Dividends: On June 15, 2017, the Company declared a regular 
        quarterly cash dividend of $0.38 per share on its common shares, a 
        regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.40625 per share on its 6.50% 
        Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares and a regular 
        quarterly cash dividend of $0.39844 per share on its 6.375% Series D 
        Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares.
      


      “While our portfolio was negatively impacted by the temporary challenges 
      in San Francisco, we remain particularly pleased with the performance of 
      our recently renovated hotels as they continue to achieve RevPAR growth 
      and increased market share,” said Mr. Bortz. “In the second quarter, 
      Same-Property RevPAR for our portfolio declined 2.4 percent, which was 
      squarely in the middle of the range of our negative 3.5 percent to 
      negative 1.5 percent outlook. Excluding San Francisco, Same-Property 
      RevPAR increased 2.0 percent. Same-Property Total Revenue declined just 
      0.2 percent, as our hotel teams continue to make progress growing 
      non-room revenues such as food and beverage – a trend which we expect 
      will continue throughout at least the remainder of 2017.”
    

Strategic Disposition Plan


      During the quarter, the Company completed the sale of the 252-room 
      Dumont NYC for gross proceeds of $118.0 million, as well as the sale of 
      the 826-space parking garage at Revere Hotel Boston Common for gross 
      proceeds of $95.0 million. To date, with the completion of these sales, 
      the Company’s strategic disposition plan has yielded a total of $676.8 
      million in gross proceeds from sales, including 9 hotel assets and 2 
      non-hotel assets, as the Company continues to execute on its original 
      disposition goal of between $500 million and $1 billion in assets.
    

      “We are very pleased with the success that we’ve had in executing our 
      strategic disposition plan, including exiting the difficult New York 
      market,” noted Mr. Bortz. “We will continue to be opportunistic in 
      selectively selling hotels and real estate assets as we take advantage 
      of the attractive private market values of our real estate, which we 
      have been selling at prices that represent a significant premium to our 
      public market valuation.”
    

Share Repurchase Program Increased to $250 
      Million


      During the second quarter, the Company repurchased 1.1 million shares at 
      an average price of $29.80 per share under its $150.0 million share 
      repurchase program. Year-to-date, the Company has repurchased 3.2 
      million common shares at an average price of $28.77 per share totaling 
      $93.3 million. On July 27, 2017, the Board of Trustees authorized the 
      repurchase of an additional $100.0 million of common shares. Together 
      with the prior repurchase authorization, the Board has authorized the 
      repurchase of $250.0 million of common shares, of which $156.7 million 
      may still be repurchased. The repurchase programs may be suspended or 
      discontinued at any time, and the Company is not obligated to acquire 
      any particular amount of shares.
    

Capital Reinvestments


      During the second quarter, the Company made $25.5 million of capital 
      improvements throughout its portfolio. In June, the Company completed a 
      $16.0 million comprehensive renovation at Hotel Zoe San Francisco 
      (formerly The Tuscan Inn), which included a renovation of all guest 
      rooms, the guest room corridors, meeting rooms, lobby, public areas, 
      restaurant and entryway. Upon completion, the hotel was fully 
      transformed from an upscale branded product to a boutique, independent, 
      upper-upscale hotel. Additionally, Revere Hotel Boston Common completed 
      a $22.5 million redevelopment and renovation in June, which included a 
      comprehensive reconcepting of the entire hotel.
    

      During the remainder of 2017, the Company will continue and complete its 
      remaining renovation and redevelopment project at LaPlaya Beach Resort & 
      Club. This final major redevelopment project is estimated to cost $8.0 
      million, and includes a renovation of the lobby, restaurant and bar, and 
      all guest rooms in the resort’s Gulf Tower. Renovation work began right 
      after July 4th and is expected to be completed early in the 
      fourth quarter of 2017.
    

Year-to-Date Highlights



Net Income: The Company’s net income was $57.8 million for the 
        six months ended June 30, 2017, a decrease of $33.3 million over the 
        same period of 2016. The decline in net income was primarily 
        attributable to the gain on sale of hotel properties sold in 2016.
      

Same-Property RevPAR and Same-Property Total Revenue per 
        Available Room: Same-Property RevPAR for the six months ended June 
        30, 2017 decreased 2.6 percent over the same period of 2016 to 
        $205.59. Excluding San Francisco, Same-Property RevPAR grew 0.3 
        percent. Year-to-date Same-Property ADR fell 0.6 percent from the 
        comparable period of 2016 to $245.39, and year-to-date Same-Property 
        Occupancy declined 2.0 percent to 83.8 percent. Same-Property Total 
        Revenue per Available Room declined 1.6 percent from the same period 
        of 2016.
      

Same-Property EBITDA: The Company’s hotels generated $125.1 
        million of Same-Property EBITDA for the six months ended June 30, 
        2017, down 6.8 percent compared with the same period of 2016. 
        Same-Property Hotel Revenues declined 2.1 percent, while Same-Property 
        Hotel Expenses rose just 0.3 percent. As a result, Same-Property 
        EBITDA Margin for the six months ended June 30, 2017 declined 164 
        basis points to 33.1 percent as compared to the same period last year.
      

Adjusted EBITDA: The Company’s Adjusted EBITDA declined 14.0 
        percent, or $19.0 million, to $116.2 million from $135.1 million in 
        the prior year period. The decline in Adjusted EBITDA was largely 
        attributable to the property dispositions completed in 2016.
      

Adjusted FFO: The Company’s Adjusted FFO declined 8.7 percent 
        to $90.9 million from $99.5 million in the prior year period. The 
        Company’s Adjusted FFO per diluted share decreased 6.6 percent to 
        $1.28 compared with the same period of 2016.

      to trailing 12-month corporate EBITDA was 3.6 times.
    

2017 Outlook


      The Company's outlook for 2017 has been updated to reflect the Company’s 
      second quarter performance, the common shares repurchased year-to-date 
      and adjusted expectations from its prior outlook. In addition, the 2017 
      outlook, which assumes no additional acquisitions or dispositions, 
      includes the Company’s various planned capital investment projects and 
      includes other significant assumptions, is as follows:

      “We expect the urban markets to continue to underperform the greater 
      U.S. hotel industry as sluggish growth in business travel and weak 
      international inbound travel combined with greater supply growth 
      negatively impact the urban markets more than the rest of the industry,” 
      commented Mr. Bortz. “Nevertheless, we are increasing the lower end of 
      our Same-Property EBITDA range and increasing the entire range for 
      Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share to 
      reflect the beat in the second quarter. This is due to our success in 
      achieving higher non-room revenues and reduced expenses despite lowering 
      our RevPAR range for the year, which is mostly attributable to the 
      delayed opening of Hotel Zoe San Francisco and our forecast for slightly 
      weaker demand in San Francisco in the third quarter caused by the 
      Moscone Center expansion.”
    

      The Company’s outlook for the third quarter of 2017 is as follows:

      The Company’s outlook for 2017 and the third quarter of 2017 assumes no 
      additional acquisitions or dispositions beyond the hotels the Company 
      owned as of June 30, 2017. The Company’s outlook also incorporates all 
      of the expected disruption associated with the various renovations and 
      repositionings at our properties, including LaPlaya Beach Resort & Club, 
      which has already commenced renovation in 2017.
    

      The Company’s estimates and assumptions, including the Company’s outlook 
      for 2017 and the third quarter of 2017, for Same-Property RevPAR, 
      Same-Property RevPAR growth rate, Same-Property Room Revenue growth 
      rate, Same-Property EBITDA, Same-Property EBITDA growth rate, 
      Same-Property EBITDA Margin and Same-Property EBITDA Margin growth rate, 
      include the hotels owned as of June 30, 2017, as if they had been owned 
      by the Company for all of 2016 and 2017, except for Hotel Zeppelin San 
      Francisco, which is not included in the first quarter.
    

      If any of the foregoing estimates and assumptions prove to be 
      inaccurate, actual results, including the outlook, may vary, and could 
      vary significantly, from the amounts shown above.

            To supplement the Company’s consolidated financial statements 
            presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting 
            principles ("GAAP"), this press release includes certain non-GAAP 
            financial measures as defined under Securities and Exchange 
            Commission ("SEC") rules.
          




           
        




            These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, 
            measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different 
            from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other 
            companies. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are not 
            based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. 
            Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not 
            reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company’s results 
            of operations determined in accordance with GAAP.
          




           
        




            Funds from Operations (“FFO”) - FFO represents net income 
            (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses from 
            sales of properties, plus real estate-related depreciation and 
            amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated 
            partnerships. The Company considers FFO a useful measure of 
            performance for an equity REIT because it facilitates an 
            understanding of the Company's operating performance without 
            giving effect to real estate depreciation and amortization, which 
            assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably 
            over time. Since real estate values have historically risen or 
            fallen with market conditions, the Company believes that FFO 
            provides a meaningful indication of its performance. The Company 
            also considers FFO an appropriate performance measure given its 
            wide use by investors and analysts. The Company computes FFO in 
            accordance with standards established by the Board of Governors of 
            NAREIT in its March 1995 White Paper (as amended in November 1999 
            and April 2002), which may differ from the methodology for 
            calculating FFO utilized by other equity REITs and, accordingly, 
            may not be comparable to that of other REITs. Further, FFO does 
            not represent amounts available for management’s discretionary use 
            because of needed capital replacement or expansion, debt service 
            obligations or other commitments and uncertainties, nor is it 
            indicative of funds available to fund the Company’s cash needs, 
            including its ability to make distributions. The Company presents 
            FFO per diluted share calculations that are based on the 
            outstanding dilutive common shares plus the outstanding Operating 
            Partnership units for the periods presented.
          




           
        




            The Company also evaluates its performance by reviewing Adjusted 
            FFO because it believes that adjusting FFO to exclude certain 
            recurring and non-recurring items described below provides useful 
            supplemental information regarding the Company's ongoing operating 
            performance and that the presentation of Adjusted FFO, when 
            combined with the primary GAAP presentation of net income (loss), 
            more completely describes the Company's operating performance. The 
            Company adjusts FFO for the following items, which may occur in 
            any period, and refers to this measure as Adjusted FFO:
          




           
        




            - Hotel acquisition and disposition costs: The Company excludes 
            acquisition and disposition transaction costs expensed during the 
            period because it believes that including these costs in FFO does 
            not reflect the underlying financial performance of the Company 
            and its hotels.
          





            - Non-cash ground rent: The Company excludes the non-cash ground 
            rent expense, which is primarily made up of the straight-line rent 
            impact from a ground lease.
          





            - Management/franchise contract transition costs: The Company 
            excludes one-time management and/or franchise contract transition 
            costs expensed during the period because it believes that 
            including these costs in FFO does not reflect the underlying 
            financial performance of the Company and its hotels.
          





            - Interest expense adjustment for acquired liabilities: The 
            Company excludes interest expense adjustment for acquired 
            liabilities assumed in connection with acquisitions, because it 
            believes that including these non-cash adjustments in FFO does not 
            reflect the underlying financial performance of the Company.
          





            - Capital lease adjustment: The Company excludes the effect of 
            non-cash interest expense from capital leases because it believes 
            that including these non-cash adjustments in FFO does not reflect 
            the underlying financial performance of the Company.
          





            - Non-cash amortization of acquired intangibles: The Company 
            excludes the non-cash amortization of acquired intangibles, which 
            includes but is not limited to the amortization of favorable and 
            unfavorable leases and above/below market real estate tax 
            reduction agreements because it believes that including these 
            non-cash adjustments in FFO does not reflect the underlying 
            financial performance of the Company.
          





            - Issuance costs of redeemed preferred shares: The Company 
            excludes issuance costs of redeemed preferred shares during the 
            period because it believes that including these adjustments in FFO 
            does not reflect the underlying financial performance of the 
            Company and its hotels.
          





            - Other: The Company excludes the ineffective portion of the 
            change in fair value of the hedging instruments during the period 
            because it believes that including these non-cash adjustments in 
            FFO does not reflect the underlying financial performance of the 
            Company and its hotels.
          




           
        




            The Company’s presentation of FFO in accordance with the NAREIT 
            White Paper, and as adjusted by the Company, should not be 
            considered as an alternative to net income (computed in accordance 
            with GAAP) as an indicator of the Company’s financial performance 
            or to cash flow from operating activities (computed in accordance 
            with GAAP) as an indicator of its liquidity.

            To supplement the Company’s consolidated financial statements 
            presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting 
            principles ("GAAP"), this press release includes certain non-GAAP 
            financial measures as defined under Securities and Exchange 
            Commission ("SEC") rules.
          




           
        




            These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, 
            measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different 
            from similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. 
            In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any 
            comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP 
            measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the 
            amounts associated with the Company’s results of operations 
            determined in accordance with GAAP.
          




           
        




            Earnings before Interest, Taxes, and Depreciation and Amortization 
            ("EBITDA") - The Company believes that EBITDA provides investors a 
            useful financial measure to evaluate its operating performance, 
            excluding the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest 
            expense) and our asset base (primarily depreciation and 
            amortization).
          




           
        




            The Company also evaluates its performance by reviewing Adjusted 
            EBITDA because it believes that adjusting EBITDA to exclude 
            certain recurring and non-recurring items described below provides 
            useful supplemental information regarding the Company's ongoing 
            operating performance and that the presentation of Adjusted 
            EBITDA, when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of net 
            income (loss), more completely describes the Company's operating 
            performance. The Company adjusts EBITDA for the following items, 
            which may occur in any period, and refers to these measures as 
            Adjusted EBITDA:
          




           
        




            - Hotel acquisition and disposition costs: The Company excludes 
            acquisition and disposition transaction costs expensed during the 
            period because it believes that including these costs in EBITDA 
            does not reflect the underlying financial performance of the 
            Company and its hotels.
          





            - Non-cash ground rent: The Company excludes the non-cash ground 
            rent expense, which is primarily made up of the straight-line rent 
            impact from a ground lease.
          





            - Management/franchise contract transition costs: The Company 
            excludes one-time management and/or franchise contract transition 
            costs expensed during the period because it believes that 
            including these costs in EBITDA does not reflect the underlying 
            financial performance of the Company and its hotels.
          





            - Non-cash amortization of acquired intangibles: The Company 
            excludes the non-cash amortization of acquired intangibles, which 
            includes but is not limited to the amortization of favorable and 
            unfavorable leases and above/below market real estate tax 
            reduction agreements because it believes that including these 
            non-cash adjustments in EBITDA does not reflect the underlying 
            financial performance of the Company and its hotels.
          





            - Gain on sale of hotel properties: The Company excludes Gain on 
            sale of hotel properties because it believes that including this 
            adjustment in EBITDA does not reflect The underlying financial 
            performance of The Company and its hotels.
          





            - Impairment loss: The Company excludes impairment loss because it 
            believes that including this adjustment in EBITDA does not reflect 
            the underlying financial performance of the Company and its hotels.
          





            - Other: The Company excludes the ineffective portion of the 
            change in fair value of the hedging instruments during the period 
            because it believes that including these non-cash adjustments in 
            EBITDA does not reflect the underlying financial performance of 
            the Company and its hotels.
          




           
        




            The Company’s presentation of EBITDA, and as adjusted by the 
            Company, should not be considered as an alternative to net income 
            (computed in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of the 
            Company’s financial performance or to cash flow from operating

          To supplement the Company’s consolidated financial statements 
          presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting 
          principles ("GAAP"), this press release includes certain non-GAAP 
          financial measures as defined under Securities and Exchange 
          Commission ("SEC") rules.
        



           
        



          These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, 
          measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from 
          similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other 
          companies. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are not 
          based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. 
          Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not 
          reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company’s results of 
          operations determined in accordance with GAAP.
        



           
        



          Funds from Operations (“FFO”) - FFO represents net income (computed 
          in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses from sales of 
          properties, plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization 
          and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships. The Company 
          considers FFO a useful measure of performance for an equity REIT 
          because it facilitates an understanding of the Company's operating 
          performance without giving effect to real estate depreciation and 
          amortization, which assume that the value of real estate assets 
          diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values have 
          historically risen or fallen with market conditions, the Company 
          believes that FFO provides a meaningful indication of its 
          performance. The Company also considers FFO an appropriate 
          performance measure given its wide use by investors and analysts. 
          The Company computes FFO in accordance with standards established by 
          the Board of Governors of NAREIT in its March 1995 White Paper (as 
          amended in November 1999 and April 2002), which may differ from the 
          methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other equity REITs and, 
          accordingly, may not be comparable to that of other REITs. Further, 
          FFO does not represent amounts available for management’s 
          discretionary use because of needed capital replacement or 
          expansion, debt service obligations or other commitments and 
          uncertainties, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the 
          Company’s cash needs, including its ability to make distributions. 
          The Company presents FFO per diluted share calculations that are 
          based on the outstanding dilutive common shares plus the outstanding 
          Operating Partnership units for the periods presented.
        



           
        



          The Company also evaluates its performance by reviewing Adjusted FFO 
          because it believes that adjusting FFO to exclude certain recurring 
          and non-recurring items described below provides useful supplemental 
          information regarding the Company's ongoing operating performance 
          and that the presentation of Adjusted FFO, when combined with the 
          primary GAAP presentation of net income (loss), more completely 
          describes the Company's operating performance. The Company adjusts 
          FFO for the following items, which may occur in any period, and 
          refers to this measure as Adjusted FFO:
        



           
        



          - Non-cash ground rent: The Company excludes the non-cash ground 
          rent expense, which is primarily made up of the straight-line rent 
          impact from a ground lease.
        



          - Other: The Company excludes Other expenses, which include hotel 
          acquisition and disposition costs, management/franchise contract 
          transition costs, interest expense adjustment for acquired 
          liabilities, capital lease adjustment and non-cash amortization of 
          acquired intangibles, in addition to the ineffective portion of the 
          change in fair value of the hedging instruments during the period, 
          because the Company believes that including these non-cash 
          adjustments in FFO does not reflect the underlying financial 
          performance of the Company and its hotels.
        



           
        



          The Company’s presentation of FFO in accordance with the NAREIT 
          White Paper, and as adjusted by the Company, should not be 
          considered as an alternative to net income (computed in accordance 
          with GAAP) as an indicator of the Company’s financial performance or 
          to cash flow from operating activities (computed in accordance with 
          GAAP) as an indicator of its liquidity.

          Earnings before Interest, Taxes, and Depreciation and Amortization 
          ("EBITDA") - The Company believes that EBITDA provides investors a 
          useful financial measure to evaluate its operating performance, 
          excluding the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest 
          expense) and our asset base (primarily depreciation and 
          amortization).
        



           
        



          The Company also evaluates its performance by reviewing Adjusted 
          EBITDA because it believes that adjusting EBITDA to exclude certain 
          recurring and non-recurring items described below provides useful 
          supplemental information regarding the Company's ongoing operating 
          performance and that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, when 
          combined with the primary GAAP presentation of net income (loss), 
          more completely describes the Company's operating performance. The 
          Company adjusts EBITDA for the following items, which may occur in 
          any period, and refers to this measure as Adjusted EBITDA:
        



           
        



          - Non-cash ground rent: The Company excludes the non-cash ground 
          rent expense, which is primarily made up of the straight-line rent 
          impact from a ground lease.

          acquisition and disposition costs, management/franchise contract 
          transition costs and non-cash amortization of acquired intangibles, 
          in addition to the ineffective portion of the change in fair value 
          of the hedging instruments during the period, because the Company 
          believes that including these non-cash adjustments in EBITDA does 
          not reflect the underlying financial performance of the Company and 
          its hotels.
        



           
        



          The Company’s presentation of EBITDA, and as adjusted by the 
          Company, should not be considered as an alternative to net income 
          (computed in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of the Company’s 
          financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities

          June 30, 2017. This schedule of hotel results for the six months 
          ended June 30 includes information from all of the hotels the 
          Company owned as of June 30, 2017, excludes Hotel Zeppelin San 
          Francisco for Q1 in both 2017 and 2016 because it was closed during

          NYC and the Parking Garage at Revere Hotel Boston Common for Q2 in 
          both 2017 and 2016 because the Company sold these properties during

Pebblebrook Hotel Trust Earnings Dip on Asset Sales and Weak Hotel Market
The hotel REIT’s expects earnings to take a step back in 2017.

Pebblebrook Hotel Trust's (NYSE:PEB) financial results went upside down during the fourth quarter. That said, the company expected as much and even outperformed its forecast despite facing the headwinds of a weak hotel market and selling $463.8 million of assets last year. Unfortunately, those two factors will continue to weigh on results in 2017.

What happened with Pebblebrook this quarter?
Pebblebrook took a step back.

Same-Property RevPAR was flat versus 2015, which was a bit below the company's guidance range of $192 to $196 due to weak business travel, an uptick in new hotel supply, and continued global economic headwinds such as a strong dollar. 
Those factors, as well as the company's shrinking hotel portfolio, weighed on earnings. However, results did come in well above the company's guidance range as Adjusted FFO was $41.5 million, or $0.57 per share, while the company's forecast was $35.1 million to $38.5 million and $0.48 to $0.53, respectively. One factor driving that higher result was a 0.5% decline in same-property expenses.
Because of that expectation-beating quarter, the company's full-year results also came in ahead of guidance. Adjusted FFO rose 11.2% to $201.8 million, or $2.78 per share, which was above the high-end of its guidance range of $195.5 million to $198.9 million and $2.69 to $2.74, respectively.
The fourth-quarter was a busy one for the company on the asset sale side. It completed an asset exchange with a former joint venture partner to redeem its 49% interest in the Manhattan Collection and then sold the Manhattan NYC for $217.5 million. The company also sold the DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Bethesda for $50.1 million during the quarter. The company used the proceeds to redeem some preferred shares and repay debt, which was down to $1 billion as of the end of the year, about $110 million less than the year-ago period.

What management had to say
CEO Jon Bortz had this to say about the company's results:

We are very pleased with our 2016 results and the continued improvements we made throughout our portfolio in 2016, both operationally and from value-enhancing renovations. In addition, we had significant success with our strategic disposition plan, completing numerous property and asset dispositions totaling $463.8 million. The U.S. hotel industry ended yet another year at its highest occupancy ever, despite weak business travel, an uptick in new supply and continued headwinds from global economic challenges including a strong U.S. dollar. For Pebblebrook, in 2016, we grew Same-Property Wholly Owned EBITDA by 4.5%, Adjusted EBITDA by 5.3% and Adjusted FFO per share by 11.2%, and we increased our dividend by 22.6%, all representing record levels. We experienced this growth and record numbers while also completing several property dispositions, which reduced the size of the Company's portfolio, but lowered leverage and increased liquidity.

Aside from jettisoning hotels to improve its balance sheet, the company also invested $124 million to spruce up several of its other properties to enhance their profitability. These recently renovated and repositioned hotels were then able to increase their market share and cash flow last year, which is a trend the company expects to continue in 2017.
Looking forward
That said, despite improvements in its retained portfolio, and more optimism in the hotel industry, the company expects its financial results to decline in 2017. The company sees Same-Property EBITDA falling 8.7% on the low end to 4.7% at the high end. Those declines, when combined with a smaller portfolio, should push Adjusted FFO down to a range of $170.9 million to $182.2 million, or $2.34 to $2.50 per share, which represent decreases of 10.1% to 15.8% versus last year.

Pebblebrook Hotel Trust Earnings Slip on Hotel Sales and Redevelopment Disruptions
The hotel REIT’s financial results still came in above expectations due to strong demand and share repurchases.











                Matthew DiLallo
            

                (TMFmd19)



            
            Apr 28, 2017 at 10:00AM
            
            





Pebblebrook Hotel Trust's (NYSE:PEB) financial results continue heading in reverse due to the company's strategic repositioning plan. Not only did its decision to sell hotels cause earnings to slip, but recent redevelopment projects led to greater-than-expected disruption at several of its hotels. However, despite these and other headwinds, Pebblebrook's financial results were either within or above its guidance range.

What happened with Pebblebrook this quarter?
Pebblebrook's results continue to head lower.

Same-property RevPAR slipped a bit versus last year, though it was within the company's guidance range of $190 to $194. That's despite significant disruptions from redevelopment projects at Revere Hotel Boston Common, Hotel Palomar Los Angeles Beverly Hills, and The Tuscan Fisherman's Wharf, without which RevPAR would have been 330 basis points higher. 
Meanwhile, AFFO declined versus last year as a result of the sale of eight hotels from its portfolio due to its strategic repositioning plan. That said, Adjusted AFFO was above the high end of its $32.5 million to $35.5 million guidance range thanks to the positive impacts of national events in Washington, D.C., as well as healthy demand in the Nashville, Seattle, and San Diego markets, which offset tough comparable results in San Francisco and Los Angeles.
AFFO on a per-share basis also came in above the company's guidance of $0.45 to $0.49 per share. Aside from the positives impacting AFFO, the per-share result benefited from the fact that Pebblebrook repurchased $75 million in stock during the quarter, which reduced the share count by 0.6% versus the prior year.
The company continued paring down its hotel portfolio during the quarter, agreeing to sell the Dumont NYC for $118 million. The company expects to close that sale in late June and could use the proceeds to buy back more shares or reduce debt.






What management had to say
CEO Jon Bortz commented on the results:

Our portfolio's operating results in the first quarter were in line with our overall expectations despite greater than anticipated disruption from one of our significant redevelopment projects. Our financial results were driven by solid demand in several of our markets, including Washington, D.C., which benefited from the Inauguration and the Women's March, as well as Nashville, Seattle, and San Diego. As expected, this strength was offset by difficult year-over-year comparisons in San Francisco and Los Angeles. The loss of the Super Bowl in San Francisco and the elimination of the prior year demand from the displaced families affected by the Porter Ranch gas leak in Los Angeles negatively impacted our growth. However, excluding the disruption from the redevelopment projects at Revere Hotel Boston Common, Hotel Palomar Los Angeles Beverly Hills and The Tuscan Fisherman's Wharf, first quarter RevPAR growth would have been 330 basis points higher, which is a better indication of the operating performance of the portfolio.

As Bortz points out, the tailwind of strong demand in several key markets helped the company deliver results that were well within its expectations. That said, the company's overall financial performance will remain choppy as it continues redeveloping hotels to boost profitability and selling off additional properties. Driving the decision to divest, according to Bortz, is that "each sale allows us to take advantage of attractive current private market prices for our properties as well as the significant discount between our current share price and the underlying value of our assets on a private market basis."
Looking forward
Pebblebrook is adjusting its full-year guidance. The company now sees AFFO coming in at $167.2 million to $176.5 million, which represents reductions of $3.7 million and $5.7 million, respectively, from its prior guidance. That said, on a per-share basis, the company expects AFFO to be in the range of $2.37 to $2.50, which is a $0.03-per-share increase on the low end and unchanged at the high end.
