About Us

Conning has Staying Power
Conning is a leading global investment management firm with a long history of serving the insurance industry.
 Conning supports institutional investors with investment solutions and asset management offerings, award-winning risk modeling software, and industry research. Conning operates globally through its offices in Boston, Cologne, Hartford, Hong Kong, London, New York and Tokyo.

Mission Statement
Enhance the financial strength of our clients by delivering superior investment results, customized solutions, and exceptional service.

 



 
Philosophy
Since its founding in 1912, Conning has focused on  serving the needs of our clients. Our tradition of excellence has required that we always place our customers at the center of our business.

Corporate Responsibility
Conning's investment centers are Hartford, Hong Kong, London and New York.
United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UNPRI)  
At Conning, we believe that environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) practices can affect portfolio performance and are necessary considerations for responsible investing. We focus attention on ESG in our bottom-up analysis, where determining the sustainability of the issuer’s business model is paramount. Companies that have questionable business practices or corporate governance, by their very nature, do not have a sustainable business model over the long term. 
Conning became a signatory to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment in April of 2012. We are now working to more formally incorporate these principles, where appropriate and consistent with our responsibilities as a fiduciary, into our investment process.

Mission Statement
Enhance the financial strength of our clients by delivering superior investment results, customized solutions, and exceptional service.

 



 
Philosophy
Since its founding in 1912, Conning has focused on  serving the needs of our clients. Our tradition of excellence has required that we always place our customers at the center of our business.

Corporate Responsibility
Conning's investment centers are Hartford, Hong Kong, London and New York.
United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UNPRI)  
At Conning, we believe that environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) practices can affect portfolio performance and are necessary considerations for responsible investing. We focus attention on ESG in our bottom-up analysis, where determining the sustainability of the issuer’s business model is paramount. Companies that have questionable business practices or corporate governance, by their very nature, do not have a sustainable business model over the long term. 
Conning became a signatory to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment in April of 2012. We are now working to more formally incorporate these principles, where appropriate and consistent with our responsibilities as a fiduciary, into our investment process.
