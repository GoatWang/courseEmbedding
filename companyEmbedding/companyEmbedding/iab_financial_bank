iAB Financial Bank and First Merchants Bank: Banking, Together












 Friday, February 17, 2017 First Merchants Corporation and Independent Alliance Banks, Inc. Announce the Signing of a Definitive Merger Agreement
MUNCIE, Ind. & FORT WAYNE, Ind.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- First Merchants Corporation (NASDAQ:FRME) and Independent Alliance Banks, Inc. (OTCQX:IALB) (IAB) today announced they have executed a definitive agreement whereby IAB will merge with and into First Merchants, and its wholly owned bank subsidiary, iAB Financial Bank (iAB), will merge with and into First Merchants Bank.
Headquartered in Fort Wayne, Indiana, IAB operates 16 banking center locations in the Fort Wayne area. IAB was formed in 2005 as a result of the combination of two longstanding banks; Grabill Bank and MarkleBank. IAB has total assets of $1.1 billion, total loans of $753 million, and total deposits of $861 million (91% of which are core) and also earned a 0.94% return on average assets and 9.57% return on tangible common equity in 2016. Additionally, as of June 30, 2016, IAB had approximately $646 million of deposits in the Fort Wayne, Indiana Metropolitan Statistical Area, ranking it fifth in deposit market share with 8.3% of the market.
The merger agreement provides that shareholders of IAB will have the right to receive 1.6530 shares of First Merchants common stock for each share of IAB common stock owned. Based on the closing price of First Merchants’ common stock on February 16, 2017 of $42.10 per share, the implied price of IAB common stock is $69.59 per share. On November 21, 2016, First Merchants purchased 495,112 shares or 12.1% of IAB’s outstanding common stock from an IAB shareholder for $19.8 million in cash. Based on the closing price of First Merchants’ common stock on February 16, 2017, the transaction value for the remaining shares of common stock, not owned by First Merchants, is approximately $251.3 million.
The transaction is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2017, subject to the affirmative vote of IAB shareholders, regulatory approvals, and other customary conditions. The combined company, doing business as First Merchants Bank, expects to complete its integration during the fourth quarter of 2017.
First Merchants and IAB will have combined assets of $8.3 billion and will be the second largest financial holding company headquartered in Indiana. The combined company will have 122 banking offices in thirty-one Indiana counties, as well as two counties in both Ohio and Illinois.
Michael C. Rechin, President and Chief Executive Officer of First Merchants, said, “Like First Merchants, iAB has a long history and a deep-rooted commitment to community banking and we are excited for it to become the newest member of the First Merchants family. We believe that our strategy to be a service-driven alternative to our super-regional bank competitors will support the acceleration of iAB’s current initiatives while furthering our goal of growing as a high-performing company. The iAB franchise is a logical geographic extension for us given the less than 20-mile proximity of our nearest banking center locations. iAB Financial Bank’s markets in Northeast Indiana, and specifically Fort Wayne, offer outstanding growth opportunities for First Merchants in Indiana’s second largest market.”
Rechin added “We expect this combination to be mutually beneficial to First Merchants and IAB shareholders. We anticipate earnings per share accretion of approximately 2% in 2017 and approximately 5% annually over the longer term through the combination of identified expense savings of 38% plus the company’s organic growth resulting in a tangible book value earnback of 3.75 years.”
Michael C. Marhenke, iAB Financial Bank’s Chief Executive Officer and President, and William H. Thatcher III, iAB Financial Bank’s Chief Operating Officer, will be executives in First Merchants Bank’s newly acquired market, with Mr. Marhenke transitioning day-to-day management responsibilities over to Mr. Thatcher, who will assume the role of Regional President. Mr. Marhenke is expected to take on a leadership role within First Merchants that will keep him involved in the success of the merger and in the growth of First Merchants.
Mr. Marhenke stated, “We are excited about the opportunity to become part of the First Merchants family, and believe this partnership will be advantageous for our clients, shareholders and communities. For several years now, our strategic plan has been driven to be the community bank of choice in our marketplace. Our bankers look forward to expanded new product capabilities and lending capacity in continuing to build relationships with our clients as First Merchants. The core values of both companies share a commitment to local decision making, personal service, long-term relationships and community involvement.”
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey and Sandler O’Neill & Partners, L.P. served as financial advisors to First Merchants and legal advisor was Bingham Greenebaum Doll LLP.
ProBank Austin served as financial advisor to IAB in this transaction and Shumaker, Loop & Kendrick, LLP served as legal advisor to IAB.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 03/29/1978
            

                BBB has determined that iAB Financial Bank meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                            4. complete the required application and pay all monetary obligations to BBB in a timely manner

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.
