(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Business Description  We are a leading provider of manufactured vinyl coated fabrics. Our best known brand, Naugahyde, is the product of many improvements on rubber-coated fabrics developed a century ago in Naugatuck, Connecticut. We design, manufacture and market a wide selection of vinyl coated fabric products under a portfolio of recognized brand names. We believe that our business has continued to be a leading supplier in its marketplace because of our ability to provide specialized materials with performance characteristics customized to the end-user specifications, complemented by technical and customer support for the use of our products in manufacturing.  Our products have undergone considerable evolution and today are distinguished by superior performance in a wide variety of applications as alternatives to leather, cloth and other synthetic fabric coverings. Our standard product lines consist of more than 600 SKUs with combinations of colors, textures, patterns and other properties. Our products are differentiated by unique protective top finishes, adhesive back coatings and transfer print capabilities. Additional process capabilities include embossing grains and patterns, and rotogravure printing, which imparts character prints and non-registered prints, lamination and panel cutting.  Our vinyl coated fabrics products have various high performance characteristics and capabilities. They are durable, stain resistant, easily processed, more cost-effective and better performing than traditional leather or fabric coverings. Our products are frequently used in applications that require rigorous performance characteristics such as automotive and non-automotive transportation, certain indoor/outdoor furniture, commercial and hospitality seating, healthcare facilities and athletic equipment. Materials that we manufacture come in a wide range of colors and textures and can be hand or machine sewn, laminated to an underlying structure, thermoformed to cover various substrates or made into a variety of shapes for diverse end-uses. We are a long-established supplier to the global automotive industry and manufacture products for interior soft trim components from floor to headliner which are produced to meet specific component production requirements such as cut and sew, vacuum forming/covering, compression molding, and high frequency welding. Some products are supplied with micro perforations, which are necessary on most compression molding processes. Materials can also be combined with polyurethane or polypropylene foam laminated with either flame or hot melt adhesive for seating, fascia and door applications.  Products are developed and marketed based upon the performance characteristics required by end-users. For example, for recreational products used outdoors, such as boats, personal watercraft, golf carts and snowmobiles, a product designed primarily for water-based durability and weatherability is used. We also manufacture a line of products with our proprietary BeautyGard topcoats that contain agents to protect against staining and bacterial and fungal micro-organisms and can withstand repeated cleaning, a necessity in the restaurant and health care industries. These topcoats are environmentally friendlier than solvent-based topcoats. The line is widely used in hospitals and other healthcare facilities. Flame and smoke retardant vinyl coated fabrics are used for a variety of commercial and institutional furniture applications, including hospitals, restaurants and residential care centers and seats for school busses and aircraft.  We currently conduct our operations in manufacturing facilities that are located in Stoughton, Wisconsin and Earby, England.  On April 29, 2015, the Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Articles of Incorporation to change the Company's name from Invisa, Inc. to Uniroyal Global Engineered Products, Inc. On June 25, 2015, the stockholders approved the amendment. On July 13, 2015, the Company filed Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (the "Certificate of Amendment") with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada to change its name. The Certificate of Amendment became effective on July 15, 2015. The name change was approved by FINRA and became effective at the opening of trading on July 16, 2015 under our new ticker symbol "UNIR". In addition to the Company's new symbol, the Company's new CUSIP number is 90916U107. The new address for the Company's Web site is www.uniroyalglobal.com.  Table of Contents  Overview  On November 10, 2014, the Company acquired through its subsidiary UEP Holdings LLC ("UEPH") all of the ownership interests in Uniroyal Engineered Products, LLC ("Uniroyal"), and acquired directly all of the ordinary common stock of Engineered Products Acquisition Limited ("EPAL") the holding company for Wardle Storeys (Group) Limited ("Wardle Storeys"). As further explained in the 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K, this transaction was treated as a combination between entities under common control and was accounted for in a manner similar to the pooling-of-interests method.  Effective with the current year, the Company changed its fiscal year to correspond to the reporting periods of its subsidiaries. The current fiscal year is a 53-week year and ended on January 3, 2016. The current year's interim quarters ended on April 5, 2015, July 5, 2015 and October 4, 2015. The extra reporting week occurred during the first quarter ended April 5, 2015.  Wardle Storeys' functional currency is the British Pound Sterling. Wardle Storeys also has sales and purchases transactions that are denominated in currencies other than its functional currency, principally the Euro. Approximately 27% of the Company's global revenues and 30% of its global raw material purchases are derived from these transactions. The average exchange rates for the Pound Sterling to the U.S. Dollar and the Euro to the Pound Sterling were approximately 7.2% and 11.0%, respectively, lower in 2015 compared to 2014. Although these lower exchange rates decreased net sales by $6.6 million for the year ended January 3, 2016, it also decreased each line item in 2015. As a result, the overall negative effect on net income was reduced to approximately $1,344,000 for the year ended January 3, 2016, compared to the corresponding period of 2014.  Year Ended January 3, 2016 Compared to the Year Ended December 28, 2014 The following table sets forth, for the year ended January 3, 2016 ("Year-end 2015") and December 28, 2014 ("Year-end 2014"), certain operations data including their respective percentage of net sales: Year Ended January 3, 2016 December 28, 2014 Change % Change Net Sales $ 99,761,973 100.0 % $ 98,323,226 100.0 % $ 1,438,747 1.5 % Cost of Sales 77,813,354 78.0 % 79,004,240 80.4 % (1,190,886 ) -1.5 % Gross Profit 21,948,619 22.0 % 19,318,986 19.6 % 2,629,633 13.6 % Other Expenses: Selling 5,201,199 5.2 % 4,691,974 4.8 % 509,225 10.9 % General and administrative 7,779,012 7.8 % 8,437,348 8.6 % (658,336 ) -7.8 % Research and development 1,728,867 1.7 % 1,527,589 1.6 % 201,278 13.2 % Total operating expenses 14,709,078 14.7 % 14,656,911 14.9 % 52,167 0.4 % Operating Income 7,239,541 7.3 % 4,662,075 4.7 % 2,577,466 55.3 % Interest expense (1,613,391 ) -1.6 % (1,552,541 ) -1.6 % (60,850 ) 3.9 % Other income (expense) (65,361 ) -0.1 % 190,234 0.2 % (255,595 ) <-100 % Income before taxes 5,560,789 5.6 % 3,299,768 3.4 % 2,261,021 68.5 % Tax provision (2,193,054 ) -2.2 % (1,340,682 ) -1.4 % (852,372 ) 63.6 % Net income 7,753,843 7.8 % 4,640,450 4.7 % 3,113,393 67.1 % Preferred dividends (2,801,687 ) -2.8 % (403,582 ) -0.4 % (2,398,105 ) >100 % Net income available to common $ 4,952,156 5.0 % $ 4,236,868 4.3 % $ 715,288 16.9 % shareholders  Table of Contents  Revenue  Total revenue for the year ended 2015 increased $1,438,747 or 1.5% to $99,761,973 from $98,323,226 for the year ended 2014. Sales volumes and pricing for the year ended 2015 were ahead of the corresponding prior year period. The increase was primarily due to new automotive platform launches and the additional reporting week included in 2015. The increase would have been approximately $8.1 million or 8.9% but it was offset by $6.6 million of unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates for 2015 compared to 2014.  Gross Profit  Total gross profit for the year ended 2015 increased $2,629,633 or 13.6% to $21,948,619 from $19,318,986 for the year ended 2014. The gross profit percentage was 22.0% of sales for the year ended 2015 compared to 19.6% for the year ended 2014. The gross profit percentage increased in 2015 primarily due to the rolling off of lower margin automotive platforms which were replaced with higher margin platforms and the positive results of cost efficiency programs implemented during 2014. The gross profit increase was offset by approximately $1.9 million of unfavorable impact of currency exchange rate changes.  Operating Expenses  Selling expenses for the year ended 2015 increased $509,225 or 10.9% to $5,201,199 from $4,691,974 for the year ended 2014. The increase resulted primarily due to increases in commissions and additional support staff expenses added during the second half of 2014.  General and administrative expenses for the year ended 2015 decreased by $658,336 or 7.8% to $7,779,012 from $8,437,348 for the year ended 2014. The expense decrease is principally due to $492,000 of statutory severance payments for the year ended 2014 as a result of labor reduction programs at our U.K. facility. The one-time expenses in 2014 due to costs associated with the acquisition in the amount of $414,000 were offset by higher labor and administrative costs in 2015 to prepare the Company to become a multinational SEC reporting company. Also contributing to the decrease was the effect of the currency exchange rates change for 2015 compared to 2014.  Research and development expenses for the year ended 2015 increased by $201,278 or 13.2% to $1,728,967 from $1,527,589 for the year ended 2014. The increase was due to increased expenditures for new product development.  Operating Income  Operating income for the year ended 2015 increased by $2,577,466 or 55.3% to $7,239,541 from $4,662,075 for the year ended 2014. The operating income percentage was 7.3% of sales for the year ended 2015 compared to 4.7% for the year ended 2014. The increase was primarily due to the gross margin improvements. The amount of increase was offset by approximately $1,382,000 of unfavorable impact of currency exchange rate changes and increased selling expenses.  Interest Expense  Interest expense for the year ended 2015 increased by $60,850 or 3.9% to $1,613,391 from $1,552,541 for the year ended 2014. This increase was attributable to average debt and capital lease obligations being higher in 2015 compared to 2014.  Other Income  Other income (expenses) decreased $255,595 to other expense of $65,361 from other income of $190,234. The decrease was principally due to losses recognized on changes in fair values of financial instruments related to currency translations from Euro to the British Pound in the U.K. subsidiary for the year ended 2015 compared to net gains for the year ended 2014.  Table of Contents  Tax Provision  The tax benefits for 2015 and 2014 in the amounts of $2,193,054 and $1,340,682, respectively are primarily related to tax benefits recognized from the reduction in the Company's U.S. deferred tax asset valuation allowance. The Company had a deferred tax asset resulting from accumulated net operating losses but they had been fully reserved as of December 31, 2013 because the Company concluded that it was more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets would not be realized. At December 28, 2014 and again at January 3, 2016, the Company concluded after an analysis at each period that it was now more likely than not that some of the asset would be realized and accordingly reduced the valuation allowance by $2,511,000 and $1,253,000 for the years ended January 3, 2016 and December 28, 2014, respectively, creating tax benefits which were recognized in the operating results. The benefits of these reductions were offset by the provisions on each period's year pre-tax income.  Preferred Stock Dividend  The terms of the acquisitions in November 2014 resulted in the issuance of preferred ownership units/stock of UEP Holdings, LLC and EPAL to the sellers. These preferred units carried quarterly dividend requirements on a total value of $55,000,000 at rates ranging from 5% to 5.5%. The dividends reflected in the financial statements for 2015 are the dividends for the full year. The corresponding preferred dividend for 2014 was for the period from the acquisition date, November 10, 2014 through the end of the year.  Liquidity and Sources of Capital  Cash as it is needed is provided by using the Company's lines of credit. These lines provide for a total borrowing commitment in excess of $40,000,000 subject to the underlying borrowing base specified in the agreements. Of the total outstanding borrowings of $16,577,279 at January 3, 2016, $13,809,139 million of the lines bears interest at LIBOR plus a range of 1.95% to 2.45%, depending on the underlying borrowing base, or, at our option, at the bank's prime or base lending rate and $2.8 million bears interest at the bank's prime or base lending rate which was 3.50% at January 3, 2016. At January 3, 2016 the lines provided an additional availability of approximately $5.4 million. We plan to use this availability to help finance our cash needs for fiscal 2016 and future periods. The balances due under the lines of credit are recorded as current liabilities on the balance sheet.  Given our capital resources in the U.S. and the potential for increased investment and acquisitions in foreign jurisdictions, we do not have a history of repatriating a significant portion of our foreign cash. Accordingly, we have not recognized a deferred tax liability for these unremitted earnings. In the event that circumstances should change in the future and we decide to repatriate these foreign amounts to fund U.S. operations, the Company would record a tax expense and pay the applicable U.S. taxes on these repatriated foreign amounts.  The ratio of current assets to current liabilities, including the amount due under our lines of credit, was 1.22 at January 3, 2016 and 1.15 at December 28, 2014.  Cash balances increased $1,305,878, after the negative effects of currency translation of $51,009, to $1,910,112 at January 3, 2016 from $604,234 at December 28, 2014. Of the above noted amounts, $1,357,877 and $480,803 were held outside the U.S. by our foreign subsidiaries as of January 3, 2016 and December 28, 2014, respectively.  Cash provided by operations was $5,301,256 for the year ended 2015 compared to $4,195,458 for the year ended 2014. Cash provided by operations during 2015 was primarily due to operating income offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventory and the net decrease in accounts payables and accrued expenses. Cash provided by operations during 2014 was primarily due to operating income and increased accounts payable due to the timing of vendor payments offset by increases in accounts receivable.  Cash used in investing activities was $2,927,196 for the year ended 2015 compared to $3,273,143 for the year ended 2014. During 2015, cash used for investing activities was principally for purchases of machinery and equipment at our manufacturing locations. Of the $2,782,525 total capital expenditures for 2015, $1,995,587 was for the U.K. manufacturing facility and of this amount, $850,577 was for the completion of a new production line. The total cost of the line was approximately $2.4 million. The Company arranged a financing lease for $1.7 million which was funded in March 2015. The proceeds from this lease were used to reduce the Company's U.K. line of credit. Included in cash used for investing activities was $107,502 for premiums paid on company owned life insurance for the year ended 2015.  Table of Contents  For the year ended 2015, financing activities used $1,017,173 of cash as compared to $600,568 used in financing activities for the year ended 2014. As mentioned above, the company received in March 2015 $1.7 million related to a financing lease. Also included in the increase was a new financing arrangement which provided $410,922 on equipment previously owned by the Company not previously financed. During the year ended 2015 the Company paid $2,479,665 of preferred dividends. During the year ended 2014, cash used in financing activities included distributions to the former members of Uniroyal of $1,800,604, for taxes payable by the members as required by the member agreement. Included in 2014 was an increase in long-term debt of $725,798 which primarily was from the term loan on equipment previously owned by the Company not previously financed.  Our credit agreements contain customary affirmative and negative covenants. We were in compliance with our debt covenants as of January 3, 2016 and through the date of filing of this report.  We currently have several on-going capital projects that are important to our long term strategic goals. Machinery and equipment will also be added as needed to increase capacity or enhance operating efficiencies in our manufacturing plants. We will use a combination of financing arrangements to provide the necessary capital. We believe that our existing resources, including cash on hand and our credit facilities, together with cash generated from operations and additional bank borrowings, will be sufficient to fund our cash flow requirements through at least the next twelve months. However, there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on favorable terms, if at all.  We have no material off balance sheet arrangements.

The SEC has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company's financial condition and operating results, and requires management to make its most significant estimates and judgments in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances. Management believes that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances; however, actual results may vary from these estimates and assumptions under different future circumstances. Our critical accounting policies are described below.  Table of Contents  Revenue Recognition  Revenue is generally recognized from product sale upon shipment to the customer or upon receipt by the customer in accordance with the agreed upon customer terms when title and risk of ownership have passed, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Based on historical results and analysis, we estimate and calculate provisions for customer rebates and sales returns and allowances and record as an offset to revenue in the same period the related revenue is recognized.  Accounts Receivable  On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the accounts receivable based on individual customer circumstances, historical write-offs and collections, and current industry and customer credit conditions, and adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts accordingly. Our policy regarding write-offs and collection efforts varies based on individual customer circumstances. Past due accounts receivable are determined based on individual customer credit terms.  Inventories  We value inventory at the lower of cost using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, or market. We assess the recoverability of inventory and record a provision for obsolescence based upon specifically identified, discontinued, or obsolete items and a percentage of quantities on hand compared with historical and forecasted usage and sales levels. These assessments, which require management's judgments and estimates, reduce inventories to their estimated net realizable value.  Goodwill, Intangible Assets, and Other Long-Lived Assets  Long-lived assets consist of goodwill, identifiable intangible assets, trademarks, and property and equipment. We have deemed that our trademarks have indefinite useful lives and are not amortized unless we determine their useful lives are no longer indefinite. Other intangible assets and property and equipment, excluding goodwill, are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful life. We review long-lived assets, including property, equipment, and intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when the estimated future cash flows from the use of the asset are less than the carrying amount of that asset.  Income Tax  We file income tax returns in the United States as a C-Corporation, and in several state jurisdictions and in the United Kingdom. Our subsidiary, Uniroyal, is a limited liability company (LLC) for federal and state income tax purposes and as such, its income, losses, and credits are allocated to its members. Prior to November 10, 2014, as the previous owners, the sellers were the sole members and reported the allocations on their personal tax returns. As a result, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the year ended December 28, 2014, there is no tax provision on its income prior to November 10, 2014. After this date, Uniroyal's income is allocated entirely to UEPH as its sole member. The Company then receives this income allocation as the sole member of UEPH less the dividends paid on the preferred units held by the former members of Uniroyal.  We follow ASC 740 Income Taxes for recording the provision for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based upon the difference between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted marginal tax rate applicable when the related asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled. Deferred income tax expenses or benefits are based on the changes in the asset or liability each period. If available evidence suggests that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is required to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Future changes in such valuation allowance are included in the provision for deferred income taxes in the period of change. We have a federal net operating loss carryforward of approximately $18 million as of January 3, 2016, which expires in years beginning 2018 through 2033. We have deferred tax assets as a result of these loss carryforwards which have been reduced by a valuation allowances to $3,764,000 and $1,253,000 at January 3, 2016 and December 28, 2014, respectively.  Table of Contents  Foreign Currency Translation  The financial position and results of operations of our foreign subsidiaries are measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of operations denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, while revenues and expenses are translated at the weighted average exchange rates during the year. The resulting translation gains and losses on assets and liabilities are recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), and are excluded from net income until realized through a sale or liquidation of the investment.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  Our short-term financial instruments consist primarily of the following: cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable. We adjust the carrying value of financial assets denominated in other currencies such as cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and the lines of credit using the appropriate exchange rates at the balance sheet date. We believe that the carrying values of these short-term financial instruments approximate their estimated fair values.  The fair value of our long-term debt is estimated based on current rates for similar instruments with the same remaining maturities. In determining the current interest rates for similar instruments, we take into account its risk of nonperformance. We believe that the carrying value of our long-term debt approximates its estimated fair value.  Postretirement and Postemployment Benefit Liabilities  We provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all employees (active or retired) who were employed prior to February 20, 1987. In calculating our plan obligations and related expense, we make various assumptions and estimates. These assumptions include discount rates, mortality rates, retirement rates, termination rates and other factors. While we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our obligations and future expense.  . . .

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
