BALTIMORE, April 19, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- 
NEWS 








T. Rowe Price (NASDAQ-GS: TROW) has introduced three new equity funds that use a quantitative management style to select the stocks they hold. The new funds are:

T. Rowe Price QM U.S. Value Equity Fund, 
T. Rowe Price QM U.S. Small & Mid-Cap Core Equity Fund, and 
T. Rowe Price QM Global Equity Fund.
In addition, the company has renamed the T. Rowe Price Diversified Small-Cap Growth Fund as the T. Rowe Price QM U.S. Small-Cap Growth Equity Fund to better reflect its quantitative management style. All four funds are a part of the new T. Rowe Price Quantitative Management (QM) series and are available in Investor Class, Advisor Class, and I Class shares.
While T. Rowe Price is well known and respected for its fundamental research capabilities, the company has also developed a quantitative research program and has managed strategies with a quantitative focus and process for the last 10 years. Designed for long-term investors, the QM funds aim to deliver capital growth through the use of systematic, data-driven stock-selection models. These proprietary models analyze a multitude of fundamental metrics drawn primarily from company financial statements. In this way, and through close collaboration among the company's investment professionals, T. Rowe Price's quantitative research process is an effective complement to its longstanding strength in fundamental research.
T. Rowe Price's quantitative investment approach is based on identifying stocks that are outperformers over multiple market cycles in most global markets. These tend to be stocks that are undervalued relative to industry peers and the broader universe. There is a preference for companies that earn high returns on capital employed and those with high earnings quality, in part because these companies often experience more moderate declines in down markets. Because of this value-oriented preference, it is possible that T. Rowe Price's QM strategies could underperform in periods when valuation and quality characteristics are not rewarded by the market.
T. ROWE PRICE QM U.S. VALUE EQUITY FUND DETAILS

The fund will invest at least 80% of its net assets in equity securities of U.S. companies, and up to 10% in foreign stocks. 
While multiple metrics are employed in stock selection, the investment approach can be expected to have a strong value tilt relative to the Russell 1000 Value Index benchmark. 
The fund will hold approximately 125–135 stocks. 
An expected annual portfolio turnover of less than 50% reflects the fund's long-term orientation and should hold down trading-related transaction costs. 
The net expense ratio is capped at 0.69% for the Investor Class shares, 0.94% for the Advisor Class, and 0.54% for I Class shares (with a 0.05% operating expense cap). 
The fund is managed by Farris Shuggi, CFA, who has been a member of T. Rowe Price's quantitative research team since 2008. 
T. ROWE PRICE QM U.S. SMALL & MID-CAP CORE EQUITY FUND DETAILS

The fund will invest at least 80% of its net assets in equity securities of U.S. companies, and up to 10% of its assets in foreign stocks. 
The investment approach favors stocks featuring a combination of relatively inexpensive valuations, strong profitability, evidence of prudent capital allocation, and price trends that indicate positive market recognition. 
The fund will hold approximately 350 stocks benchmarked to the Russell 2500 Index. The fund will be well diversified, with a maximum size of any position expected to be lower than 1%. 
An expected annual portfolio turnover of less than 50% reflects the fund's long-term orientation and should hold down trading-related transaction costs. 
The net expense ratio is capped at 0.84% for the Investor Class shares, 1.09% for the Advisor Class, and 0.69% for I Class shares (with a 0.05% operating expense cap). 
The fund is managed by Boyko Atanassov, CFA, Ph.D., who has been a member of T. Rowe Price's quantitative research team since 2010.
T. ROWE PRICE QM GLOBAL EQUITY FUND DETAILS

The fund will invest at least 40% of its net assets in companies outside the U.S. and up to 20% in emerging market countries. 
The investment approach favors stocks featuring a combination of relatively inexpensive valuations, strong profitability, evidence of prudent capital allocation, and price trends that indicate positive market recognition. 
The fund will hold approximately 350–375 stocks benchmarked to the Morgan Stanley Capital International All Country World Index (MSCI ACWI). 
An expected annual portfolio turnover of less than 50% reflects the fund's long-term orientation and should hold down trading-related transaction costs. 
The net expense ratio is capped at 0.74% for the Investor Class shares, 0.99% for the Advisor Class, and 0.59% for I Class shares (with a 0.05% operating expense cap). 
The fund will be managed by Sudhir Nanda, CFA, Ph.D., who heads T. Rowe Price's Quantitative Equity Group and has over 15 years of investment experience at T. Rowe Price. Prashant Jeyaganesh, CFA, a 10-year veteran of T. Rowe Price, will serve as associate portfolio manager.
QM U.S. SMALL-CAP GROWTH EQUITY FUND (FORMERLY T. ROWE PRICE DIVERSIFIED SMALL-CAP GROWTH FUND)

The fund employs a systematic, data-driven process to identify attractive stocks within the small-cap growth universe. 
The fund normally invests at least 80% of net assets in equity securities issued by small-cap U.S. growth companies. 
The fund currently holds an Overall Morningstar rating of five stars for its risk-adjusted performance, as well as the 3-, 5- and 10-year periods ended January 31, 2016.1 The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with the fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year Morningstar Rating™ metrics. 
The fund has outperformed the Lipper Small-Cap Growth Funds Average and its benchmark index, the MSCI U.S. Small Cap Growth Index, for the 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods ended December 31, 2015.2 The fund's returns for the 1-, 3-, 5, and 10-year periods ended December 31, 2015, were 2.33%, 16.22%, 13.02%, and 9.36%, respectively. The MSCI U.S Small-Cap Growth Index returns for the 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods ended December 31, 2015, were -3.05%, 13.62%, 11.17%, and 8.78%, respectively. 
Current performance may be higher or lower than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary, and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. To obtain the most recent month-end performance, please call 1-800-541-8803 or go to troweprice.com. 
The fund charges a 1% redemption fee on shares held for 90 days or less. The performance information does not reflect the deduction of the redemption fee; if it did, the performance would be lower. The fund's total return figures include changes in principal value, reinvested dividends, and capital gain distributions. 
The net expense ratio is capped at 0.85% for the Investor Class shares. 
The fund has been managed since 2006 by Sudhir Nanda, CFA, Ph.D., head of the Quantitative Equity Group at T. Rowe Price. He has more than 15 years of investment experience at the firm.
Download a prospectus or obtain one by calling 1-800-541-8803. The prospectus includes investment objectives, risks, fees, expenses, and other information that you should read and consider carefully before investing.
All funds are subject to market risk, including the possible loss of principal.

QUOTE 
Sudhir Nanda, head of the Quantitative Equity Group at T. Rowe Price and portfolio manager of the QM Global Equity Fund and the QM U.S. Small-Cap Growth Equity Fund: 
"The launch of these new funds signals T. Rowe Price's commitment to quantitative equity research. Collectively, our experienced quantitative team has spent many years developing models that have demonstrated an ability to identify stocks with a high probability of outperformance over market cycles. Avoiding potential underperformers is another important component that can help a fund beat its benchmarks over time, and our models are designed to help with that, as well."
"In addition to managing the QM funds, our quantitative team also provides analysis for use by our fundamental research investment professionals. Our groups collaborate well together and complement each other. Our quantitative strategies are not 'black box.' We use efficient, transparent, and systematic analysis of fundamental data to drive our investment decisions as we work to provide investors with relative outperformance in a persistent manner."

An expected annual portfolio turnover of less than 50% reflects the fund’s long-term orientation and should hold down trading-related transaction costs.
The net expense ratio is capped at 0.89% for the Investor Class shares, 1.14% for the Advisor Class, and 0.69% for I Class shares (with a 0.05% operating expense cap).
The fund is managed by Boyko Atanassov, CFA, Ph.D., who has been a member of T. Rowe Price’s quantitative research team since 2010.

QUOTE
Sudhir Nanda, head of the Quantitative Equity Group at T. Rowe Price and portfolio manager of the QM Global Equity Fund and the QM U.S. Small-Cap Growth Equity Fund:
“The launch of these new funds signals T. Rowe Price’s commitment to quantitative equity research. Collectively, our experienced quantitative team has spent many years developing models that have demonstrated an ability to identify stocks with a high probability of outperformance over market cycles. Avoiding potential underperformers is another important component that can help a fund beat its benchmarks over time, and our models are designed to help with that, as well.”
“In addition to managing the QM funds, our quantitative team also provides analysis for use by our fundamental research investment professionals. Our groups collaborate well together and complement each other. Our quantitative strategies are not ‘black box.’ We use efficient, transparent, and systematic analysis of fundamental data to drive our investment decisions as we work to provide investors with relative outperformance in a persistent manner.”

T. Rowe Price mutual funds are subject to ongoing management fees and may be subject to redemption fees. An IRA may be subject to an annual fee, and a fee may be assessed when an IRA is closed. See prospectus for details.

The mutual funds referred to in this website are offered and sold only to persons residing in the United States and are offered by prospectus only. The prospectuses include investment objectives, risks, fees, expenses, and other information that you should read and consider carefully before investing.
Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 6/30/17, 72 of 108 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

*157 of our 332 mutual funds had a 10-year track record as of 6/30/17 (includes all share classes and excludes funds used in insurance products). 134 of these 157 (85%) funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 215 of 317 (68%), 183 of 225 (81%), 149 of 180 (83%), of T. Rowe Price funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 6/30/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
36 of our 39 Retirement Funds had a 10-year track record as of 6/30/17 (includes all share classes). 34 of these 36 funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 38 of 39, 38 of 39, and 35 of 36 of the Retirement Funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 6/30/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
Source: Lipper Inc. 162 of 213 funds (excluding institutional and bank institutional funds as defined by Lipper) more than 6 months old had expense ratios below their Lipper averages based on fiscal year-end data available as of 6/30/17.
The principal value of the Retirement Funds is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The funds’ allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term postretirement withdrawal horizon. The funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The funds maintain a substantial allocation to equities both prior to and after the target date, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.

Source for performance: T. Rowe Price. Fund performance is calculated using the official NAV with dividends reinvested, if any. The value of an investment and any income from it can go down as well as up. Investors may get back less than the amount invested. It will be affected by changes in the exchange rate between the base currency of the fund and the subscription currency, if different. Sales charges, taxes and other locally applied costs have not been deducted and if applicable, they will reduce the performance figures. Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future performance.

Hedged share classes (denoted by 'h') utilise investment techniques to mitigate currency risk between the underlying investment currency(ies) of the fund and the currency of the hedged share class. The costs of doing so will be borne by the share class and there is no guarantee that such hedging will be effective.







   Please   note that no management fees are charged to the Z, S and J share classes. No   administration agent fees are charged to the J class. No expenses or any   other fees are charged to the Z class. Fee arrangements for the Z, S and J   classes are made directly with the investment manager. Please see the   prospectus for further information.



   Where   the base currency of the fund differs from the share class currency, exchange   rate movements may affect returns.

Emerging Markets Equity

In emerging markets, identifying winners can be profitable; but avoiding losers is critical. Investing in the region since 1985, we believe there is no substitute for proprietary, fundamentally-driven research. That’s why today we have one of the industry’s deepest emerging and frontier markets equity research platforms.

Investment Objective
		Long-term capital growth from a diversified portfolio of high-quality European (ex UK) companies.


Investment Approach

Fundamental research is critical to successfully identify and assess long-term investment opportunities. We look for companies with high returns on capital and capable of providing sustainable earnings across the market cycle.
Style agnostic, focus on quality. By avoiding style constraints, we can invest in quality companies and maintain a balanced portfolio through market cycles.
Disciplined approach to valuation. We aim to buy businesses at a clear discount to their intrinsic value.
Risk management is essential and is assisted by diversification, quantitative analysis, and automatic stabilizers built into our investment process.

Source for performance: T. Rowe Price. Fund performance is calculated using the official NAV with dividends reinvested, if any. The value of an investment and any income from it can go down as well as up. Investors may get back less than the amount invested. It will be affected by changes in the exchange rate between the base currency of the fund and the subscription currency, if different. Sales charges, taxes and other locally applied costs have not been deducted and if applicable, they will reduce the performance figures. Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future performance.

Hedged share classes (denoted by 'h') utilise investment techniques to mitigate currency risk between the underlying investment currency(ies) of the fund and the currency of the hedged share class. The costs of doing so will be borne by the share class and there is no guarantee that such hedging will be effective.







   Please   note that no management fees are charged to the Z, S and J share classes. No   administration agent fees are charged to the J class. No expenses or any   other fees are charged to the Z class. Fee arrangements for the Z, S and J   classes are made directly with the investment manager. Please see the   prospectus for further information.



   Where   the base currency of the fund differs from the share class currency, exchange   rate movements may affect returns.

Emerging Markets Equity

In emerging markets, identifying winners can be profitable; but avoiding losers is critical. Investing in the region since 1985, we believe there is no substitute for proprietary, fundamentally-driven research. That’s why today we have one of the industry’s deepest emerging and frontier markets equity research platforms.
 

U.S. Equity

We’ve been a leader in US equity investment since we were founded in 1937. During that time, market conditions have constantly changed, but one thing has remained reliably the same – our consistent investment approach and resolute focus on delivering long-term returns for our clients.

Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 6/30/17, 72 of 108 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

*157 of our 332 mutual funds had a 10-year track record as of 6/30/17 (includes all share classes and excludes funds used in insurance products). 134 of these 157 (85%) funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 215 of 317 (68%), 183 of 225 (81%), 149 of 180 (83%), of T. Rowe Price funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 6/30/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
36 of our 39 Retirement Funds had a 10-year track record as of 6/30/17 (includes all share classes). 34 of these 36 funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 38 of 39, 38 of 39, and 35 of 36 of the Retirement Funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 6/30/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
Source: Lipper Inc. 162 of 213 funds (excluding institutional and bank institutional funds as defined by Lipper) more than 6 months old had expense ratios below their Lipper averages based on fiscal year-end data available as of 6/30/17.
The principal value of the Retirement Funds is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The funds’ allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term postretirement withdrawal horizon. The funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The funds maintain a substantial allocation to equities both prior to and after the target date, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.

T. Rowe Price mutual funds are subject to ongoing management fees and may be subject to redemption fees. An IRA may be subject to an annual fee, and a fee may be assessed when an IRA is closed. See prospectus for details. 
Past performance cannot guarantee future results. All mutual funds are subject to market risk, including possible loss of principal. Diversification cannot assure a profit or protect against loss in a declining market.
Based on cumulative total return, 174 of 232 (75%), 142 of 160 (89%), 115 of 127 (91%), and 105 of 114 (92%) T. Rowe Price stock funds (including all share classes and excluding funds used in insurance products) outperformed their Lipper averages for the 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods ended 6/30/17, respectively. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)

1Source: Lipper Inc. 162 of 213 funds (excluding institutional and bank institutional funds as defined by Lipper) more than 6 months old had expense ratios below their Lipper averages based on fiscal year-end data available as of 6/30/17.
*The principal value of the Retirement Funds and Target Funds (collectively, the "target date funds") is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The target date funds' allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The Retirement Funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term retirement withdrawal horizon. The Target Funds emphasize asset accumulation prior to retirement, balance the need for reduced market risk and income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a moderate postretirement withdrawal horizon. The target date funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The key difference between the Retirement Funds and the Target Funds is the overall allocation to equity; although they each maintain significant allocations to equities both prior to and after the target date, the Retirement Funds maintain a higher equity allocation, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.
