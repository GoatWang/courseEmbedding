There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsEssential for understanding the P.I.ByTom BrodyVINE VOICEon April 17, 2006Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseThe Blue & Brown Books are fun to read.  They establish most of the concepts that are discussed in the P.I.  These concepts are notated below, along with page numbers.  My notes below indicate the page numbers where these concepts occur in the B&B Books, as well as in the P.I.  If you read the B&B Books, you will have a relatively easy time recognizing the concepts (but not necessarily understanding them), as they are set forth, when you read the P.I.  You will know what to look out for.  Additionally, it seems that much of the first 50 pages of the P.I. is spent not doing philosophy, but is spent reflecting about philosophy.  This 50 page span of reflection is apt to be particularly confusing, unless one first reads the B&B Books.  The end-result of reading the B&B Books that is:  When you proceed to read the P.I., you will feel self-assured and happy in recognizing the same concepts, and new variations of these concepts, that appear in the P.I.Here is some late-breaking news.  A few years after posting this review, I finally published a real paper about Wittgenstein.  The following paper contains several pages about Wittgenstein, that is, about his analysis of the meaning of the word, "expectation."  My article got published in early 2010:Brody, T. (2010) Obviousness in patents following the U.S. Supreme Court's decision of KSR International Co. v. Teleflex, Inc. in Journal Patent Trademark Office Society 92:26-70.To summarize, W.'s philosophy first of all shows how the grammar of our language makes us think that mental acts (or mental processes, mental images, or feelings), of which we are conscious, are required for our various language games.  Again and again, W. discloses paper experiments demonstrating that mental acts (of which we are conscious) are not at all required for language games.  Next, W. explains how our various language games are like games, where these language games include: meaning, understanding, referring, commanding, and so on.  W. devotes much space to providing exercises disclosing different classes of language games, where the exercises are meant to convince us that there is no essential mental act (of which we are conscious).  Finally, W. provides an answer as to what is essential for a word to transmit meaning, understanding, reference, a command, a request, and the like.  However, W. provides only a sketchy answer, namely, that the answer lies in some institution or use.  NOTESMENTAL ACT OR MENTAL PROCESS.  Notion that meaning, referring, understanding, depends on a mental image or a mental process. Wittgenstein explains how the grammar of the layperson gives birth to this notion. Wittgenstein explains that this is a false notion and, at times, makes fun of this notion.a. The mental image or mental process is like consulting a paradigm or prototype (page 128, 165, 166 of B&B Books);b. The mental image or mental process is like consulting a table (page 100 of B&B Books);c. The mental image or mental process is like "accompaniment of another," "some kind of addition" (page 168, 169 of B&B Books).  Wittgenstein reveals what the layperson believes understanding and imagination to require a mental image or mental process.  Wittgenstein says that the layperson exclaims:  "But when I image something, something certainly happens!" (page 97 of PI).d. "You say to me: "You understand this expression . . . as if the sense were an atmosphere accompanying the word . . ."(page 41 of PI).e. "What really comes before our mind when we understand a word?-Isn't it something like a picture? Well, suppose that a picture does come before your mind when you hear the word "cube", say the drawing of a cube." (page 46 of PI).f. Wittgenstein shows how we are tricked into thinking there is this mental act or mental process, in an example of the language game of intending: "But didn't I already intend [by way of a mental process] the whole construction of the sentence . . . at its beginning?  So surely it already existed in my mind before I said it out loud . . . But here we are construing a misleading picture of "intending" . . ." (page 92 of PI).g. Wittgenstein says that the layperson says, "we sometimes call it "thinking" to accompany a sentence by a mental process . . .," thus implying that this is how the layperson comes to think that language games must be accompanied by a mental process.h. Wittgenstein says that the layperson comes to believe that language games require a mental image or mental process, since the layperson has the false picture that "the processes called . . . recognizing always consisted in comparing two impressions with one another.  It is as if I carried a picture of an object with me and used it to perform an identification of an object as the one represented by the picture." (page 133 of PI).i. Wittgenstein makes fun of the notion that language games require a mental image or mental picture, when he writes that "It is no more essential to the understanding of a proposition that one should imagine anything in connexion with it, than that one should make a sketch from it." (page 102 of PI).j. Wittgenstein tells how the layperson is tricked into thinking that language games of understanding require a mental process or mental picture, as the layperson is all to willing to say: "But when I imaging something, or even actually see objects, I have got something which my neighbor has not. . . I understand you.  You want to look about you and say: "At any rate only I have got THIS."" (page 102 of PI).k. "A gun is fired in my presence and I say: "This crash wasn't as loud as I expected" . . . was there a crash, louder than that of a gun, in your imagination?" (page 40 of B&B Books),l.  "I see someone pointing a gun and say "I expect a bang".  The shot is fired. . . . so did that bang somehow already exist in your expectation? . . . Did something of the shot already occur in my expectation?" (page 110 of PI),m. Wittgenstein explains how we are tricked into thinking that the mental image or mental process exists.  Wittgenstein points out that people generally agree to the proposition that "The purpose of language is to express thoughts.-So presumably the purpose of every sentence is to express a thought." (page 118 of PI).  Wittgenstein points out that the layperson's agreement to this proposition is what makes the layperson believe that the mental images or mental process are necessary for language games (page 118 of PI).n. Wittgenstein provides another example that shows that a mental act or a mental process need not accompany language games (example of expecting).  "We say "I am expecting him", when we believe that he will come, though his coming does not occupy our thoughts." (page 129 of PI).o. Wittgenstein provides yet another example showing that language games do not require a mental image or mental process.  "You were interrupted a while ago; do you still know what you were going to say?"  If I do know now, and say it--does that mean that I had already thought it before, only not said it? No." (page 138 of PI).p. Meaning, referring, understanding do not depend on mental acts (mental acts of which we are conscious) because of the fact that we can say, "Napoleon was crowned in 1804," and also mean "the man who won the battle of Austerlitz." (page 39; 142 of B&B Books).q. Wittgenstein argues that meaning, referring, understanding, are not dependent on a mental picture, because we can say, "King's College is no fire," even though (if you did have a mental image) there would be a dozen buildings that look just like that image. (page 39 of B&B Books).r. "When I think in language, there aren't `meanings' going through my mind in addition to the verbal expressions: the language is itself the vehicle of thought." (page 90 of PI).s. Wittgenstein shows how the grammar of the layperson suggests that language games require a separate mental image or mental process: ""One is tempted to use the following picture: what he really `wanted to say', what he `meant' was already present somewhere in his mind even before we gave it expression."  (page 91 of PI).t. Wittgenstein agrees that mental images do occur, even though he says that they are not a necessary part of any language game, with the exception of the language game of describing what you imagine: "The mental picture is the picture which is described when someone describes what he imagines." (page 98 of PI).u. Wittgenstein makes fun of the notion that a mental image blue is used when we use the language game of color (of the word blue): "Has anyone shewn me the image of the colour blue and told me that this is the image of blue?" (page 100 of PI).FEELINGS (feelings are a subset of mental acts or mental processes).  Notion that language games (e.g., meaning, referring, understanding, intending) depend on a mental process, where the mental process is a feeling.  Wittgenstein explains that this is a false notion and makes fun of this notion (pages 100, 105, 112, 129, 132 135, 144, 145, 148, 156 of B&B Books):a. Feelings of familiarity (page 180 of B&B Books);b. Relaxing of a strain (page 100 of B&B Books);c. Feelings of tension or feeling relieved (page 129 of B&B Books).d. "When I said, "Give me an apple and a pear and leave the room," had I the same feeling when I pronounced the two words "and"?" (page 79 of B&B Books)e.  "Didn't I have a sort of homely feeling when I took in the word `tree'?" (page 156 of B&B Books).GENERAL PROPERTIES OF ACTUAL GAMES (games of sports, cards, board games) AND LANGUAGE GAMES.  Concept that that there are many different types of games, that it is fruitless to define "games" by any single characteristic game, that it is fruitless to find a common element in all games, and that games are better defined by way of a family of resemblances.a.  Wittgenstein states that the search for this common element is like attempting to strip off "its particular costume" or like trying to find the real artichoke by stripping off its leaves (page 125 of B&B Books).b.  Wittgenstein provides examples of the multitude of games, for example, bounded card games and unbounded card games (page 91, 92 of B&B Books),c.  A game is something characterized by "a multitude of circumstances" (page 157 of B&B Books),d. But if someone wished to say: "There is something common to all these constructions . . . [o]ne might as well say: "Something runs through the whole thread-namely the continuous overlapping of these fibres . . . " (page 28 of PI).LIST OF LANGUAGE GAMES.  Wittgenstein uses these examples to demonstrate the absence of a mental image or mental process in these language games, and also to demonstrate the existence of the family quality in these language games:a. Languages game of can (page 116 of B&B Books),b. Languages game of trying (page 116 of B&B Books),c. Languages game of searching (page 129 of B&B Books),d. Languages game of expecting (page 183 of B&B Books),e. Languages game of familiarity (page 181 of B&B Books),f. Languages game of color (page 134 of B&B Books),g. Languages game of understanding (page 113, 155), "I then try to remember what happened in my mind when I understood the words I did understand and when I didn't understand the others . . . this experiment will sow us a multitude of different characteristic experiences, it will not show us any one experience which we should be inclined to call the experience of understanding . . . [b]ut opposed to these there will be a large class of cases in which I should have to say "I know of no particular experience at all, I just said `Yes', or `No'". Wittgenstein then provides a list of these experiences (page 156 of B&B Books);h. Languages game of sameness (pages 140, 141 of B&B Books),i. Languages game of observing (page 152 of B&B Books),j. Languages games of recognizing (page 127,165 of B&B Books),k. Languages games of thinking (page 148 of B&B Books).  Wittgenstein argues that the self observation of any mental image or mental act that occurs during thinking, will not tell us what thinking is: "In order to get clear about the meaning of the word "think" we watch ourselves while we think; what we observe will be what the word means"-But the concept is not used like that.  (It would be as if without knowing how to play chess, I were to try and make out what the word "mate" meant by close observation of the last move of some game of chess.)" (page 88 of PI).  Here, Wittgenstein is implying that the language game of thinking requires context  (page 88 of PI).  "Say: "Yes, this pen is blunt . . . [f]irst thinking it; then without thought; then just think the thought without the words .  . . [b]ut what constitutes thought here is not some process which has to accompany the words if they are not to be spoken without thought." (page 91 of PI).l. Languages games of willing, volition, intention (page 150, 151, 157).  ""is it time to get up?", he tries to make up his mind, and then suddenly he finds himself getting up.  Describing it this way emphasizes the absence of an act of volition."  Wittgenstein also uses the example of volition to illustrate the "game character" of the language game of volition: "But there is not one common difference between so called voluntary acts and involuntary ones, viz, the presence or absence of one element, the "act of volition."" (page 152 of B&B Books),m. Language games of belief (page 151 154 of B&B Books),n. Language games of using a name or naming (page 173, page 16 of PI),o. Language games of observing (page 152 of B&B Books),p. Language games of deriving (page 124 of B&B Books),q. Language game of similarity or having something in common (page 133, 135, 136 of B&B Books),r. Language game of reading (page 122 of B&B Books),s. Language games of interpreting drawings.  "And yet one feels that what one calls the expression of the face [a drawing] is something that can be detached from the drawing of the face.  It is as though we could say: "This face has a particular expression: namely this" (pointing to something)  . . . [W]e are, as it were, under the optical delusion which . . . makes us think that there are two objects where there is only one.  The delusion is assisted by our using the verb "to have", saying "The face has a particular expression"." (page 162, 163 of B&B Books).  See also page 168 169 of B&B Books).  Here, Wittgenstein points out how the layperson's use of ordinary grammar makes him think that a mental image or mental process is needed in the language games of understanding, of interpreting, etc., whereas, in fact, understanding, interpretation, etc., comes from context or from an institution.t. Language games of interpreting music.  ""What is it like to know the tempo in which a piece of music should be played?"  And the idea suggest itself that there must be a paradigm somewhere in our mind, and that we have adjusted the tempo to conform to that paradigm.  But in most cases . . . I will . . . just whistle it in a particular way, and nothing will have been present to my mind but the tune actually whistled (not an image of that)." (page 166 of B&B Books).  "Sing this tune with expression.  And now don't sing it, but repeat its expression!-And here one actually might repeat something.  For example, motions of the body, slower and faster breathing, and so on." (page 91 of PI).  Here, Wittgenstein seems to be showing how the layperson's use of grammar indicates that expression is a mental process separate from the singing (page 91 of PI).u. Similarly, in a discussion of the language game of recognition, Wittgenstein states that "Suppose the game . . . consisted in this, that B should say whether he knows the object or not but does not say what it is.  Suppose he was shown an ordinary pencil . . . [w]hat happened when he recognized it? . . . the words "Oh, this is a pencil" did not refer to a paradigm, the similarity of which with the pencil shown B had recognized.  Asked "what is a pencil?", Be would not have pointed to another object as the paradigm or sample, but could straight away have pointed to the pencil shown to him . . . [h]e just reacted in this particular way by saying this word." (page 128 of B&B Books).v. Wittgenstein explains why the notion that a mental image or mental process is used in understanding, interpreting, etc., a word or a drawing.  Wittgenstein explains: ""The word falls", one is tempted to explain, "into a mould of my mind long prepared fro it". But . . . I don't perceive both the word and a mould . . ." (page 170 of B&B Books).INSTITUTIONS, CONTEXT, USE, SITUATIONS.  Wittgenstein concludes that meaning, referring, understanding, etc., depends on some connection to context, uses, institutions, connection.a. "The meaning of a phrase for us is characterized by the use we make of it.  The meaning is not a mental accompaniment to the expression . . . I want to play chess, and a man gives the white king a paper crown, leaving the use of the piece unaltered, but telling me that the crown has a meaning to him in the game . . . I say: "as long as it doesn't alter the use of the piece, it hasn't what I call a meaning."" (page 65 of B&B Books).b. "[W]e refer by the phrase "understanding a word" not necessarily to that which happens while we are saying or hearing it, but to the whole environment of the event of saying it." (page 157 of B&B Books).c. Wittgenstein indicates that meaning comes not from a mental image or mental process, but from use.  "What we call their meaning is not anything which they have got in them or which is fastened to them irrespective of what use we make of them." (page 170 of B&B Books).d. Regarding the language game of naming, Wittgenstein says: "We can therefore say that if naming something is to be more than just uttering a sound while pointing to something, there must also be . . . the knowledge of how in the particular case the sound . . . is to be used." (page 173 of B&B Books).e. "This thought ties on to thoughts which I have had before . . . [t]his thought is connected with those earlier  thoughts", and yet be unable to shew the connexion." (page 139 of PI).f. "Of course, if the meaning is the use we make of the word . . . [b]ut we understand the meaning of a word when we hear or say it; we grasp it in a flash, and what we grasp in this way is surely something different from the "use," which is extended in time . . . [b]ut can the whole use of the word come before my mind, when I understand it in this way?" (page 46 of PI).  "One cannot guess how a word functions.  One has to look at its use and learn from that." (page 93 of PI).g. "An intention [in language game of intending] is embedded in its situation, in human customs and institutions." (page 92 of PI).h. This concerns the language game the color red. "What am I to say about the word "red"?  --that it means something "confronting us all" and that everyone should really have another word, besides this one, to mean his own sensation of red?  Or is it like this: the word "red" means something known to everyone . . ." (page 81 of PI).  Thus, Wittgenstein seems to say that meaning comes from something confronting us all, from something known to everyone.i. The following concerns the language game of expecting.  "An expectation is imbedded in a situation, from which arises.  The expectation of an explosion may, for example, arise from a situation in which an explosion is to be expected." (page 129 of PI).j. This concerns Wittgenstein's connection of language games with use.  ""It is as if we could grasp the whole use of the word in a flash.". . . Can't the use-in a certain sense-be grasped in a flash?  (page 65 of PI).  Here, Wittgenstein seems to be suggesting how meaning comes from something other than a mental image or mental process: "A machine as symbolizing its actions:the action of a machine-I might say at first-seems to be there in nit from the start.  What does that mean?-If we know the machine, everything else, that is its movement, seems to be already completely determine.  We talk as if these parts could only move in this way . . . "The machine's action seems to be in it from the start . . ." ". . . the possible movements of a machine are already there in it in some mysterious way . . ." (page 66 of PI).k. "I have been trained to react to this sign in a particular way, and now I do so react to it . . . a person goes by a sign-post only in so far as there exists a regular use of sign posts, a custom." (page 68 of PI).l. "To obey a rule, to make a report, to give an order, to play a game of chess, are customs (uses, institutions)." (page 68 of PI).11 comment|

Reputedly one of Wittgenstein most direct and accesible works, it is subtle and containing many of his ideas that appear in the previous Tractatus and later Investigations. A good dose of semiotics is needed to organise his ideas in a context more accessible to the casual reader interested in linguistics and neuropsychology.0Comment|

Philology and language analysis are hardly my forte or general interests but this nestles with symbolism and therefore is in a vein of epistemology and heuristics that I am very much inclined for. Attributions, signs, ascription, frames of understanding and the like seem to be addressed in this book. It is sad and superficial for me to state that what brought me to purchase this book is its title, having not tackled any Wittgenstein prior. I read one comment stating that this might be a hard read, but after Gilles Deleuze and Karl Marx how difficult can this be. Difficulty is to be matched by understanding. The more difficult the more inviting the challenge.0Comment|

Background and education[edit]
Rodin was born Jewish[4][5] in Philadelphia, PA.[6] She was the younger of two daughters of Morris and Sally Seitz. She graduated with honors from the Philadelphia School for Girls and won an undergraduate scholarship to the University of Pennsylvania.[7] At Penn, Rodin majored in psychology and graduated from the University's College for Women with a B.A. in 1966. She was the president of Penn's Women's Student Government and led the groundwork for the merger with the Men's Student Government[8] that ultimately formed the Student Committee on Undergraduate Education that led to the co-education of the College of Arts and Sciences.[9] She went on to earn a Ph.D. from Columbia University, which she received in 1970. Rodin also completed some postdoctoral research at the University of California at Irvine in 1971.[10]
Academic career[edit]
After teaching briefly at New York University, Rodin became an associate professor at Yale University, where she was to become well known among students as a popular lecturer.[7] She held various professorial and other positions at Yale from 1972 to 1994, including Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, Chair of the Department of Psychology, and Provost.
In 1994, Rodin became the first permanent female president of an Ivy League institution when she took over the leadership at her alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania and in so doing became the university's first graduate to become its president. Her immediate predecessor was Dr. Claire M. Fagin, who served in 1994 as Interim President.[11] As president, Rodin guided the university through a period of unprecedented growth and development that transformed Penn’s academic core and dramatically enhanced the quality of life on campus and in the surrounding community. She encouraged revitalization in University City and West Philadelphia through public safety; the establishment of Wharton School alliances for small businesses; the development of buildings and streetscapes that turned outward to the community; and the establishment of a university-led partnership school, the Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander University of Pennsylvania Partnership School.[12]
Under Rodin's leadership, Penn invigorated its resources, doubling its research funding and tripling both its annual fundraising and the size of its endowment. It also created Penn Medicine, the unified organization comprising the university's medical school and hospital; attracted record numbers of undergraduate applicants, creating Penn’s most selective classes ever; and rose in the U.S. News & World Report rankings of top national research universities from 16th in 1994 to 4th in 2002.[13]
The Rockefeller Foundation[edit]
Rodin became president of the Rockefeller Foundation in March, 2005. Following the devastation of Hurricane Sandy in 2012, Rodin was appointed by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo to co-chair NYS 2100,[14] a commission charged with finding ways to improve the resilience and strength of the state’s infrastructure in the face of natural disasters and other emergencies.[15][16]
Other professional work[edit]
She is on the Board of Directors of Citigroup and Comcast Corporation, where she served as the presiding director until 2006.[17] Rodin has also served on the board of corporations, including Aetna, Electronic Data Systems (EDS) and BlackRock.[18] She continues to serve as a trustee of the Brookings Institution.
Personal[edit]
Rodin is married to Paul R. Verkuil, a former president of the College of William and Mary, former dean of the Tulane University Law School and former CEO of the American Automobile Association.[19] Verkuil is a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, where he served previously as dean. Rodin was previously married two other times, to Bruce Rodin and to Nicholas Neijelow, with whom she has a son, Alex.[7]
Awards and honors[edit]
In 2003, Rodin was named to the PoliticsPA list of "Pennsylvania's Most Politically Powerful Women".[20] That same year, Rodin received the Philadelphia Award, given to "citizen[s] of the region who [have] done the most to advance the best and largest interest of the community."[21]
Rodin was named one of Crain's 50 Most Powerful Women in New York list three years in a row.[22] Rodin has also been recognized as one of Forbes Magazine's List of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women,[23] and the National Association of Corporate Directors' (NACD's) 2011 Directorship 100, in recognition of her work promoting the highest standards of corporate governance.

She encouraged revitalization in University City and West Philadelphia through public safety; the establishment of Wharton School alliances for small businesses; the development of buildings and streetscapes that turned outward to the community; and the establishment of a university-led partnership school, the Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander University of Pennsylvania Partnership School.[12]
Under Rodin's leadership, Penn invigorated its resources, doubling its research funding and tripling both its annual fundraising and the size of its endowment. It also created Penn Medicine, the unified organization comprising the university's medical school and hospital; attracted record numbers of undergraduate applicants, creating Penn’s most selective classes ever; and rose in the U.S. News & World Report rankings of top national research universities from 16th in 1994 to 4th in 2002.[13]
The Rockefeller Foundation[edit]
Rodin became president of the Rockefeller Foundation in March, 2005. Following the devastation of Hurricane Sandy in 2012, Rodin was appointed by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo to co-chair NYS 2100,[14] a commission charged with finding ways to improve the resilience and strength of the state’s infrastructure in the face of natural disasters and other emergencies.[15][16]
Other professional work[edit]
She is on the Board of Directors of Citigroup and Comcast Corporation, where she served as the presiding director until 2006.[17] Rodin has also served on the board of corporations, including Aetna, Electronic Data Systems (EDS) and BlackRock.[18] She continues to serve as a trustee of the Brookings Institution.
Personal[edit]
Rodin is married to Paul R. Verkuil, a former president of the College of William and Mary, former dean of the Tulane University Law School and former CEO of the American Automobile Association.[19] Verkuil is a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, where he served previously as dean. Rodin was previously married two other times, to Bruce Rodin and to Nicholas Neijelow, with whom she has a son, Alex.[7]
Awards and honors[edit]
In 2003, Rodin was named to the PoliticsPA list of "Pennsylvania's Most Politically Powerful Women".[20] That same year, Rodin received the Philadelphia Award, given to "citizen[s] of the region who [have] done the most to advance the best and largest interest of the community."[21]
Rodin was named one of Crain's 50 Most Powerful Women in New York list three years in a row.[22] Rodin has also been recognized as one of Forbes Magazine's List of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women,[23] and the National Association of Corporate Directors' (NACD's) 2011 Directorship 100, in recognition of her work promoting the highest standards of corporate governance.

Background and education[edit]
Rodin was born Jewish[4][5] in Philadelphia, PA.[6] She was the younger of two daughters of Morris and Sally Seitz. She graduated with honors from the Philadelphia School for Girls and won an undergraduate scholarship to the University of Pennsylvania.[7] At Penn, Rodin majored in psychology and graduated from the University's College for Women with a B.A. in 1966. She was the president of Penn's Women's Student Government and led the groundwork for the merger with the Men's Student Government[8] that ultimately formed the Student Committee on Undergraduate Education that led to the co-education of the College of Arts and Sciences.[9] She went on to earn a Ph.D. from Columbia University, which she received in 1970. Rodin also completed some postdoctoral research at the University of California at Irvine in 1971.[10]
Academic career[edit]
After teaching briefly at New York University, Rodin became an associate professor at Yale University, where she was to become well known among students as a popular lecturer.[7] She held various professorial and other positions at Yale from 1972 to 1994, including Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, Chair of the Department of Psychology, and Provost.
In 1994, Rodin became the first permanent female president of an Ivy League institution when she took over the leadership at her alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania and in so doing became the university's first graduate to become its president. Her immediate predecessor was Dr. Claire M.

Judith Rodin (born Judith Seitz; September 9, 1944) is a philanthropist with a long history in U.S. higher education. She was the president of the Rockefeller Foundation from 2005 until 2017.[1] From 1994 to 2004, Rodin served as the 7th permanent president of the University of Pennsylvania, and the first permanent female president of an Ivy League university.[2][3]

Background and education[edit]
Rodin was born Jewish[4][5] in Philadelphia, PA.[6] She was the younger of two daughters of Morris and Sally Seitz. She graduated with honors from the Philadelphia School for Girls and won an undergraduate scholarship to the University of Pennsylvania.[7] At Penn, Rodin majored in psychology and graduated from the University's College for Women with a B.A. in 1966. She was the president of Penn's Women's Student Government and led the groundwork for the merger with the Men's Student Government[8] that ultimately formed the Student Committee on Undergraduate Education that led to the co-education of the College of Arts and Sciences.[9] She went on to earn a Ph.D. from Columbia University, which she received in 1970. Rodin also completed some postdoctoral research at the University of California at Irvine in 1971.[10]
Academic career[edit]
After teaching briefly at New York University, Rodin became an associate professor at Yale University, where she was to become well known among students as a popular lecturer.[7] She held various professorial and other positions at Yale from 1972 to 1994, including Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, Chair of the Department of Psychology, and Provost.
In 1994, Rodin became the first permanent female president of an Ivy League institution when she took over the leadership at her alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania and in so doing became the university's first graduate to become its president. Her immediate predecessor was Dr. Claire M. Fagin, who served in 1994 as Interim President.[11] As president, Rodin guided the university through a period of unprecedented growth and development that transformed Penn’s academic core and dramatically enhanced the quality of life on campus and in the surrounding community. She encouraged revitalization in University City and West Philadelphia through public safety; the establishment of Wharton School alliances for small businesses; the development of buildings and streetscapes that turned outward to the community; and the establishment of a university-led partnership school, the Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander University of Pennsylvania Partnership School.[12]
Under Rodin's leadership, Penn invigorated its resources, doubling its research funding and tripling both its annual fundraising and the size of its endowment. It also created Penn Medicine, the unified organization comprising the university's medical school and hospital; attracted record numbers of undergraduate applicants, creating Penn’s most selective classes ever; and rose in the U.S. News & World Report rankings of top national research universities from 16th in 1994 to 4th in 2002.[13]
The Rockefeller Foundation[edit]
Rodin became president of the Rockefeller Foundation in March, 2005. Following the devastation of Hurricane Sandy in 2012, Rodin was appointed by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo to co-chair NYS 2100,[14] a commission charged with finding ways to improve the resilience and strength of the state’s infrastructure in the face of natural disasters and other emergencies.[15][16]
Other professional work[edit]
She is on the Board of Directors of Citigroup and Comcast Corporation, where she served as the presiding director until 2006.[17] Rodin has also served on the board of corporations, including Aetna, Electronic Data Systems (EDS) and BlackRock.[18] She continues to serve as a trustee of the Brookings Institution.
Personal[edit]
Rodin is married to Paul R. Verkuil, a former president of the College of William and Mary, former dean of the Tulane University Law School and former CEO of the American Automobile Association.[19] Verkuil is a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, where he served previously as dean. Rodin was previously married two other times, to Bruce Rodin and to Nicholas Neijelow, with whom she has a son, Alex.[7]
Awards and honors[edit]
In 2003, Rodin was named to the PoliticsPA list of "Pennsylvania's Most Politically Powerful Women".[20] That same year, Rodin received the Philadelphia Award, given to "citizen[s] of the region who [have] done the most to advance the best and largest interest of the community."[21]
Rodin was named one of Crain's 50 Most Powerful Women in New York list three years in a row.[22] Rodin has also been recognized as one of Forbes Magazine's List of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women,[23] and the National Association of Corporate Directors' (NACD's) 2011 Directorship 100, in recognition of her work promoting the highest standards of corporate governance.

	 By Eric Nee 
 
 Summer 2009






Judith Rodin heads the Rockefeller Foundation, one of the world’s oldest,
most influential, and innovative foundations.
Many of the 20th century’s big breakthroughs—Social Security, the Green Revolution,
the discovery of DNA, and family
planning—can be traced to early funding
from the Rockefeller Foundation.
Today, Rodin is doing her best to keep
the Rockefeller Foundation at the forefront
of new and big ideas. The foundation continues
to fund organizations tackling specific
problems like poor health care and environmental
degradation. But Rodin has
taken a different tack by also funding organizations
that are creating new innovation
processes—like crowdsourcing and collaborative
competitions—which can be applied
to solving all types of social problems.
In this interview with Stanford Social
Innovation Review Managing Editor Eric Nee,
Rodin explains the impact that the economic
downturn has had on the Rockefeller Foundation
and its grantmaking ability. She goes
on to discuss in some detail why the foundation
is funding organizations developing new
innovation processes and which processes
are proving most fruitful. And last, Rodin explains
how the Rockefeller Foundation is
adapting its grantmaking to the new opportunities
provided by the Obama administration.
Eric Nee: How is the economic downturn
affecting the Rockefeller Foundation?
Judith Rodin: Nobody foresaw the magnitude
of the economic crisis or the rapidity
with which it occurred. Our endowment was
down somewhere in the neighborhood of 25
percent at the end of ’08. And we will, undoubtedly,
be well over our traditional 5
percent payout this year. But our investment
managers were attentive to the market turbulence,
and in early 2008 we took out a
sizable line of credit with a large bank. With
access to that money, we did not have to sell
our holdings into a declining market to meet
our grantmaking needs. We plan to honor all
of our approved grants and move forward
with all of our ongoing initiatives. The Rockefeller
Foundation has been around for more
than 90 years, and with the confidence of
that history we’re well positioned to weather
this financial crisis.
What lessons did the foundation learn
from going through the Great Depression?
Just as the federal government saw the opportunity
to initiate major programs during
that time of need, so too did the Rockefeller
Foundation. It spent substantial resources
on significant programs, such as the development of Social Security. We are
planning to do the same thing now.
What impact will the economic downturn
have on nonprofits?
Clearly, there will be fewer nonprofits, at both
the level of givers and the level of grantees.
This may be the moment for consolidation in
an “industry”—in quote marks—that’s really
proliferated, and where there may not have
been the incentive or the motivation for
economies of scale. And so, regrettably, this
may be an opportunity for that. I also think
that innovation is going to be critical, accomplishing
more with less, working together, leveraging
resources, sharing data, and creating
models for change that can be more easily
replicated. All of these things are going to be
absolutely urgent in this economic climate.
You mentioned innovation. One of the
Rockefeller Foundation’s program areas is
funding innovation. Can you explain what
you are doing in that area?
Innovation is not just a product, it’s a process.
We want to focus our funding on the
how, not just on the what. We’re funding
organizations that are at the cutting edge of
the process of innovation. Our hope is that
those processes can be used by lots of different
organizations in lots of different fields.
What we’ve found is that a lot of the innovative
processes that have been created in the
private sector can be applied to solving not for-profit social challenges in the fields in
which we work—health care, economic security,
climate change, poverty alleviation,
and capacity building.
We’re focusing our efforts on two core
innovation ideas. First, that the most successful
solutions will often come from the
place where you’d least expect them. Here
we are funding organizations involved in
crowdsourcing techniques and collaborative
competitions. Second, that the innovations
that focus on the user often lead to
extraordinary and, we think, different outcomes.
Here we are funding organizations
focused on user-driven innovation.
Let’s talk about the first type of innovation
model you mentioned, crowdsourcing.
We began with a partnership with a for-profit company called InnoCentive that has
linked together a network of about 150,000
engineers, scientists, and entrepreneurs
around the world. They use a Web-based
platform to gather solutions to problems
that have confounded people working in
just one place, such as an R&D department
at a large pharmaceutical company. Hundreds
or even thousands of people who
have never met, and never will, compete to
solve a problem. The best solution, which is
determined by the organization that posted
the problem, wins a prize.
We thought this would be an amazing
platform for finding solutions to world
problems. I’ll give you an example. BoGo-Light had developed a solar-powered flashlight
and wanted to expand on that to develop
a product that could light a whole room
for people who had no electricity. So they
posted the problem on InnoCentive. The
winner was a scientist in New Zealand,
someone with whom BoGoLight, which is
based in Houston, would never have come
into contact. Just as important, BoGoLight
said the process was much more economical
and allowed them to see the problem
differently. The new light is now being used
in African villages and in the Gaza Strip.
One of the interesting things is how
many of the solvers have sent e-mails back
to InnoCentive saying: “I can’t tell you how
fantastic it feels to be working on social
problems. It’s not that I don’t like the prize
money, and I like working on the for-profit
problems, too. But it feels terrific to be
working on socially important problems
that I know can help people.”
Who are you funding in the area of collaborative
competitions?
An example is Changemakers, an Ashoka founded
NGO. Here again our interest is in
the process. At InnoCentive, the problem
solvers don’t see one another’s solutions,
but at Changemakers all of the solutions are
posted so that everyone can read them and
perhaps build on one another’s solutions.
They aren’t in the same room, but they can
collaborate virtually, making it possible to
create a different and better solution. It’s
through collaborative revision and iteration
that the best ideas come and new and creative
solutions are developed. Coca-Cola,
for example, sponsored a global water challenge
at Changemakers. They were looking
for ways to help impoverished communities
gain access to sanitation and drinking water.
Almost 300 competing applications came
in from 54 countries. Four of these entrants
were named winners and are splitting $1
million to create scalable, replicable, and
sustainable models that can be applied
around the world.
The second type of process that you are
funding is user-driven innovation. Can you
explain what that is?
The design firm IDEO is one of the best
practitioners of user-driven innovation.
Their concept is that innovations are most
successful if the people who will be using
the product or the service are given a real
voice in the development process. IDEO
usually works with large for-profit companies
to help design new products and services.
We funded IDEO to work with nonprofits to
help solve social problems. One grantee
they’ve been working with is Conversion
Sound, a social enterprise that develops
hearing aids for poor people in rural India.
Through the IDEO process they discovered
that because authority commands such respect,
particularly in the rural parts of India,
hearing aid technicians would be more effective
if they wore uniforms. It’s certainly
not something that I would have thought of,
or even thought was important, but the users
identified this as critical. In this instance,
a small change in the program made a very
big difference.
Another example of user-driven innovation
is the work done by Positive Deviance,
a group at Tufts University. Their idea is
that every community has positive outliers,
people who stand out because their behavior
is different from most of the other people
in the group and because they are more
successful. What Positive Deviance does is
identify the behaviors that have made
these outliers successful, and then teach
and institutionalize these behaviors to others
in the group. Positive Deviance gets
credit for showing what reduced hospital acquired
infections. They found that in
hospitals where the infection rate was very
low, individuals were using hand sanitizers,
and that that was not the case systematically
in those hospitals with high infection
rates. Positive Deviance spread those practices
to other hospitals.
With our funding, Positive Deviance is trying to figure out ways to decrease corruption
in governments of developing countries.
They’re identifying the behaviors of the most
ethical public officials in developing countries
and what behaviors they engage in to
root out waste, fraud, abuse, and corruption,
and then they are trying to generalize and
teach those behaviors. Their belief is that
some of the abuse comes from lacking the
skills to behave ethically, rather than simply
looking for fraudulent ways to hurt people.
How does the Rockefeller Foundation get
these lessons and skills about innovative
processes out to the rest of the world?
That is the critical question. We think innovation
is a skill that can be taught. Our Innovation
Initiative has three parts. The first
part, which I’ve already described, is to
make the grants to do the work. The second
part is monitoring and evaluating the work.
This involves not only measuring success
in the more traditional terms—does the innovation
work—but also evaluating whether
the process made the work of the grantee
better, different, more cost-effective, and a
whole cascade of other parameters. The
third part is to disseminate the process
through conferences, written materials, and
other means. Our success will be realized
only if all of this spreads and goes to scale.
We’ve already begun bringing the grantees
together, both actually and virtually, to
share what they have learned.
One of the things we are also doing is to
turn the lens on ourselves and ask are we,
the Rockefeller Foundation and the philanthropy
sector as a whole, using these innovation
tools and techniques? If we are, are we
using them as effectively as we might? And if
we’re not, can we go through the same kind
of training that we’ve been doing with our
grantees? We’ve held one workshop for several
foundations that were interested in embarking
on this journey with us. And we’ve
held a couple of workshops for ourselves. If
we really get good at this, we believe that by
using some of these innovation practices we
can make up for some of the financial cuts in
our endowment.
Let’s talk about President Obama. What
impact will his administration have on the
foundation’s work?
We did a national poll last summer with
Time—well before the economic crisis really
hit. What we found is that Americans want
new public policies. They want government
and their employers to enter into a new kind
of social contract. Americans also understand
that their roles will have to change and
that the 21st century is going to demand different
things of them as well. We were struck
by their embrace of government. So I think
President Obama has that mandate.
The opportunity for innovation is real, in
part because resources are limited. Whether
it’s innovation in public policy, whether it’s
a White House Office of Social Innovation,
whether it’s new kinds of models
of public-private partnership, all
of these are going to be necessary.
I don’t think it’s a choice between
public and private approaches to
solving social problems. It’s going
to require all of the sectors. We may need to
redefine the roles of each and how they interact.
But the problems are so big that we
need both the markets and the public sector
to engage, but we need them to engage in
different ways. That’s what this discussion
in Washington and literally around kitchen
tables everywhere in the United States is really
all about.
What is the Rockefeller Foundation doing
now to take advantage of this situation?
We worked on the economic stimulus bill,
trying to draw attention to issues like infrastructure,
climate change and the environment,
poverty, and urbanization. Some of
our grantmaking has changed to capitalize
on this shift as well.
We just funded a conference at NYU’s
Furman Center called “A Crisis Is a Terrible
Thing to Waste.” This conference looked at
the mortgage and housing crisis and asked,
“What are the opportunities for new ideas
about homeownership and how mortgages
and financing need to occur?” The new U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development
secretary, Shaun Donovan, was a
keynote speaker.
You launched a new program last summer
called Campaign for American Workers.
How has that program adjusted to the new
economic and political reality?
It was very clear to us that the growing inequality
around the world was going to have
enormous impact, and that government was
not providing major solutions to that set of
issues. So as we thought about this, we said,
“Has the social contract for the 20th century
now changed so much that we really ought
to examine what the 21st century contract
should be?” The Campaign for American
Workers is an effort to produce new social
research and create new public
policy solutions, all motivated
toward increasing the economic
security of the American worker.
Our view is that you can’t use
protectionist trade policies or
immigration policies to solve that problem.
It’s about doing what America has always
been good at, which is growing the pot
through innovation and economic development
and expanding the workforce.
What are some programs that you have
funded in this area?
One example is the Tax Policy Center,
which has developed the idea of a guaranteed
retirement account. If workers don’t
have access to a conventional defined benefit pension plan, they could contribute 2.5
percent of their income to the plan and the
government would pay the first 60 percent
of that amount, and then the employer
would kick in another 2.5 percent. It’s similar
to a 401(k). The difference is that the
money is deposited into an individual account
with the Social Security Administration,
which pools the money and puts it into
relatively conservative investments.
Are you optimistic about the future?
I think we will find solutions. This is an
amazing opportunity for Americans. We
can’t afford to squander it, because it’s a
once-in-a-generation opportunity.

                           "New York. Athens. Boston. Tohoku. Newtown. Oslo. West. Wenzhou. New Orleans. Dhaka. Moore. Nairobi. These communities are
                              just a few among the many that have been hit hard by one of the "wicked problems" of today's world: natural catastrophe, disease
                              and contagion, systems or social collapse. If you haven't been directly touched by one of these disruptions yourself, you
                              are sure to have been affected by them in some way. They harm people, destabilize communities, and threaten organizations
                              and even whole societies. These problems have become such a part of our world that knowing how to prepare for them, how to
                              respond when they happen, and how to recover from them should be essential skills of modern life for all of us. We have certainly
                              made progress in this regard, especially in the years since 9/11, but we are still at greater risk than we should be. We can't
                              anticipate every disruption that might come our way, but we can develop an overall approach for dealing with the wicked problems,
                              and formulate specific plans for areas where we and our communities are particularly vulnerable. The Resilience Dividend is
                              both timely and important as both the severity and frequency of disruptions are increase. We face extreme weather events,
                              rapid population shifts, and global interconnectedness that make us vulnerable to disruptions wherever they take place. What's
                              more, the list of global risks that we face in the coming years is truly daunting: from cyber-attacks to food shortage crises
                              to extreme volatility in energy price. We can no longer assume we are immune to the world's wicked problems, no matter who
                              we are and where we live. It develops both a way of thinking and practical tools for taking action for protecting the world's
                              people and communities and shows how to create a blueprint for change."--

                              whom they are good, in what instances, and to whom they should be made accessible. These issues can be debated at multiple
                              levels; from the ethical implications, to the social and psychological consequences for society and for the individual, to
                              the legal and medical outcomes. Each chapter highlights a different array of problems and benefits, while emph

                              in 1996 by Judith Rodin, President of the University of Pennsylvania. Distinguished members of the Commission, leading experts,
                              commissioned researchers, and leaders in America's nascent public discourse movement offer unexpected insights and an optimistic
                              vision of the health of our politics and culture. Readers - of all political persuasions - from the halls of political power
                              to the streets of urban neighborhood, from newsrooms and studios to think tanks and universities, will find these essays opening
                              up new paths to robust public discussion, more engaged citizenship, and stronger communities."--Jacket

The university & urban revival : out of the ivory tower and into the streets by

                           "In the last quarter of the twentieth century, urban colleges and universities found themselves enveloped by the poverty,
                              crime, and physical decline that afflicted American cities. Some institutions turned inward, trying to insulate themselves
                              rather than address the problems in their own backyards. Others attempted to develop better community relations, though changes
                              were hard to sustain." "Spurred by an unprecedented crime wave in 1996, University of Pennsylvania President Judith Rodin
                              knew that the time for urgent action had arrived, and she set a new course of proactive community engagement for her university.

                              and a mother with a deep affection for her hometown." "During Rodin's administration (1994-2004), the Chronicle of Higher
                              Education referred to Penn's progress as a "national model of constructive town-gown interaction and partnership." This book
                              narrates the challenges, frustrations, and successes of Penn's campaign, and its prospects for long-term change."--Jacket

                              "A new wave of investors is using impact investing to address some of the greatest challenges of our time - from climate change
                                 and water scarcity to lack of access to health care, education, and affordable housing- with the intention of also generating
                                 a financial return. This couldn't happen at a more critical time. While philanthropy continues to be a transformative force
                                 for good, global philanthropic funds, even when combined with the development or aid budgets of many national governments,
                                 add up to mere billions of dollars. Meanwhile, the cost of solving the world's problems runs into the trillions. In "The Power
                                 of Impact Investing", Rockefeller Foundation president Judith Rodin and Margot Brandenburg, two of the foremost experts in
                                 the field, explain what impact investing is, how it compares to philanthropy and traditional investments, where opportunities
                                 are evolving around the world, and how to get started. By sharing moving stories of impact investors and the exciting social
                                 enterprises benefiting from these investments, Rodin and Brandenburg offer a compelling resource for anyone interested in
                                 better understanding the power of impact investing -including retail investors, high-net-worth individuals, and heads of family
                                 offices, foundations, banks, and pension funds- while also offering experienced impact investors an opportunity to deepen
                                 their knowledge and benefit from the perspectives of other investors."--Descripción del editor

                                 just a few among the many that have been hit hard by one of the "wicked problems" of today's world: natural catastrophe, disease
                                 and contagion, systems or social collapse. If you haven't been directly touched by one of these disruptions yourself, you
                                 are sure to have been affected by them in some way. They harm people, destabilize communities, and threaten organizations
                                 and even whole societies. These problems have become such a part of our world that knowing how to prepare for them, how to
                                 respond when they happen, and how to recover from them should be essential skills of modern life for all of us. We have certainly
                                 made progress in this regard, especially in the years since 9/11, but we are still at greater risk than we should be. We can't
                                 anticipate every disruption that might come our way, but we can develop an overall approach for dealing with the wicked problems,
                                 and formulate specific plans for areas where we and our communities are particularly vulnerable. The Resilience Dividend is
                                 both timely and important as both the severity and frequency of disruptions are increase. We face extreme weather events,
                                 rapid population shifts, and global interconnectedness that make us vulnerable to disruptions wherever they take place. What's
                                 more, the list of global risks that we face in the coming years is truly daunting: from cyber-attacks to food shortage crises
                                 to extreme volatility in energy price. We can no longer assume we are immune to the world's wicked problems, no matter who
                                 we are and where we live. It develops both a way of thinking and practical tools for taking action for protecting the world's
                                 people and communities and shows how to create a blueprint for change."--

                              A new wave of investors is using impact investing to address some of the greatest challenges of our time-from climate change
                                 and water scarcity to lack of access to health care, education, and affordable housing-with the intention of also generating
                                 a financial return. This couldn't happen at a more critical time. While philanthropy continues to be a transformative force
                                 for good, global philanthropic funds, even when combined with the development or aid budgets of many national governments,
                                 add up to mere billions of dollars. Meanwhile, the cost of solving the world's problems runs into the trillions. In The Power
                                 of Impact Investing, Rockefeller Foundation president Judith Rodin and Margot Brandenburg, two of the foremost experts in
                                 the field, explain what impact investing is, how it compares to philanthropy and traditional investments, where opportunities
                                 are evolving around the world, and how to get started. By sharing moving stories of impact investors and the exciting social
                                 enterprises benefiting from these investments, Rodin and Brandenburg offer a compelling resource for anyone interested in
                                 better understanding the power of impact investing-including retail investors, high-net-worth individuals, and heads of family
                                 offices, foundations, banks, and pension funds-while also offering experienced impact investors an opportunity to deepen their
                                 knowledge and benefit from the perspectives of other investors

Remarks by Judith Rodin at the November 2015 BSR Annual Conference
November 5, 2015

Good evening.
I want to thank Aron Cramer and his incredible team for putting together another inspiring, productive, exhausting week. But as you know BSR’s good work is more than just excellent conferences. They are an incredible partner for so many of us in thinking through how we can bring together public-private partnerships to solve large, pressing challenges and build better businesses in the process.
Building resilience offers us one of those dual opportunities. This week you’ve heard from the crème de la crème of resilience thinking and doing. You’ve covered a range of topics, from building resilient businesses, to becoming resilient leaders, to thinking about resilience in the face of climate change.
You’ve heard from CEOs, CSOs, and even CROs—the first cohort of chief resilience officers who are leading cities in the 100 Resilient Cities Network, pioneered by The Rockefeller Foundation. And you’ve networked among your peers, sharing insights, best practices, and a few war stories along the way. If there is one mantra to sum up these proceedings, the next poster for your office wall, it may be the words of business strategist Andrew Winston who wrote:
“An extreme world calls for extreme change.”
And we are indeed living in an extreme world. Crisis has become the new normal. Thanks to the combining forces of globalization, urbanization, and climate change, not a week goes by that we don’t feel some disturbance that affect our businesses or the economy or geography that surrounds them. Maybe it’s an attack on our systems: a data breach or technology glitch. Maybe it’s a disruption in our communities: standing here in San Francisco, our minds go immediately to earthquakes and forest fires, but we are also seeing the effects of the slower burning stresses—drought, air pollution, and wealth inequality—on the communities and businesses here.
Other crises come from the inside: a massive product recall with no alternative sources for backup material like Lululemon faced a few years ago, or the scandal Volkswagen is currently caught up in. You might not think of these as resilience challenges, but they are. And any one of them could take a business, or even an industry, down.
In some weeks, it’s all of these disruptions. But if we spend so much time putting out fires and responding to emergencies, we miss out on new opportunities to grow our businesses, to unleash new innovations, to reach the full potential of our careers and our companies. And while it’s true that small challenges are good tests that can lead to transformations, businesses should be taking deliberate, planned, proactive risks, rather than be in the position of reacting.
Resilience thinking gives businesses the upper hand. When you invest in resilience building, not only do you spend less time and energy responding and reacting, you see dividends—resilience dividends—in the form of greater consumer loyalty, higher employee morale, and yes, greater profits.
There are three ways that companies can achieve these resilience dividends.
First, organizations must begin by building resilience from the inside out. This means more than just establishing business continuity plans, it requires embedding resilience at all levels of the culture. A textbook case study is Toyota Motor Corporation. Before the Japanese earthquake in 2011, the automaker had learned from past crises
and established disaster response task forces in every operation unit. But leadership did more than that: it had taken care to build the kind of culture that empowered its employees and its suppliers to gather and share information quickly, make decisions, and do what needed to be done to get car parts to manufacturers and deliver cars to customers—during good times and in times of crisis.
When the earthquake struck, Toyota’s leaders not only called into action the disaster response task forces that had been established, the company’s president, Akio Toyoda, delegated his authority to the people on the ground. Despite a production loss of about 370,000 vehicles, within a month all of Toyota’s major plants in Japan were running.
By the end of June, 90 percent of production had been restored. And in two years, Toyota had regained its top position, while other businesses in Japan still, even four years later, are struggling to recover. So start with building a culture that promotes greater resilience.
Second, the private sector can benefit from a hugely untapped market for innovating resilience products and services. Some companies have made resilience building one of their new business lines. For example, Veolia, is a company dedicated to helping customers solve their environmental and sustainability challenges. In Boston, for instance, Veolia’s innovative underground energy system recaptures and reuses environmentally-friendly thermal energy or “green steam,” which is reducing greenhouse gasses equivalent to removing 80,000 cars from the roads and increasing air quality. But it is also powering nearly 250 customers in the central business district and biotech corridor in nearby Cambridge.
That’s the resilience dividend.
Other companies are innovating new product and service lines that answer the question: “What do people, cities, or businesses need to prepare for, withstand, and grow in transform in the face of shocks and stresses?”
For example, big data companies are innovating platforms to help cities analyze their resilience challenges. New Orleans is working with Palantir to understand and then fix more effectively with one solution Problems arising from the interlinked geographical overlap of crimes, poverty, school drop-out rates, and environmental hazards.
So, #2, your companies can innovate around resilience products and services, creating new market opportunities. Third, be a critical partner in building resilience in the cities and communities where you are located. Take the current drought crippling the West Coast. The tourism industry in Las Vegas is a huge consumer of water, but they’ve recognized they have a role to play in building the resilience of their region.
For example, the MGM Grand directed its restaurants to make a simple but important change: by thawing frozen meat in a meat cooler overnight (rather than under running water) one restaurant alone has saved 3 million gallons of water in a year and saw significant savings on their water bill.
That’s just one restaurant! Imagine the dividends if all of the restaurants on the strip made this one simple change? In this example, building resilience isn’t just about environment sustainability, but also yielding resilience dividends by advancing more inclusive economies—where everyone, including your customers, employees, and neighbors, have access to opportunities.
This is a theme I hope to explore further with Aron and share some of the good work BSR and The Rockefeller Foundation are doing in this area. But first, let me end by saying that while an extreme world calls for extreme change, it also presents an extreme opportunity: 60 percent of the jobs that will exist in ten years haven’t even been invented yet. Seventy percent of the urban infrastructure needed by 2050 has not yet been built. Thousands of products and services that will be a part of daily life haven’t even been imagined. Many of those jobs and those products will be a direct result of seizing opportunities to manage and limit disruption, build resilience, and thrive in an extreme world. And I have no doubt that the individuals who will be leading those boardrooms and who will create those product lines are sitting at these tables here tonight, ready to put what you’ve seen, heard and dreamed this week into practice come Monday.
The future of your business and our society may depend on it.

Background and education[edit]
Rodin was born Jewish[4][5] in Philadelphia, PA.[6] She was the younger of two daughters of Morris and Sally Seitz. She graduated with honors from the Philadelphia School for Girls and won an undergraduate scholarship to the University of Pennsylvania.[7] At Penn, Rodin majored in psychology and graduated from the University's College for Women with a B.A. in 1966. She was the president of Penn's Women's Student Government and led the groundwork for the merger with the Men's Student Government[8] that ultimately formed the Student Committee on Undergraduate Education that led to the co-education of the College of Arts and Sciences.[9] She went on to earn a Ph.D. from Columbia University, which she received in 1970. Rodin also completed some postdoctoral research at the University of California at Irvine in 1971.[10]
Academic career[edit]
After teaching briefly at New York University, Rodin became an associate professor at Yale University, where she was to become well known among students as a popular lecturer.[7] She held various professorial and other positions at Yale from 1972 to 1994, including Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, Chair of the Department of Psychology, and Provost.
In 1994, Rodin became the first permanent female president of an Ivy League institution when she took over the leadership at her alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania and in so doing became the university's first graduate to become its president. Her immediate predecessor was Dr. Claire M. Fagin, who served in 1994 as Interim President.[11] As president, Rodin guided the university through a period of unprecedented growth and development that transformed Penn’s academic core and dramatically enhanced the quality of life on campus and in the surrounding community. She encouraged revitalization in University City and West Philadelphia through public safety; the establishment of Wharton School alliances for small businesses; the development of buildings and streetscapes that turned outward to the community; and the establishment of a university-led partnership school, the Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander University of Pennsylvania Partnership School.[12]
Under Rodin's leadership, Penn invigorated its resources, doubling its research funding and tripling both its annual fundraising and the size of its endowment. It also created Penn Medicine, the unified organization comprising the university's medical school and hospital; attracted record numbers of undergraduate applicants, creating Penn’s most selective classes ever; and rose in the U.S. News & World Report rankings of top national research universities from 16th in 1994 to 4th in 2002.[13]
The Rockefeller Foundation[edit]
Rodin became president of the Rockefeller Foundation in March, 2005. Following the devastation of Hurricane Sandy in 2012, Rodin was appointed by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo to co-chair NYS 2100,[14] a commission charged with finding ways to improve the resilience and strength of the state’s infrastructure in the face of natural disasters and other emergencies.[15][16]
Other professional work[edit]
She is on the Board of Directors of Citigroup and Comcast Corporation, where she served as the presiding director until 2006.[17] Rodin has also served on the board of corporations, including Aetna, Electronic Data Systems (EDS) and BlackRock.[18] She continues to serve as a trustee of the Brookings Institution.
Personal[edit]
Rodin is married to Paul R. Verkuil, a former president of the College of William and Mary, former dean of the Tulane University Law School and former CEO of the American Automobile Association.[19] Verkuil is a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, where he served previously as dean. Rodin was previously married two other times, to Bruce Rodin and to Nicholas Neijelow, with whom she has a son, Alex.[7]
Awards and honors[edit]
In 2003, Rodin was named to the PoliticsPA list of "Pennsylvania's Most Politically Powerful Women".[20] That same year, Rodin received the Philadelphia Award, given to "citizen[s] of the region who [have] done the most to advance the best and largest interest of the community."[21]
Rodin was named one of Crain's 50 Most Powerful Women in New York list three years in a row.[22] Rodin has also been recognized as one of Forbes Magazine's List of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women,[23] and the National Association of Corporate Directors' (NACD's) 2011 Directorship 100, in recognition of her work promoting the highest standards of corporate governance.

Judith Rodin (born Judith Seitz; September 9, 1944) is a philanthropist with a long history in U.S. higher education. She was the president of the Rockefeller Foundation from 2005 until 2017.[1] From 1994 to 2004, Rodin served as the 7th permanent president of the University of Pennsylvania, and the first permanent female president of an Ivy League university.[2][3]

Background and education[edit]
Rodin was born Jewish[4][5] in Philadelphia, PA.[6] She was the younger of two daughters of Morris and Sally Seitz. She graduated with honors from the Philadelphia School for Girls and won an undergraduate scholarship to the University of Pennsylvania.[7] At Penn, Rodin majored in psychology and graduated from the University's College for Women with a B.A. in 1966. She was the president of Penn's Women's Student Government and led the groundwork for the merger with the Men's Student Government[8] that ultimately formed the Student Committee on Undergraduate Education that led to the co-education of the College of Arts and Sciences.[9] She went on to earn a Ph.D. from Columbia University, which she received in 1970. Rodin also completed some postdoctoral research at the University of California at Irvine in 1971.[10]
Academic career[edit]
After teaching briefly at New York University, Rodin became an associate professor at Yale University, where she was to become well known among students as a popular lecturer.[7] She held various professorial and other positions at Yale from 1972 to 1994, including Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, Chair of the Department of Psychology, and Provost.
In 1994, Rodin became the first permanent female president of an Ivy League institution when she took over the leadership at her alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania and in so doing became the university's first graduate to become its president. Her immediate predecessor was Dr. Claire M. Fagin, who served in 1994 as Interim President.[11] As president, Rodin guided the university through a period of unprecedented growth and development that transformed Penn’s academic core and dramatically enhanced the quality of life on campus and in the surrounding community. She encouraged revitalization in University City and West Philadelphia through public safety; the establishment of Wharton School alliances for small businesses; the development of buildings and streetscapes that turned outward to the community; and the establishment of a university-led partnership school, the Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander University of Pennsylvania Partnership School.[12]
Under Rodin's leadership, Penn invigorated its resources, doubling its research funding and tripling both its annual fundraising and the size of its endowment. It also created Penn Medicine, the unified organization comprising the university's medical school and hospital; attracted record numbers of undergraduate applicants, creating Penn’s most selective classes ever; and rose in the U.S. News & World Report rankings of top national research universities from 16th in 1994 to 4th in 2002.[13]
The Rockefeller Foundation[edit]
Rodin became president of the Rockefeller Foundation in March, 2005. Following the devastation of Hurricane Sandy in 2012, Rodin was appointed by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo to co-chair NYS 2100,[14] a commission charged with finding ways to improve the resilience and strength of the state’s infrastructure in the face of natural disasters and other emergencies.[15][16]
Other professional work[edit]
She is on the Board of Directors of Citigroup and Comcast Corporation, where she served as the presiding director until 2006.[17] Rodin has also served on the board of corporations, including Aetna, Electronic Data Systems (EDS) and BlackRock.[18] She continues to serve as a trustee of the Brookings Institution.
Personal[edit]
Rodin is married to Paul R. Verkuil, a former president of the College of William and Mary, former dean of the Tulane University Law School and former CEO of the American Automobile Association.[19] Verkuil is a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, where he served previously as dean. Rodin was previously married two other times, to Bruce Rodin and to Nicholas Neijelow, with whom she has a son, Alex.[7]
Awards and honors[edit]
In 2003, Rodin was named to the PoliticsPA list of "Pennsylvania's Most Politically Powerful Women".[20] That same year, Rodin received the Philadelphia Award, given to "citizen[s] of the region who [have] done the most to advance the best and largest interest of the community."[21]
Rodin was named one of Crain's 50 Most Powerful Women in New York list three years in a row.[22] Rodin has also been recognized as one of Forbes Magazine's List of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women,[23] and the National Association of Corporate Directors' (NACD's) 2011 Directorship 100, in recognition of her work promoting the highest standards of corporate governance.

For over two decades Rodin led and transformed two global institutions: The Rockefeller Foundation and the University of Pennsylvania. A ground-breaking executive throughout her career, Dr. Rodin was the first woman named to lead an Ivy League Institution and was the first woman to serve as The Rockefeller Foundation’s president. A research psychologist by training, she was one of the pioneers of the behavioral medicine and health psychology movements. Dr. Rodin’s leadership ushered The Rockefeller Foundation into a new era of strategic philanthropy that emphasized partnerships with business, government, and the philanthropic community to address and solve for the complex challenges of the 21st century. Rodin championed two whole new fields that are now pervasive: resilience and impact investing.   At Penn, Dr. Rodin presided over an unprecedented decade of growth and progress that transformed the institution, its campus, and the community, taking the university from sixteenth to fourth in U.S. News and World Report national rankings. The University also engineered a comprehensive, internationally acclaimed neighborhood revitalization program in West Philadelphia.  Rodin has served as a member of the board for several leading corporations and many non-profits. She has authored more than 250 academic articles and chapters, and has written or co-written 15 books, including her two most recent, The Power of Impact Investing: Putting Markets to Work for Profit and Global Good and The Resilience Dividend: Being Strong in a World Where Things Go Wrong.

Fagin, who served in 1994 as Interim President.[11] As president, Rodin guided the university through a period of unprecedented growth and development that transformed Penn’s academic core and dramatically enhanced the quality of life on campus and in the surrounding community. She encouraged revitalization in University City and West Philadelphia through public safety; the establishment of Wharton School alliances for small businesses; the development of buildings and streetscapes that turned outward to the community; and the establishment of a university-led partnership school, the Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander University of Pennsylvania Partnership School.[12]
Under Rodin's leadership, Penn invigorated its resources, doubling its research funding and tripling both its annual fundraising and the size of its endowment. It also created Penn Medicine, the unified organization comprising the university's medical school and hospital; attracted record numbers of undergraduate applicants, creating Penn’s most selective classes ever; and rose in the U.S. News & World Report rankings of top national research universities from 16th in 1994 to 4th in 2002.[13]
The Rockefeller Foundation[edit]
Rodin became president of the Rockefeller Foundation in March, 2005. Following the devastation of Hurricane Sandy in 2012, Rodin was appointed by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo to co-chair NYS 2100,[14] a commission charged with finding ways to improve the resilience and strength of the state’s infrastructure in the face of natural disasters and other emergencies.[15][16]
Other professional work[edit]
She is on the Board of Directors of Citigroup and Comcast Corporation, where she served as the presiding director until 2006.[17] Rodin has also served on the board of corporations, including Aetna, Electronic Data Systems (EDS) and BlackRock.[18] She continues to serve as a trustee of the Brookings Institution.
Personal[edit]
Rodin is married to Paul R. Verkuil, a former president of the College of William and Mary, former dean of the Tulane University Law School and former CEO of the American Automobile Association.[19] Verkuil is a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, where he served previously as dean. Rodin was previously married two other times, to Bruce Rodin and to Nicholas Neijelow, with whom she has a son, Alex.[7]
Awards and honors[edit]
In 2003, Rodin was named to the PoliticsPA list of "Pennsylvania's Most Politically Powerful Women".[20] That same year, Rodin received the Philadelphia Award, given to "citizen[s] of the region who [have] done the most to advance the best and largest interest of the community."[21]
Rodin was named one of Crain's 50 Most Powerful Women in New York list three years in a row.[22] Rodin has also been recognized as one of Forbes Magazine's List of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women,[23] and the National Association of Corporate Directors' (NACD's) 2011 Directorship 100, in recognition of her work promoting the highest standards of corporate governance.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
