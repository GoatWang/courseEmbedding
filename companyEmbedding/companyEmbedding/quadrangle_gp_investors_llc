U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSIONLitigation Release No. 21487 / April 15, 2010Securities and Exchange Commission v. Quadrangle Group LLC and Quadrangle GP Investors II, L.P., United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, 10-cv-3192 (filed April 15, 2010)SEC CHARGES PRIVATE EQUITY FIRM IN NEW YORK PENSION FUND PROBEThe Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against Quadrangle Group LLC and Quadrangle GP Investors II, L.P. in connection with the Commission's ongoing investigation into a multi-billion dollar kickback scheme involving New York's largest pension fund. The Quadrangle defendants agreed to settle the SEC's charges and pay a penalty of $5 million.The SEC previously charged Henry Morris, the top political advisor and chief fundraiser for former New York State Comptroller Alan Hevesi, and David Loglisci, the former New York State Deputy Comptroller, for orchestrating a fraudulent scheme that extracted kickbacks from investment management firms seeking to manage the assets of the New York State Common Retirement Fund. In today's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, the Commission alleges that the Quadrangle defendants entered into undisclosed financial arrangements that benefited Morris and Loglisci in order to win investment business from the Retirement Fund.Specifically, the SEC alleges that the Quadrangle defendants secured a $100 million investment from the Retirement Fund only after a former Quadrangle executive arranged for a Quadrangle affiliate to distribute the DVD of a low-budget film called "Chooch" that Loglisci and his brothers had produced and after that executive agreed to pay more than $1 million in sham "finder" fees to Morris. The scheme corrupted the integrity of the Common Fund's investment processes and resulted in the Retirement Fund's assets being invested with the undisclosed purpose of enriching Morris and Loglisci's brother.In settling the SEC's charges without admitting or denying the allegations, Quadrangle Group LLC and Quadrangle GP Investors II, L.P. consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and orders them to pay the financial penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.The SEC's investigation is continuing. The Commission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the New York Attorney General's Office which today announced an Assurance of Discontinuance with respect to the Quadrangle defendants. As part of that disposition, the defendants have agreed to repay the management fees they earned from the Retirement Fund's investment.For further information, see Litigation Release No. 20963 (March 19, 2009); Litigation Release No. 21001 (April 15, 2009); and Litigation Release No. 21018 (April 30, 2009)

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.

Our Story |


Our Team |


Let US Help|






It's a cruel world out there for the small business owner. And we can relate because we're entrepreneurs, just like you. We work with business owners throughout their companies' life cycles, helping them overcome the obstacles blocking effective compliance. And we provide the kind of thought leadership and guidance that will inspire and encourage their continued success, no matter the odds.
We got into this business because helping entrepreneurs is our passion. And we strongly believe in the power of private enterprise.





Wilmington, Delaware, in 1899, a young attorney named Christopher Ward had a big idea: create a firm that would make it easier for businesses to form corporations. Around the same time, another Delaware attorney named Josiah Marvel, had the very same idea.
After two decades in business, Ward and Marvel joined forces to create the first company solely dedicated to the business of being in business. At the time, it was called Corporation Service Company® (CSC®).
From Corporation Service Company to The Company Corporation® to incorporate.com, we may have changed our look but we still have more than a century's worth of experience in our business. To date, we've helped form more than 750,000 corporations or LLCs, and we've provided services to those companies that have improved their business compliance along every arduous step.





Simply put, we know what you're going through. Many of our team members ran their own companies before joining us. So when we say, "we've been there," we actually mean it. Our employees care for your orders as if they were their own, because, yeah, they've been there. And together, we've been there before more than 750,000 times.
We know that our success grows from your success, so we strive to fulfill your business needs with enthusiasm, speed, and absolute professionalism. We won't treat you like Joe Schmoe. We'll listen to you like a business partner.
Welcome to an entire corporation full of people who love corporations more than anything in the world?a mighty team of credible, approachable folks just like you who are forever dedicated to helping you do it right and do it better.




incorporate.com provides a range of services that are appropriate to every state of the small business life cycle.

 We help companies incorporate and form limited liability companies (LLCs) and may other entity types. Our formation services are available in every U.S. state as well as the District of Columbia.
We serve as a Registered Agent for thousands of U.S. businesses, making sure that our customers receive their legal and business critical documents quickly and securely.
We help businesses apply for tax information, including IRS-required Employer Identification Numbers (EINs) and, for nonprofit companies, 501(c) status.
We help new entities with their bylaws and operating agreements, reserve their unique company names, and register to do business in other states.
We help companies meet their ongoing compliance requirements, including annual report preparation, filing and research to find out what business licenses are needed in the form of a Business License Compliance Package.

Our coaching services put small business owners in touch with friendly, knowledgeable specialists who can guide them through their day-to-day compliance challenges. And Compliance Watch®, our exclusive online tool (free to our Registered Agent customers), sends handy reminders every time your corporate filings are due and provides many other assets that set your feet firmly on the path to easier business compliance.













                            "Much easier than incorporating on one's own, I've done it both ways and it was well worth the money."
                        

James Ireland
                            Las Vegas, NV






                            "My overall experience was wonderful! It was fast and easy. Customer service was fantastic! I would recommend The Company Corporation to everyone!"
                        

Shea Polk
                            Beaufort






                            "I have been using The Company Corporation for almost 20 years and have had no hassles during that time."
                        

Matthew F.
                            Thousand Oaks






                            "For a person who is just starting in business and not knowing where to find all the information they need to start, The Company Corporation was very helpful and knowledgeable about the forms, requirements, and necessary contacts you need to make."
                        

Diane D.
                            Longview






                            "Your company's website was very user friendly and the pricing was competitive. My company was created quickly and my documents were emailed right to me."

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
