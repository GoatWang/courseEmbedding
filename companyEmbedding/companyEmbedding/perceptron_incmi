Helix 3D Scanning Sensors







Home → Helix 3D Scanning Sensors 








Helix™ is Perceptron’s family of next generation 3D Scanning Sensors incorporating MEMs technology offering the world’s first fully programmable laser scanner. The laser line quantity, density, length and orientation characteristics are all user configurable and eliminate the necessity to physically move the scanner over the part during scanning.
All scanning motion is contained within the patented Helix Smart Sensor, dramatically improving quality and accuracy of scanned data. It also allows you to capture multiple part features in one sensor position ensuring both accurate and repeatable measurement results. Helix contains an imbedded accelerometer to determine real-time sensor orientation. It was developed specially for advanced robotic inspection applications where the robot moves the sensor to discrete measuring positions and collects all required measurement data.
HelixHDR (High Dynamic Range)
The advanced performance HelixHDR Smart Sensor offers high power, and extended dynamic range, providing adjustable power up to the maximum permitted for a Class 3R laser. HelixHDR produces a thinner laser line and offers higher measurement resolution ideally suited for the inspection of complex machined parts and also exports enhanced 3D point clouds. The higher power also allows more complex measuring applications, including inspection of highly reflective metallic surfaces such as machined aluminum castings found in the automotive and aerospace sectors.

Automated Enterprise Metrology Solutions
Perceptron offers an extensive portfolio of dimensional gauging and inspection products along with robotic guidance, gap & flush measurement and 3D laser scanning solutions. With over 30 years of experience, Perceptron can be your enterprise metrology partner.
Globally, companies rely on Perceptron’s metrology solutions to assist in managing their complex manufacturing processes to improve quality, shorten product launch times and reduce costs. More than 900 systems, 12,000 Perceptron measuring sensors and over 3,000 Coord3 coordinate measuring machines are in active daily use worldwide. Headquartered in Plymouth, Michigan USA with subsidiary operations in Brazil, China, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, India, Italy, Spain, Japan, Singapore, Slovakia, Spain and the UK.
Our Mission
To be the global leader in supplying advanced metrology technology by helping our customers to identify and solve their measurement and quality problems.
Our Story
Perceptron (NASDAQ:PRCP) was founded in 1981 by graduates of The General Motors Institute (formerly GMI and now Kettering University). Working closely with the automotive industry, they analyzed and comprehended the damaging effects of process variation on complex product assembly operations and concluded “a process which cannot be measured can never be effectively controlled or optimized.”
Through revolutionary machine vision and pioneering engineering efforts, they created a unique and innovative measurement solution that not only allowed fast and efficient containment of quality problems as they occurred, but also provided the ability to pro-actively seek-out and reduce process variation. The final result was groundbreaking – the first viable, in-process, 100% dimensional measurement solution capable of being deployed in the harshest of manufacturing environments.

Perceptron Launches ScanR(TM), World's First Green CMM Laser-Line Scanner Offering Extended Dynamic Range Capable of Measuring Reflective Surfaces -- for Use With Portable and Fixed Coordinate Measuring Machines
ScanR (scan er) Represents the Sixth Generation of CMM-Laser Scanners From Perceptron, Dramatically Extending the Range of Engineering Materials That Can Be Laser-Scanned, Offering a Significant Customer Advantage Over Red and Blue Laser Scanners When Scanning Highly Reflective and Carbon Fiber Parts

                            Company Release - 5/4/2015 9:15 AM ET



PLYMOUTH, MI -- (Marketwired) -- 05/04/15 --
 Perceptron, Inc. (NASDAQ: PRCP) For more than 20 years Perceptron has pioneered the use of laser scanners on portable and fixed coordinate measuring machines. With the fast-growing application of 3D laser scanning for reverse engineering, production-part dimensional inspection, and as a complement to 3D printing, Perceptron has introduced the world's first green laser-line universal CMM scanner. Highly reflective materials such as machined aluminum and carbon fiber composites have always been a challenge for laser scanners, requiring part spraying with a powder coat, which severely inhibits its practical use on repetitive production parts. 
The new generation of ScanR CMM Laser Scanner represents a technological breakthrough solving many of the age-old application problems associated with laser scanning and provides the following enhanced performances:

Enhanced dynamic range (Wider coverage of color spectrum and reflectivity)
            
Improved material coverage (Carbon fiber, polished metal, plated metal)
            
Increased accuracy (Thinner laser line with higher signal to noise ratio)
            
Improved edge detection (Sub-pixel optimization)
            
Adjustable data acquisition rate for HQ (high quality) and HS (high speed) operation
            
Large field of view and depth of view 

ScanR is seamlessly integrated into Perceptron's TouchDMIS metrology software, offering a simple one-touch scanning interface and allowing initial user set-up using tactile-probe with subsequent sharing of the generated part coordinate system. Feature extraction from the generated point cloud allows automatic inspection of part features against nominal feature definitions selected from CAD. Production parts can be programmed to be inspected automatically with scanning zone and parameters adjusted per feature for data acquisition and cycle time optimization. 
Perceptron's CEO Jeff Armstrong states, "Perceptron has been a leader and innovator in the field of CMM laser scanning and measurement for more than 20 years. The launch of the new ScanR Universal CMM Laser Scanner extends our leadership position and fully exploits the business synergies of the COORD3 CMM and Next Metrology Software acquisitions executed earlier this year."
About Perceptron 
        Perceptron (NASDAQ: PRCP) supplies a comprehensive range of automated industrial metrology products and solutions to manufacturing organizations for dimensional gauging, dimensional inspection and 3D scanning. Products include 3D machine vision solutions, robot guidance, coordinate measuring machines, laser scanning, and advanced analysis software. Automotive, aerospace and other manufacturing companies globally rely on Perceptron's metrology solutions to assist in managing their complex manufacturing processes to improve quality, shorten product launch times and reduce costs. More than 900 systems, 12,000 Perceptron measuring sensors and over 3,000 COORD3 coordinate measuring machines are in active daily use worldwide. Headquartered in Plymouth, Michigan, Perceptron has subsidiary operations in Brazil, China, Czech Republic, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Singapore, Spain and the UK.
