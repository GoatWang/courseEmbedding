 LONDON & MADRID--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

      ACCIONA, a global infrastructure, water and renewable energy group, and

      Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. LP (together with its affiliates, "KKR"),

      a leading global investment firm, today announced a partnership to

      consolidate and develop one of the largest operating international

      renewable energy portfolios in the world.

    


      Under the agreement, KKR will invest in ACCIONA Energía International

      (AEI), the international renewable energy generation business of ACCIONA

      Energía, the Spanish multinational's energy division. KKR is making the

      investment from its global infrastructure fund.

    


      KKR is acquiring a one-third stake in AEI at a price of €417m and will

      help to fund future growth of the renewables portfolio. ACCIONA Energía

      will retain the remaining two-thirds of AEI.

    


      AEI will hold ACCIONA Energía's operating renewable assets outside

      Spain, comprising 2.3 GW in 14 countries, including US, Mexico,

      Australia, Italy, Portugal and South Africa, that will generate an

      estimated cash flow of €120m distributable to the partners. Most of the

      portfolio is comprised of wind farms, with a small number of solar

      (photovoltaic and thermal) assets.

    


      The investment gives an implied enterprise value to AEI of €2.6bn,

      including €1.3bn in equity and €1.3bn in net debt, making this one the

      world's largest financial transactions in the renewable energy sector to

      date.

    


      ACCIONA Energía will operate AEI's assets for 20 years under a

      management agreement. ACCIONA Energía will also give AEI a Right of

      First Offer on future renewable energy projects it develops within AEI's

      operational territory. ACCIONA Energía has a strong pipeline that can be

      accelerated through this partnership.

    


      The agreement is expected to be closed before the end of the year.

    


      The intention of both partners is to promote an international IPO

      through a YieldCo vehicle that will hold all or part of the assets of

      AEI. The agreement includes an earn-out consideration of an additional

      purchase price up to €50m based on the outcome of YieldCo's public

      offering.

    

Henry

      Kravis, co-Chairman and co-CEO of KKR, said: "This investment

      adds to our track record of building successful partnerships with

      corporates and families. I am really optimistic about the opportunity to

      partner with such a prominent renewable energy company and to help

      further develop what is already one of the largest operating renewable

      portfolios in the world."


José

      Manuel Entrecanales Domecq, Chairman and CEO of ACCIONA, said: "We

      are very pleased to have KKR on board as a long-term investment partner

      who understands and shares our ambition to grow in the renewable energy

      sector. Our strategic alliance will broaden our international reach, and

      it will transform the scale of what we can achieve."



      Jesús Olmos, Head of KKR Infrastructure in Europe and Head of KKR's

      operations in Spain, said: "Today's announcement represents another

      important step in the growth and diversification of our global

      infrastructure platform, following earlier investments in onshore wind,

      solar, water utilities, district heating, locomotive leasing and

      parking, in Europe and the US.


Rafael Mateo, CEO of ACCIONA Energía, said: "There is a strategic

      rationale for this partnership because of our complementary roles, where

      ACCIONA brings 20 years of experience in project development and a

      strong technological track record."

ECOFIN FUNDS

Ecofin Vista Long/Short Fund Limited is an open-ended hedge fund incorporated in the Cayman Islands.  The Fund's objective is to provide its investors with good absolute returns. The Fund invests in listed equity securities of global companies affected by an increasing drive towards energy efficiency, changes in energy policies and technological advances.  The fund invests mainly in North America, Europe and Asia into liquid listed equities.The Team takes a sustainable approach to investing.  They believe that adding a critical layer of ESG analysis to investment decisions, mitigating climate change-related tail risks through a fossil free portfolio and influencing corporate behaviour by engaging with companies' managements, will deliver the best risk adjusted returns for investors.  The Fund strategy is fundamental. It is managed with a low net exposure and is targeting returns that are uncorrelated to equity-markets, alongside moderate volatility. There is a strong emphasis on downside protection and preservation of capital. The investment process starts with top down macro analysis identifying key industry, regulatory, technology and environmental themes and concludes with fundamental bottom-up research, including ESG research, to assess specific company outlooks.The fund was established in December 2012, is unregulated and is available only to qualified investors.  Ecofin Global Renewable Infrastructure Fund Limited is an open-ended long only fund incorporated in the Cayman Islands. The fund invests in public equity securities of global companies owning predominantly carbon-free electricity generating assets. These companies offer a stable dividend due to the nature of the underlying assets and in addition offer the possibility of strong capex driven growth.  The underlying assets are typically fully contracted with high credit rated counterparties. The fund invests mainly in North America, Europe and Asia.The Team takes a sustainable approach to investing. They believe that adding a critical layer of ESG analysis to investment decisions and influencing corporate behaviour by engaging with companies' managements, will deliver the best risk adjusted returns for our investors.  In addition there is a recognition that long-term ownership, informed by fundamentals, of renewable power generating assets will contribute to the transition to a clean carbon economy.  The power generation sector accounts for 30% of global carbon emissions, is highly capital intensive, and therefore large corporate investment into renewable power generating assets is critical to achieve deployment plans needed. Increased renewable asset deployment leads directly to lower global carbon emissions.  The fund was established in November 2015, is unregulated and is available only to qualified investors.  For more information on these funds please contact us on info@ecofin.co.uk

The Interview - Bernard Lambilliotte, Ecofin: "We expect explosive development in China's renewable energy sectors"

Equity Long Short











Bernard Lambilliotte, chief investment officer of specialist utilities and infrastructure investor Ecofin, says the firm's newly-launched China Power & Infrastructure Fund is well poised to capitalise on the growth opportunities arising from China's USD586bn stimulus spending, much of which is being directed toward the infrastructure and energy space. GFM: What is the background to your company and fund? BL: Ecofin is a leading specialist in the utilities and infrastructure sectors worldwide, managing over USD3bn across a range of hedge funds, long-only funds and mandates, and invests through both public equities and private situations. The firm has a global team of 25 utility specialists, four of whom specialise in China. Ecofin was founded in 1992 and has offices in London, New York, Hong Kong and Geneva. The Ecofin China Power & Infrastructure Fund is the latest addition to Ecofin's global utilities investment platform. The fund pursues a long-biased long/short equity strategy and focuses on investment in large-cap, liquid public equities. It aims to generate compelling risk-adjusted returns in greater China and capitalise on the long-term growth potential in China's utility and infrastructure space. The fund seeks to generate absolute returns through dynamic portfolio construction and sector allocation based on macro and fundamental research. The fund was launched on July 1 with a starting capital of USD63m. Before the launch, Ecofin was already investing some of its assets in China though its global funds. GFM: Who are your key service providers? BL: The key service providers for the Ecofin China Power & Infrastructure Fund are Morgan Stanley International and Deutsche Bank as custodians and prime brokers, Citi Hedge Fund Services (Ireland) as administrator, Ernst & Young as auditor, and Simmons & Simmons in the UK and Maples and Calder in Cayman as legal advisers. GFM: Have there been any recent changes to the management team? BL: For the firm overall, the only change to the team has been the addition of David Silverstein in New York earlier this year. He came from Merrill Lynch where he was the no. 1 analyst in utilities high-yield debt as ranked by Institutional Investor for four of the past five years. He brings strong fixed-income expertise to our specialised utilities team. GFM: How and where do you distribute your funds? What is the profile of your current and targeted client base? BL: For the firm in general, we have long-term relationships across the investor spectrum. We have more than 200 current investors, spread fairly evenly between North America, Europe and Asia. Around 50 per cent of our hedge fund assets under management come from private banks and family offices, with the rest from funds of funds and institutional clients. We continue to work with a sovereign wealth fund, managing a custom long-only mandate, and we are developing strong relationships with more institutions, especially as we will reach the five-year anniversary for our Global Utilities Hedge Fund in October. The China Power & Infrastructure Fund will be distributed globally. GFM: What is your investment process? BL: As with our other funds, the China Power & Infrastructure investment team combines top-down macro analysis and bottom-up company fundamental research in making investment decisions and develops investment thesis using both catalyst events and mismatches between valuation and stock price. On the macro side, the investment team takes into consideration a range of factors such as economic activities, interest rates, commodity prices and the regulatory environment, and assesses the sensitivity of sub-sectors to each of these macro drivers. The team also leverages Ecofin's global platform as well as the firm's dedicated commodity research efforts. The investment team is split between London and Hong Kong and frequently meets with companies in China. Both absolute and relative valuation metrics are considered in making investment decisions. GFM: How do you generate ideas for your funds? BL: Ecofin's investment strategy in China focuses on sub-sector allocations. The team develops a detailed understanding of the sub-sectors and isolates key macro and fundamental drivers for each. The team also spends time looking at each company, including management visits, in order to understand key fundamental drivers. The combination of top-down and bottom-up views leads to a clearly articulated view on sub-sectors that inform our sub-sector allocations. We have often found our specialist angle enables us to establish views that differ from market consensus, and to identify catalysts and valuation arbitrage opportunities. GFM: What is your approach to managing risk? BL: The China Power & Infrastructure Fund employs Ecofin's existing risk management process and technology infrastructure. The risk team monitors the portfolio in terms of beta exposure, leverage and long-short ratios. Quantitative models are run to assess the portfolio's exposure to a range of factors such as the broader equity market movement and commodity prices. GFM: How has your recent performance compared with your expectations and track record? BL: The existing investments in China within the global hedge fund portfolio have delivered performance for the year to date more than 10 per cent higher than the broader Chinese market performance, but with 70 per cent of the volatility. Going forward we expect the fund to continue to produce superior risk-adjusted returns. GFM: What opportunities are you looking at right now? BL: The majority of China's ongoing USD586bn stimulus spending will go into the infrastructure and energy space, which accelerates long-term growth and also provides catalysts and dispersion among the sub-sectors. GFM: What events do you anticipate in your sector in the year ahead? BL: We will continue to witness the growth effect generated by China's stimulus spending efforts. We expect to see further market liberalisation of many-heavily regulated sectors, and tariff reforms as lower commodity prices and an inflationary environment create good conditions for a smoother transition to a more market-driven system. Furthermore, we expect explosive development in the renewable energy sectors. The new renewable energy development targets that the government is setting will drive China's domestic investment in the sector, while at the same time global demand will provide huge opportunities for China's low-cost equipment manufacturers. GFM: How will these developments affect your own portfolio? BL: We see exciting opportunities both on a long-biased basis in selective sectors but also dispersions among sub-sectors and companies. The portfolio will have a clear overweight toward sectors that we believe are likely to benefit from upward tariff adjustments and high growth, as well as winners in the renewable energy space. GFM: Are investors' expectations moving towards capital preservation? BL: Our investment universe covers the entire value chain from cyclical upstream suppliers to defensive downstream asset operators. The defensive portion of our universe, which consists of traditional utility companies, tends to outperform the market in downturns. Hence if we take a more conservative outlook on the market, we can still manage capital in a way that delivers superior risk-adjusted returns in the market. Overall we do believe that capital preservation and risk management have become more important since the credit crisis. However, the defensive characteristics of fund allocations in China, despite the rally this year, is reassuring in the sense that there is capital available to be allocated and any correction is unlikely to be too long or too deep. GFM: What differentiates you from other managers in your sector? BL: There is a lack of specialisation in China's equity market, and very few sector specialist funds at the moment. This provides a great opportunity for us to extract alpha on companies and industries. Ecofin has longstanding experience investing in the sectors worldwide and it is the same expertise and understanding of these industries that we are trying to apply to China. By investing in US and European companies that form part of the same value chain as Chinese companies, Ecofin forms a more rounded understanding of the demand supply situation for the Chinese companies. Our global commodity market research is also very relevant to their fundamentals. GFM: Do you foresee problems in raising mandates from investors through 2009? If so, what factors will drive investors back to your funds? BL: Investors are very cautious and many are facing liquidity constraints themselves. Capital is scarcer in the current environment, and liquidity is becoming a primary concern for investors. In this environment, Ecofin's China fund provides investors with dedicated exposure to China's infrastructure and utility space, high liquidity (monthly with 30 days' notice) and no financial leverage on capital. China, especially through our sectors, offers a rare spot of counter-cyclical and consistent growth as well as dispersion opportunity amid the global economic slowdown. We believe the supportive macro backdrop combined with Ecofin's specialist fundamental investment approach will enable us to achieve attractive returns. GFM: Do you have any plans for other product launches in the near future? BL: We continue to think about how we can generate profits for our investors, using our specialist investor knowledge across the industries that we cover and across capital structures. We believe there are some great opportunities in renewables, where we are already quite active, and in credit, where we have recently added to our team.

News Release









 








Wed, 07 June 2006

2006-027
Carlyle/Riverstone Renewable Energy Infrastructure Fund to Acquire Interest in US Renewables Group's Bottle Rock Power Corporation 

Los Angeles – US Renewables Group, LLC ("USRG"), Riverstone Holdings LLC ("Riverstone") and The Carlyle Group today announced that Carlyle/Riverstone Renewable Energy Infrastructure Fund I ("CRREIF") has agreed to acquire from USRG a significant stake in the Bottle Rock Power LLC, a California based company (Bottle Rock) whose principal asset is a 55 megawatt geothermal power station in the Geysers in Lake County. Under the terms of the convertible note and partnership interest purchase agreement, CRREIF intends to acquire an ownership stake and fund additional capital through a convertible note. This is one of the first investments from CRREIF’s $685 million renewable energy infrastructure fund.Bottle Rock plans to continue to refurbish the steam field and the facility and plans to restart the facility within the next six months. Before the end of 2007, Bottle Rock expects to produce approximately 260,000 megawatt hours per year of base load renewable power for sale to Pacific Gas and Electric under a long-term power purchase agreement. This is enough energy on average to supply electricity to over 21,000 California homes without the typical pollutants (SOX, NOX and VOCs) that result from the combustion of fossil fuels.The Bottle Rock facility was originally constructed, owned and operated by the California Department of Water Resources ("DWR") to service its own power consumption requirements. DWR closed the facility in 1990 and subsequently sold it to several investors in 2001 who formed Bottle Rock. USRG purchased a majority stake in Bottle Rock in late 2005."Working with Riverstone to bring Bottle Rock back on line is a winning combination for all involved, especially the citizens of California", stated Jim McDermott, Managing Partner of USRG.Stephen Schaefer, Riverstone Managing Director stated, "We are very excited to partner with USRG on this project. The affordable energy this project will produce demonstrates that renewable energy can and will have a growing impact on the energy mix in the U.S. and around the world"
* * * * * US Renewables GroupUS Renewables Group, LLC is a company organized to manage a series of private equity funds (including USRG Power and Biofuels Fund I, LP) that acquire, develop and operate renewable energy and clean fuel assets. The company owns and operates landfill methane, biomass, geothermal,, ethanol and biodiesel projects. USRG also invests in the development of projects or expansion opportunities at renewable energy facilities. USRG has offices in Los Angeles and New York.
