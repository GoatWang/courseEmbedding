Our Services : Hedge Fund Marketing : Fund Accounting Administration : Fund Management Solutions








 

























Our value added services  consist of many different pieces. As the hedge fund manager you need to focus  your attention on the buying and selling of securities. Why are hedge fund  managers outsourcing their back-office operations? Simple, focusing on an  in-house back office diverts their attention from their core responsibilities,  namely asset accumulation and building your franchise. Your investors will  appreciate the independent third-party verification of your funds’ operating  results by our CPAs at Strategic Asset Management.  Our individualized services packages tailored  to your fund or situation are crucial to satisfying your customers.   We  greatly reduce expenses and overhead for your fund by eliminating the need for  a large administrative and operational staff.

The Europe Hedge Fund 25

							Our first ranking of Europe's biggest single-manager hedge fund families shows assets concentrated among a few large players.
						







In Europe, just as in the U.S., 2003 was the year that
    institutional investment in hedge funds began to take off.
    After three years of dismal returns in their traditional bond
    and stock portfolios, British, Dutch, Scandinavian and Swiss
    pension funds and insurance companies turned their attention to
    alternative investments, whose value as noncorrelated holdings
    they craved even as equity markets worldwide recovered last
    year.
On the whole, continental European institutions increased
    their average strategic allocation to hedge funds to 3.2
    percent last year, double the level of 2001. According to a
    2003 study by Goldman Sachs International and Russell
    Investment Group, U.K. institutional investors boosted their
    average strategic allocation to hedge funds to 5.0 percent last
    year, compared with 1.8 percent in 2001. The increased interest
    in alpha-oriented investing swelled the coffers of the
    fast-growing group of hedge fund managers based in Europe,
    where asset growth is outstripping that of the hedge fund
    market as a whole, according to analysts.
Much of that money is run by the very biggest managers. The
    Europe Hedge Fund 25, Alpha's ranking of the biggest
    families of single-manager hedge funds based in Europe, which
    is published for the first time in this issue, shows that the
    25 top managers run $83 billion in assets, or about half of the
    total assets of $150 billion to $190 billion that industry
    analysts estimate Europe's hedge fund managers held at year-end
    2003.
Leading our list of Europe's biggest hedge fund groups is
    London-based Man Investments, which ran $7.4 billion in its AHL
    managed-futures program as of September 30, 2003. Man is
    followed by multistrategy firm GLG Partners, also in London,
    with $7.05 billion and Barclays Global Investors, which offers
    equity market-neutral and other hedge funds around the world
    and managed $6.5 billion. Rounding out the top five are
    Dublin-based Vega Asset Management I, with $5.8 billion, and
    UBS, a fund-of-funds giant that oversaw $4.8 billion in
    single-manager funds as of September.
The European hedge fund managers who are attracting assets
    fastest have one thing in common -- an increasingly
    sophisticated infrastructure to manage portfolios and risk. The
    big European hedge fund managers no longer work out of small
    offices in the smarter parts of London (and most of the members
    of the Europe Hedge Fund 25 are in London, with a few in Paris,
    one in Switzerland and one operating out of Sweden). They look
    like veteran investment managers rather than upstart boutiques,
    and they sport extensive staff to develop trading models,
    manage risk and handle back office chores.
"There is a growing belief that larger hedge fund managers
    should have an infrastructure commensurate with their size, and
    we can show a huge infrastructure -- we can tick those boxes,"
    says Mark Chambers, Man Investments' head of sales management
    for Europe. "This is attractive for people allocating $500
    million -- there are not many [managers] that can take that
    capacity."
Man benefited from 2003's markets, which aided systematic
    trend followers. The firm's AHL program returned 21 percent for
    the year, helping to boost assets by $1.7 billion from year-end
    2002. BGI added currency hedge funds to its product line last
    year. "What better place to harvest alpha than the currency
    markets?" asks Mark Fitzgerald, director of the Alternative
    Investment Group at BGI Europe. He points out that 90 percent
    of the foreign exchange market's participants -- such as
    central banks trying to support a currency or corporations
    hedging exposures -- are not trading for profit. That creates
    inefficiencies for fund managers such as BGI to exploit.
In our list we provide each manager's total assets under
    management as of September 30, 2003. Where possible, we also
    show assets at the individual fund level with 2003 returns net
    of fees through September 30, along with the fund's investing
    style. Asset totals reflect a firm's internally run,
    single-manager hedge funds and separate accounts but exclude
    funds of funds, funds managed by third parties, mutual funds
    and other long-only money, and private equity and venture
    capital. Assets run anywhere in the world are included, as long
    as the manager's ultimate parent company is located in Europe;
    we also count stand-alone money management units of U.S.
    companies if they are headquartered in Europe. We gathered our
    data through questionnaires completed by hedge fund managers
    and supplemented by extensive staff research. In some cases,
    asset totals or returns represent Alpha estimates.
    Additional data on the Europe Hedge Fund 25 and information on
    firms that completed our questionnaire but are too small to
    make the list this year are available on our Web site,
    www.institutionalinvestor.com/alpha.
Given the opacity of the hedge fund business, we may have
    missed some firms that belong on the Europe Hedge Fund 25. If
    we overlooked your firm, please e-mail us at
    hfeurope@iimagazine.com with your contact details so we can
    send you a questionnaire for the 2005 ranking.

This ranking was compiled by Institutional
    Investor's Alphaunder the direction of Assistant
    Managing Editor for Research Lewis Knox and Senior Editor Jane
    B. Kenney with Researchers Rachel Markus and Abel Lee.

The level of technical detail it provides serves a vital information need. We often pick up valuable insight in HFM before being told by our primes and external counsel.
