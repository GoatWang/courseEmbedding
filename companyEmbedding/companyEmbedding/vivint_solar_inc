History[edit]
In 1999, Keith Nellesen and Todd Pedersen co-founded APX Alarm Security Solutions in Provo, Utah.[9][10] At the time, the company sold and installed security systems.[9] Vivint began retaining customers in 2006 after it became a home monitoring provider.[9] The company expanded its service to Canada that year after signing a $75 million credit facility agreement with Goldman Sachs.[11] Goldman Sachs and APX Alarm completed another credit facility agreement worth $440 million in 2009.[11] That November, the company acquired a central alarm monitoring station from Criticom Monitoring Services, a subsidiary of Protection One, in St. Paul, Minnesota.[11] APX Alarm opened a new corporate headquarters in Provo, Utah a month later.[12]
APX Alarm Security Solutions rebranded as Vivint in February 2011.[9][13] The company completed a $565 million senior debt financing led by Goldman Sachs that month.[14] Vivint also received funding from Peterson Partners and Jupiter Partners.[14] The company launched Vivint Solar, a solar energy company, in 2011.[15] The company partnered with Alarm.com early that year to deploy severe weather alerts to their customer base.[16] Vivint was acquired by The Blackstone Group in September 2012.[17][18][19][20][21][22] In 2013, Forbes ranked the company 46th in its annual ranking of "America's Most Promising Companies."[23] Vivint acquired Smartrove, a wireless mesh networking technology provider, and began wireless broadband in August 2013.[24] In October, Inc. named the company the second most job creating private company in the United States.[25] In 2013, the company created the Vivint Fellows Program, a summer internship program at the Vivint Innovation Center.[26][27][28][29]
Vivint acquired the cloud storage startup Space Monkey, a company founded by Clint Gordon-Carroll and Alen Peacock in 2014.[30]
Vivint CEO Todd Pedersen appeared on the season finale of the CBS television show Undercover Boss in February 2015.[31]
The company opened a new monitoring center in Eagan, Minnesota in August 2015.
On October 26, 2015, Vivint acquired the naming rights to the Utah Jazz's home arena, renaming the building as Vivint Smart Home Arena. The contract will last for 10 years.[32]

The Vivint Skycontrol touchscreen smart home hub.


Vivint launched its own cloud-based smart home solution, in June 2014.[35] The system provides a centralized control, a smartphone application for remote access and learning algorithms that automatically pick up on a user's patterns.[36] In 2014, the touchscreen Vivint SkyControl panel received a CE Pro BEST Award for "new custom electronic products introduced in 2014."[37] In 2015, Vivint introduced the Vivint Doorbell Camera to its smart home solution.[38] The product allows consumers to see, hear and speak with visitors on their doorstep from any mobile device.[39] The product received a 2016 Electronic House Product of the Year award.[40]
In January 2016, Vivint announced partnerships with Amazon and Nest.[41] Vivint also announced Vivint Element, its own smart thermostat, and the Vivint Ping Camera, the first indoor camera with one-touch call out.[42]
Vivint Solar[edit]
In 2011, Vivint Inc. launched a standalone company, Vivint Solar,[4] as a solar electricity provider that designs, installs, and maintains residential photovoltaic systems.[15][43] The company offers solar panels via a power purchase agreement (PPA).[44] Vivint Solar owns, installs, and maintains solar panels on customers’ homes in exchange for customers agreeing to purchase the solar energy their panels produce. Customers do not pay for installation, but pay for energy that the panels produce, for the life of the contracts.[45] Vivint Solar is similar to other alternative solar companies like SolarCity, SunRun, and Sungevity. Its innovation in the field is the use of microinverters for each separate solar panel, allowing maximum production when some of the panels are in the shade.[46][47]
In October 2014, Vivint Solar made its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol VSLR.[48] In July 2015, SunEdison announced plans to purchase Vivint Solar for $2.2 billion.[49] This deal subsequently fell through, and Vivint Solar has initiated suit against SunEdison for breach of contract, with SunEdison filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization.[50]

Philanthropy[edit]
The Vivint Gives Back focuses on helping children with intellectual disabilities through intelligent products and services. Vivint employees and owners contribute time, money, and volunteer hours to perform services for these children.
In 2012, Vivint Gives Back Foundation was named the “Corporate Volunteer Program of the Year.” [55]
In April 2015, Vivint employees worked with the Feed My Starving Children organization to donate $47,000 and assemble 217,000 meal kits to feed children in Haiti. Vivint has donated a total of 800,000 meals, enough to feed more than 2,000 children for an entire year.[56]
In 2015, Vivint became the official safety sponsor for Autism Speaks, the nation’s largest autism organization.[57]
Vivint employees volunteer time and money to renovate homes for families who have children with intellectual disabilities. Employees install Vivint smart home technology in the homes and sensory rooms with developmental components such as swings, rock-climbing walls, reading nooks and art stations.[58] Since its creation in 2008, Vivint Gives Back has donated $9 million and more than 150,000 service hours.[59]
In February 2014, the company donated $2 million to the Utah Valley University to establish a professional sales program,[60] as well as a SMART Lab for marketing research.[61][62]
Legal issues[edit]
From 2009 through 2012 the company settled with the states of Arkansas,[63] Oregon,[64] Wisconsin[65] and Contra Costa County, California and agreed to conform its contracts to refrain from certain sales practices.[66]
In 2013, the company settled for $55,000 with the Kansas Attorney General, which accused sales agents of using deceptive practices while going door-to-door offering to install or replace home security systems. The agents also allegedly failed to advise the consumers of their rights under the Kansas Consumer Protection Act and did not disclose all costs associated with switching alarm system providers.[67]
The Ohio Attorney General settled with Vivint in 2013 following complaints alleging deceptive sales practices and the company's refusal to honor cancellation notices. Vivint agreed to comply with Ohio consumer laws and paid $50,000 in fines.[68] Also in 2013, Vivint agreed to an assurance of voluntary compliance in Nebraska. The company promised not to make any misrepresentations while engaging in sales. The company also donated $50,000 to two charities in Lancaster County, Nebraska.[69]
As of 2014, two federal class-action lawsuits were filed against Vivint for alleged violations of the TCPA.[70][71] In June 2014, Vivint agreed to a proposed settlement in Benzion which included a $6 million settlement fund.[72]

Philanthropy[edit]
The Vivint Gives Back focuses on helping children with intellectual disabilities through intelligent products and services. Vivint employees and owners contribute time, money, and volunteer hours to perform services for these children.
In 2012, Vivint Gives Back Foundation was named the “Corporate Volunteer Program of the Year.” [55]
In April 2015, Vivint employees worked with the Feed My Starving Children organization to donate $47,000 and assemble 217,000 meal kits to feed children in Haiti. Vivint has donated a total of 800,000 meals, enough to feed more than 2,000 children for an entire year.[56]
In 2015, Vivint became the official safety sponsor for Autism Speaks, the nation’s largest autism organization.[57]
Vivint employees volunteer time and money to renovate homes for families who have children with intellectual disabilities. Employees install Vivint smart home technology in the homes and sensory rooms with developmental components such as swings, rock-climbing walls, reading nooks and art stations.[58] Since its creation in 2008, Vivint Gives Back has donated $9 million and more than 150,000 service hours.[59]
In February 2014, the company donated $2 million to the Utah Valley University to establish a professional sales program,[60] as well as a SMART Lab for marketing research.[61][62]
Legal issues[edit]
From 2009 through 2012 the company settled with the states of Arkansas,[63] Oregon,[64] Wisconsin[65] and Contra Costa County, California and agreed to conform its contracts to refrain from certain sales practices.[66]
In 2013, the company settled for $55,000 with the Kansas Attorney General, which accused sales agents of using deceptive practices while going door-to-door offering to install or replace home security systems. The agents also allegedly failed to advise the consumers of their rights under the Kansas Consumer Protection Act and did not disclose all costs associated with switching alarm system providers.[67]
The Ohio Attorney General settled with Vivint in 2013 following complaints alleging deceptive sales practices and the company's refusal to honor cancellation notices. Vivint agreed to comply with Ohio consumer laws and paid $50,000 in fines.[68] Also in 2013, Vivint agreed to an assurance of voluntary compliance in Nebraska. The company promised not to make any misrepresentations while engaging in sales. The company also donated $50,000 to two charities in Lancaster County, Nebraska.[69]

History[edit]
In 1999, Keith Nellesen and Todd Pedersen co-founded APX Alarm Security Solutions in Provo, Utah.[9][10] At the time, the company sold and installed security systems.[9] Vivint began retaining customers in 2006 after it became a home monitoring provider.[9] The company expanded its service to Canada that year after signing a $75 million credit facility agreement with Goldman Sachs.[11] Goldman Sachs and APX Alarm completed another credit facility agreement worth $440 million in 2009.[11] That November, the company acquired a central alarm monitoring station from Criticom Monitoring Services, a subsidiary of Protection One, in St. Paul, Minnesota.[11] APX Alarm opened a new corporate headquarters in Provo, Utah a month later.[12]
APX Alarm Security Solutions rebranded as Vivint in February 2011.[9][13] The company completed a $565 million senior debt financing led by Goldman Sachs that month.[14] Vivint also received funding from Peterson Partners and Jupiter Partners.[14] The company launched Vivint Solar, a solar energy company, in 2011.[15] The company partnered with Alarm.com early that year to deploy severe weather alerts to their customer base.[16] Vivint was acquired by The Blackstone Group in September 2012.[17][18][19][20][21][22] In 2013, Forbes ranked the company 46th in its annual ranking of "America's Most Promising Companies."[23] Vivint acquired Smartrove, a wireless mesh networking technology provider, and began wireless broadband in August 2013.[24] In October, Inc. named the company the second most job creating private company in the United States.[25] In 2013, the company created the Vivint Fellows Program, a summer internship program at the Vivint Innovation Center.[26][27][28][29]
Vivint acquired the cloud storage startup Space Monkey, a company founded by Clint Gordon-Carroll and Alen Peacock in 2014.[30]
Vivint CEO Todd Pedersen appeared on the season finale of the CBS television show Undercover Boss in February 2015.[31]
The company opened a new monitoring center in Eagan, Minnesota in August 2015.
On October 26, 2015, Vivint acquired the naming rights to the Utah Jazz's home arena, renaming the building as Vivint Smart Home Arena. The contract will last for 10 years.[32]
Peter Thiel and Solamere Capital co-led a $100 million investment in Vivint in April 2016.[33] Solamere strategic investors include Hewlett Packard Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman, Sun Microsystems co-founder Scott McNealy and former Walmart CEO H. Lee Scott, Jr..[34]
Products and services[edit]




The Vivint Skycontrol touchscreen smart home hub.


Vivint launched its own cloud-based smart home solution, in June 2014.[35] The system provides a centralized control, a smartphone application for remote access and learning algorithms that automatically pick up on a user's patterns.[36] In 2014, the touchscreen Vivint SkyControl panel received a CE Pro BEST Award for "new custom electronic products introduced in 2014."[37] In 2015, Vivint introduced the Vivint Doorbell Camera to its smart home solution.[38] The product allows consumers to see, hear and speak with visitors on their doorstep from any mobile device.[39] The product received a 2016 Electronic House Product of the Year award.[40]
In January 2016, Vivint announced partnerships with Amazon and Nest.[41] Vivint also announced Vivint Element, its own smart thermostat, and the Vivint Ping Camera, the first indoor camera with one-touch call out.[42]
Vivint Solar[edit]
In 2011, Vivint Inc. launched a standalone company, Vivint Solar,[4] as a solar electricity provider that designs, installs, and maintains residential photovoltaic systems.[15][43] The company offers solar panels via a power purchase agreement (PPA).[44] Vivint Solar owns, installs, and maintains solar panels on customers’ homes in exchange for customers agreeing to purchase the solar energy their panels produce. Customers do not pay for installation, but pay for energy that the panels produce, for the life of the contracts.[45] Vivint Solar is similar to other alternative solar companies like SolarCity, SunRun, and Sungevity. Its innovation in the field is the use of microinverters for each separate solar panel, allowing maximum production when some of the panels are in the shade.[46][47]
In October 2014, Vivint Solar made its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol VSLR.[48] In July 2015, SunEdison announced plans to purchase Vivint Solar for $2.2 billion.[49] This deal subsequently fell through, and Vivint Solar has initiated suit against SunEdison for breach of contract, with SunEdison filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization.[50]

History[edit]
In 1999, Keith Nellesen and Todd Pedersen co-founded APX Alarm Security Solutions in Provo, Utah.[9][10] At the time, the company sold and installed security systems.[9] Vivint began retaining customers in 2006 after it became a home monitoring provider.[9] The company expanded its service to Canada that year after signing a $75 million credit facility agreement with Goldman Sachs.[11] Goldman Sachs and APX Alarm completed another credit facility agreement worth $440 million in 2009.[11] That November, the company acquired a central alarm monitoring station from Criticom Monitoring Services, a subsidiary of Protection One, in St. Paul, Minnesota.[11] APX Alarm opened a new corporate headquarters in Provo, Utah a month later.[12]
APX Alarm Security Solutions rebranded as Vivint in February 2011.[9][13] The company completed a $565 million senior debt financing led by Goldman Sachs that month.[14] Vivint also received funding from Peterson Partners and Jupiter Partners.[14] The company launched Vivint Solar, a solar energy company, in 2011.[15] The company partnered with Alarm.com early that year to deploy severe weather alerts to their customer base.[16] Vivint was acquired by The Blackstone Group in September 2012.[17][18][19][20][21][22] In 2013, Forbes ranked the company 46th in its annual ranking of "America's Most Promising Companies."[23] Vivint acquired Smartrove, a wireless mesh networking technology provider, and began wireless broadband in August 2013.[24] In October, Inc. named the company the second most job creating private company in the United States.[25] In 2013, the company created the Vivint Fellows Program, a summer internship program at the Vivint Innovation Center.[26][27][28][29]
Vivint acquired the cloud storage startup Space Monkey, a company founded by Clint Gordon-Carroll and Alen Peacock in 2014.[30]
Vivint CEO Todd Pedersen appeared on the season finale of the CBS television show Undercover Boss in February 2015.[31]
The company opened a new monitoring center in Eagan, Minnesota in August 2015.
On October 26, 2015, Vivint acquired the naming rights to the Utah Jazz's home arena, renaming the building as Vivint Smart Home Arena. The contract will last for 10 years.[32]
Peter Thiel and Solamere Capital co-led a $100 million investment in Vivint in April 2016.[33] Solamere strategic investors include Hewlett Packard Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman, Sun Microsystems co-founder Scott McNealy and former Walmart CEO H. Lee Scott, Jr..[34]
Products and services[edit]




The Vivint Skycontrol touchscreen smart home hub.


Vivint launched its own cloud-based smart home solution, in June 2014.[35] The system provides a centralized control, a smartphone application for remote access and learning algorithms that automatically pick up on a user's patterns.[36] In 2014, the touchscreen Vivint SkyControl panel received a CE Pro BEST Award for "new custom electronic products introduced in 2014."[37] In 2015, Vivint introduced the Vivint Doorbell Camera to its smart home solution.[38] The product allows consumers to see, hear and speak with visitors on their doorstep from any mobile device.[39] The product received a 2016 Electronic House Product of the Year award.[40]
In January 2016, Vivint announced partnerships with Amazon and Nest.[41] Vivint also announced Vivint Element, its own smart thermostat, and the Vivint Ping Camera, the first indoor camera with one-touch call out.[42]
Vivint Solar[edit]
In 2011, Vivint Inc. launched a standalone company, Vivint Solar,[4] as a solar electricity provider that designs, installs, and maintains residential photovoltaic systems.[15][43] The company offers solar panels via a power purchase agreement (PPA).[44] Vivint Solar owns, installs, and maintains solar panels on customers’ homes in exchange for customers agreeing to purchase the solar energy their panels produce. Customers do not pay for installation, but pay for energy that the panels produce, for the life of the contracts.[45] Vivint Solar is similar to other alternative solar companies like SolarCity, SunRun, and Sungevity. Its innovation in the field is the use of microinverters for each separate solar panel, allowing maximum production when some of the panels are in the shade.[46][47]
In October 2014, Vivint Solar made its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol VSLR.[48] In July 2015, SunEdison announced plans to purchase Vivint Solar for $2.2 billion.[49] This deal subsequently fell through, and Vivint Solar has initiated suit against SunEdison for breach of contract, with SunEdison filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization.[50]
Awards[edit]

Forbes List of America’s Best Employers: Vivint is one of 500 companies in the U.S. to make the inaugural Forbes list of “America’s Best Employers.” Vivint is also the top-ranked security and home automation company on the list and was named to Forbes list of “America’s Most Promising Companies” in 2013.[8]

The Stevie Awards selected Vivint as the Customer Service Department of the Year from more than 1,500 organizations of all sizes and in virtually every industry.
Vivint won a 2013 Inc. Hire Power Award from Inc. magazine, ranking at #2 on the publication’s list of winners. Inc. Magazine also named Vivint the #1 job-creating company in consumer products and services and the #1 job creator in Utah.[52]

Vivint Smart Home was the overall winner of the Business Intelligence Group’s inaugural Best Places to Work award contest.[54]

Philanthropy[edit]
The Vivint Gives Back focuses on helping children with intellectual disabilities through intelligent products and services. Vivint employees and owners contribute time, money, and volunteer hours to perform services for these children.
In 2012, Vivint Gives Back Foundation was named the “Corporate Volunteer Program of the Year.” [55]
In April 2015, Vivint employees worked with the Feed My Starving Children organization to donate $47,000 and assemble 217,000 meal kits to feed children in Haiti. Vivint has donated a total of 800,000 meals, enough to feed more than 2,000 children for an entire year.[56]
In 2015, Vivint became the official safety sponsor for Autism Speaks, the nation’s largest autism organization.[57]
Vivint employees volunteer time and money to renovate homes for families who have children with intellectual disabilities. Employees install Vivint smart home technology in the homes and sensory rooms with developmental components such as swings, rock-climbing walls, reading nooks and art stations.[58] Since its creation in 2008, Vivint Gives Back has donated $9 million and more than 150,000 service hours.[59]
In February 2014, the company donated $2 million to the Utah Valley University to establish a professional sales program,[60] as well as a SMART Lab for marketing research.[61][62]
Legal issues[edit]
From 2009 through 2012 the company settled with the states of Arkansas,[63] Oregon,[64] Wisconsin[65] and Contra Costa County, California and agreed to conform its contracts to refrain from certain sales practices.[66]
In 2013, the company settled for $55,000 with the Kansas Attorney General, which accused sales agents of using deceptive practices while going door-to-door offering to install or replace home security systems. The agents also allegedly failed to advise the consumers of their rights under the Kansas Consumer Protection Act and did not disclose all costs associated with switching alarm system providers.[67]
The Ohio Attorney General settled with Vivint in 2013 following complaints alleging deceptive sales practices and the company's refusal to honor cancellation notices. Vivint agreed to comply with Ohio consumer laws and paid $50,000 in fines.[68] Also in 2013, Vivint agreed to an assurance of voluntary compliance in Nebraska. The company promised not to make any misrepresentations while engaging in sales. The company also donated $50,000 to two charities in Lancaster County, Nebraska.[69]
As of 2014, two federal class-action lawsuits were filed against Vivint for alleged violations of the TCPA.[70][71] In June 2014, Vivint agreed to a proposed settlement in Benzion which included a $6 million settlement fund.[72]

History[edit]
In 1999, Keith Nellesen and Todd Pedersen co-founded APX Alarm Security Solutions in Provo, Utah.[9][10] At the time, the company sold and installed security systems.[9] Vivint began retaining customers in 2006 after it became a home monitoring provider.[9] The company expanded its service to Canada that year after signing a $75 million credit facility agreement with Goldman Sachs.[11] Goldman Sachs and APX Alarm completed another credit facility agreement worth $440 million in 2009.[11] That November, the company acquired a central alarm monitoring station from Criticom Monitoring Services, a subsidiary of Protection One, in St. Paul, Minnesota.[11] APX Alarm opened a new corporate headquarters in Provo, Utah a month later.[12]
APX Alarm Security Solutions rebranded as Vivint in February 2011.[9][13] The company completed a $565 million senior debt financing led by Goldman Sachs that month.[14] Vivint also received funding from Peterson Partners and Jupiter Partners.[14] The company launched Vivint Solar, a solar energy company, in 2011.[15] The company partnered with Alarm.com early that year to deploy severe weather alerts to their customer base.[16] Vivint was acquired by The Blackstone Group in September 2012.[17][18][19][20][21][22] In 2013, Forbes ranked the company 46th in its annual ranking of "America's Most Promising Companies."[23] Vivint acquired Smartrove, a wireless mesh networking technology provider, and began wireless broadband in August 2013.[24] In October, Inc. named the company the second most job creating private company in the United States.[25] In 2013, the company created the Vivint Fellows Program, a summer internship program at the Vivint Innovation Center.[26][27][28][29]
Vivint acquired the cloud storage startup Space Monkey, a company founded by Clint Gordon-Carroll and Alen Peacock in 2014.[30]
Vivint CEO Todd Pedersen appeared on the season finale of the CBS television show Undercover Boss in February 2015.[31]
The company opened a new monitoring center in Eagan, Minnesota in August 2015.
On October 26, 2015, Vivint acquired the naming rights to the Utah Jazz's home arena, renaming the building as Vivint Smart Home Arena. The contract will last for 10 years.[32]
Peter Thiel and Solamere Capital co-led a $100 million investment in Vivint in April 2016.[33] Solamere strategic investors include Hewlett Packard Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman, Sun Microsystems co-founder Scott McNealy and former Walmart CEO H. Lee Scott, Jr..[34]
Products and services[edit]




The Vivint Skycontrol touchscreen smart home hub.


Vivint launched its own cloud-based smart home solution, in June 2014.[35] The system provides a centralized control, a smartphone application for remote access and learning algorithms that automatically pick up on a user's patterns.[36] In 2014, the touchscreen Vivint SkyControl panel received a CE Pro BEST Award for "new custom electronic products introduced in 2014."[37] In 2015, Vivint introduced the Vivint Doorbell Camera to its smart home solution.[38] The product allows consumers to see, hear and speak with visitors on their doorstep from any mobile device.[39] The product received a 2016 Electronic House Product of the Year award.[40]
In January 2016, Vivint announced partnerships with Amazon and Nest.[41] Vivint also announced Vivint Element, its own smart thermostat, and the Vivint Ping Camera, the first indoor camera with one-touch call out.[42]
Vivint Solar[edit]
In 2011, Vivint Inc. launched a standalone company, Vivint Solar,[4] as a solar electricity provider that designs, installs, and maintains residential photovoltaic systems.[15][43] The company offers solar panels via a power purchase agreement (PPA).[44] Vivint Solar owns, installs, and maintains solar panels on customers’ homes in exchange for customers agreeing to purchase the solar energy their panels produce. Customers do not pay for installation, but pay for energy that the panels produce, for the life of the contracts.[45] Vivint Solar is similar to other alternative solar companies like SolarCity, SunRun, and Sungevity. Its innovation in the field is the use of microinverters for each separate solar panel, allowing maximum production when some of the panels are in the shade.[46][47]
In October 2014, Vivint Solar made its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol VSLR.[48] In July 2015, SunEdison announced plans to purchase Vivint Solar for $2.2 billion.[49] This deal subsequently fell through, and Vivint Solar has initiated suit against SunEdison for breach of contract, with SunEdison filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization.[50]
Awards[edit]

Forbes List of America’s Best Employers: Vivint is one of 500 companies in the U.S. to make the inaugural Forbes list of “America’s Best Employers.” Vivint is also the top-ranked security and home automation company on the list and was named to Forbes list of “America’s Most Promising Companies” in 2013.[8]
Vivint is the 2015 recipient of the Women’s Choice Award for America’s Best Home Security System.[51]

The Stevie Awards selected Vivint as the Customer Service Department of the Year from more than 1,500 organizations of all sizes and in virtually every industry.
Vivint won a 2013 Inc. Hire Power Award from Inc. magazine, ranking at #2 on the publication’s list of winners. Inc. Magazine also named Vivint the #1 job-creating company in consumer products and services and the #1 job creator in Utah.[52]
PCMag named Vivint Sky one of the Best Products of the Year in 2015.[41]
Consumers Digest rated Vivint a “Best Buy” in 2016.
Vivint won two Gold Stevie Awards and two Silver Stevie Awards for Customer Service in 2016.[53]
Vivint Smart Home was the overall winner of the Business Intelligence Group’s inaugural Best Places to Work award contest.[54]

Philanthropy[edit]
The Vivint Gives Back focuses on helping children with intellectual disabilities through intelligent products and services. Vivint employees and owners contribute time, money, and volunteer hours to perform services for these children.
In 2012, Vivint Gives Back Foundation was named the “Corporate Volunteer Program of the Year.” [55]
In April 2015, Vivint employees worked with the Feed My Starving Children organization to donate $47,000 and assemble 217,000 meal kits to feed children in Haiti. Vivint has donated a total of 800,000 meals, enough to feed more than 2,000 children for an entire year.[56]
In 2015, Vivint became the official safety sponsor for Autism Speaks, the nation’s largest autism organization.[57]
Vivint employees volunteer time and money to renovate homes for families who have children with intellectual disabilities. Employees install Vivint smart home technology in the homes and sensory rooms with developmental components such as swings, rock-climbing walls, reading nooks and art stations.[58] Since its creation in 2008, Vivint Gives Back has donated $9 million and more than 150,000 service hours.[59]
In February 2014, the company donated $2 million to the Utah Valley University to establish a professional sales program,[60] as well as a SMART Lab for marketing research.[61][62]
Legal issues[edit]
From 2009 through 2012 the company settled with the states of Arkansas,[63] Oregon,[64] Wisconsin[65] and Contra Costa County, California and agreed to conform its contracts to refrain from certain sales practices.[66]
In 2013, the company settled for $55,000 with the Kansas Attorney General, which accused sales agents of using deceptive practices while going door-to-door offering to install or replace home security systems. The agents also allegedly failed to advise the consumers of their rights under the Kansas Consumer Protection Act and did not disclose all costs associated with switching alarm system providers.[67]
The Ohio Attorney General settled with Vivint in 2013 following complaints alleging deceptive sales practices and the company's refusal to honor cancellation notices. Vivint agreed to comply with Ohio consumer laws and paid $50,000 in fines.[68] Also in 2013, Vivint agreed to an assurance of voluntary compliance in Nebraska. The company promised not to make any misrepresentations while engaging in sales. The company also donated $50,000 to two charities in Lancaster County, Nebraska.[69]
As of 2014, two federal class-action lawsuits were filed against Vivint for alleged violations of the TCPA.[70][71] In June 2014, Vivint agreed to a proposed settlement in Benzion which included a $6 million settlement fund.[72]

History[edit]
In 1999, Keith Nellesen and Todd Pedersen co-founded APX Alarm Security Solutions in Provo, Utah.[9][10] At the time, the company sold and installed security systems.[9] Vivint began retaining customers in 2006 after it became a home monitoring provider.[9] The company expanded its service to Canada that year after signing a $75 million credit facility agreement with Goldman Sachs.[11] Goldman Sachs and APX Alarm completed another credit facility agreement worth $440 million in 2009.[11] That November, the company acquired a central alarm monitoring station from Criticom Monitoring Services, a subsidiary of Protection One, in St. Paul, Minnesota.[11] APX Alarm opened a new corporate headquarters in Provo, Utah a month later.[12]
APX Alarm Security Solutions rebranded as Vivint in February 2011.[9][13] The company completed a $565 million senior debt financing led by Goldman Sachs that month.[14] Vivint also received funding from Peterson Partners and Jupiter Partners.[14] The company launched Vivint Solar, a solar energy company, in 2011.[15] The company partnered with Alarm.com early that year to deploy severe weather alerts to their customer base.[16] Vivint was acquired by The Blackstone Group in September 2012.[17][18][19][20][21][22] In 2013, Forbes ranked the company 46th in its annual ranking of "America's Most Promising Companies."[23] Vivint acquired Smartrove, a wireless mesh networking technology provider, and began wireless broadband in August 2013.[24] In October, Inc. named the company the second most job creating private company in the United States.[25] In 2013, the company created the Vivint Fellows Program, a summer internship program at the Vivint Innovation Center.[26][27][28][29]
Vivint acquired the cloud storage startup Space Monkey, a company founded by Clint Gordon-Carroll and Alen Peacock in 2014.[30]
Vivint CEO Todd Pedersen appeared on the season finale of the CBS television show Undercover Boss in February 2015.[31]
The company opened a new monitoring center in Eagan, Minnesota in August 2015.
On October 26, 2015, Vivint acquired the naming rights to the Utah Jazz's home arena, renaming the building as Vivint Smart Home Arena. The contract will last for 10 years.[32]
Peter Thiel and Solamere Capital co-led a $100 million investment in Vivint in April 2016.[33] Solamere strategic investors include Hewlett Packard Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman, Sun Microsystems co-founder Scott McNealy and former Walmart CEO H. Lee Scott, Jr..[34]
Products and services[edit]




The Vivint Skycontrol touchscreen smart home hub.


Vivint launched its own cloud-based smart home solution, in June 2014.[35] The system provides a centralized control, a smartphone application for remote access and learning algorithms that automatically pick up on a user's patterns.[36] In 2014, the touchscreen Vivint SkyControl panel received a CE Pro BEST Award for "new custom electronic products introduced in 2014."[37] In 2015, Vivint introduced the Vivint Doorbell Camera to its smart home solution.[38] The product allows consumers to see, hear and speak with visitors on their doorstep from any mobile device.[39] The product received a 2016 Electronic House Product of the Year award.[40]
In January 2016, Vivint announced partnerships with Amazon and Nest.[41] Vivint also announced Vivint Element, its own smart thermostat, and the Vivint Ping Camera, the first indoor camera with one-touch call out.[42]
Vivint Solar[edit]
In 2011, Vivint Inc. launched a standalone company, Vivint Solar,[4] as a solar electricity provider that designs, installs, and maintains residential photovoltaic systems.[15][43] The company offers solar panels via a power purchase agreement (PPA).[44] Vivint Solar owns, installs, and maintains solar panels on customers’ homes in exchange for customers agreeing to purchase the solar energy their panels produce. Customers do not pay for installation, but pay for energy that the panels produce, for the life of the contracts.[45] Vivint Solar is similar to other alternative solar companies like SolarCity, SunRun, and Sungevity. Its innovation in the field is the use of microinverters for each separate solar panel, allowing maximum production when some of the panels are in the shade.[46][47]
In October 2014, Vivint Solar made its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol VSLR.[48] In July 2015, SunEdison announced plans to purchase Vivint Solar for $2.2 billion.[49] This deal subsequently fell through, and Vivint Solar has initiated suit against SunEdison for breach of contract, with SunEdison filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization.[50]
Awards[edit]

Forbes List of America’s Best Employers: Vivint is one of 500 companies in the U.S. to make the inaugural Forbes list of “America’s Best Employers.” Vivint is also the top-ranked security and home automation company on the list and was named to Forbes list of “America’s Most Promising Companies” in 2013.[8]
Vivint is the 2015 recipient of the Women’s Choice Award for America’s Best Home Security System.[51]
Best Contact Centers in the World: Vivint's Customer Solutions Manager Matt Hansen won the Silver award for "Best Use of Social Media in a Contact Center" from the Global Contact Center.
The Stevie Awards selected Vivint as the Customer Service Department of the Year from more than 1,500 organizations of all sizes and in virtually every industry.
Vivint won a 2013 Inc. Hire Power Award from Inc. magazine, ranking at #2 on the publication’s list of winners. Inc. Magazine also named Vivint the #1 job-creating company in consumer products and services and the #1 job creator in Utah.[52]
PCMag named Vivint Sky one of the Best Products of the Year in 2015.[41]
Consumers Digest rated Vivint a “Best Buy” in 2016.
Vivint won two Gold Stevie Awards and two Silver Stevie Awards for Customer Service in 2016.[53]
Vivint Smart Home was the overall winner of the Business Intelligence Group’s inaugural Best Places to Work award contest.[54]

Philanthropy[edit]
The Vivint Gives Back focuses on helping children with intellectual disabilities through intelligent products and services. Vivint employees and owners contribute time, money, and volunteer hours to perform services for these children.
In 2012, Vivint Gives Back Foundation was named the “Corporate Volunteer Program of the Year.” [55]
In April 2015, Vivint employees worked with the Feed My Starving Children organization to donate $47,000 and assemble 217,000 meal kits to feed children in Haiti. Vivint has donated a total of 800,000 meals, enough to feed more than 2,000 children for an entire year.[56]
In 2015, Vivint became the official safety sponsor for Autism Speaks, the nation’s largest autism organization.[57]
Vivint employees volunteer time and money to renovate homes for families who have children with intellectual disabilities. Employees install Vivint smart home technology in the homes and sensory rooms with developmental components such as swings, rock-climbing walls, reading nooks and art stations.[58] Since its creation in 2008, Vivint Gives Back has donated $9 million and more than 150,000 service hours.[59]
In February 2014, the company donated $2 million to the Utah Valley University to establish a professional sales program,[60] as well as a SMART Lab for marketing research.[61][62]
Legal issues[edit]
From 2009 through 2012 the company settled with the states of Arkansas,[63] Oregon,[64] Wisconsin[65] and Contra Costa County, California and agreed to conform its contracts to refrain from certain sales practices.[66]
In 2013, the company settled for $55,000 with the Kansas Attorney General, which accused sales agents of using deceptive practices while going door-to-door offering to install or replace home security systems. The agents also allegedly failed to advise the consumers of their rights under the Kansas Consumer Protection Act and did not disclose all costs associated with switching alarm system providers.[67]
The Ohio Attorney General settled with Vivint in 2013 following complaints alleging deceptive sales practices and the company's refusal to honor cancellation notices. Vivint agreed to comply with Ohio consumer laws and paid $50,000 in fines.[68] Also in 2013, Vivint agreed to an assurance of voluntary compliance in Nebraska. The company promised not to make any misrepresentations while engaging in sales. The company also donated $50,000 to two charities in Lancaster County, Nebraska.[69]
As of 2014, two federal class-action lawsuits were filed against Vivint for alleged violations of the TCPA.[70][71] In June 2014, Vivint agreed to a proposed settlement in Benzion which included a $6 million settlement fund.[72]

Vivint Smart Home and Vivint Solar Partner to Provide The Most Comprehensive Smart Home Experience
SPECIAL TO CES – LAS VEGAS (January 4, 2017) – Today at CES 2017, Vivint Smart Home, the leading smart home services provider in North America, and Vivint Solar, Inc. (NYSE: VSLR), one of the leading residential solar providers in North America, announced a strategic partnership to offer a single, unified experience that will allow customers to intelligently manage both the generation and consumption of energy in the home.
“Before long, every home will be intelligent, and we believe solar energy is a key component of the smart home experience,” said Alex Dunn, president of Vivint Smart Home. “When Vivint entered the solar business in 2011, our ultimate goal was to bring together the benefits of smart home technology and solar power. We’re excited to begin making this vision a reality.”
According to a study from Research Now, there is a strong consumer preference for bundling a residential solar energy system with smart home technology.* The study found approximately half of consumers interested in installing a rooftop solar energy system were also interested in buying a smart home system and associated products.
Later this year, new Vivint Solar customers will be able to receive an integrated energy management system from Vivint Smart Home, including a Vivint SkyControl panel, Vivint Element thermostat and home sensors, at no additional cost.
Intelligence optimizes energy usage
Sky, Vivint’s smart home assistant, is the artificial intelligence at the heart of a Vivint smart home, providing intelligent management of both energy production and consumption. For instance, Sky uses data from sensors throughout the home to automatically adjust the temperature based on a homeowner’s specific activity and preferences. Sky also provides intelligent recommendations to increase the home’s energy efficiency, such as suggesting on temperate days that the homeowner open windows and turn off the air conditioner.
The combination of solar energy generation and energy conservation from a smart home allows customers to build the foundation for a net zero home that can produce as much energy as it consumes.
“This strategic partnership makes Vivint Solar the first and only residential solar company to actually deliver on the full smart home equation,” said David Bywater, CEO of Vivint Solar. “Combining rooftop solar power with smart learning capabilities puts the ambitious goal of a net zero energy home within striking distance for the masses. It enhances a homeowner’s ability to manage energy and save money, which is exactly what they want in their smart home experience.”
Combined energy savings
Customers can get combined energy savings from a Vivint smart home that reduces energy usage and by receiving power from their solar system oftentimes at lower rates than their variable utility rate. For example, a smart thermostat can help reduce heating and cooling costs by 10-15 percent, and Vivint Solar customers typically save on average 10-30 percent on their current energy costs. Studies also show that a home with a typical residential solar energy system is valued up to $15,000 higher than it would be without the solar energy system.**
Single app to manage everything
Vivint Smart Home and Vivint Solar customers will be able to see both their solar production and home energy usage in a single view from their Vivint Smart Home app. They can get insights into current and historical energy usage, visibility of near real-time power generation and intelligent management capabilities to automatically conserve energy.
Customers with this combined solution can also upgrade to a full smart home system, including smart locks, lights, cameras and more.
Intelligent energy management from Vivint Solar and Vivint Smart Home will be available later this year. For more information about Vivint Solar, visit www.vivintsolar.com.

FAQ


What is privacy mode? 

Privacy mode allows you to temporarily disable your camera’s remote viewing and recording capabilities. While in Privacy mode, your camera will display a blue screen on your online account and mobile app. 



What if my Fixed Camera isn’t showing up on my online account or my phone? 

Go to the cameras section on your online account center. If you can’t see any cameras listed, contact our Customer Care team via chat or email for assistance.

If you can see cameras listed there but not on your mobile app, log out and back in and it should show up.




Can I install a new camera or move my old one? 

Normally a Vivint Smart Home Professional will install and position your Vivint Ping cameras, but after installation you can move your Ping cameras wherever you want. If you move your cameras or receive a new camera and would like to learn how to, you can always install them yourself.



What do I do if my recording schedules aren’t working?

If your camera’s schedules are not working, make sure that your camera is working and that the light on the front is green.
If everything is working, check and make sure that your schedules are turned on in the Recording Schedules section for your cameras.
If they still aren’t working, you may need to delete and recreate your recording schedules.
 If you have a SkyControl panel, you will manage your recording schedules online by using your Automation settings, which can be accessed by clicking on the gear icon.



How can I set up recording schedules for my camera? 

You’ll set up all recording schedules online.
If you have a SkyControl panel, you will manage your recording settings online by creating custom rules. Click here to learn how.
If you have a Go!Control panel, click here for a tutorial that will teach you how to create recording schedules for your cameras.



What do all the lights mean on my Fixed Camera?

Red and Green (solid interchanging): Wireless network connection failed

Red (solid): No local or Internet connection

Green (Solid): Full internet connection with Alarm.com IP

Green (blinking): local network connection with local IP address

Blue(solid) Privacy Mode Enabled




What if my camera isn't displaying correctly online or on my phone? 

If your Fixed Camera status is not displaying correctly on your phone or the website, check the following to fix the issue:

Go to your camera to make sure it is operational and that the LED is green. If it isn’t, unplug and re-plug your camera and wait about 5 minutes to see if it turns green.

Check your camera on both your app and online account. If both are working, then the issue is already resolved. 

If only your computer, app, or neither is working, contact our Customer Care team via chat or email for assistance.

Account FAQs




FAQ


Where can I manage my account information?

Vivint provides a comprehensive online account center that gives you access to all of your important account information, billing history, and account documents, as well as online access to control your Vivint system. Click here to log in.
To learn more about Vivint's online account center, click here.



How can I obtain a certificate for my home insurance?

Many insurance companies will give you a discount just for having a security and home automation system installed. However, they often require a certificate proving the installation has taken place. To obtain this certificate, simply download the certificate from your online account center. Once you log in, go to the 'Resources' tab and click on 'Insurance Certificate' in the top right corner. You can download the certificate there and email it to your insurance agent or print the certificate. 



Can I obtain the certificate before my installation date?

No. Installation must take place before we issue a certificate.



Do I need an alarm permit for my Vivint system? 

It depends. The easiest way to know if you need an alarm permit or not is to search your local government’s website. If your city does require a permit, almost all cities make these forms available online. However, as a courtesy, you can call customer support and we will mail your form to you, if you need one. If you get the form through us, the process will take between 7 and 10 working days.



How much does a permit cost?

The price of a permit varies depending on your municipality. Visit your local government website for more information.



When I get notified that my alarm has been triggered, how do I find out if it was an actual emergency or a false alarm?

You will need to contact your local police department. However, in most cases, if the alarm that is triggered signifies an actual emergency, the authorities will notify the Central Monitoring Station that will then contact you.



Are your call centers accredited?

Yes. Our call center is CSAA Certified as a Five Diamond Central Station. It has also been identified by the International Customer Management Institute (ICMI) as one of the top 50 call centers in all of North America. As a company, we received the J.D. Power and Associates award for "An Outstanding Customer Service Experience" two years running--in 2008 and 2009. Vivint is also part of the Security Industry Alarm Coalition and the Electronic Life Safety, Security & Systems Professionals organization.



Why do you use a door-to-door approach?

We have chosen to market our products using the door-to-door method because it allows us to use a personal approach. When our sales reps come to your door, they can talk to you and customize a system that meets your exact needs.



How do I verify the sales rep who visited my home actually works for your company?

Verifying that the Vivint sales rep visiting your home is legitimate is easy. Simply follow this link and enter the rep's badge ID. If you feel someone is misrepresenting Vivint, please call us and we will help you get verification.



How do I get a permit?

You are responsible for obtaining a permit. The easiest way to get one is to search your local government website. Almost all cities make these forms available online. However, as a courtesy, you can call Customer Care and we will mail your form to you. This process will take between 7 and 10 business days.



Why do I need to fill out a permit application?

Depending on where you live, you may be required to register your alarm with your local authorities or obtain a permit so that emergency personnel can be dispatched to your home.



Do I need to be at home for my installation? 

Yes. Our technicians walk through your home to find the best way to set up your system. This means an adult member of the family must be present.



What happens when I move?

At Vivint, we are dedicated to excellence in customer service. That's why we make moving as simple as possible. You can review our move policy here.




What is your cancellation policy?

You can review our cancellation policy here.




Can I transfer my account? 

Yes, you can transfer your account. If the person taking over your account wants to sign a new, 42-month agreement, the transfer is free. Otherwise, they can take over the remainder of your agreement and pay a $100 transfer fee. For more information about account transfers, click here.



If my original cancellation date has passed and I'm unable to fulfill my agreement, what are my options?

We're sorry to hear you're considering canceling. However, we understand that life happens and circumstances change. You can review our cancellation policy here.

CLEANSOLAR is all about transparency. 

That's why we created the CLEANSOLAR FAQs - to ensure that you have all the facts when it comes to rooftop solar. 


Answer:

There is very little maintenance required for photovoltaic solar installations on your roof. Seasonal rain rinses dust off of Bay Area roofs and many homeowners will hose down their panels once in the summer. If any debris should fall onto the panels, it should be removed, but that’s about it. Solar panels (modules) are made of durable materials and don’t have any moving parts, so they can...

FAQ


Do I ever need to replace the battery in my SkyControl?

No. The battery in the SkyControl is a rechargeable, backup battery. If your panel loses power due to being unplugged or a home power outage, the backup battery will keep your system running. However, you may receive a panel low battery alert if your panel goes without power for too long. You can acknowledge the alert to stop the panel from beeping. The battery will recharge once power is restored. 
In rare cases, the backup battery in the SkyControl can go bad. This is evident if the low battery alert appears immediately after a power loss. In this case, contact support for assistance in replacing the battery. 



What rights do panel admin users have?

Granting admin rights to a user will allow them to access settings on the panel, including users, panel security and networking options. It will also allow the user to create custom rules and notifications via the mobile app



Why is my panel beeping?

You're panel will beep for two reasons. When the system is armed and a door or window is opened, the panel will begin to beep a countdown for you to disarm the system before an alarm is triggered. 
The other reason that your panel would beep is to alert you of a notification. Click here to learn about panel alerts and notifications.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
