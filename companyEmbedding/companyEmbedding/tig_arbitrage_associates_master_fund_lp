      the proposed merger. Shareholders may also choose to withhold quorum by 
      not voting on the merger and thus delay their vote on the proposed 
      merger until a later date.
    

      “We believe the current offer price of $21 per share is grossly unfair 
      to current shareholders. Shareholders are not being paid a fair value 
      for the margin expansion opportunity they already own, much less a 
      premium. The transfer of value to Signet shareholders and the lopsided 
      sharing of deal synergies could not be seen more clearly than by 
      comparing the $1.4B of value accretion that Signet shareholders have 
      enjoyed versus the $286M premium paid for Zale shares. Said 
      another way, Signet holders have benefited 5x the amount that Zale 
      holders have,” said Drew Figdor, Portfolio Manager.
    

A Turnaround Story Cut Short? Right Deal – Wrong Price


      Our analysis of the proposed merger identified several problematic 
      issues in the valuation of Zale and the negotiation of the agreement, 
      that led us to oppose the transaction. These are summarized below and 
      more fully discussed in our forthcoming proxy statement:
    

The Proposed Merger Consideration is below the 
      Standalone Value of Zale


      The day before the announcement of the Merger, Zale was trading at an 
      EV/EBITDA multiple of 9.1x 2016 analyst estimates. Using Management’s 
      now disclosed 2016 base case estimate, this would imply a $31 share 
      price. Using management’s alternative [downside] case, would imply a $25 
      share price.
    

Use of an Inappropriate Share Price Benchmark


      TIG Advisors believes that the trading price of the shares of Zale at 
      the time of the announced transaction were significantly undervalued. 
      Had Management’s projections been known to investors ahead of the 
      Merger’s announcement, we believe investors would have valued the shares 
      well in excess of recent trading ranges. We also believe Golden Gate’s 
      announced intention to register shares for sale adversely affected the 
      Company’s market value.
    

Use of Stale Financial Information


      Zale and its financial advisor, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith 
      Incorporated (“BofA Merrill Lynch”) relied on stale financial forecasts 
      prepared some time before July 31, 2013 in evaluating the fairness to 
      the Company’s stockholders of Signet’s offer. Considering that actual 
      results were already exceeding projections this would have yielded a 
      materially different fairness analysis. We view this as a substantial 
      oversight.
    

Failure to Include Equitable Share of Potential 
      Synergies


      TIG Advisors believes a proper analysis would examine Zale and Signet 
      from the perspective of the market’s view of what value was created and 
      shared by the transaction. By our estimate, the $1.4 billion increase in 
      Signet’s market capitalization on the date of the Merger announcement 
      compares to a $286 million premium paid for depressed Zale shares.
    

All-Cash Merger Consideration Deprives Zale 
      Stockholders of the Value of Synergies and Upside Potential


      TIG Advisors believes that the agreed upon transaction with Signet was 
      flawed from the outset because it neither recognized the value of the 
      turnaround already well underway nor did it split the value of deal 
      synergies with Zale holders in an equitable manner. TIG Advisors 
      believes that both issues could have been addressed with an equity 
      component to the consideration.
    

Shortcomings in the BofA Merrill Lynch Fairness 
      Analysis


      We have detailed above our view that the fairness analysis improperly 
      relied upon stale financial forecasts that have not been updated through 
      two quarterly reports following the entry into the Merger Agreement. We 
      further believe that BofA Merrill Lynch included a number of irrelevant 
      companies and transactions in order to formulate a comparable group that 
      would support the Merger.
    

We Believe The Process That Led To The Signing Of The Merger Was 
      Flawed


      TIG Advisors believes the merger consideration is inadequate and fails 
      to provide full and fair value for the Shares and that the sale process 
      was tainted by a number of conflicts of interest.
    

      Our key concerns are summarized below, and more fully described in our 
      proxy statement:
    

Potential Conflicts of Interest with Golden Gate


      We believe the inclusion of Golden Gate’s representative on the board of 
      directors’ negotiation committee created an inherent conflict of 
      interest between a 23% stockholder looking to sell its stake and a Board 
      decision over evaluating the right course to maximize shareholder value.
    

      TIG Advisors believes that consistent with its fiduciary duties to all 
      shareholders of Zale and with understanding of the inherent conflicts of 
      interest, the Board should have negotiated a transaction that requires 
      the vote of a “majority of the minority” of Zale shareholders for the 
      approval of the Merger.
    

Potential Conflict with Bank of America


      While actively engaged with Zale in the potential lead underwriting role 
      for Golden Gate’s Zale shares, BofA Merrill Lynch was simultaneously 
      soliciting business from Signet by analyzing the merits of a potential 
      acquisition of Zale for $17 - $21 per share, making a presentation on 
      October 7, 2013.
    

      We believe that BofA Merrill Lynch was conflicted and not in the best 
      position to provide a “fairness opinion” on the proposed Merger given 
      its prior involvement with Signet. We question why BofA Merrill Lynch 
      and not any of the numerous other nationally recognized investment banks 
      were retained.
    

The Company’s Lack of Sale Process


      According to Zale’s Proxy Statement, the Company never explored interest 
      in the sale of the Company prior to receiving Signet’s unsolicited 
      offer, then never sought other bidders or “shopped” the Company in any 
      way during the course of its negotiations with Signet to seek competing 
      offers and has entered into a merger agreement with Signet that does not 
      contain a “go-shop” provision that would allow the Company to ensure 
      that value is being maximized.
    

Potential Conflict with Management


      Amidst discussions with Signet as to the sale of the Company, Signet 
      indicated to Theo Killion, CEO of Zale, that it was Signet’s preference 
      for Mr. Killion to continue leading the Zale division of Signet post 
      transaction closing. These indications happened both in early January 
      and in early February, according to the Proxy Statement. In our view, 
      Signet’s stated interest in retaining Mr. Killion served to further 
      deepen the level of conflicts replete throughout the process.
    

Alternatives Exist For Maximizing Stockholder Value


      TIG Advisors believes shareholders should vote against the current deal 
      with Signet given the lack of compelling value delivered versus Zale’s 
      standalone value. While TIG Advisors believes there is minimal or no 
      downside risk given the strong financial results reported by the Company 
      following the Merger announcement, shareholders concerned by the 
      perceived downside have another option available.
    

      Zale shareholders can withhold quorum and thus delay their vote on the 
      Merger until a later date (potentially into the beginning of 2015) when 
      more is known about Zale’s results and the fair value Zale shareholders 
      should receive in the Merger can be better estimated. Zale shareholders 
      are essentially long a very valuable “put option” with a strike price of 
      $21 and an expiration date of February 19, 2015.
    

      Our reading of the Merger Agreement indicates to us that should enough 
      shareholders withhold quorum by not voting their shares for, against or 
      abstain with respect to the approval of the Merger, then under the 
      provisions of the Merger Agreement, Zale’s Board may postpone or adjourn 
      the Special Meeting to solicit additional proxies for the purpose of 
      obtaining the requisite stockholder approval.
    

      In the event that shareholders approve the acquisition, we intend to 
      pursue an appraisal claim against Signet to compel additional 
      consideration for our interest but we believe that all Zale holders 
      deserve a fair price for their shares.
    

We encourage shareholders of Zale to recognize the Company’s true 
      value and join us in voting AGAINST the 
      Merger.


      Shareholders do not have to take any action at this time. TIG Advisors 
      has filed a preliminary proxy statement with the SEC, and intends to 
      send proxy material to Zale stockholders.
    

      TIG Advisors has retained Olshan Frome Wolosky LLP as its legal counsel, 
      and MacKenzie Partners, Inc. as its proxy solicitor, to support its 
      efforts in opposing the proposed merger at the Special Meeting.
