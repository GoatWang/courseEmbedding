July 25, 2017 07:30 ET
Significance of Gold Bar Acquisitions for US Gold Corp. and McEwen Mining Inc.


POINT ROBERTS, WA--(Marketwired - July 25, 2017) - Investorideas.com, a global news source covering leading sectors including mining stocks, released a snapshot of two gold mining companies that have acquired property in the Gold Bar area of Nevada, both North and South and the potential at stake for US Gold Corp. (NASDAQ: USAU) and McEwen Mining Inc (NYSE: MUX).According to a report in Science Daily that looked at a model for how Nevada gold deposits formed, "This Nevada gold boom started in 1961 with the discovery of the Carlin gold mine, near the town of Carlin, at a spot where the early westward-moving prospectors missed the gold because it was too fine-grained to be readily seen. Since the 1960s, geologists have found clusters of these "Carlin-type" deposits throughout northern Nevada. They constitute, after South Africa, the second largest concentration of gold on Earth."A rising player in the Nevada gold play, US Gold Corp. (NASDAQ: USAU) announced earlier in July that it had completed the acquisition of the Gold Bar North (GBN) mining claims. The Gold Bar North Property consists of 49 unpatented lode mining claims in Eureka County, Nevada. The only financial obligation required to maintain these claims are the annual federal and county fees.GBN is a highly prospective gold exploration property, identified and staked by Dave Mathewson. GBN consists of 49 unpatented lode mining claims situated in Eureka County, Nevada, in Sections 29, 30, 31 and 32, Township 23 North, Range 49 East, and Sections 5 and 6, Township 22 North, Range 49 East, Mount Diablo Base Line and Meridian.Dave Mathewson, Vice President and Head of Nevada Exploration for US Gold Corp. believes the GBN property is a continuation of the same trend and system as Keystone and therefore synergistic. Keystone is positioned on the prolific Cortez gold trend, one of the world's leading gold producing regions.In their recent press release he also stated, "The Gold Bar district is highly prospective with McEwen Mining's (NYSE: MUX) Gold Bar Development Project and Gold Bar South property nearby."Mihaela Iancu, Head of Investor Relations at McEwen Mining Inc. (NYSE: MUX) talked to Investor Ideas about the Gold Bar Project. "Gold Bar is a proposed mine project which, if constructed, would consist of a conventional open pit mine with an oxide gold heap leach recovery circuit. The property is located in the southern Roberts Mountains within the Battle Mountain-Eureka-Cortez gold trend, approximately 30 miles northwest of Eureka, in Eureka County, central Nevada and covers an area of 37 square miles (97 sq km) contained in 1,196 claims. The property was previously mined from 1987 to 1994 by Atlas Precious Metals Inc. The Gold Bar project is currently in the permitting phase, which commenced in 2012. In October, 2015 we published a Feasibility Study on the property.""Highlights of the proposed Gold Bar mine:- Owner operated open pit mine with run-of-mine oxide heap leach processing;- Estimated initial capital expenditures - $60 million;- Pay-back period - 3 years at $1,150/oz Au, 2 years at $1,300;- After-tax IRR - 20% at $1,150/oz Au, 36% at $1,300/oz Au;- Average annual production of 75,000 oz Au at cash cost of $728/oz Au;- 6 years Life of Mine ore production of 13 M tons at a diluted grade of 0.032 opt (1.1 gpt) Au- Updated in-pit resource estimate: 611,000 oz Measured & Indicated and 111,000 oz Inferred;- Total operating cash costs per tonne of ore - $18.06 (mining - $11.71, processing - $5.3, general & administrative - $1.05)."Mihaela notes, "The Gold Bar South Property was purchased in 2016 due to its close proximity to the Gold Bar Project. Its near surface deposit is approximately 3 miles (5 km) to the southeast of the main ore bodies of the Gold Bar Complex. The deposit is similar to other sedimentary-rock hosted gold deposits in Nevada in that disseminated and oxidized gold mineralization occurs in the Webb Formation and Devils Gate Limestone lithologies. Our objective is to develop Gold Bar South into a satellite resource that can contribute to the production from the Gold Bar Mine by adding to the later years of mine production. The company intends to initiate permitting on Gold Bar South after a positive Record of Decision is delivered for Gold Bar. The property also has additional exploration potential beyond its current 120,000 oz Au resources."Mihaela also went on to say, "For 2017 we allocated $2 million for the completion of the permitting activities at Gold Bar. The Bureau of Land Management has incorporated the public comments from the Draft Environmental Impact Statement into the Final Environmental Impact Statement. Permitting continues to advance as planned and remains on schedule, with a Record of Decision expected in Q3, 2017. $37.2 million are allocated for initial stage construction to start in 2017, immediately upon obtaining the permit. Completion of the initial stage construction of the mine will take about 10-12 months and will provide us with a ramp-up production of 9,000 oz Au in 2018, further to which production at Gold Bar will move to 75,000 oz Au per year."

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
