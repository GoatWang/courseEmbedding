Willdan Appoints Stacy McLaughlin Chief Financial Officer

 ANAHEIM, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

      Willdan Group, Inc. ("Willdan") (NASDAQ:WLDN) today announced the

      promotion of Stacy B. McLaughlin to Chief Financial Officer, effective

      November 15, from her previous position as the company's Compliance

      Manager.

    


      "Stacy is a proactive, results-oriented professional who has extensive

      knowledge of the financial drivers and performance of each of our

      business segments and has worked closely with everyone on our finance

      and leadership teams," said Thomas Brisbin, Chief Executive Officer.

      "During the past three years, she has made a key contribution to the

      Company in designing and implementing processes and procedures to

      streamline accounting functions and improve efficiencies. Stacy has

      already proven her capabilities and I am confident she will make a

      strong contribution to our future success as our Chief Financial

      Officer."

    


      Stacy brings nearly 10 years of experience in finance, SEC reporting and

      compliance. As Compliance Manager at Willdan, she has been responsible

      for overseeing all aspects of the financial reporting process, including

      analyzing the balance sheets and income statements of each business

      segment. Prior to joining Willdan, Mrs. McLaughlin was, from 2009 to

      2010, Senior Associate at Windes & McClaughry Accountancy Corporation

      and, from 2004 to 2009, Senior Audit Associate at the public accounting

      firm KPMG, LLP. In this position, she planned, coordinated and completed

      financial statement audits for companies in the engineering services

      sector, among others. McLaughlin has a Masters in Accounting from the

      University of Southern California and BS from the University of Arizona.

    


      Brisbin continued, "I would also like to thank Kimberly Gant for the

      many contributions she has made to Willdan as our Chief Financial

      Officer over the past 6 years and wish her well in all of her future

      endeavors."
