History[edit]
The brand was introduced by Mars in the UK in 1960, named by Peter Phillips (known as Peter Pfeffer at the time), the winner of a competition that won him £5, as Opal Fruits.[1] The four original flavours were strawberry, lemon, orange, and lime. Opal Fruits were introduced in the United States in 1967[1] as M&M's Fruit Chewies and later, in the 1970s, Starburst. Originally, Starburst came in the same flavours as Opal Fruits. Subsequently, its first variant, Sunshine Flavors, was released and was later renamed "Tropical Opal Fruits". In Europe, lemon and lime were combined to become "Lemon and Lime" to make room for a blackcurrant flavour.
The brand name Opal Fruits was phased out in the UK, followed by Ireland in 1998 in order to standardize the product in a globalised marketplace.[2] In 2008, the supermarket chain Asda revived the original Opal Fruits in the UK for a period of 12 weeks starting 10 May 2008.[3] On 6 October 2008 Mars acquired Wrigley,[4] and it transferred Mars' non-chocolate candy brands, including Starburst, to the Wrigley subsidiary.[5] The original flavours are now branded "Original Fruits", and Starburst now comes in several assortments: Limited Edition Retro Fruits, Tropical, Baja California, Sour, Strawberry Mix, Berries & Creme, Very Berry and Fruity Slushies. Among the additional flavors are Strawberry Lemonade Chill, Citrus Slush, Cherry Splash, Blue Raspberry Rush Kiwi, Banana, Plum, Blueberry, Passion Fruit, Blackberry, Raspberry, Strawberry-Banana, Mango, Melon, Tropical Punch, Green Apple, Blue Raspberry, Watermelon, Mixed Berries & Cream, Peaches & Cream, Orange Cream, and Strawberry & Cream. Europe also has the "Sour" assortment, which includes Apple, Cherry, Pineapple and Raspberry, as well as Strawberry Mix. As of early 2010 it was decided that Strawberry was the most popular flavor in the United Kingdom. Lime is also very popular within this demand.
Starburst in the UK is vegan, its packaging and website clearly stating "Suitable for Vegetarians", and also does not contain any artificial colors or flavors.[6] In the US, Starburst contains non-vegetarian gelatin in its ingredients.




The UK 'Opal Fruits' limited edition branding


Lime Starburst made a comeback in 2007 as a limited-edition "retro" flavour in packages of the "Baja" version, while the range in the UK was further extended with a version named Starburst Choozers. These lozenge shaped chews have a liquid fruit juice centre, and come packaged with the tag line "The chews that ooze." Each packet contains three flavours; Orange & Mango, Raspberry & Orange, and Pineapple & Orange.
As of August 2016, the advertising slogan for Starburst is "Unexplainably Juicy".[1]
Marketing[edit]
In the 1970s Opal Fruits were well known in the UK for their advertising tag line "Opal Fruits—made to make your mouth water!" (slogan coined by Murray Walker[7]). The full advertising jingle was "Opal Fruits—made to make your mouth water/Fresh with the tang of citrus/four refreshing fruit flavours/orange, lemon, strawberry, lime/Opal Fruits—made to make your mouth water!"
Starburst has been marketed in several ways, including a marketing tie-in for the movie Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest where they replaced Kiwi Banana and Tropical Punch with Royal Berry Punch.
In 2007 a commercial for Starburst's Berries and Creme flavor went viral.[8] The commercial, referred to as "Berries and Creme" or as "The Little Lad Dance", stars Jack Ferver as a man dressed in Victorian/Georgian clothing expressing his excitement for the candy's flavor by performing an impromptu song and dance routine.[9] The commercial received praise for its style from Advertising Age.[10][11] In an interview with Adweek Ferver commented that the commercial took over twelve hours to film and that he had to wear the full costume in 80 degree weather.[12]
Other varieties[edit]
Starburst also exists in the form of jellybeans, lollipops, gummies, hard candy, candy canes, candy corn, popsicles, gum, and lip gloss (the latter in a partnership with Lip Smackers).

History[edit]
The brand was introduced by Mars in the UK in 1960, named by Peter Phillips (known as Peter Pfeffer at the time), the winner of a competition that won him £5, as Opal Fruits.[1] The four original flavours were strawberry, lemon, orange, and lime. Opal Fruits were introduced in the United States in 1967[1] as M&M's Fruit Chewies and later, in the 1970s, Starburst. Originally, Starburst came in the same flavours as Opal Fruits. Subsequently, its first variant, Sunshine Flavors, was released and was later renamed "Tropical Opal Fruits". In Europe, lemon and lime were combined to become "Lemon and Lime" to make room for a blackcurrant flavour.
The brand name Opal Fruits was phased out in the UK, followed by Ireland in 1998 in order to standardize the product in a globalised marketplace.[2] In 2008, the supermarket chain Asda revived the original Opal Fruits in the UK for a period of 12 weeks starting 10 May 2008.[3] On 6 October 2008 Mars acquired Wrigley,[4] and it transferred Mars' non-chocolate candy brands, including Starburst, to the Wrigley subsidiary.[5] The original flavours are now branded "Original Fruits", and Starburst now comes in several assortments: Limited Edition Retro Fruits, Tropical, Baja California, Sour, Strawberry Mix, Berries & Creme, Very Berry and Fruity Slushies. Among the additional flavors are Strawberry Lemonade Chill, Citrus Slush, Cherry Splash, Blue Raspberry Rush Kiwi, Banana, Plum, Blueberry, Passion Fruit, Blackberry, Raspberry, Strawberry-Banana, Mango, Melon, Tropical Punch, Green Apple, Blue Raspberry, Watermelon, Mixed Berries & Cream, Peaches & Cream, Orange Cream, and Strawberry & Cream. Europe also has the "Sour" assortment, which includes Apple, Cherry, Pineapple and Raspberry, as well as Strawberry Mix. As of early 2010 it was decided that Strawberry was the most popular flavor in the United Kingdom. Lime is also very popular within this demand.
Starburst in the UK is vegan, its packaging and website clearly stating "Suitable for Vegetarians", and also does not contain any artificial colors or flavors.[6] In the US, Starburst contains non-vegetarian gelatin in its ingredients.




The UK 'Opal Fruits' limited edition branding


Lime Starburst made a comeback in 2007 as a limited-edition "retro" flavour in packages of the "Baja" version, while the range in the UK was further extended with a version named Starburst Choozers. These lozenge shaped chews have a liquid fruit juice centre, and come packaged with the tag line "The chews that ooze." Each packet contains three flavours; Orange & Mango, Raspberry & Orange, and Pineapple & Orange.
As of August 2016, the advertising slogan for Starburst is "Unexplainably Juicy".[1]
Marketing[edit]
In the 1970s Opal Fruits were well known in the UK for their advertising tag line "Opal Fruits—made to make your mouth water!" (slogan coined by Murray Walker[7]). The full advertising jingle was "Opal Fruits—made to make your mouth water/Fresh with the tang of citrus/four refreshing fruit flavours/orange, lemon, strawberry, lime/Opal Fruits—made to make your mouth water!"
Starburst has been marketed in several ways, including a marketing tie-in for the movie Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest where they replaced Kiwi Banana and Tropical Punch with Royal Berry Punch.
In 2007 a commercial for Starburst's Berries and Creme flavor went viral.[8] The commercial, referred to as "Berries and Creme" or as "The Little Lad Dance", stars Jack Ferver as a man dressed in Victorian/Georgian clothing expressing his excitement for the candy's flavor by performing an impromptu song and dance routine.[9] The commercial received praise for its style from Advertising Age.[10][11] In an interview with Adweek Ferver commented that the commercial took over twelve hours to film and that he had to wear the full costume in 80 degree weather.[12]
Other varieties[edit]
Starburst also exists in the form of jellybeans, lollipops, gummies, hard candy, candy canes, candy corn, popsicles, gum, and lip gloss (the latter in a partnership with Lip Smackers).

History[edit]
The brand was introduced by Mars in the UK in 1960, named by Peter Phillips (known as Peter Pfeffer at the time), the winner of a competition that won him £5, as Opal Fruits.[1] The four original flavours were strawberry, lemon, orange, and lime. Opal Fruits were introduced in the United States in 1967[1] as M&M's Fruit Chewies and later, in the 1970s, Starburst. Originally, Starburst came in the same flavours as Opal Fruits. Subsequently, its first variant, Sunshine Flavors, was released and was later renamed "Tropical Opal Fruits". In Europe, lemon and lime were combined to become "Lemon and Lime" to make room for a blackcurrant flavour.
The brand name Opal Fruits was phased out in the UK, followed by Ireland in 1998 in order to standardize the product in a globalised marketplace.[2] In 2008, the supermarket chain Asda revived the original Opal Fruits in the UK for a period of 12 weeks starting 10 May 2008.[3] On 6 October 2008 Mars acquired Wrigley,[4] and it transferred Mars' non-chocolate candy brands, including Starburst, to the Wrigley subsidiary.[5] The original flavours are now branded "Original Fruits", and Starburst now comes in several assortments: Limited Edition Retro Fruits, Tropical, Baja California, Sour, Strawberry Mix, Berries & Creme, Very Berry and Fruity Slushies. Among the additional flavors are Strawberry Lemonade Chill, Citrus Slush, Cherry Splash, Blue Raspberry Rush Kiwi, Banana, Plum, Blueberry, Passion Fruit, Blackberry, Raspberry, Strawberry-Banana, Mango, Melon, Tropical Punch, Green Apple, Blue Raspberry, Watermelon, Mixed Berries & Cream, Peaches & Cream, Orange Cream, and Strawberry & Cream. Europe also has the "Sour" assortment, which includes Apple, Cherry, Pineapple and Raspberry, as well as Strawberry Mix. As of early 2010 it was decided that Strawberry was the most popular flavor in the United Kingdom. Lime is also very popular within this demand.
Starburst in the UK is vegan, its packaging and website clearly stating "Suitable for Vegetarians", and also does not contain any artificial colors or flavors.[6] In the US, Starburst contains non-vegetarian gelatin in its ingredients.




The UK 'Opal Fruits' limited edition branding


Lime Starburst made a comeback in 2007 as a limited-edition "retro" flavour in packages of the "Baja" version, while the range in the UK was further extended with a version named Starburst Choozers. These lozenge shaped chews have a liquid fruit juice centre, and come packaged with the tag line "The chews that ooze." Each packet contains three flavours; Orange & Mango, Raspberry & Orange, and Pineapple & Orange.
As of August 2016, the advertising slogan for Starburst is "Unexplainably Juicy".[1]
Marketing[edit]
In the 1970s Opal Fruits were well known in the UK for their advertising tag line "Opal Fruits—made to make your mouth water!" (slogan coined by Murray Walker[7]). The full advertising jingle was "Opal Fruits—made to make your mouth water/Fresh with the tang of citrus/four refreshing fruit flavours/orange, lemon, strawberry, lime/Opal Fruits—made to make your mouth water!"
Starburst has been marketed in several ways, including a marketing tie-in for the movie Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest where they replaced Kiwi Banana and Tropical Punch with Royal Berry Punch.
In 2007 a commercial for Starburst's Berries and Creme flavor went viral.[8] The commercial, referred to as "Berries and Creme" or as "The Little Lad Dance", stars Jack Ferver as a man dressed in Victorian/Georgian clothing expressing his excitement for the candy's flavor by performing an impromptu song and dance routine.[9] The commercial received praise for its style from Advertising Age.[10][11] In an interview with Adweek Ferver commented that the commercial took over twelve hours to film and that he had to wear the full costume in 80 degree weather.[12]
Other varieties[edit]
Starburst also exists in the form of jellybeans, lollipops, gummies, hard candy, candy canes, candy corn, popsicles, gum, and lip gloss (the latter in a partnership with Lip Smackers).

The brand was introduced by Mars in the UK in 1960, named by Peter Phillips (known as Peter Pfeffer at the time), the winner of a competition that won him £5, as Opal Fruits.[1] The four original flavours were strawberry, lemon, orange, and lime. Opal Fruits were introduced in the United States in 1967[1] as M&M's Fruit Chewies and later, in the 1970s, Starburst. Originally, Starburst came in the same flavours as Opal Fruits. Subsequently, its first variant, Sunshine Flavors, was released and was later renamed "Tropical Opal Fruits". In Europe, lemon and lime were combined to become "Lemon and Lime" to make room for a blackcurrant flavour.
The brand name Opal Fruits was phased out in the UK, followed by Ireland in 1998 in order to standardize the product in a globalised marketplace.[2] In 2008, the supermarket chain Asda revived the original Opal Fruits in the UK for a period of 12 weeks starting 10 May 2008.[3] On 6 October 2008 Mars acquired Wrigley,[4] and it transferred Mars' non-chocolate candy brands, including Starburst, to the Wrigley subsidiary.[5] The original flavours are now branded "Original Fruits", and Starburst now comes in several assortments: Limited Edition Retro Fruits, Tropical, Baja California, Sour, Strawberry Mix, Berries & Creme, Very Berry and Fruity Slushies. Among the additional flavors are Strawberry Lemonade Chill, Citrus Slush, Cherry Splash, Blue Raspberry Rush Kiwi, Banana, Plum, Blueberry, Passion Fruit, Blackberry, Raspberry, Strawberry-Banana, Mango, Melon, Tropical Punch, Green Apple, Blue Raspberry, Watermelon, Mixed Berries & Cream, Peaches & Cream, Orange Cream, and Strawberry & Cream. Europe also has the "Sour" assortment, which includes Apple, Cherry, Pineapple and Raspberry, as well as Strawberry Mix. As of early 2010 it was decided that Strawberry was the most popular flavor in the United Kingdom. Lime is also very popular within this demand.
Starburst in the UK is vegan, its packaging and website clearly stating "Suitable for Vegetarians", and also does not contain any artificial colors or flavors.[6] In the US, Starburst contains non-vegetarian gelatin in its ingredients.




The UK 'Opal Fruits' limited edition branding


Lime Starburst made a comeback in 2007 as a limited-edition "retro" flavour in packages of the "Baja" version, while the range in the UK was further extended with a version named Starburst Choozers. These lozenge shaped chews have a liquid fruit juice centre, and come packaged with the tag line "The chews that ooze." Each packet contains three flavours; Orange & Mango, Raspberry & Orange, and Pineapple & Orange.
As of August 2016, the advertising slogan for Starburst is "Unexplainably Juicy".[1]
Marketing[edit]
In the 1970s Opal Fruits were well known in the UK for their advertising tag line "Opal Fruits—made to make your mouth water!" (slogan coined by Murray Walker[7]). The full advertising jingle was "Opal Fruits—made to make your mouth water/Fresh with the tang of citrus/four refreshing fruit flavours/orange, lemon, strawberry, lime/Opal Fruits—made to make your mouth water!"
Starburst has been marketed in several ways, including a marketing tie-in for the movie Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest where they replaced Kiwi Banana and Tropical Punch with Royal Berry Punch.
In 2007 a commercial for Starburst's Berries and Creme flavor went viral.[8] The commercial, referred to as "Berries and Creme" or as "The Little Lad Dance", stars Jack Ferver as a man dressed in Victorian/Georgian clothing expressing his excitement for the candy's flavor by performing an impromptu song and dance routine.[9] The commercial received praise for its style from Advertising Age.[10][11] In an interview with Adweek Ferver commented that the commercial took over twelve hours to film and that he had to wear the full costume in 80 degree weather.[12]
Other varieties[edit]
Starburst also exists in the form of jellybeans, lollipops, gummies, hard candy, candy canes, candy corn, popsicles, gum, and lip gloss (the latter in a partnership with Lip Smackers).

PRODUCT LINE










MPEG2 DIGITAL HEAD END DELIVERY

 


Since its inception in 1986, our company has been on the forefront of video transportation technologies. Today the company is widely recognized as a leader in the business of reception, control and transmission of television RF signals over coax, fiber and/or Ethernet IP networks. Starburst MPEG2 QAM Modulators and Processors encode any video/audio source into a broadcast quality (HD or DIGITAL SD) signal that can now be sent to an unlimited amount of MPEG2 or MPEG4 TVs.

Prime markets for the Starburst head end line include Lodging, Institutions, Bars, Restaurants, Office Buildings, Sports Venues, College Campus, Security Cameras, Digital Signage and Multi Dwelling facilities. Starburst is available with built in PRO IDIOM and/or in CLEAR QAM.

 









CHANNEL DELETION/INSERTION

 


Looking to totally eliminate a channel and then re insert another in its place? Looking to eliminate noise in your fiber optic system, looking to be rid of PCS interference and/or create a BRICK WALL LOW PASS or HI PASS FILTER?

We can create a FILTER for just about any application!

Each unit is built to BROADCAST QUALITY specification & individually tested to comfortably meet your expectations.

 









UL LISTED POWER & AMPLIFICATION

 


“ONE OF A KIND”
We are proud to introduce the FIRST EVER…… UL LISTED Quasi Square Wave 60-90V Non-Standby POWER SUPPLY for the Broadband MDU marketplace!

As broadband networks expand and become more complex each and every day, the demand for top-of-the-line products that meet UL requirements increases exponentially. Our UL listed SB-UL6090-15PS is equipped with a unique “AUTO SHUT DOWN” feature that detects if and when the unit is running too hot. The SB-UL6090-15PS also comes in a Rainproof Type 3R Enclosure that allows it to be used outdoors like most traditional power supplies. However, its UL listing gives the operator the cost savings and flexibility to place the unit indoors as well!

Our UL LISTED DUAL POWERED RF AMPLIFIER model SB-1025-2W is a high performance DUAL POWERED RF distribution amplifier designed for use in multi dwelling buildings. One of the unique features of this amplifier is that if no AC voltage is available, the unit can be powered by CATV 60-90 Volts if it is present on the cable.

 









CUSTOMER PREMISE MoCA 2.0  

 


All Starburst MoCA 2.0 Passives come with NEXT LEVEL LAYERED CIRCUIT BOARD Technology!  Each product has been carefully designed to optimize the balance between the traditional performance requirements in the 5-1000 MHz spectrum along with the additional requirements necessary for the proper communication of the MoCA signals in the 1125-1675 MHz spectrum. ALL STARBURST TECHNOLOGIES MoCA 2.0 Customer Premise products come with our ground breaking 10 year repair warranty.

Other popular Starburst Customer Premise items are our Point of Entry FILTERS and BYPASS Drop AMPLIFIERS. The Filters come stand alone and/or with built in ground block (and optional surge suppression) which reduces the required installation components and increases network reliability. The BYPASS Drop Amplifiers raise the signal level in the forward direction to overcome cable and splitter losses and provide proper signal levels at the receiving device.  Like our MoCA 2.0 DROP PASSIVES all Starburst MoCA 2.0 FILTERS and BYPASS AMPS come with a 10 year replacement warranty. 

 


PDI Communications is an equal opportunity, drug-free employer.
