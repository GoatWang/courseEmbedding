NeuroDerm






NeuroDerm is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company developing next-generation treatments for central nervous system (CNS) disorders that will make a clinically meaningful difference in patients’ lives. NeuroDerm’s technology enables new routes of administration for existing drugs that overcome their current deficiencies and achieve enhanced clinical efficacy.





			NeuroDerm is the first to develop liquid levodopa (LD), the gold standard treatment for Parkinson’s disease, thus enabling for the first time continuous sub-cutaneous (SC) administration of this drug. By overcoming its biggest deficiency – short half life – NeuroDerm’s products should transform patients’ lives, offering them clinical benefits that can only be obtained today by undergoing highly invasive surgery.

Our Solutions









			NeuroDerm is developing a pipeline of products that address deficiencies in current treatments for the growing population of moderate to severe Parkinson’s disease patients. NeuroDerm is the first to develop a liquid formulation of levodopa/carbidopa (LD/CD). Based on this novel formulation, the company has developed a line of LD/CD products administered through a patch-pump or small belt pump to deliver a continuous, controlled dose of LD/CD. The LD/CD line of products includes: ND0612L for moderate Parkinson’s disease patients, ND0612H for severe Parkinson’s disease patients and ND0680 for the small subset of severe Parkinson’s disease patients whose symptoms have advanced to a more acute stage, requiring even higher doses of LD/CD.

Now enrolling for clinical trials






Investigating the effectiveness and safety of ND0612, an investigational medicine for patients with advanced Parkinson’s Disease





ND0612
ND0612 is a novel liquid formulation of levodopa/carbidopa (LD/CD) aimed to reduce motor complications in patients with advanced Parkinson’s Disease.
ND0612 is designed in low-dose (ND0612L) and high-dose (ND0612H), administered subcutaneously (just under the skin) through a mini-pump, enabling 24-hour continuous LD/CD administration.
In a phase II placebo controlled study, ND0612L was shown to maintain steady, therapeutic levodopa plasma concentrations that were associated with major changes in clinical parameters such as “OFF time” reduction when added to optimal oral standard of care.1
In a phase IIa study, ND0612H was shown to reach higher levodopa steady plasma levels,2 indicating that it may provide an effective alternative to current treatments requiring surgery, such as deep brain stimulation and LD/CD Intestinal Gel.
		




ND0612 CLINICAL STUDIES
TREATMENT DURATION: 4-52 WEEKS
YOU MAY BE ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THESE STUDIES IF YOU ARE:

30 to 80 years old
Taking at least 4 doses/day of levodopa
Experiencing a minimum of 2-2.5 hours of “OFF” time per day with predictable early morning “OFF” periods






IF YOU OR A LOVED ONE ARE BEING TREATED FOR ADVANCED PARKINSON’S DISEASE, CONSIDER ND0612 CLINICAL STUDIES
Most medications for Parkinson’s Disease begin to lose effectiveness after several years of use. Without access to an effective medication, patients with Parkinson’s Disease begin to experience more “OFF” periods, which have a significant impact on daily life. Treatments that reduce “OFF time” are needed.
Pharmaceutical companies use research studies like the ones for which we are enrolling patients to learn more about investigational medications before they are made available to the public. The results of these studies will provide more information about the investigational medication’s effect on Parkinson’s Disease. By taking part in these studies, you may contribute to the development of medications for Parkinson’s Disease patients in the future.
		




ND0612 CLINICAL STUDIES
ND0612 clinical studies are evaluating an investigational Parkinson’s Disease treatment that uses a pump system to deliver an infusion of the investigational medication, a solution of levodopa and carbidopa, through a small needle that is inserted beneath the skin.
By using an infusion to deliver the investigational medication continuously, it could offer more effective control of “OFF” periods than oral medications. Researchers designed these clinical studies to protect the rights and welfare of those participating. Independent review boards reviewed and approved these research protocols and related materials (e.g. explanatory documents and informed consents), and will monitor the progress of the studies.
Currently, only patients who participate in research studies like these can receive the investigational medication. It is not approved by regulatory agencies for the treatment of Parkinson’s Disease. As with any medical research study, the investigational medication is not guaranteed to help your Parkinson’s Disease.
		




WHAT ARE THE RISKS RELATED TO THESE STUDIES?

Though the investigational medication has been studied before, and was found to be tolerable, it is possible you could experience side effects. Because research studies can affect the health and safety of participants, you will be closely monitored during the study if you participate in these studies.
To date, 138 people (healthy volunteers and patients with Parkinson’s Disease) were treated with continuous subcutaneous infusion of the study drug.

The most commonly reported adverse effects were local skin infusion site reactions. Nearly all subjects reported subcutaneous nodules at the infusion sites, which were generally not associated with pain. The nodules resolved spontaneously within an average of 2-3 months. Approximately 50% of patients reported mild and transient pain, erythema (superficial reddening of the skin) and edema (a condition characterized by an excess of watery fluid collecting in the cavities), at the infusion sites, which resolved spontaneously.
Other common adverse events included local hemorrhage (bruising) at the infusion sites and headache.
The study drug contains levodopa and carbidopa which are known to be associated with adverse events, the most common being dyskinesia (abnormal involuntary movements), nausea, vomiting, dizziness, low blood pressure upon rising, headache, sleeplessness, dry mouth, anxiety and constipation.
Serious side effects that are known to be associated with LD/CD medications are hallucinations and delusions, unexpected falling asleep (e.g. during driving), unusual urges and high fever and confusion related to medication withdrawal.

					Full Description



NeuroDerm Ltd., incorporated on March 18, 2003, is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company. The Company is engaged in developing treatments for central nervous system (CNS) disorders, primarily Parkinson's disease, as well as other CNS diseases. The Company's Parkinson's disease product candidates are drug-device combination products, with devices and varying levodopa (LD)/carbidopa (CD) or apomorphine concentrations and dosages. Its liquid LD/CD and apomorphine formulations include ND0612H, ND0612L and ND0701.The Company is developing ND0612H for the treatment of patients suffering from severe Parkinson's disease. ND0612H is designed to provide continuous subcutaneous delivery of an adjustable dose LD/CD formulation in order to reduce the motor complications associated with orally administered LD/CD by maintaining controlled and steady plasma levodopa concentration levels. It is developing ND0612L for the treatment of patients at the moderate stage of Parkinson's disease that can no longer control motor complications with oral levodopa. Each dose of ND0612L is designed to be continuously administered subcutaneously to such patients for around period through the CRONO ND belt pump. In addition, the Company is designing ND0612L to allow patients to receive LD/CD overnight. The Company is also working with its third-party medical device manufacturers on a smaller, patch-pump device for use with ND0612L.The Company has also designed ND0701, which is an apomorphine-based product. ND0701 is for patients suffering from Parkinson's disease, may be used mostly by patients suffering from high motor fluctuations and not responding well to LD/CD. ND0701 is administered through a patch pump. The Company is also developing a product candidate, ND0801, to treat cognition disorders associated with CNS diseases, such as attention deficit disorder (ADD)/attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. ND0801's reformulation is a non-addictive nicotine-based treatment administered through a transdermal patch.The Company's delivery devices include CRONO ND and CRONO Twin ND belt pumps. CRONO ND is a fixed-dose belt pump that operates around the clock and can be preprogrammed to the desired delivery profile of LD/CD. CRONO ND is used to administer its ND0612L and ND0701 drug formulations. CRONO ND consists of two parts: a preprogrammed pump device, which regulates the delivery rate of the drug, and a single-use, disposable cartridge, which holds its liquid reformulation of LD/CD and is connected to an infusion tube. CRONO Twin ND is an adjustable belt pump. It has engaged third-party firms to design and manufacture a patch pump for the administration of ND0612L and ND0701.

Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation, NeuroDerm Ltd. - M&A Call


NeuroDerm Reportedly Is Mulling A Sale
Jun 12 17
NeuroDerm Ltd. (NasdaqGM:NDRM) soared nearly 12% amid reports, citing Bloomberg, which said that the company is mulling a sale and is working with a financial advisor on this. NeuroDerm has attracted interest from other big drug makers with a presence in the central nervous system business, but valuation remains the biggest hurdle, some reports noted.


NeuroDerm Ltd. Announces Final Data from Trial 006; European Medicines Agency Accepts Design of NeuroDerm's ND0612 Phase III iNDiGO Efficacy Trial
Jun 9 17
NeuroDerm Ltd. announced final data from trial 006. Sheila Oren, MD, MBA, Chief Medical Officer at NeuroDerm will present the final results from this trial in a poster titled, “Safety, efficacy and tolerability of continuous SC LD/CD (ND0612) infusion in PD patients with motor fluctuations,” (Abstract LBA41) in a late-breaking poster session on June 7, 2017 from 1:15 p.m. to 2:45 p.m. (P.T.) at the 21st International Congress of Parkinson’s Disease and Movement Disorders. The Congress is taking place June 4-8, 2017 in Vancouver, B.C. Trial 006 was an international open label, blinded rater, phase II study of ND0612H, NeuroDerm's high dose continuous, subcutaneously delivered levodopa/carbidopa (LD/CD) liquid formulation, in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. In March 2017, NeuroDerm announced that a preliminary analysis of trial 006 demonstrated that the trial successfully met its primary, key secondary and additional secondary endpoints, with many patients experiencing a complete reduction of OFF-time to zero. Trial 006 Design Trial 006 was a 28-day multicenter, international (U.S., EU and Israel), parallel-group, blinded rater, randomized phase II study that investigated the efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of two dosing regimens (R1 and R2) of ND0612H and compared them to the baseline of standard optimized oral therapy: R1: 24-hour administration of ND0612H (720/90mg LD/CD) at a high day rate for 18 hours and a low night rate for 6 hours. R2: 14-hour administration of ND0612H during the waking hours (538/68mg LD/CD) complemented by a morning dose of 150/15mg oral LD/CD. All patients could add oral LD/CD therapy at any time as needed. The trial enrolled 38 patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease. Tamar Rachmilewitz MD, Medical Director at NeuroDerm will present additional baseline patient characteristic data from trial 006 in an abstract titled, “Baseline characteristics of the population enrolled to a randomized clinical study of subcutaneous levodopa/carbidopa (ND0612) infusion in patients with advanced PD,” (Abstract 1377) in a poster session on June 8, 2017 from 1:15 p.m. to 2:45 p.m. PT. Trial 006 Endpoints: The primary endpoint of this study was to assess the change from baseline to day 28 in daily OFF-time (normalized to 16 waking hours) as assessed by a blinded rater. A key secondary endpoint was to assess the percentage of subjects who were “ON” by 8:00am and 9:00am. Additional secondary endpoints were also evaluated as well as safety and tolerability. Trial 006 Study Efficacy and Safety Results: Five subjects did not complete the study. Reasons for discontinuation were: adverse events (n = 2), lack of efficacy (n = 2), and withdrawal of consent (n = 1). Primary endpoint (OFF-time) and key secondary endpoint (“ON” by 8:00am and 9:00am) achieved in R1: The primary endpoint was met in R1. The OFF-time was reduced by 2.8 hours (p = 0.004), from 5.6 hours at baseline. There was a smaller, non-statistically significant reduction of 1.3 hours in OFF-time in R2. In R1, the proportion of patients who achieved the first “ON” by 8:00am (as reported by the patient) increased from 11% at baseline to 50% by day 28 (p = 0.02), and, by 9:00am, from 32% at baseline to 75% (p = 0.007). Good ON (secondary endpoint): Good ON (defined as no or mild dyskinesia, as assessed by the blinded rater) increased in R1 by 3.7 hours (p < 0.001), from 9.2 hours. Although the R2 regimen was not designed to provide optimal ND0612H dosing, significant improvements in Good ON were also observed in this cohort, increasing by 2.8 hours (p = 0.003), from 8.5 hours. Complete reduction of OFF-time (post-hoc analysis): In R1, 42% of patients had a complete reduction in OFF-time to zero hours (11% in R2). Troublesome Dyskinesia (post hoc analysis): Troublesome dyskinesia (defined as “ON” with moderate or severe dyskinesia as assessed by the blinded rater) decreased by 3.5 hours (p = 0.011), from 5.1 hours at baseline, in the subgroup of all patients who had at least 1 hour of troublesome dyskinesia at baseline (n = 14, R1 and R2 combined). Reduction in Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) III (post-hoc analysis): UPDRS III score at 8:00am decreased in R1 by 17.1 points, from 37.4 at baseline to 20.3. Reductions in UPDRS scores in R1 were maintained throughout the day and also observed at 12:00pm (6.9 points) and 4:00pm (6.5 points). Safety and Tolerability: Both regimens were well tolerated. Of the 38 subjects, four reported six serious adverse events, including one subject with subcutaneous abscess and orthostatic hypotension, and another with worsening PD symptoms. These two patients did not complete the study. Additionally, one subject fell and fractured his nose, and there was one case of suspected panniculitis that was eventually ruled out. Infusion site reactions (nodules, bruising, erythema and hemorrhage) were common, yet generally well tolerated. These results corroborate the safety and tolerability data obtained in previous studies and did not raise new safety or tolerability concerns. Additionally, the ND0612H infusion pump systems were reliable with only few minor, correctable malfunctions reported. No major inconvenience related to the wearing of the device was reported for either day or night administration. 

The company also announced that it has received a Scientific Advice Letter from the Scientific Advice Working Party of the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The letter accepts the main design elements suggested by NeuroDerm for the amended iNDiGO phase III efficacy trial (trial 007), including study population and primary and secondary endpoints, as well as the suggested statistical analysis approach. The EMA suggested that NeuroDerm’s planned clinical and regulatory development program may be adequate to support a benefit-risk evaluation of ND0612 for the treatment of Parkinson's disease patients on levodopa with motor fluctuations. At any stage of development of a product candidate, developers can request Scientific Advice from the EMA, which provides a mechanism for the EMA to give developers advice on the appropriate tests and studies in the development of a product candidate. This process is designed to facilitate the development and availability of high-quality, effective and acceptably safe medicines, for the benefit of patients. NeuroDerm recently requested Scientific Advice from the EMA focused on the amended ND0612 iNDiGO trial protocol. The goal of this request was to reach agreement with the Agency on the content of this protocol, which is now being conducted as a pivotal efficacy and safety trial to support registration of ND0612 in the EU, and to confirm completeness of the development program intended to support the submission of a Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA).

	Business

	NDRM is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company developing next-generation treatments for central nervous system, or CNS, disorders through proprietary formulations based on existing drugs that are intended to make a significant difference in patients' lives.

	Product candidates in NDRM’s pipeline are designed to overcome major deficiencies of current treatments and achieve enhanced clinical efficacy through continuous, controlled administration, primarily subcutaneously or transdermally.

	Additionally, because NDRM’s product candidates are based on reformulations of leading, approved drugs, NDRM believes that most of them qualify for an accelerated, lower risk regulatory pathway to marketing approval.

	For moderate to severe Parkinson's disease, NDRM’s product candidates are aimed at overcoming the most significant limitations of current levodopa-carbidopa, or LD/CD, therapy.

	For over 30 years, oral administration of LD/CD has been the standard of care for Parkinson's disease.

	However, despite its widespread acceptance, oral LD/CD has significant limitations, primarily short duration in the blood, or half-life, as well as low absorption and availability in the body. As a result, plasma levodopa concentrations fluctuate sharply, contributing to patients' motor complications. 

 

	At the advanced stages of the disease, patients do not respond to oral administration of LD/CD, motor complications are exacerbated and patients are left with limited treatment options that are highly invasive and/or burdensome.

	NDRM has developed liquid formulations, such as its product candidates ND0612H and ND0612L, that for the first time enable 24-hour, continuous subcutaneous administration of LD/CD to overcome these limitations, maintain steady levodopa levels and offer patients a better quality of life without the need for surgery.

	There are three main stages to Parkinson's disease: mild, moderate and severe, each associated with increasing levels of motor complications and requiring different treatments.

	NDRM is developing a pipeline of product candidates for the growing population of moderate and severe Parkinson's disease patients that address the deficiencies of current treatments.

	These product candidates are designed to administer continuous, controlled doses of LD/CD or apomorphine, utilizing customized versions of off-the-shelf, belt pump devices.

	NDRM is also developing a product candidate for patients suffering from cognition disorders associated with CNS diseases.

	These diseases include Attention Deficit Disorder/Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, or ADD/ADHD, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia.

	NDRM’s cognition product candidate is based on a combination of reformulated approved drugs allowing for continuous administration via transdermal patches.

	In its recently completed Phase II trial, NDRM examined plasma levodopa concentrations of individual Parkinson's disease patients treated with optimized, current standard of care and either ND0612L or a placebo as an add-on for 14 days.

	Additionally, in order to determine the effect of ND0612L without the standard of care, NDRM conducted an additional week of treatment of ND0612L alone or with entacapone.

	An average steady plasma levodopa concentration of 550ng/ml was maintained when ND0612L was administered alone, and an approximately 800ng/ml plasma levodopa concentration was maintained when ND0612L was administered together with twice-daily oral entacapone.

Intellectual property

	NDRM’s patents and patent applications underlying its product candidates cover specific compositions and methods of use of the active drug substances for the ND0612H, ND0612L, ND0680 and ND0801 product candidate programs.

	For the ND0612H, ND0612L and ND0680 product candidate programs, NDRM has four patents, including patents in the United States, South Africa and New Zealand, and have more than 35 pending patent applications worldwide, including one pending and two national phase international applications filed under the PCT.

	Absent patent-term extensions, these patents will expire between 2030 and 2031.

	Additional patent applications NDRM has filed in this family, if approved, will expire in 2035. In addition, NDRM has one pending international PCT application for the composition of ND0701.

	In relation to the composition and method of use related to ND0801, NDRM has currently been granted four patents, including patents in Australia, Japan, Mexico, and the United States and have more than 10 pending patent applications worldwide pursuant to one national phase international application filed under the PCT. Such patents will expire between 2028 and 2031 absent patent-term extensions.

	Competition

	Parkinson's Disease

	NDRM’s commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if its competitors develop and commercialize products, treatments or procedures that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any product that NDRM may develop.

	Specifically, NDRM may compete with companies that attempt to decrease the sharp fluctuations and improve the bioavailability and short-life associated with orally administered LD/CD, such as Impax Laboratories Inc., XenoPort, Inc., Intec Pharma Ltd. and Depomed, Inc., which are developing oral LD/CD drugs that include a controlled release or gastric retention attribute in order to decrease the gastronomical tract's impact on the concentration of levodopa. Similarly, Synagile Corporation is seeking to develop an ester form of levodopa for continuous subcutaneous administration. If such products are approved and successfully improve the bioavailability of LD/CD or an alternative drug, the demand for NDRM’s Parkinson's disease product candidates may be significantly reduced.

	Other Cognitive Disorders

	Similarly, although NDRM is in the clinical phase of ND0801 for the treatment of other cognitive disorders, such as ADD/ADHD, if ND0801 obtains approval in the future, NDRM would compete with current treatments.

	For example, NDRM is aware that a number of existing treatments for ADD/ADHD are currently on the market and are marketed by pharmaceutical companies that may be far larger and more experienced than us. Current competitor drugs to ND0801 for the treatment of ADD/ADHD include stimulants such as Ritalin and Adderall, as well as the non-stimulant drugs Strattera, Intuniv and Kapvay.

	Further, NDRM recognizes that patients and doctors are often unwilling to change medications, and this factor may make it difficult for ND0801 to penetrate the market, even if it receives FDA approval.

	However, based on its clinical trials, NDRM believes that ND0801 will have a sustainable competitive advantage over the current alternatives, and at the very least offer an alternative mode of administration.

	5% shareholders pre-IPO

	Shmuel Cabilly  22.4%

	Robert Taub       28.2%

	Uwe Wascher   26.1%

	Dividends

	No dividends are planned.

	Use of proceeds

	NDRM expects to receive $58 million from its IPO and use it for the following:

	$20 million with respect to its ND0612H product candidate through completion of phase III clinical trials in 2017 and receipt of marketing approval which, depending on the results of its clinical trials and the regulatory approval process, NDRM expects to receive in Europe by the first half of 2018 and in the United States by the second half of 2018;

	$20 million with respect to its ND0612L product candidate through the commencement of its two pivotal phase III clinical trials in 2015 in the United States and Europe to support an NDA submission to the FDA (but not to fund the completion of such clinical trials or receipt of marketing approval);

	and $5 million to advance the development of its other product candidates and general research activities.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
