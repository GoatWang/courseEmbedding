(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  This Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those set forth as a result of general economic conditions and changes in the assumptions used in making such forward-looking statements. The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations relates to the operations and financial condition reported in the financial statements of China Ginseng Holdings Inc. for the three months and nine months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 and should be read in conjunction with such financial statements and related notes included in this report and the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2013. The analysis set forth below is provided pursuant to applicable Securities and Exchange Commission regulations and is not intended to serve as a basis for projections of future events.  Company Overview  Our Company, China Ginseng Holdings Inc., was incorporated on June 24, 2004 in the State of Nevada. Since our inception in 2004, we have been engaged in the business of farming, processing, distribution and marketing of fresh ginseng, dry ginseng, ginseng seeds, and seedlings. Starting in August 2010, we have gradually shifted the focus of our business from direct sales of ginseng to canned ginseng juice production and wine production. Our current focus is the sales of canned ginseng juice.  After we shifted the focus of our business into the ginseng beverage business, we have started to store our raw material and sell only a limited amount of our self-produced ginseng. We also purchase ginseng from outside sources, and then resell it to generate revenue, which sales are based on orders from the market. However, due to the global recession and local market conditions, demand for ginseng exports declined beginning in 2008, creating a significant oversupply in China. All those factors caused us to incur losses in 2012 and 2013. Additionally, in June 2012, we decided to abandon the growing and harvesting of grapes due to the poor quality of recent harvests, which were not suitable for the production of wine or grape juice. We did not renew the leases for grape vineyard with the Chinese Government when the leases expired on December 31, 2013. On June 30, 2013, we discontinued our grape production operations and sold the assets and liabilities of Tonghua Linyuan. Going forward, we plan to purchase grapes from market to produce wine if we receive orders from customers. Due to limited capital at this moment, our current main focus is ginseng beverage business. However, we plan to further adjust our business strategy when our financial situation improves.  In addition, as our new business is in the initial stages, we need to spend capital to promote our new products and develop our marketing plan. There is no assurance that there will be sufficient demand for our beverages to allow us to operate profitably initially, or at all. We have recurring operating losses and there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. As of March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, the cash balance on hand for the Company was $25,365 and $142,969, respectively.  In order to meet the challenge, we raised capital to support our operation through [credit letter loan info.]. In addition, we established Hong Kong Huaxia in Hong Kong as a sales company for health products and specialized local goods in March 2012. Hong Kong Huaxia was set up as a part of our adjusted marketing strategy so that we can explore the Asia market through Hong Kong Huaxia, while Jilin Huamei remains focused on domestic sales in China. The focus of Hong Kong Huaxia is the sale of our ginseng juice in the Asia market. Hong Kong Huaxia is currently recruiting distributors for the Asia market in addition to its online shopping platform for direct sales of our ginseng juice. And as a part of our market promoting, we plan to open online store through Taobao, the biggest online Business-to-Consumer and Consumer-to-Consumer platform in Asia. Because Taobao only accepts business with domestic business address, we established a new wholly owned subsidiary of Hong Kong Huaxia, Jilin Huaxia Ginseng Co., Ltd ("Jilin Huaxia"), which is located in China. In the quarter ended December 31, 2013, Jilin Huaxia borrowed $6,065,932 (RMB 36,983,383) in order to fund the acquisition of machinery and equipment. Subsequent to March 31, 2014, we returned machinery and equipment with a cost of $6,161,798 and a carrying value of $5,917,894 to the original seller. The lender of the loan dated October 29, 2013 with a carrying value of $6,011,506 at March 31, 2014 agreed to defer repayment until we receives the amounts due from the return of the machinery and equipment.  Although, we have generated only limited revenues from our ginseng beverage business since we shifted the focus of our businesses, we believe there is future potential to do so because (i) the China ginseng market is recovering now; (ii) the demand and the price is in an uptrend due to Chinese government restrictions on the amount of land available for ginseng farming (land under our Company's control has not been affected by the government restrictions);  As the impact of the shift in the focus of our business away from the ginseng business and into the ginseng beverage business and the wine business is uncertain and the shift represents a material change in our business, our past revenues and other financial results do not provide a meaningful basis for future performance and there is no guarantee that we will be able to attain profitability in the foreseeable future.  Our Subsidiaries  Our business in China is currently mainly conducted through our wholly-owned subsidiaries: Yanbian Huaxia, Jilin Ganzhi, Jilin Huamei, Jilin Huaxia which are located in North China and Hong Kong Huaxia which is located in Hong Kong  · Yanbian Huaxing Ginseng Industry Co. Ltd. ("Yanbian Huaxing") is a wholly foreign owned enterprise ("WFOE")with a registered capital of $364,000. Yanbian Huaxing is operated to plant ginseng, and our revenue in the past was mainly from the sales of ginseng produced and sold by Yanbian Huaxing.  · Jilin Ganzhi Ginseng Products Co. Ltd. ("Jilin Ganzhi") is a WFOE with a registered capital of $100,000. It is operated to process ginseng and produce canned ginseng juice.  · Jilin Huamei Beverage Co. Ltd. ("Jilin Huamei") is a WFOE with a registered capital of $200,000. It is operated to market our canned ginseng juice.  · Hong Kong Huaxia International Industrial Co., Ltd. ("Hong Kong Huaxia") is our wholly-owned subsidiary with a registered capital of HKD 880,000,000 (approximately $113,443,000), which has not been funded by us. It is operated to sell health products and specialized local goods.  · Jinlin Huaxia Ginseng Co., Ltd ("Jilin Huaxia") is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hong Kong Huaxia with a registered capital of $6,000,000. Jilin Huaxia was incorporated in September 2013 as a part of our market promoting strategy. We plan to open online stroe through Taobao, the biggest online Business-to Consumer and Consumer-to-Consumer plaftform in Asia. Because Taobao only accepts stores with domestic business address, we established Jilin Huaxia to facilitate our expansion to B2C and C2C markets.  Our Products  Through Yanbian Huaxing, we obtained 20-year leases to 3,705 acres of land approved by the local government for ginseng growing on June 12, 2005, and we have developed 3% of the land resources.  Since August 2010, we have gradually shifted our business focus from direct sales of ginseng and ginseng byproducts to the production and sale of canned ginseng juice. We have started reserving most of the ginseng produced by Yanbian Huaxing for use in the planned production of canned ginseng juice. Meanwhile, as there is a higher standard for ginseng used in canned ginseng juice, we are able to sell some of the ginseng produced by Yanbian Huaxing, which is not qualified for use in canned ginseng juice to the market through Yanbian Huaxing. Although we have shifted our business focus to the production and sale of ginseng juice, we still receive orders for ginseng and its byproducts because of our reputation in the industry for selling high-quality ginseng. We intend to maintain this part of our business even though it is no longer our business focus. In addition, if we receive large orders for ginseng and/or ginseng byproducts, we will directly purchase ginseng and/or ginseng byproducts from the market if we can get a lower price of the products. This part of sale of ginseng is generated on an order-to-order basis and conditioned on whether we can get a lower price for such demanded products in the market.  Through Jilin Ganzhi, we produce two types of canned ginseng juice:  · Ganzhi Asian Ginseng Beverage  · Ganzhi American Ginseng Beverage  Canned Ginseng Juice  To produce canned ginseng juice, we take ginseng juice extracted from fresh ginseng as the main material and add natural extracts like xylitol, citric acid and steviosides as subsidiary ingredients. We have farming technicians periodically inspect farmers to ensure they follow our growing guidelines to control the quality of the fresh ginseng, and when we need to purchase fresh ginseng from the market for production of ginseng juice, we limit our choice to the highest quality of fresh ginseng. We use low residue pesticide and biodegradable fertilizer for ginseng planting. We use xylitol instead of sugar to lower calories, which also does not cause products to have a sour taste.  The most important component of ginseng is ginsenoside. Based upon reading our competitors' product labels, all of their ginseng drinks are blended after extracting ginsenosides through chemical methods. The chemical extraction of ginsenosides will cause damage to its nutritional components. Our technology is different from the traditional method used by our competitors. We squeeze-out the natural juice from fresh ginseng so as to preserve freshness and nutrition in the final product.  Squeezing is not commonly used in canned ginseng juice because it requires fresh ginseng, the preservation of which is very difficult. Fresh ginseng rots very fast. The harvest time concentrates in September and October, which is a fairly short period. After that, one can only buy dried ginseng from the market such as sun-dried ginseng from which we cannot squeeze juice. However, our drink formula uses refrigerated ginseng as a raw material to produce canned ginseng juice, which enables us to maintain its freshness and nutrition in our final products. The drink formula for our ginseng beverages is a registered patent approved by the Chinese government, patent number ZL 03111397.6. This patent was issued on January 23, 2008 and expires 20 years after issuance.  This is the reason we store our fresh ginseng in refrigerated warehouse space. We are currently renting a refrigerated warehouse (-20 degrees Celsius) to store all fresh ginseng inventory necessary for production of the ginseng beverages. Monthly rent for refrigerated warehouse is RMB 4,500 (about $676.86). This lease is currently expired and operating on a month to month basis. We commenced production in August 2010 and sales in October 2010, which was reflected in our financial statement for the three months ending December 31, 2010. We initiated our sales of canned ginseng juice in China, and we plan to expand our business to overseas markets in 2014 or 2015. Our Ganzhi Ginseng Beverage costs approximately $2.21 per 1600 ml bottle, and our American Ginseng Beverage costs approximately $2.66 per 1600 ml bottle. However, as we are in the initial stage of the ginseng beverage business, we cannot assure the demands for our ginseng beverage will be profitable in the short term and there is no guarantee that we will be able to generate the revenue from ginseng beverage business.  We own the production plant for ginseng juice. The plant is certified by the Chinese government as a Good Manufacturing Process facility, which is required for our production of these products. Good Manufacturing Process standards cover organization and personnel, building and facilities, equipment, materials, hygiene and sanitation, validation, documentation, production management, quality management, production distribution and recall, complaints and adverse reactions report, and self-inspections.  Distribution  We intend to recruit one general distributor for our products of ginseng beverage in every city in China through Jilin Huamei. The city level distributor can recruit the second level distributors. In addition to recruiting general distributors, in some major cities, Jilin Huamei will establish sale branch offices to facilitate the local sales. Our direct sales will target customers of high-end retailers such as supermarkets, pharmacies, hotels, gift shops, entertainment centers, tourists attractions, airport and high-speed trains, etc.  We are using the same distribution agreement for our general distributors although specific terms might differ based upon negotiations we have with each distributor. In specific regard to our ginseng juice business, we have signed five (5) distributors through Jilin Huamei as of the date of this filing. As for the distribution of our wine, we have signed one (1) distributor through Jilin Huamei as of the date of this filing.  In addition, as a part of our adjustment to our marketing strategy for our ginseng juice, we established Hong Kong Huaxia in March 2012. Hong Kong Huaxia recruits distributors to sell ginseng juice outside of China in Asia Markets and to build and maintain an online shopping platform through which to take orders directly from end user customers. In addition, we plan to open online shop via Taobao, the biggest online B2C and C2C platform in Asia. Because Taobao requires business to have a domestic address, we set up Jinlin Huaxia, a subsidiary of Hong Kong Huaxia, which is located in Jinlin, China.  Competitive Environment  The market for ginseng products is highly competitive. Our operations may be affected by technological advances by competitors, industry consolidation, patents granted to competitors, competitive combination products, new products offered by our competitors, as well as new information provided by other marketed products and/or other post-market studies.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates including the allowance for doubtful accounts, the saleability and recoverability of inventory, income taxes and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  In addition, past financial results are not indicative of future performance due to our emphasis on further commercializing ginseng juice with our crops as raw materials and broadening our offering. Furthermore, we cannot predict what future laws and regulations might be passed that could have a material effect on our results of operations. We assess the impact of significant changes in laws and regulations on a regular basis and update the assumptions and estimates used to prepare our financial statements when we deem it necessary.  Consolidated Financial Statements  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts and activities of China Ginseng Holdings, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Yanbian Huaxing Ginseng Co. Limited, Jilin Huamei Beverage Co. Limited, Jilin Ganzhi Ginseng Products Co. Limited, Tonghua Linyuan Grape Planting Co. Limited and Hong Kong Huaxia International Industrial, Co. Limited (which included Jilin Huaxia Ginseng Co., Ltd.). All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  Ginseng Crops and Grape Crops  The Company uses the full absorption costing method to value its ginseng crops. Included in crop costs are seeds, labor, applicable overhead including depreciation, and supplies. Common costs are allocated in each period based upon the total number of hectors under cultivation during the period.  The carrying value of the ginseng crops is reviewed on a regular basis for any impairment in value using management's best estimate as to expect future market values, yields and costs to harvest. Costs accumulated on the acres expected to be harvested during the next fiscal year have been classified as a current asset.  In March 2013, the Company determined that the grape juice inventory held at Tonghua Linyuan is no longer saleable. As such, the Company wrote off inventory with a value of RMB 8,855,286 ($1,410,149) at June 30, 2013.  At March 31, 2014 and June 30, 2013, there were no shipments of Ginseng at customer locations awaiting inspection and approval that may be subject to invoicing.  Revenue Recognition  The Company processes ginseng and stores the stock for ginseng juice production. Any grown ginseng that is not suitable for the beverage production is sold. The Company also purchases ginseng from farmers for its resale business. Ginseng is planted in the Spring (March) and Fall (September) of each year and is generally harvested in September. It usually takes 6 years for a ginseng root to mature although senior maturity can be as long as 8 years.  Harvested ginseng can be sold in two ways: (1) fresh ginseng, which can be sold immediately and stored in refrigerators for up to 3 years, and (2) dried ginseng, which is processed and dried via sunlight and steam machines. Drying is a two-month process. Dried ginseng can be stored up to 5 years. The Company has focused on selling dried ginseng as it is more profitable than selling fresh ginseng. The Company has also been storing fresh ginseng for future juice manufacturing.  When the Company sells ginseng, it receives orders prior to harvest. For major customers, approximately 20% to 30% is paid upon delivery as payment in advance. The balance is billed after the customer's inspection process is completed, which can take up to 60 days. Until the customer finalizes its inspection and deems the shipment acceptable, the shipment is still the property of the Company. Upon customer completion of inspection and approval, the sale is then recognized and the balance of the invoice price is wired to the Company. For smaller sales, customers pick up the ginseng from the Company, pay in cash at time of pick up and receive an invoice with the appropriate sales tax applied and a cash acknowledgement. On these orders, revenue is recognized upon shipment/payment.  The Company has entered into several distribution agreements to sell ginseng juice. In accordance with these agreements, the distributors will advance funds to the Company for orders to be placed. Upon the placement of orders by the distributor, the Company will ship the product to the distributor and title will pass to the distributor. In relation to distribution agreements for ginseng beverages, it is the Company's policy, commencing upon the execution of the distribution agreements, to allow the distributors to return all unsold products at the end of six (6) months from the shipment date should the product not be sold and the product has not exceeded the expiration date. The Company is establishing history as to the quantity of the ginseng, which has been returned in order to determine if a reserve for returns and allowances is necessary. To date, returns have been minimal. For each reporting period, the Company ascertains from each distributor its' current on hand quantity and assesses the situation in order to establish a return allowance, if necessary. As of March 31, 2014 and June 30, 2013, all distribution sales had been sold to third parties.  Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  Accounts receivable consists principally of trade receivables. When ginseng is shipped to a customer, the customer pays 20%-30% of the invoice and is entitled to an inspection process, which could take up to 60 days. Upon completion of the inspection and approval process, the customer notifies the company, and a sale is recorded. The allowance for doubtful accounts represents management's estimate of the amount of probable credit losses, determined by reviewing past due balances and other information. Account balances are written off against the allowance if management determines the receivable is uncollectible. The Company's standard terms stipulate payment in 60 days and consider a receivable to be uncollectible after one year. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $1,507,992 and $664,976 at June 30, 2013 and June 30, 2012, respectively.  Vineyard Development Costs  In June 2012, the Company decided to abandon the growing and harvesting of grapes due to the poor quality of recent harvests indicating that the vineyard land was no longer suitable for the production of wine or grape juice. Accordingly, the Company has abandoned the vineyard and recorded a charge to operations of $872,568, which is included under discontinued operations in the financial statements for the quarter ended June 30, 2012. The Company has also decided not to renew its leases with the Chinese Government when it expires in December 2013. Going forward, the Company will purchase grapes in the open market to produce wine and grape juice.  Going Concern  As indicated in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $11,108,740 as of March 31, 2014 and there are existing uncertain conditions the Company foresees relating to its ability to obtain working capital and operate successfully. Management's plans include the raising of capital through the debt and equity markets to fund future operations and the generating of revenue through its businesses. Failure to raise adequate capital and generate adequate sales revenues could result in the Company having to curtail or cease operations.  Additionally, even if the Company does raise sufficient capital to support its operating expenses and generate adequate revenues, there can be no assurances that the revenues will be sufficient to enable it to develop business to a level where it will generate profits and cash flows from operations. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. However, the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.  Result of Operations The following tables present certain unaudited consolidated statement of operations information. Financial information is presented for the three months and nine months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 respectively.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  This Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those set forth as a result of general economic conditions and changes in the assumptions used in making such forward-looking statements. The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations relates to the operations and financial condition reported in the financial statements of China Ginseng Holdings Inc. for the three and six months ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 and should be read in conjunction with such financial statements and related notes included in this report and the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2013. The analysis set forth below is provided pursuant to applicable Securities and Exchange Commission regulations and is not intended to serve as a basis for projections of future events.  Company Overview  Our Company, China Ginseng Holdings Inc., was incorporated on June 24, 2004 in the State of Nevada. The Company conducts business through its four wholly-owned subsidiaries located in China. We have been granted 20-year leases to 3,705 acres of land by the Chinese government for ginseng planting and we control, through a lease, approximately 750 acres of grape vineyards. However, recent harvests of grapes showed poor quality for wine production, which indicates that the vineyards are no longer suitable for planting grapes for wine production. Therefore, we have decided not to renew our lease for the vineyards with the Chinese government upon expiration on December 31, 2013 and, going forward, we intend to purchase grapes from the open market in order to produce grape juice and wine.  Since our inception in 2004, we have been engaged in the business of farming, processing, distribution and marketing of fresh ginseng, dry ginseng, ginseng seeds, and seedlings. Starting in August 2010, we have gradually shifted the focus of our business from direct sales of ginseng to canned ginseng juice production and wine production.  Since we shifted the focus of our business into the ginseng beverage business and the wine business, we have started to store our raw material and sell only a limited amount of our self-produced ginseng. We also purchase ginseng from outside sources, and then resell it to generate revenue, which sales are based on orders from the market. However, due to the global recession and local market conditions, demand for ginseng exports declined beginning in 2008, creating a significant oversupply in China. All those factors caused us to incur losses in 2012 and 2013. Additionally, in June 2012, we decided to abandon the growing and harvesting of grapes due to the poor quality of recent harvests, which were not suitable for the production of wine or grape juice. We did not renew the leases for grape vineyard with the Chinese Government when the leases expired on December 31, 2013. On June 30, 2013, we discontinued our grape production operations and sold the assets and liabilities of Tonghua Linyuan. Going forward, we plan to purchase grapes from market to produce wine if we receive orders from customers. Due to limited capital at this moment, our current main focus is ginseng beverage business. However, we plan to further adjust our business strategy when our financial situation improves.  In addition, as our new business is in the initial stages, we need to spend capital to promote our new products and develop our marketing plan. There is no assurance that there will be sufficient demand for our beverages and wine to allow us to operate profitably initially, or at all. We have recurring operating losses and there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. As of December 31, 2013, the cash balance on hand for the Company was $142,969.  In order to meet the challenge, we raised capital to support our operation through a Regulation S private placement and we are recruiting distributors for ginseng beverage and wine products. In addition, we established Hong Kong Huaxia in Hong Kong as a sales company for health products and specialized local goods in March 2012. Hong Kong Huaxia was set up as a part of our adjusted marketing strategy so that we can explore the Asia market through Hong Kong Huaxia, while Jilin Huamei remains focused on domestic sales in China. The focus of Hong Kong Huaxia is the sale of our ginseng juice and wine in the Asia market. Hong Kong Huaxia is currently recruiting distributors for the Asia market in addition to its online shopping platform for direct sales of our ginseng juice and wine. And as a part of our market promoting, we plan to open online store through Taobao, the biggest online Business-to-Consumer and Consumer-to-Cobnsumer platform in Asia. Because Taobao only accepts business with domestic business address, we established a new wholly owned subsidiary of Hong Kong Huaxia, Jilin Huaxia Ginseng Co., Ltd ("Jilin Huaxia"), which is located in Jilin, China. In the quarter ended December 31, 2013, Jilin Huaxia borrowed $6,065,932 (RMB 36,983,383) in order to fund the acquisition of machinery and equipment.  Although, we have generated only limited revenues from our ginseng beverage and wine businesses since we shifted the focus of our businesses, we believe there is future potential to do so because (i) the China ginseng market is recovering now; (ii) the demand and the price is in an uptrend due to Chinese government restrictions on the amount of land available for ginseng farming (land under our Company's control has not been affected by the government restrictions);  As the impact of the shift in the focus of our business away from the ginseng business and into the ginseng beverage business and the wine business is uncertain and the shift represents a material change in our business, our past revenues and other financial results do not provide a meaningful basis for future performance and there is no guarantee that we will be able to attain profitability in the foreseeable future.  Our Subsidiaries  Our business in China is currently mainly conducted through our wholly-owned subsidiaries : Yanbian Huaxia, Jilin Ganzhi, Jilin Huamei which are located in North China and Hong Kong Huaxia which is located in Hong Kong . On June 30, 2013, the Company discontinued its grape production operations. The Company sold the assets and liabilities of Tonghua Linyuan and plans to close Tonghua Linyuan. Below is the operational status of each of these businesses as of the date of this filing:  Yanbian Huaxing Ginseng Industry Co. Ltd. ("Yanbian Huaxing") - Ginseng farming and sales.  ? On September 8, 2003, we and Jilin Dunhua Huaxing Ginseng Industry Co, Ltd.  Jilin Ganzhi Ginseng Products Co. Ltd. ("Jilin Ganzhi") - Produces canned ginseng juice.  ? On August 24, 2005, we acquired 100% equity interest in Jilin Ganzhi at a price of $95,691. We received a certificate of approval issued by the competent local approval authority on May 31, 2006 and a business license issued by the competent local registration authority on June 19, 2006. Subsequently, on September 26, 2007 and August 31, 2008, we increased Jilin Ganzhi's registered capital by $50,000 and $20,000, respectively. Now the registered capital of Jilin Ganzhi is $100,000. We applied with the relevant PRC approval and registration authorities for each of the aforesaid capital increases and have obtained all applicable approvals and registrations for such changes, including a renewed certificate of approval issued by the local approval authority and a renewed business license issued by the local registration authority certifying Jilin Ganzhi as a WFOE lawfully owned by us. Jilin Ganzhi is operated to process ginseng and produce canned ginseng juice. Jilin Ganzhi started production of canned ginseng juice in the three months ended December 31, 2010.  Tonghua Linyuan Grape Planting Co. ("Tonghua Linyuan") - Grew grapes and produced wine through a winery producer until June 30, 2013, when Tonghua Linyuan became a shell company and ceased operations.  ? On January 15, 2008, we acquired 100% equity interest in Tonghua Linyuan from two PRC individual shareholders at a price of $1,000,000. The price was determined by arm's-length negotiations based upon the appraised net asset value of Tonghua Linyuan at the time of acquisition which was approximately $1,332,248. Tonghua Linyuan was operated to plant grapes and produce wine. As of June 2013, the planned production of wine and grape juice had not commenced due to the poor quality of the harvests from Tonghua Linyuan in recent years, which were not suitable for the production of wine or grape juice; therefore, the Company decided to abandon the growing and harvesting of grapes. On June 30, 2013, Tonghua Linyuan entered into a sale agreement with Mr. Wenkai Wang to transfer all assets and debts of Tonghua Linyuan to Mr. Wenkai Wang for $0 (zero) consideration, including the ownership of machinery and equipment, the right to the use of the plant and the debt of $2 million of Tonghua Linyuan, effective immediately. Mr. Wang has been engaged in wine sale business in Tonghua City for many years and does not have any material relationship with the Company, or any of its affiliates, or any director or officer of the Company, or any associate of any such director or officer, other than in respect of the sale of Tonghua Linyuan. Pursuant to the sale of all assets and debts, Tonghua Linyuan became a shell with no operations. We believe that it is in the best interest of the Company to dispose of the assets and debts of Tonghua Linyuan. Going forward, the Company will purchase grapes in the open market to produce wine and grape juice. Contracts entered into by Tonghua Linyuan with a winery producer for production of wine remain valid and will be fulfilled by Jilin Huamei.  Jilin Huamei Beverage Co. Ltd. ("Jilin Huamei") - Markets our canned ginseng juice and wine.  ? We incorporated Jilin Huamei as a WFOE on October 17, 2005. We received a certificate of approval issued by the competent local approval authority on October 17, 2005 and a business license issued by the competent local registration authority on October 19, 2005 certifying Jilin Huamei as a WFOE lawfully owned by us. The registered capital of Jilin Huamei is $200,000. Jilin Huamei operates as a sales department for our canned ginseng juice and wine, which are produced by our other subsidiaries. We plan to recruit one general distributor for our canned ginseng juice and one general distributor for our wine in each big city in China through Jilin Huamei. We commenced sales of our ginseng beverage in October 2010 and Jilin Huamei started generating revenue in November 2010. As of the date of this filing, Jilin Huamei has five (5) general distributors for our ginseng beverage and one (1) general distributor for our wine. Jilin Huamei established one (1) sale branch office in Jiangsu Province from the period of June 2011 to May 2013. The Company decided to cease operating this branch because we did not have many sales from this branch and we did not have enough cash to support its operations. As of September 30, 2013, Jilin Huamei also conducts the purchase of grapes from the open market for the production of our own wine.  Hong Kong Huaxia International Industrial Co., Ltd. ("Hong Kong Huaxia") - Sells health products and specialized local goods  ? Hong Kong Huaxia was incorporated by us on March 18, 2012, as a wholly-owned subsidiary to sell health products and specialized local goods. The registered capital of Hong Kong Huaxia is HKD 880,000,000 (approximately $113,443,000), which has not been funded by the Company. Hong Kong Huaxia began operations in April 2012. On September 27, 2013, the Company established a new wholly owned subsidiary of Hong Kong Huaxia, Jilin Huaxia Ginseng Co., Ltd ("Jilin Huaxia").  Our Products  Previously, through Yanbian Huaxing, we focused on the farming, processing, distribution and marketing of Asian and American Ginseng and related byproducts in the following varieties:  ? Fresh Ginseng: For pharmaceutical, health supplement, cosmetic industry and fresh consumption.  ? Dry Ginseng: Dried form for pharmaceutical and health supplement consumption.  ? Ginseng Seeds: Selling of ginseng seeds.  ? Ginseng Seedling: Selling of ginseng seedling.  Also through Yanbian Huaxing, we obtained 20-year leases to 3,705 acres of land approved by the local government for ginseng growing on June 12, 2005, and we have developed 3% of the land resources.  Since August 2010, we have gradually shifted our business focus from direct sales of ginseng and ginseng byproducts to the production and sale of canned ginseng juice and wine. We have started reserving most of the ginseng produced by Yanbian Huaxing for use in the planned production of canned ginseng juice and grape juice produced by Tonghua Linyuan for use in the production of wine. Meanwhile, as there is a higher standard for ginseng used in canned ginseng juice, we are able to sell some of the ginseng produced by Yanbian Huaxing, which is not qualified for use in canned ginseng juice to the market through Yanbian Huaxing. Although we have shifted our business focus to the production and sale of ginseng juice and wine, we still receive orders for ginseng and its byproducts because of our reputation in the industry for selling high-quality ginseng. We intend to maintain this part of our business even though it is no longer our business focus. In addition, if we receive large orders for ginseng and/or ginseng byproducts, we will directly purchase ginseng and/or ginseng byproducts from the market if we can get a lower price of the products. This part of sale of ginseng is generated on an order-to-order basis and conditioned on whether we can get a lower price for such demanded products in the market.  Through Jilin Ganzhi, we produce two types of canned ginseng juice:  ? Ganzhi Asian Ginseng Beverage  ? Ganzhi American Ginseng Beverage  In addition to canned ginseng juice, we also shifted our business to wine production. Prior to the sale of the assets and debts of Tonghua Linyuan, we grew and crushed the grapes from our vineyards and had the juice reserved. In the future, we will purchase grapes in the open market to produce wine and grape juice. We contracted with Jinyuanshan Winery for the final production and bottling of the wine and commenced wine production through Jinyuanshan Winery in March 2011 and sales in April 2011. All of our wines are sold through Jinlin Huamei and Hong Kong Huaxia.  We produce and sell three types of wine:  ? Bingqing Ice Wine  ? Pearl in the Snow (Red Wine)  ? Linyuan Hong Wine (Red Wine)  New Focus of Our Business  Canned Ginseng Juice  To produce canned ginseng juice, we take ginseng juice extracted from fresh ginseng as the main material and add natural extracts like xylitol, citric acid and steviosides as subsidiary ingredients. We have farming technicians periodically inspect farmers to ensure they follow our growing guidelines to control the quality of the fresh ginseng, and when we need to purchase fresh ginseng from the market for production of ginseng juice, we limit our choice to the highest quality of fresh ginseng. We use low residue pesticide and biodegradable fertilizer for ginseng planting. We use xylitol instead of sugar to lower calories, which also does not cause products to have a sour taste.  Currently, there are about 10 kinds of ginseng drinks on the market; all of them are imported from Korea. Based on our market research, the price range for those products is RMB 4 to RMB 30 per can (about $0.60-$4.51).  The most important component of ginseng is ginsenoside. Based upon reading our competitors' product labels, all of their ginseng drinks are blended after extracting ginsenosides through chemical methods. The chemical extraction of ginsenosides will cause damage to its nutritional components. Our technology is different from the traditional method used by our competitors. We squeeze-out the natural juice from fresh ginseng so as to preserve freshness and nutrition in the final product.  Squeezing is not commonly used in canned ginseng juice because it requires fresh ginseng, the preservation of which is very difficult. Fresh ginseng rots very fast. The harvest time concentrates in September and October, which is a fairly short period. After that, one can only buy dried ginseng from the market such as sun-dried ginseng from which we cannot squeeze juice. However, our drink formula uses refrigerated ginseng as a raw material to produce canned ginseng juice, which enables us to maintain its freshness and nutrition in our final products. The drink formula for our ginseng beverages is a registered patent approved by the Chinese government, patent number ZL 03111397.6. This patent was issued on January 23, 2008 and expires 20 years after issuance.  This is the reason we store our fresh ginseng in refrigerated warehouse space. We are currently renting a refrigerated warehouse (-20 degrees Celsius) to store all fresh ginseng inventory necessary for production of the ginseng beverages. Monthly rent for refrigerated warehouse is RMB 4,500 (about $676.86). We commenced production in August 2010 and sales in October 2010, which was reflected in our financial statement for the three months ending December 31, 2010. We initiated our sales of canned ginseng juice in China, and we plan to expand our business to overseas markets in 2014 or 2015. Our Ganzhi Ginseng Beverage costs approximately $2.21 per 1600 ml bottle, and our American Ginseng Beverage costs approximately $2.66 per 1600 ml bottle. However, as we are in the initial stage of the ginseng beverage business, we cannot assure the demands for our ginseng beverage will be profitable in the short term and there is no guarantee that we will be able to generate the revenue from ginseng beverage business.  We own the production plant for ginseng juice. The plant is certified by the Chinese government as a Good Manufacturing Process facility, which is required for our production of these products. Good Manufacturing Process standards cover organization and personnel, building and facilities, equipment, materials, hygiene and sanitation, validation, documentation, production management, quality management, production distribution and recall, complaints and adverse reactions report, and self-inspections.  Wine  Our grapes grow on 750 acres of land leased from a group of individual farmers, paying approximately $37.50 per acre a year for 15 years. This lease expires on December 31, 2013. However, recent harvests from our vineyard showed poor quality indicating the vineyard is no longer suitable for the production of wine. We decided to abandon the growing and harvesting of grapes and not to renew the lease of the land when it expires. We will now purchase grapes in the open market to produce wine.  We started production of wine in March 2011 and sales in April 2011. Through Tonghua Linyuan, we have a written production agreement with Tonghua Jinyuanshan Winery ("Jinyuanshan Winery") to produce Pearl in Snow Wine and Bingqing Ice Wine for us from May 20, 2012 to May 19, 2017. Pursuant to the sale of all assets and liabilities of Tonghua Linyuan on June 30, 2013, the contract with Jinyuanshan Winery was fulfilled by our subsidiary, Jilin Huamei. Under the terms of the agreement, we provide Jinyuanshan Winery with grape juice, bottling supplies and packaging supplies, and Jinyuanshan Winery produces and bottles the wine with a charge of approximately $0.16-0.24 per bottle (approximately $0.16 a bottle for processing red wine and approximately $0.24 per bottle for processing ice wine). We have another written production agreement with Jinyuanshan Winery through Tonghua Linyuan (replaced by Jilin Huamei since June 30, 2013) to produce Linyuan Hong Wine for us at a charge of approximately $0.16 per bottle from May 20, 2012 to May 19, 2017. The agreement contains similar terms as the production written agreement we have with Jinyuanshan Winery for producing Pearl in Snow Wine and Bingqing Ice Wine.  Distribution  We intend to recruit one general distributor for our products of ginseng beverage and wine in every city in China through Jilin Huamei. The city level distributor can recruit the second level distributors. In addition to recruiting general distributors, in some major cities, Jilin Huamei will establish sale branch offices to facilitate the local sales. Our direct sales will target customers of high-end retailers such as supermarkets, pharmacies, hotels, gift shops, entertainment centers, tourists attractions, airport and high-speed trains, etc.  We started negotiating distribution and sales agreements with potential general distributors. We are using the same distribution agreement for our general distributors although specific terms might differ based upon negotiations we have with each distributor. In specific regard to our ginseng juice business, we have signed five (5) distributors through Jilin Huamei as of the date of this filing. As for the distribution of our wine, we have signed one (1) distributor through Jilin Huamei as of the date of this filing.  In addition, as a part of our adjustment to our marketing strategy for our ginseng juice and wine, we established Hong Kong Huaxia in March 2012. Hong Kong Huaxia recruits distributors to sell wine and ginseng juice outside of China in Asia Markets and to build and maintain an online shopping platform through which to take orders directly from end user customers. In addition, we plan to open online shop via Taobao, the biggest online B2C and C2C platform in Asia, a subsidiary of Alibaba. Because Taobao requires business to have a domestic address, we set up Jinlin Huaxia, a subsidiary of Hong Kong Huaxia, which is located in Jinlin, China.  Competitive Environment  The market for ginseng products and wine is highly competitive. Our operations may be affected by technological advances by competitors, industry consolidation, patents granted to competitors, competitive combination products, new products offered by our competitors, as well as new information provided by other marketed products and/or other post-market studies.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates including the allowance for doubtful accounts, the saleability and recoverability of inventory, income taxes and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  In addition, past financial results are not indicative of future performance due to our emphasis on further commercializing ginseng juice with our crops as raw materials and broadening our offering, such as wine sale. Furthermore, we cannot predict what future laws and regulations might be passed that could have a material effect on our results of operations. We assess the impact of significant changes in laws and regulations on a regular basis and update the assumptions and estimates used to prepare our financial statements when we deem it necessary.  Consolidated Financial Statements  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts and activities of China Ginseng Holdings, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Yanbian Huaxing Ginseng Co. Limited, Jilin Huamei Beverage Co. Limited, Jilin Ganzhi Ginseng Products Co. Limited, Tonghua Linyuan Grape Planting Co. Limited and Hong Kong Huaxia International Industrial, Co. Limited. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  Inventory  Our inventory consists of fresh and dried ginseng as well as formerly crushed grapes, and is stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost is determined using the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) Method.  Ginseng Crops and Grape Crops  The Company uses the full absorption costing method to value its ginseng crops. Included in crop costs are seeds, labor, applicable overhead including depreciation, and supplies. Common costs are allocated in each period based upon the total number of hectors under cultivation during the period.  The carrying value of the ginseng crops is reviewed on a regular basis for any impairment in value using management's best estimate as to expect future market . . .

The market in China for ginseng is extremely competitive. According to official
statistics, at peak time, there are more than four companies engaged in ginseng
production in China. The fierce competition within the ginseng industry for
planting land is compounded by the Chinese government's recent promotion of
forestation in state-owned forests. This has dramatically reduced the woodland
available for ginseng planting.

Our major competitors are Changbai Baoquan Mountain, Changbai Ni Li River, Ji 
An Ginseng and Antler Company & The First Fu Song Ginseng Farm. We rank in the
middle of these competitors, the larger of which in general have greater
financial and personnel resources and have achieved greater market penetration
than we have.

We believe we compete in this market based upon:

·Land Resources Controlled

·Research and Development

·Ginseng cultivation systems and techniques.

·Microwave drying technology Established Distribution Network

·Business Model which provides Chinese ginseng seeds and continual professional
 technical support to farmers who own or lease plantable ginseng-favorable land
 and then purchasing back from these same farmers fresh ginseng.


Company Description
China Ginseng Holdings, Inc. is headquartered in Changchun City, Jilin 
Province,Peoples Republic of China. Our main business includes farming, 
processing,distribution and marketing of Asian Ginseng and related byproducts 
in thefollowing varieties: white ginseng, red ginseng, ginseng energy


 drinks, 
ginseng seeds, and ginseng seedling.

We control through leases 3,705 acres of land approved by the Chinese 
government for Asian Ginseng growing.

Our principal operations include farming, processing, distribution and 
marketing of organic Asian Ginseng generating its revenue from sales of white 
ginseng, fresh ginseng, ginseng seeds, and ginseng seedlings. For the year 
2006 these products constituted the following percentages of our total 
revenues: White Ginseng 60%, Fresh Ginseng 7% Seeds and Seedlings 33%.

cosmetic manufacturers and distributors throughout Asia, in countries such as
Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia, Hong Kong as well as domestically in China.
