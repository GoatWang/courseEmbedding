James Ross Jack (born 21 March 1959) is a Scottish football player and manager.
Playing career[edit]
A striker, Jack began his career in the Highland Football League with Ross County where he made a handful of appearances in the 1974–75 season before joining Everton, initially as an apprentice before graduating to the professional ranks. He made only a solitary, goalscoring appearance, for Everton and, after a fruitless loan spell at Cardiff City, he joined Norwich City for £20,000 in December 1979. He would have to wait almost a year before making his Norwich debut against Ipswich Town in the League Cup in September 1980. In the 1981–82 season, he scored 10 league goals for Norwich and, with two in the FA Cup and two more in the Football League Cup, was the club's leading scorer for the season. In the summer of 1983, a fee of £15,000 secured his transfer to Lincoln City where he remained for the next two seasons. His last game for Lincoln, and in England, was in May 1985, against Bradford City, in a game overshadowed by the Bradford City stadium fire, which killed 56 spectators.[2] In July 1985, he returned to Scotland to join Dundee. In October 1987, Dunfermline Athletic's manager Jim Leishman paid £15,000 to secure Jack's services and he made an instant impression, scoring on his debut in a 3–2 away defeat to Motherwell.[3] In each of his three seasons at the club, Jack would finish as Dunfermline's leading scorer, his most successful season being the 1989–1990 campaign when he was the second highest goalscorer in the Scottish Premier League, his 16 league goals placing him just one goal behind John Robertson.[4] In July 1991 a fee of £45,000 was sufficient to see Jack move to Kilmarnock. Following a brief loan sojourn to Sligo Rovers (January – March 1993), Jack was appointed player-manager of Montrose in March 1993. His spell would last only six months and in October 1993 he moved on to Ayr United before retiring from the professional game at the end of the 1993–1994 season.
Coaching career[edit]
Post retirement, Jack moved into coaching, primarily focusing with work with the Scottish Football Association (SFA), first as the SFA's Highlands and Islands area community development officer[5] and then as the SFA's North of Scotland Football Development Officer. In October 2001 it was announced that he would leave this role to take up the position of High Performance Football Coach at the Scottish Institute of Sport, a role he commenced in December 2001 and maintains to this day. On his appointment, Jack was quoted as saying "this new role is one where I hope we can make a difference to the future prospects of Scottish football."[6] He continued to play football at a junior level, particularly in the North Caledonian Football League with Alness United[7] and, in the summer months, with hometown Avoch.[8]
In October 2007 there was speculation that Jack may make a return to management with Ross County with The Scotsman quoting Jack as saying "the time could be right for me to get back into the game. I could think of no better club than Ross County to do that with. I'm a local boy and County have played a big part in my life."[9] but the return did not materialise. In April 2008, his post as the Scottish Institute of Sport's high-performance football coach was axed after the Scottish FA decided that the coaching of young players was best done by the individual clubs.[10] Jack finally made his return to Ross County when he was appointed assistant coach in July 2008.[11] In December 2008 Ross lost his job with Ross County due to the managerial team wanting to take a "new direction".[12]
In January 2009, Jack was appointed manager of Elgin City in the Scottish Third Division.[13] After five years with the club, Jack left Elgin City in January 2014 by mutual consent.[14]
On 23 April 2014, Jack was appointed manager of Turriff United a Scottish Highland Football League club from Aberdeenshire. [15]

Description

Johannesburg born recording artist, Ross Jack, is set to unleash his unique brand of hip-hop in North America with the release of his new album, 'Self Medicated,' on Radikal Records. After establishing himself in the industry as a prodigious beat-maker and producer for up and coming acts, Ross Jack decided to step out from the background and in front of the mic, releasing his mix-tape album, 'Notes from the Wild' in 2013. The album took the South African music scene by storm as single after single topped the national radio charts, with six singles in rotation making it into the 5FM Top 5 and two of them hitting the #1 spot. Now, Ross Jack returns with his strongest work to date, 'Self Medicated.' 'Self Medicated' is a perfect blend of Ross Jack's influences, taking the best sounds of Rap, RnB, Soul, Trip-Hop, and Pop to produce a unique style he refers to as "Stoner Pop." Each track sees Ross Jack taking his creativity to the next level as his charismatic performance on the mic adapts to the album's wide-range of production styles. From the chilled-out haunting vibes of "Fall," to the irresistible high energy pop-rap anthem "Gold Plated," followed up with the dancehall reggae vibes of "Burning Man," the album's diverse beats and production allow Ross to tackle a variety of emotions applying his own exciting sound. Ross Jack succeeds by continuously blurring the lines between musical genres, creating an album that would appeal to fans of the electro-pop sounds of The Weeknd, and the smoked out swagger-filled bars of Mac Miller alike. Backed by lush production and massive hooks, 'Self Medicated' establishes Ross Jack as an artist to watch in 2017.

Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice Form
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") is a United States copyright law that provides guidelines for online service providers in case of copyright infringement. Below is the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to us as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the DMCA, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office website, http://www.copyright.gov.
To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide us with the items specified below. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that the material is infringing your copyright. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
This notice and any attachments we receive will be forwarded to the alleged infringer, who will then have the opportunity to file a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Should a properly filed counter notification be filed, you will be notified and have 10 business days within which to file for a restraining order in Federal Court to prevent the reinstatement of the material.

Lulu abides by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"), which governs how we are to treat claims of copyright infringement. If someone believes in good faith that a Lulu Account Holder has infringed their copyright, they can request that we take down the infringing material by filing a DMCA Notice. To file a DMCA Notice with Lulu, click on the button "Continue".
We reserve the right to ignore a Notice that is not in compliance with the DMCA. When a clear and valid Notice is received pursuant to the guidelines, we will respond by either taking down the allegedly infringing content or blocking access to it, and we may also contact you for more information.
If you are not the copyright holder or its agent and if the content is clearly infringing the copyright of a well-known work, please select "Infringes a well-known work" from the dropdown menu.
