Colo. L. Rev. 623 (1996).Greg loves that his clients are innovators who look at the world and try to improve it by making things better, faster, cheaper, and more accessible. He combines a passion for advocating and a fascination with technology to help his clients acquire and use their intellectual property portfolios as a critical component of their overall business strategy.Currently the Chair of Merchant & Gould's Electrical & Software Group and Co-Chair of the Licensing Group, Greg's practice is focused on counseling clients in acquiring, protecting and leveraging their investment in innovation. Greg has prosecuted patents and negotiated agreements relating to a variety of technologies, including software, internet telephony, telecommunications, mechanical and sports inventions, and financial services systems. Greg is also experienced in patent, trademark, and trade secret litigation, patent and trademark prosecution, validity and infringement opinions, and due diligence.Prior to joining Merchant & Gould, Greg spent six years as General Counsel, first for an internet teleconferencing company and then for an enterprise software firm. In addition to drafting and prosecuting patent applications, Greg counseled both firms on how to protect and leverage their technologies by negotiating license, maintenance, collaboration, consulting, outsourcing, and other agreements. His in-house experience helps him understand his clients' motivations and pressures and how he can best provide what they need in a timely and cost-efficient manner.Greg started his career as a patent examiner in the USPTO, and he worked as a patent agent before and during law school. Greg uses his first-hand knowledge of how examiners think to creatively craft successful patent applications and to develop relationships with examiners in the office. Greg is an avid golfer, fly fisherman, and attendee at his two sons' various sporting events.Representative CasesNegotiated sale of private Internet-telephony company and all intellectual property into international, publicly traded equipment provider.Negotiated high-value enterprise-software licenses, maintenance agreements, and professional services contracts with leading financial services companies.Managed prosecution of large portfolio of strategically important patent applications for leading software provider.Performed due diligence and evaluated impact of acquiring a company that distributes open-source code.Settled potential patent litigation with negotiated license for document-recognition technology.Managed defense of "bet-the-company" litigation relating to IP transfer and professional services, resulting in a win on all claims and counterclaims.Performed IP audits and increased internal patent disclosures through patent-incentive programs.Judicial ClerkshipLaw clerk for the Honorable Lewis T.

Prior to joining Aytu BioScience on a full-time basis, he split his time between Aytu and Ampio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. from April 2015 until June 2017.  Prior to joining Ampio Pharmaceuticals in June 2014, he provided financial and operational consulting services to the biotech industry through his consulting company, Gould, LLC.

Mr. Gould began his career as an auditor with Arthur Andersen, LLP. He currently serves on the board of directors of CytoDyn, Inc., a publicly traded drug development company pursuing anti-viral agents for the treatment of HIV. Mr. Gould graduated from the University of Colorado with a BS in Business Administration and is a Certified Public Accountant.Read MoreGreg Gould stated, "I'm pleased to be joining Josh and Jarrett Disbrow, along with the entire Aytu team, in a full-time capacity.  These past two years have been rewarding, and I look forward to dedicating much more time to executing our growth plans.  I'm confident in the people we've attracted, the products we've acquired, and the business plan we have put in place over the past two years, and I believe Aytu is poised for commercial success and substantial growth in the near future." About Aytu BioScience, Inc.

Peer Reviews




About Peer Rating
Martindale-Hubbell® Peer Review Ratings™ are the gold standard in attorney ratings, and have been for more than a century. These ratings indicate attorneys who are widely respected by their peers for their ethical standards and legal expertise in a specific area of practice.


The Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings process is the gold standard due to its objectivity and comprehensiveness. Lawyers solicited for peer reviews include both those selected by the attorney being reviewed and lawyers independently selected by Martindale-Hubbell. All reviewers are verified as attorneys through Martindale-Hubbell's extensive attorney database. Only attorneys practicing at least three years and receiving a sufficient number of reviews from non-affiliated attorneys are eligible to receive a Rating.
What are the different Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings?
AV Preeminent®: The highest peer rating standard. This rating signifies that a large number of the lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence for their legal knowledge, communication skills and ethical standards.
Distinguished: An excellent rating for a lawyer with some experience. This rating indicates the attorney is widely respected by their peers for high professional achievement and ethical standards.
Notable: This rating indicates that the lawyer has been recognized by a large number of their peers for strong ethical standards.
Lawyers who have received peer reviews after 2009 will display more detailed information, including practice areas, summary ratings, detailed numeric ratings and written feedback (if available). Details for individual reviews received before 2009 are not displayed.
Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.

Client Reviews 


About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.

I met with Mr. Gregory he was recommended by a family member that is also a lawyer. He told me he only takes cases that he knows he can win and he took my case. I don't have to pay anything if I don't win my case.
