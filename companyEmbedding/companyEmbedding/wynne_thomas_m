Tom Wynne is General Counsel to Mormac Marine Group, Inc. and related entities including:
                  The Interlake Steamship Company, which operates a fleet of self-unloading bulk carriers
                  on the Great Lakes; SeaStreak, LLC, which operates high speed passenger ferries between
                  Monmouth County, New Jersey and Manhattan; and New England Fast Ferry Company, which
                  operates high speed passenger ferries between New Bedford, Massachusetts and Martha’s
                  Vineyard. Previously, Mr. Wynne was a partner in the Cleveland, Ohio law firm of Ray,
                  Robinson, Carle & Davies P.L.L., which along with its predecessor firms dating back
                  to 1890 is the second oldest law firm in Cleveland and the oldest firm practicing
                  maritime law in Cleveland. While at the firm, Mr. Wynne concentrated his practice
                  in the areas of admiralty and maritime law, representing both local and international
                  vessel owners and their respective insurers.
               
Mr. Wynne earned his undergraduate degree, with honors, in Marine Transportation Management/Business
                  Administration from the State University of New York Maritime College (B.S. 1990),
                  where he also earned minors in Marine Operations and International Business. As part
                  of his undergraduate education, Mr. Wynne participated in three summer sea terms and
                  passed a rigorous United States Coast Guard license examination, earning him a United
                  States Coast Guard issued merchant mariner’s license as Third Mate of Steam and Motor
                  Vessels, Unlimited Gross Tonnage upon Open Oceans.
               
After graduation from Maritime College, Mr. Wynne utilized his Coast Guard license
                  and sailed as second officer aboard the M/V Biehl Trader, a 210-foot escort vessel based in Valdez, Alaska, and as third officer aboard the
                  M/V OMI Star, a 660-foot chemical tanker engaged in domestic trade, before starting law school.
               
Mr. Wynne received his law degree, magna cum laude, from the University of Toledo College of Law (J.D. 1994), where he was Order of
                  the Coif, a Student Articles Editor of the University of Toledo Law Review, and recipient
                  of the American Jurisprudence Award in Trial Practice.
               
Mr. Wynne clerked with his former firm between his second and third years of law school,
                  went to work there as an associate after graduating from law school in 1994, and became
                  a principal in the firm in January of 2000. He left the firm to accept his current
                  position in January of 2008, and his maritime work continues to include the defense
                  of shipboard personal injury claims, marine related property damage claims, and transactional
                  work including the sale, purchase and charter of vessels.
               
Mr. Wynne is admitted to practice in the Ohio Supreme Court, the United States District
                  Courts for the Northern District of Ohio, Eastern District of Michigan, Western District
                  of Michigan and Northern District of Indiana, and the United States Courts of Appeals
                  for the Sixth and Seventh Circuits, and is a member of the Association of Corporate
                  Counsel, the Cleveland Bar Association and the Maritime Law Association of the United
                  States, from which he has attained the status of Proctor in Admiralty.
               
Mr. Wynne teaches Admiralty Law, which is useful for any practice proximate to navigable
                  waters, and which surveys admiralty jurisdiction, rights and liabilities of commercial
                  and pleasure boat owners, rights of injured maritime workers and passengers, collision,
                  salvage, maritime liens, cargo claims, and limitation of liability.

Wells Fargo


                                            I find it quite disturbing to see 24 one star, the lowest, ratings on the first page of Wallet Hub's most recent reviews of Wells Fargo. Somehow, in its overall summary, Wallet Hub still gives the impression Wells Fargo is a good banking option. What's going on here?

Navy Federal Credit Union nRewards® Credit Card

                                            It is my opinion that you would do better to find a different company. In the long run they will charge you plenty and the support is virtually non-existent. They don't even have a working answering system. They are disorganized  and a nightmare to work with.

Making simple transfers or even looking at accounts is harder and more confusing. bring back the old version.

If the company isn't reporting the account correctly, you can submit a dispute to the credit bureaus asking them to correct it.

If you were a grad victim you don't need to fill out a fraud package. Google it. And send it to the credit bureaus.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.

Are there really companies you can pay that guarantee to raise your credit score in 2 months or less or they'll double your money back?
