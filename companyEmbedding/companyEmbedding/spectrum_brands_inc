Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc. is an American diversified company established in 2005 as the successor company to Rayovac Corporation. Rayovac had been located in Wisconsin since its conception as The French Battery Company in 1906. Rayovac, as a division of Spectrum Brands, remained headquartered in Madison, Wisconsin, along with Remington even while the parent company, Spectrum Brands, was headquartered in Georgia. On April 15, 2010 Spectrum Brands announced that it would be moving Corporate Headquarters back to Madison, WI. Spectrum Brands moved its Headquarters to Middleton, WI in October 2013.
The company manufactures and markets batteries under the Rayovac and Varta brand names, home appliances under the Remington, Russell Hobbs and George Foreman brand names, lawn and garden care products under the Spectracide and Garden Safe brand names, insect repellents under the Cutter and Repel brand names.[3] Spectrum owns several pet care companies both in the aquarium supply and companion animal trades. In the aquarium business, Spectrum owns Tetra, Whisper, Marineland, Perfecto, Jungle, Instant Ocean, Visi-Therm, and other product lines. Companion animal lines consist of Dingo, Lazy Pet, Wonderbox, and others. Both aquarium lines and companion lines are concentrated into Spectrum's United Pet Group based in Cincinnati, Ohio.

History[edit]




Ray-O-Vac D-size battery


In 1906, the French Battery Co. was founded in Madison, Wisconsin, by James Bowen Ramsay (1869-1952), with Alfred Landau as its first president. In 1910, Landau was replaced by C.F. Burgess, and the company became profitable. After a fire destroyed the plant in 1915, Burgess left to found his own company. Production rose during the First World War, and by 1920, the French company had US$2.74 million in sales and 600 employees, and 1000 employees in 1931.[4]
In 1930, the company name was changed to Ray-O-Vac, an allusion to the then-new technology of vacuum tubes and electron rays. In 1933, the company patented the first wearable vacuum tube hearing aid.[5]
During its ownership by the parent company of ESB Industrials, a British subsidiary was established to manufacture and market batteries in the United Kingdom under the Ray-O-Vac name. This operation ceased in 1972; Ray-O-Vac batteries continued to be marketed, although they were manufactured by the British Ever Ready company.[citation needed] In 1988, the name was simplified to Rayovac.
Diversification and name change[edit]
In 2003, Rayovac decided to diversify,[3] and acquired non-battery related businesses including Remington Products and United Pet Group. In 2004, Rayovac successfully underbid Energizer (Eveready) as RadioShack's battery supplier and produced the "Enercell" brand of battery sold exclusively at RadioShack. In January 2005, Rayovac purchased United Industries Corporation for about $476 million in cash and stock. Brands included in United Industries were Vigoro, Spectracide and Sta-Green lawn products, Cutter, Hot Shot and Repel insect control products and pet supply products with the Marineland, Perfecto, and Eight in One brands.[6] In 2005, Tetra, a major provider of pet-fish products, was acquired. This diversification prompted the name change from Rayovac to Spectrum Brands.[3]
Rayovac also bought other battery companies including Varta, Ningbo Baowang and Microlite S.A.. The Microlite acquisition included the rights to the Rayovac name in Brazil, giving the company worldwide rights to the Rayovac name.[7] With this acquisition, Rayovac consolidated its presence in the majority of countries in Latin America. Rayovac is a well recognized brand in this region.
Heavily leveraged in debt, Spectrum attempted to sell its pet division (United Pet Group) containing aquarium products and supplies under the Tetra, Marineland, Instant Ocean and Jungle brand names, and pet care products under the Dingo, Firstrax, 8 in 1 and Nature's Miracles brand names. Appliance maker Salton, owned by hedge fund Harbinger Capital, agreed to pay approximately $692 million cash to purchase the pet care division, but the deal collapsed on July 14, 2008. According to Forbes and The Wall Street Journal, the sale was rejected by Spectrum's own key lenders, most likely because the deal valued the brands for less than what the bankers considered them to be worth.[citation needed]
On February 3, 2009, Spectrum filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.[8] The company later emerged from bankruptcy on August 28, 2009.[2][9] Since emerging from Chapter 11, Spectrum has announced year-over-year increases in sales and adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of their fiscal 2010.
Russell Hobbs Inc.[edit]
Spectrum Brands finalized a merger with Russell Hobbs Inc. (formerly known as Salton, Inc.) on June 16, 2010, to form a new $3 billion consumer products company. Russell Hobbs' brands include George Foreman Grill, Toastmaster, Black & Decker Home appliances, and Russell Hobbs.
Armored AutoGroup[edit]
On April 28, 2015, Spectrum Brands entered the automotive supply business by acquiring Armored AutoGroup which makes Armor All finishes and STP automotive chemicals among other products.[10]
Battery products[edit]

On February 3, 2009, Spectrum filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.[8] The company later emerged from bankruptcy on August 28, 2009.[2][9] Since emerging from Chapter 11, Spectrum has announced year-over-year increases in sales and adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of their fiscal 2010.
Russell Hobbs Inc.[edit]
Spectrum Brands finalized a merger with Russell Hobbs Inc. (formerly known as Salton, Inc.) on June 16, 2010, to form a new $3 billion consumer products company. Russell Hobbs' brands include George Foreman Grill, Toastmaster, Black & Decker Home appliances, and Russell Hobbs.
Armored AutoGroup[edit]
On April 28, 2015, Spectrum Brands entered the automotive supply business by acquiring Armored AutoGroup which makes Armor All finishes and STP automotive chemicals among other products.[10]

Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc. is an American diversified company established in 2005 as the successor company to Rayovac Corporation. Rayovac had been located in Wisconsin since its conception as The French Battery Company in 1906. Rayovac, as a division of Spectrum Brands, remained headquartered in Madison, Wisconsin, along with Remington even while the parent company, Spectrum Brands, was headquartered in Georgia. On April 15, 2010 Spectrum Brands announced that it would be moving Corporate Headquarters back to Madison, WI. Spectrum Brands moved its Headquarters to Middleton, WI in October 2013.
The company manufactures and markets batteries under the Rayovac and Varta brand names, home appliances under the Remington, Russell Hobbs and George Foreman brand names, lawn and garden care products under the Spectracide and Garden Safe brand names, insect repellents under the Cutter and Repel brand names.[3] Spectrum owns several pet care companies both in the aquarium supply and companion animal trades. In the aquarium business, Spectrum owns Tetra, Whisper, Marineland, Perfecto, Jungle, Instant Ocean, Visi-Therm, and other product lines. Companion animal lines consist of Dingo, Lazy Pet, Wonderbox, and others. Both aquarium lines and companion lines are concentrated into Spectrum's United Pet Group based in Cincinnati, Ohio.

History[edit]




Ray-O-Vac D-size battery


In 1906, the French Battery Co. was founded in Madison, Wisconsin, by James Bowen Ramsay (1869-1952), with Alfred Landau as its first president. In 1910, Landau was replaced by C.F. Burgess, and the company became profitable. After a fire destroyed the plant in 1915, Burgess left to found his own company. Production rose during the First World War, and by 1920, the French company had US$2.74 million in sales and 600 employees, and 1000 employees in 1931.[4]
In 1930, the company name was changed to Ray-O-Vac, an allusion to the then-new technology of vacuum tubes and electron rays. In 1933, the company patented the first wearable vacuum tube hearing aid.[5]
During its ownership by the parent company of ESB Industrials, a British subsidiary was established to manufacture and market batteries in the United Kingdom under the Ray-O-Vac name. This operation ceased in 1972; Ray-O-Vac batteries continued to be marketed, although they were manufactured by the British Ever Ready company.[citation needed] In 1988, the name was simplified to Rayovac.
Diversification and name change[edit]
In 2003, Rayovac decided to diversify,[3] and acquired non-battery related businesses including Remington Products and United Pet Group. In 2004, Rayovac successfully underbid Energizer (Eveready) as RadioShack's battery supplier and produced the "Enercell" brand of battery sold exclusively at RadioShack. In January 2005, Rayovac purchased United Industries Corporation for about $476 million in cash and stock. Brands included in United Industries were Vigoro, Spectracide and Sta-Green lawn products, Cutter, Hot Shot and Repel insect control products and pet supply products with the Marineland, Perfecto, and Eight in One brands.[6] In 2005, Tetra, a major provider of pet-fish products, was acquired. This diversification prompted the name change from Rayovac to Spectrum Brands.[3]
Rayovac also bought other battery companies including Varta, Ningbo Baowang and Microlite S.A.. The Microlite acquisition included the rights to the Rayovac name in Brazil, giving the company worldwide rights to the Rayovac name.[7] With this acquisition, Rayovac consolidated its presence in the majority of countries in Latin America. Rayovac is a well recognized brand in this region.
Heavily leveraged in debt, Spectrum attempted to sell its pet division (United Pet Group) containing aquarium products and supplies under the Tetra, Marineland, Instant Ocean and Jungle brand names, and pet care products under the Dingo, Firstrax, 8 in 1 and Nature's Miracles brand names. Appliance maker Salton, owned by hedge fund Harbinger Capital, agreed to pay approximately $692 million cash to purchase the pet care division, but the deal collapsed on July 14, 2008. According to Forbes and The Wall Street Journal, the sale was rejected by Spectrum's own key lenders, most likely because the deal valued the brands for less than what the bankers considered them to be worth.[citation needed]
On February 3, 2009, Spectrum filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.[8] The company later emerged from bankruptcy on August 28, 2009.[2][9] Since emerging from Chapter 11, Spectrum has announced year-over-year increases in sales and adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of their fiscal 2010.
Russell Hobbs Inc.[edit]
Spectrum Brands finalized a merger with Russell Hobbs Inc. (formerly known as Salton, Inc.) on June 16, 2010, to form a new $3 billion consumer products company. Russell Hobbs' brands include George Foreman Grill, Toastmaster, Black & Decker Home appliances, and Russell Hobbs.
Armored AutoGroup[edit]
On April 28, 2015, Spectrum Brands entered the automotive supply business by acquiring Armored AutoGroup which makes Armor All finishes and STP automotive chemicals among other products.[10]

Announcement


View Product Photos




United Pet Group, a division of Spectrum Brands, Inc. is voluntarily recalling multiple brands of packages of rawhide dog chew products that were distributed to retail outlets and sold online in the U.S. The recall involves the brands and products described below.
The recall was initiated after  United Pet Group identified that certain of its rawhide chew manufacturing facilities located in Mexico and Colombia, as well as one of its suppliers in Brazil, were using a quaternary ammonium compound mixture as a processing aid in the manufacturing of rawhide chews. The compound is an anti-microbial chemical that is approved for cleaning food processing equipment, but it has not been approved in the U.S. as a processing aid in the production of rawhide chews for dogs.
United Pet Group received very limited reports of pet illness based on the volume of possibly affected rawhide chew products manufactured and distributed. The primary complaint received from consumers was that the affected product had an unpleasant odor. Diarrhea and vomiting were also reported.
Exposure to quaternary ammonium compounds through direct ingestion may cause the following symptoms in dogs: reduced appetite, and gastric irritation including diarrhea and vomiting. These symptoms may require treatment by a veterinarian depending on severity.
The affected product was distributed nationwide from United Pet Group’s Edwardsville, Illinois distribution facility and was delivered to consumers through various retail establishments including online outlets. All of the dog chew products included in the voluntary recall identify an expiration date ranging from 06/01/2019 through 05/31/2020 located on the back of the package.
The products subject to the recall are described below.

"Supporting pet retailers is one of the most important parts of what we do. We make a concerted effort to continue pushing ourselves and innovating so they have the tools and support to help their customers create meaningful, enjoyable experiences with their pets," said John Pailthorp, Vice President of Marketing, Spectrum Brands, Inc. – Pet, Home & Garden Division. 
Spectrum Brands, Inc. – Pet, Home & Garden invites attendees to touch, feel and see how its portfolio of pet care solutions work together to grow the connection between pets and their "parents" through a more meaningful and enriching experience. Its Aquatics division will be represented by Tetra® brand, Marineland® and Instant Ocean®. Its Companion Animal division will be represented by Nature's Miracle®, Healthy Hide®, Pro·Sense®, LitterMaid®, Dingo®, FURminator®, Perfect Coat®, Wild Harvest™ and eCOTRITION™.
Innovating the Aquatic Experience
To whet the appetite for innovations in aquatics, the Spectrum Brands, Inc. – Pet, Home & Garden booth will feature engaging videos showing the latest technologies and aquatic mobile apps, introduce new products and marketing tools to support the retailers and showcase a recent scientific breakthrough through the University of Florida Tropical Aquaculture Laboratory (UFTAL). 

Celebrating Heritage, Innovating the Future of Fishkeeping Tetra® and Marineland® are celebrating years of aquatics industry heritage at our booth with a timeline showcasing how we have innovated and evolved. While we are rooted in history, the future of fishkeeping is a focus as well. Tetra® and GloFish® brands will showcase new programs designed to introduce potential hobbyists of all ages to fishkeeping with educational content, new GloFish® characters and Macaroni Kid events. 
Experiencing a GloFish® GalleryPet retailers can Experience the Glo® in a darkened room dedicated to GloFish® Fluorescent Fish, offering a very unique aquatic experience. A live aquarium will be filled with brilliantly-colored tetras, barbs and danios and the latest GloFish® line décor and accessories. Under the new GloFish® Cycle Light, visitors will watch the environment transform before their eyes. The GloFish® Color-Changing Background, Plants and Ornaments change colors as the lighting rotates through a cycle of blue LED, black LED and white light. 
Innovating Aquatics with Tetra® Brand My Aquarium AppThe video for Tetra® brand My Aquarium App will show the latest innovations that aquatic retailers can offer customers to keep them organized and makes maintenance simpler so they have more time on their hands to enjoy their fish.  To demonstrate the My Aquarium App experience, a station of tablets will be available to show its features including instant recommendations as well as custom notifications for food dispensing, water changes, water testing, filtration, etc.  Additionally, visitors can watch the YouTube video campaign, featuring The Bergmans, a big and busy family who uses the My Aquarium App to make aquarium maintenance easier and have fishkeeping expertise at their fingertips to maintain their beautiful, healthy aquarium. 
Instant Ocean® Features UFTAL's breakthrough culturing First Pacific Blue Tang in captivityInstant Ocean® will feature presentations from members of the team of scientists from the University of Florida's Tropical Aquaculture Laboratory (UFTAL) who were the first to breed Pacific Blue Tangs (Paracanthurus hepatus) in captivity in an aquatic environment using Instant Ocean®. Assistant Professor Dr. Matthew DiMaggio and Assistant Extension Scientist Eric Cassiano will present from 2 p.m. – 2:30 p.m. on March 22 and March 23, 2017, which will also be streamed live on Facebook. They will share their perspectives on this historic achievement. Attendees will have direct access to ask questions, see photos and footage, and learn insights on how captive propagation could affect commercial production protocols and conservation efforts in the future.

Improving the Pet Owner Experience
Because dogs, cats, birds, and small animals are all big parts of the personal and professional lives of Global Pet Expo attendees, the Spectrum Brands, Inc. – Pet, Home & Garden booth will also host attractive, interactive displays that introduce new Companion Animal packaging and formulations. The theme of the Companion Animal displays is interaction, so the booth will have sensory stations for our Nature's Miracle®, LitterMaid®, Pro·Sense®, Healthy Hide® and Digest-eeze™ brands. 

Promoting a Balance Between Pet Parenting and Home OwnershipTo continue its "Trust the Miracle" campaign, Nature's Miracle® will demonstrate how "Pet Parents Can Have Nice Things." The beautiful white lounge of the Nature's Miracle® area announces new formulas for long-term odor elimination, as well as new delivery systems for cleaning carpet. As a long-standing cornerstone product, Nature's Miracle® will proudly debut its new packaging to give visitors a glimpse at the evolving design of the brand. 
Catering to Cat LoversBecause every cat has different litter box needs, LitterMaid® and Nature's Miracle® are highlighting the range of litter products available for consumers to deal with the toughest litter box odors. The area also details the ways pet retailers can educate their consumers on proper usage of litter. 
Treating Dogs RightHealthy Hide® and Digest-eeze™ have teamed up to bring pet retailers up close and personal with their lines of gourmet dog treats. This area focuses on digestive health and lists each product's number of ingredients, recommended age for feeding, chew time, digestibility and added benefits. Under this display, visitors will be able to examine and interact with each line's products and packaging. 
Providing Affordable Care Products for PetsExpanding on the interaction theme of Companion Animal, Pro·Sense® is bringing its dental, itch and joint health solutions out for display. Visitors will get to check out a video and the new look of each product. This area promotes the idea that pet owners can use Pro·Sense® products to care for their pets the same way they take care of themselves. 
Solving the Pet Hair ProblemEducation is the most important part in the fight against pet hair. That's why the FURminator® area details the grooming tasks pet parents should perform daily, weekly and monthly. Each activity is tied to FURminator® products, so visitors will know the proper grooming regimen and solutions to recommend to consumers. To help pet retailers understand FURminator® consumers even better, this area profiles the "FURminator® ProSumer," the individual most likely to seek out pet grooming products and education. 
Making Pets Jump for JoyThe lively Dingo® display wastes no time showing why the right assortment and selection of rawhide dog bones, dog chews and dog treats can increase sales. This area shows off the new look of Dingo® packaging for its flavored/standard rawhide, rawhide alternative, benefit added, and its soft, chewy and crunchy varieties. Visitors will also learn consumer statistics they can use to strategize their store's product offerings.

United Pet Group, a division of Spectrum Brands, Inc. is voluntarily expanding its recall of multiple brands of packages of rawhide dog chew products to include our retail partners’ private label brands. The recall involves the brands and products described below.United Pet Group previously initiated a voluntary recall of its branded products on 6/10/17 which included the following brands: American Beefhide, Digest-eeze, and Healthy Hide (including Healthy Hide – Good -n- Fun and Healthy Hide – Good -n- Fit).The recall was initiated after  United Pet Group identified that certain of its rawhide chew manufacturing facilities located in Mexico and Colombia, as well as one of its suppliers in Brazil, were using a quaternary ammonium compound mixture as a processing aid in the manufacturing of rawhide chews. The compound is an anti-microbial chemical that is approved for cleaning food processing equipment, but it has not been approved in the U.S. as a processing aid in the production of rawhide chews for dogs.United Pet Group received very limited reports of pet illness based on the volume of possibly affected rawhide chew products manufactured and distributed. The primary complaint received from consumers was that the affected product had an unpleasant odor. Diarrhea and vomiting were also reported.Exposure to quaternary ammonium compounds through direct ingestion may cause the following symptoms in dogs: reduced appetite and gastric irritation, including diarrhea and vomiting. These symptoms may require treatment by a veterinarian depending on severity.The affected product was distributed nationwide from United Pet Group’s Edwardsville, Illinois distribution facility and was delivered to consumers through various retail establishments, including online outlets. All of the dog chew products included in the voluntary recall identify an expiration date ranging from 06/01/2019 through 5/31/2020 located on the  back of the package with the exception of the Enzadent and Dentahex products which are listed by UPC codes below and specific expiration dates outlined below.The private label products subject to the recall are described below.Private Label Product BrandsPrivate Label Product Names and Identifying InformationCompanionUnited Pet Group is recalling certain packages of dog chews with the Companion brand on the label.This recall is limited to dog chew products that contain rawhide.

Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc. is an American diversified company established in 2005 as the successor company to Rayovac Corporation. Rayovac had been located in Wisconsin since its conception as The French Battery Company in 1906. Rayovac, as a division of Spectrum Brands, remained headquartered in Madison, Wisconsin, along with Remington even while the parent company, Spectrum Brands, was headquartered in Georgia. On April 15, 2010 Spectrum Brands announced that it would be moving Corporate Headquarters back to Madison, WI. Spectrum Brands moved its Headquarters to Middleton, WI in October 2013.
The company manufactures and markets batteries under the Rayovac and Varta brand names, home appliances under the Remington, Russell Hobbs and George Foreman brand names, lawn and garden care products under the Spectracide and Garden Safe brand names, insect repellents under the Cutter and Repel brand names.[3] Spectrum owns several pet care companies both in the aquarium supply and companion animal trades. In the aquarium business, Spectrum owns Tetra, Whisper, Marineland, Perfecto, Jungle, Instant Ocean, Visi-Therm, and other product lines. Companion animal lines consist of Dingo, Lazy Pet, Wonderbox, and others. Both aquarium lines and companion lines are concentrated into Spectrum's United Pet Group based in Cincinnati, Ohio.

History[edit]




Ray-O-Vac D-size battery


In 1906, the French Battery Co. was founded in Madison, Wisconsin, by James Bowen Ramsay (1869-1952), with Alfred Landau as its first president. In 1910, Landau was replaced by C.F. Burgess, and the company became profitable. After a fire destroyed the plant in 1915, Burgess left to found his own company. Production rose during the First World War, and by 1920, the French company had US$2.74 million in sales and 600 employees, and 1000 employees in 1931.[4]
In 1930, the company name was changed to Ray-O-Vac, an allusion to the then-new technology of vacuum tubes and electron rays. In 1933, the company patented the first wearable vacuum tube hearing aid.[5]
During its ownership by the parent company of ESB Industrials, a British subsidiary was established to manufacture and market batteries in the United Kingdom under the Ray-O-Vac name. This operation ceased in 1972; Ray-O-Vac batteries continued to be marketed, although they were manufactured by the British Ever Ready company.[citation needed] In 1988, the name was simplified to Rayovac.
Diversification and name change[edit]
In 2003, Rayovac decided to diversify,[3] and acquired non-battery related businesses including Remington Products and United Pet Group. In 2004, Rayovac successfully underbid Energizer (Eveready) as RadioShack's battery supplier and produced the "Enercell" brand of battery sold exclusively at RadioShack. In January 2005, Rayovac purchased United Industries Corporation for about $476 million in cash and stock. Brands included in United Industries were Vigoro, Spectracide and Sta-Green lawn products, Cutter, Hot Shot and Repel insect control products and pet supply products with the Marineland, Perfecto, and Eight in One brands.[6] In 2005, Tetra, a major provider of pet-fish products, was acquired. This diversification prompted the name change from Rayovac to Spectrum Brands.[3]
Rayovac also bought other battery companies including Varta, Ningbo Baowang and Microlite S.A.. The Microlite acquisition included the rights to the Rayovac name in Brazil, giving the company worldwide rights to the Rayovac name.[7] With this acquisition, Rayovac consolidated its presence in the majority of countries in Latin America. Rayovac is a well recognized brand in this region.
Heavily leveraged in debt, Spectrum attempted to sell its pet division (United Pet Group) containing aquarium products and supplies under the Tetra, Marineland, Instant Ocean and Jungle brand names, and pet care products under the Dingo, Firstrax, 8 in 1 and Nature's Miracles brand names. Appliance maker Salton, owned by hedge fund Harbinger Capital, agreed to pay approximately $692 million cash to purchase the pet care division, but the deal collapsed on July 14, 2008. According to Forbes and The Wall Street Journal, the sale was rejected by Spectrum's own key lenders, most likely because the deal valued the brands for less than what the bankers considered them to be worth.[citation needed]
On February 3, 2009, Spectrum filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.[8] The company later emerged from bankruptcy on August 28, 2009.[2][9] Since emerging from Chapter 11, Spectrum has announced year-over-year increases in sales and adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of their fiscal 2010.
Russell Hobbs Inc.[edit]
Spectrum Brands finalized a merger with Russell Hobbs Inc. (formerly known as Salton, Inc.) on June 16, 2010, to form a new $3 billion consumer products company. Russell Hobbs' brands include George Foreman Grill, Toastmaster, Black & Decker Home appliances, and Russell Hobbs.
Armored AutoGroup[edit]
On April 28, 2015, Spectrum Brands entered the automotive supply business by acquiring Armored AutoGroup which makes Armor All finishes and STP automotive chemicals among other products.[10]
Battery products[edit]

Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc. is an American diversified company established in 2005 as the successor company to Rayovac Corporation. Rayovac had been located in Wisconsin since its conception as The French Battery Company in 1906. Rayovac, as a division of Spectrum Brands, remained headquartered in Madison, Wisconsin, along with Remington even while the parent company, Spectrum Brands, was headquartered in Georgia. On April 15, 2010 Spectrum Brands announced that it would be moving Corporate Headquarters back to Madison, WI. Spectrum Brands moved its Headquarters to Middleton, WI in October 2013.
The company manufactures and markets batteries under the Rayovac and Varta brand names, home appliances under the Remington, Russell Hobbs and George Foreman brand names, lawn and garden care products under the Spectracide and Garden Safe brand names, insect repellents under the Cutter and Repel brand names.[3] Spectrum owns several pet care companies both in the aquarium supply and companion animal trades. In the aquarium business, Spectrum owns Tetra, Whisper, Marineland, Perfecto, Jungle, Instant Ocean, Visi-Therm, and other product lines. Companion animal lines consist of Dingo, Lazy Pet, Wonderbox, and others. Both aquarium lines and companion lines are concentrated into Spectrum's United Pet Group based in Cincinnati, Ohio.

History[edit]




Ray-O-Vac D-size battery


In 1906, the French Battery Co. was founded in Madison, Wisconsin, by James Bowen Ramsay (1869-1952), with Alfred Landau as its first president. In 1910, Landau was replaced by C.F. Burgess, and the company became profitable. After a fire destroyed the plant in 1915, Burgess left to found his own company. Production rose during the First World War, and by 1920, the French company had US$2.74 million in sales and 600 employees, and 1000 employees in 1931.[4]
In 1930, the company name was changed to Ray-O-Vac, an allusion to the then-new technology of vacuum tubes and electron rays. In 1933, the company patented the first wearable vacuum tube hearing aid.[5]
During its ownership by the parent company of ESB Industrials, a British subsidiary was established to manufacture and market batteries in the United Kingdom under the Ray-O-Vac name. This operation ceased in 1972; Ray-O-Vac batteries continued to be marketed, although they were manufactured by the British Ever Ready company.[citation needed] In 1988, the name was simplified to Rayovac.
Diversification and name change[edit]
In 2003, Rayovac decided to diversify,[3] and acquired non-battery related businesses including Remington Products and United Pet Group. In 2004, Rayovac successfully underbid Energizer (Eveready) as RadioShack's battery supplier and produced the "Enercell" brand of battery sold exclusively at RadioShack. In January 2005, Rayovac purchased United Industries Corporation for about $476 million in cash and stock. Brands included in United Industries were Vigoro, Spectracide and Sta-Green lawn products, Cutter, Hot Shot and Repel insect control products and pet supply products with the Marineland, Perfecto, and Eight in One brands.[6] In 2005, Tetra, a major provider of pet-fish products, was acquired. This diversification prompted the name change from Rayovac to Spectrum Brands.[3]
Rayovac also bought other battery companies including Varta, Ningbo Baowang and Microlite S.A.. The Microlite acquisition included the rights to the Rayovac name in Brazil, giving the company worldwide rights to the Rayovac name.[7] With this acquisition, Rayovac consolidated its presence in the majority of countries in Latin America. Rayovac is a well recognized brand in this region.
Heavily leveraged in debt, Spectrum attempted to sell its pet division (United Pet Group) containing aquarium products and supplies under the Tetra, Marineland, Instant Ocean and Jungle brand names, and pet care products under the Dingo, Firstrax, 8 in 1 and Nature's Miracles brand names. Appliance maker Salton, owned by hedge fund Harbinger Capital, agreed to pay approximately $692 million cash to purchase the pet care division, but the deal collapsed on July 14, 2008. According to Forbes and The Wall Street Journal, the sale was rejected by Spectrum's own key lenders, most likely because the deal valued the brands for less than what the bankers considered them to be worth.[citation needed]
On February 3, 2009, Spectrum filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.[8] The company later emerged from bankruptcy on August 28, 2009.[2][9] Since emerging from Chapter 11, Spectrum has announced year-over-year increases in sales and adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of their fiscal 2010.
Russell Hobbs Inc.[edit]
Spectrum Brands finalized a merger with Russell Hobbs Inc. (formerly known as Salton, Inc.) on June 16, 2010, to form a new $3 billion consumer products company. Russell Hobbs' brands include George Foreman Grill, Toastmaster, Black & Decker Home appliances, and Russell Hobbs.
Armored AutoGroup[edit]
On April 28, 2015, Spectrum Brands entered the automotive supply business by acquiring Armored AutoGroup which makes Armor All finishes and STP automotive chemicals among other products.[10]
Battery products[edit]




Rayovac 1.5V 'C' battery


Rayovac manufactures alkaline batteries ranging in size from AAA to 9V, rechargeable NiMH batteries, hearing aid batteries, lithium photo batteries, specialty batteries and portable power chargers. In addition, a variety of portable LED flashlights and lanterns are produced under the Rayovac brand.[11]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
