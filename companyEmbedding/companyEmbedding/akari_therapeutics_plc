GBS































AKARI THERAPEUTICS PLCA Revolution in Treating ComplementGBS
Guillain Barré syndrome (GBS)
Guillain Barré syndrome is an acute immune-mediated polyneuropathy where the immune system is triggered into attacking the myelin sheath surrounding nerves, leading to progressive, fairly symmetric muscle weakness accompanied by absent or depressed deep tendon reflexes. Patients usually present a few days to a week after onset of symptoms. The weakness can vary from mild difficulty with walking to nearly complete paralysis of all extremities, facial, respiratory, and bulbar muscles.
Guillain-Barré syndrome occurs worldwide, with an overall incidence of one to two per 100,000 per year, and over 6,000 patients admitted to US hospitals with a primary diagnosis of GBS every year. While all age groups are affected, the incidence increases by approximately 20 percent with every ten-year increase in age beyond the first decade of life. Patients are treated with supportive care, plasma exchange or Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG).
The proportion of patients with GBS who walk independently at six months and one year after diagnosis is approximately 80 and 84 percent, respectively. At one year, full recovery of motor strength occurs in about 60 percent of patients, while severe motor problems persist in about 14 percent. Approximately five to ten percent of patients with GBS have a prolonged course with several months of ventilator dependency and very delayed and incomplete recovery. Within one year of diagnosis, approximately 4 to 5 percent of patients with GBS die despite intensive care.
Coversin has been successfully tested in animal models of Guillain Barré syndrome (GBS). In GBS, complement-mediated damage is provoked by the deposition of auto-antibodies, against the neuromuscular junction in the myelin sheath. This in turn triggers systemic complement activation and local tissue destruction, with often devastating neurological consequences.

Akari Therapeutics was established in 2005 in the UK. The company is currently public and trades on NASDAQ under AKTX.
Akari is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapeutics to treat orphan autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Akari’s lead drug, Coversin, a second-generation and potentially best-in-class complement inhibitor, acts on complement component-C5, preventing release of C5a and formation of C5b – 9 (also known as the membrane attack complex or MAC). Coversin is a recombinant small protein (16,740 Da) derived from a native protein discovered in the saliva of the Ornithodoros moubata tick, where it modulates the host immune system to allow the parasite to feed without alerting the host to its presence or provoking an immune response. Coversin is thereby derived from a molecule that underwent 300 million years of natural selection, optimising it for this purpose.

Product Pipeline































AKARI THERAPEUTICS PLCA Revolution in Treating ComplementProduct Pipeline
Akari’s development pipeline is focused on inhibitors of early mediators of acute and chronic inflammation, specifically the complement system, the eicosanoid system and the bioamine system. Each of these systems have either proven or scientifically well-supported causative roles in the diseases being targeted by Akari. Akari believes that blocking early mediators of inflammation will prevent initiation and continual amplification of the processes that cause certain diseases.
All Akari molecules are derived from ticks through 300 million years of natural selection have evolved to produce inhibitors that bind tightly to key highly-conserved inflammatory mediators, are well tolerated in humans, and remain fully functional when a host is repeatedly exposed to the molecule.

Akari Therapeutics, PLC: Initiation of Research Coverage

Akari Therapeutics, PLC: Initiation of Research Coverage

            Thursday, April 6, 2017







William Blair & Company initiated research coverage of Akari Therapeutics, PLC (AKTX $11.62). Akari Therapeutics is a development-stage biotechnology company focused on development of next-generation complement inhibitors for the treatment of rare hematologic diseases.
Analyst Tim Lugo said, “Akari Therapeutics’ lead candidate, Coversin, is a next-generation complement inhibitor in early-stage clinical trials. Complement inhibition has become a blockbuster therapeutic category with the success of Soliris, which generated $2.8 billion in 2016 revenue. Given the alternative binding site of Coversin versus Soliris, the product should find a niche in non-Soliris-responding patients whose genetic mutations prevent the activity of Soliris. Akari has already successfully treated one such European patient and presented this data at the 2016 American Society of Hematology meeting. We believe that Coversin has several other potential competitive advantages to Soliris, including a once-daily, self-administered, subcutaneous injection; LTB4-independent inhibition; and a smaller molecule, which may allow increased tissue penetration.”
Lugo added, “The company’s Phase II study is likely to be detailed at Akari’s analyst event on April 24 and should provide data on several additional patients. To date, the product has a clean side effect profile from the Phase I data in normal healthy patients. In addition, preclinical data reinforces the limited clinical data and suggests that Coversin is blocking complement. With C5 inhibition being a validated method of treatment in the rare life-threatening rare diseases of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, we see the upcoming Phase II data set as a major value-creating event for the company.”
William Blair is a global investment banking and asset management firm. We are committed to building enduring relationships with our clients and providing expertise and solutions to meet their evolving needs. An independent and employee-owned firm, William Blair is based in Chicago, with offices in 17 cities across four continents.

Akari Therapeutics Announces FDA Fast Track Designation For Coversin




















March 30, 2017 16:02 ET

 | Source: Akari Therapeutics, Plc






NEW YORK and LONDON, March  30, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Akari Therapeutics (NASDAQ:AKTX), an emerging growth, clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, announced today that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track designation for Coversin™ for treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) in patients who have polymorphisms conferring eculizumab resistance. Coversin™ is a second-generation complement inhibitor that acts on complement component-C5, preventing the release of C5a and the formation of C5b–9 (also known as the membrane attack complex or MAC), and independently also inhibits LTB4 activity. “We are very proud of the continued advancement of our Coversin program for the treatment of PNH in patients with or without polymorphisms,” said Dr. Gur Roshwalb, Chief Executive Officer of Akari Therapeutics. “The FDA fast track designation recognizes the unmet need in patients with PNH who cannot be treated with the current standard of care due to polymorphisms.” Akari is evaluating Coversin in two Phase 2 clinical trials. The first Phase 2 trial is evaluating Coversin™ in patients with PNH who have never received a complement blocking therapy. Interim results from this ongoing Phase 2 trial will be presented at the recently announced Research and Development Day to be held on April 24, 2017 in New York. The second Phase 2 trial is evaluating Coversin in patients with PNH and C5 polymorphisms resistant to eculizumab. One patient has been enrolled in this trial and has demonstrated significant LDH reduction and complete complement blockade with self-administered subcutaneous Coversin™ for over one year. The Fast Track program was created by the FDA to facilitate the development and expedite the review of new drugs which show promise in treating a serious or life-threatening disease and address an unmet medical need. Drugs that receive this designation benefit from more frequent communications and meetings with FDA to review the drug's development plan including the design of the proposed clinical trials, use of biomarkers and the extent of data needed for approval. Drugs with Fast Track Designation may qualify for priority review to expedite the FDA review process, if relevant criteria are met. About Akari Therapeutics Plc Akari is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of life-transforming treatments for a range of rare and orphan autoimmune and inflammatory diseases caused by dysregulation of complement C5 and Leukotriene B4 (LTB4), including paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (“PNH”), atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (“aHUS”), and Guillain Barré syndrome (“GBS”).  Akari’s lead product candidate, Coversin™ complement inhibitor, a second-generation complement inhibitor, acts on complement component-C5, preventing the release of C5a and the formation of C5b–9 (also known as the membrane attack complex or MAC), and independently also inhibits LTB4 activity.  C5 inhibition is growing in importance in a range of rare autoimmune diseases related to dysregulation of the complement component of the immune system, including PNH, aHUS, and GBS. Exploiting the power of nature, Akari is also developing other tick derived proteins and expects to bring additional compounds to clinical trials over the next several years. The pipeline is focused on developing bioengineered versions of native tick salivary proteins that act as anti-inflammatory compounds allowing the tick to remain on its host. These compounds include PGP sparing LTB4 inhibitors, classical and alternative complement inhibitors, anti-histamines, and serotonin inhibitors as examples. Akari is also developing engineered forms that allow for potential oral absorption, as, for example, a potential orally absorbed C5 inhibitor, and tissue specific proteins, as, for example, Coversin™ that acts specifically at the neuromuscular junction for diseases like myasthenia gravis.
