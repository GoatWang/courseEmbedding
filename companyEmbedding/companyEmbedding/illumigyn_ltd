Further, the Gynescope™ is the only colposcope that allows sophisticated imaging simultaneously with complex interventional procedures[7] to support the best clinical outcomes.  Key Product Characteristics:Superb optical performance for the intended field of use:superb performance is achieved through multispectral illumination options, wide field of view, working distance flexibility, and proximity to the examined tissue Integrated imaging and interventions:the Gynescope™ is the only colposcope that enables complex interventional procedures through the optical speculum simultaneous with sophisticated imaging[7], so as to support the best clinical outcomeSimple to operate: auto identification of working distance, auto focus and auto illumination control Full digital suit that delivers better care:digital images that can be saved, archived, retrieved, shared, followed and compared Modular:upgradable platform that can support therapeutic, hysteroscopy and endoscopic applications Fully patented:Illumigyn’s proprietary technology

      Illumigyn is a privately-held early stage company that has extended

      compact imaging colposcope. The device will be used for medical 
      applications in order to eliminate the inherent subjectivity of cervical 
      exams. For more information please visit: http://illumigyn.com/
