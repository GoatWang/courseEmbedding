Our Firm


		INCA Investments (“INCA”) is an SEC registered institutional investment advisor exclusively dedicated to investing in the stock markets of Latin America with $740 million assets under management. The firm was founded by Fernando Donayre in 2004, who has been investing in Latin America since 1990. The investment process is led by a seasoned team of investment professionals with a variety of industry and country backgrounds and a combined 80+ years of experience investing in the markets of Latin America.

		INCA serves a broad range of institutional investors including some of the largest and most prestigious foundations, endowments, family offices and asset managers in the world. We strive to become a trusted investment partner to our clients via our committed effort to help them meet their investment goals.

		We are located in Miami, Florida, which we consider a competitive advantage for investing in Latin America. As the acknowledged business capital of Latin America, Miami is strategically located to provide us with the information base and flight logistics we need to stay in close contact with the geographically distant markets of the region. As a regional investor, without a bias to any single country, we believe Miami provides a neutral location which allows us to avoid the informational bias that results from being located in only one of the many Latin American countries.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for NTS (NYSEMKT:NTS) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A
