OER was founded with the purpose to manufacture OE reproductions. Each part is meticulously engineered utilizing original blueprints to provide the most accurate duplicate. The company has a comprehensive line of over 10,000 top-notch products, including steering and suspension, fuel and exhaust, electrical and wiring, audio and security, and car care products as well as interior soft goods, emblem and decals, paint and chemicals, and more.

Many days, months, and sometimes even years are spent on engineering OER parts to guarantee that each product is perfect in every way. One of the most important steps is to ensure that product fits precisely. OER products are built to fit as seamlessly as possible. It is one thing to design a reproduction part and another to duplicate its quality. Using first-rate materials, workmanship, and consistent quality control methods the company ensures that its finished products meet OE specifications. Actually, many company's products even surpass the original ones.

These products represent a prestigious class of restoration parts which are almost equal to the products by MOPAR and GM.

Quality. Trust.The best companies put a lot of effort into building and maintaining their brand image. They're attentive to customers' wants and needs, stay current with the latest technology, and of course offer the best products backed up with industry leading customer service and warranties. When you shop for brand names you can buy with the confidence that comes from knowing that you're getting a product with a proven reputation for quality, reliability and performance. We're consumers just like you and brand names are just as important to us. That's why we carry only the top brands in the automotive aftermarket. Check out the extensive list of brands we offer and you'll see names that you know and trust, because we wouldn't sell you anything we wouldn't put on our own vehicles.Our wide range of brands means you'll always be able to get exactly what you need no matter what you're doing to your vehicle or what you're driving. Want a spoiler for your Civic? Choose from 7 different brands, each offering a selection of styles and materials. Need brakes for your Chevy pickup? There are 14 brands to choose from at prices and friction compounds to suit your wallet and driving style. How about a performance exhaust system for your Mustang? We offer 8 different brands so you can get the performance and sound you want in your choice of material and price. These are just a few examples of the tremendous variety you'll find on our digital shelves. When you shop here you'll never have to settle for a color or style you don't really want because "that's all they had".Some retailers buy end lots, closeouts, and fakes and pose as approved dealers, only to leave you in the lurch when there's a problem. You'll never be in that predicament with us because we are authorized dealers for most of the brands we sell and we have ongoing business relationships with those companies. This benefits you because when you shop with us you can be assured that you're getting the genuine article, not some cheap knock-off, and you'll have all the support the company offers including a valid warranty in the unlikely event you have a problem with your purchase. Our status as authorized dealer also allows us to offer sales and promotions sanctioned by the manufacturer, including discounted prices, manufacturers' rebates, and product giveaways.Featured VideosForgiato Difalco Grille01Curt02Kenwood Car Entertainment Systems03Rigid Industries Tortured04Backrack05We don't just sell auto parts and accessories, we're enthusiasts like you and we use the products we carry on our own vehicles. Our staff's automotive interests are as varied as our brands, and they're into everything including lifted 4-wheelers, tuner cars, muscle cars, drag racing, and autocross. We install the brand name products we sell and test them on our own cars and trucks. The employee parking area looks like a product testing lab with plenty of wheel and tire combos, body kits, spoilers, and custom grilles, slammed sports models and sky high 4-wheelers. Under those hoods there's cold air intakes, turbochargers, and performance tunes, and when they're fired up you'll hear the throaty rumble from free-flowing exhaust systems. If we find that a product doesn't measure up to our standards, we won't sell it. When you buy from us you get the best purchasing experience possible because of the familiarity and experience we have with our brands.

Fort Collins
Fort Collins enjoys a national reputation as a community where the American dream comes true. Residents are part of a thriving city that still maintains the heart of a small community that cares.  From high-tech business campuses to flower-lined alleyways to thriving locally owned businesses, positivity abounds.
Colorado State University adds to the diversity of the community and creates numerous cultural and educational opportunities. It has well-respected mens and womens sports programs. Fort Collins boasts a vibrant arts scene (how many cities have colorful painted pianos upon which anyone can tickle the ivories?) and residents can choose from an array of performing arts offerings, including top-tier small theaters, symphonies, ballet, choral groups, an opera company and traveling national shows at the city-owned Lincoln Center.
Visitors are welcome at the city’s many award-winning breweries for tours and tastings; start at one and you’ll have the choice from almost a dozen of which to visit next. Each summer, Fort Collins plays host to large festivals, including Tour de Fat and New West Fest, whose Bohemian Nights features top national musical acts. Small music venues abound and multiple locations offer free outdoor summer concerts.
Fort Collins is home to over 40 city parks scattered throughout the town.   A bike path system provides miles of paved trails popular with local bicyclists, runners and walkers.  Whether spring, summer, fall or winter, there are plenty of fun options for the whole family. Farmers’ markets are popular year-round and countless restaurants take pride in serving locally sourced products.
The attractive cost of living, mild climate, simple lifestyle, outdoor recreation, entertainment and top-tier health care facilities attract many retirees to the area. Many of them join their children who have chosen to raise their families here. The city’s “Old Town” was even the inspiration for Main Street USA in Disneyland!
Every month it seems Fort Collins makes some sort of “Best Of” list. In 2012, Forbes ranked the city the third best place for business and careers. It’s easy to see why Money Magazine ranked Fort Collins ranked No. 2 on its 2008 Best Places to Live list, and No. 1 in 2006.
