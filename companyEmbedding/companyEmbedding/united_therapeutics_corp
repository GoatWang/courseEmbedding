Adcirca product website


Indication

        Adcirca is a phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE-5) inhibitor indicated for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)(WHO Group 1) to improve exercise ability. Studies establishing effectiveness included predominately patients with NYHA Functional Class II–III symptoms and etiologies of idiopathic or heritable PAH (61%) or PAH associated with connective tissue diseases (23%).
                            
Important Safety Information for Adcirca
CONTRAINDICATIONS

Nitrates and Guanylate Cyclase (GC) Stimulators: Do not use ADCIRCA in patients taking medicines that contain nitrates or guanylate cyclase stimulators (such as riociguat), as the combination could cause a sudden, unsafe drop in blood pressure
Hypersensitivity Reactions: Patients with a known serious hypersensitivity to tadalafil should not take ADCIRCA

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Cardiovascular: Patients who experience anginal chest pain after taking ADCIRCA should seek immediate medical attention
Cardiovascular: Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (PDE-5is), including tadalafil, have mild systemic vasodilatory properties that may result in transient decreases in blood pressure.  Before prescribing ADCIRCA, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be adversely affected by such actions.  Pulmonary vasodilators may significantly worsen the cardiovascular status of patients with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) and administration of ADCIRCA to these patients is not recommended
Cardiovascular: The use of ADCIRCA with alpha blockers, blood pressure medications, or alcohol may lower blood pressure significantly and may lead to symptomatic hypotension (light-headedness or fainting)
Potential Drug Interactions: Tadalafil is metabolized predominately by CYP3A in the liver.  Use of ADCIRCA with potent CYP3A inhibitors, such as ketoconazole and itraconazole, should be avoided.  For patients on ADCIRCA therapy that require treatment with ritonavir, ADCIRCA should be discontinued at least 24 hours prior to starting ritonavir.  For patients on ritonavir therapy that require treatment with ADCIRCA, start ADCIRCA at 20 mg once a day.  Use of ADCIRCA with potent inducers of CYP3A, such as rifampin, should be avoided
Special Populations: The use of ADCIRCA is not recommended for patients with severe renal or hepatic impairment.  Please see Full Prescribing Information for dosing recommendations for patients with mild to moderate renal or hepatic impairment
Potential Drug Interactions: ADCIRCA contains the same ingredient (tadalafil) as Cialis®, which is used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED) and the signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).  The safety and efficacy of combinations of ADCIRCA with Cialis or other PDE-5is have not been studied.  Therefore, the use of such combinations is not recommended
Vision/Hearing: Patients who experience a sudden loss of vision in one or both eyes, which could be a sign of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), or sudden decrease or loss of hearing after taking ADCIRCA should seek immediate medical attention.
Prolonged Erection: In rare instances, men taking PDE-5is (including tadalafil) for ED reported an erection lasting more than four hours.  Male patients who experience a prolonged erection should seek immediate medical attention

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Adverse Reactions:  The most common adverse event with ADCIRCA is headache (42% ADCIRCA vs 15% placebo).  Other common adverse events (reported by ≥9% of patients on ADCIRCA and more frequent than placebo by 2%) include myalgia (14% vs 4%), nasopharyngitis (13% vs 7%), flushing (13% vs 2%), respiratory tract infection (13% vs 6%), extremity pain (11% vs 2%), nausea (11% vs 6%), back pain (10% vs 6%), dyspepsia (10% vs 2%), and nasal congestion (9% vs 1%)

Orenitram product website


Indication

Orenitram is a prostacyclin vasodilator indicated for treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (WHO Group 1) to improve exercise capacity. The study that established effectiveness included predominately patients with WHO functional class II-III symptoms and etiologies of idiopathic or heritable PAH (75%) or PAH associated with connective tissue disease (19%). When used as the sole vasodilator, the effect of Orenitram on exercise is about 10% of the deficit, and the effect, if any, on a background of another vasodilator is probably less than this. Orenitram is probably most useful to replace subcutaneous, intravenous, or inhaled treprostinil, but this use has not been studied.
                            
Important Safety Information for Orenitram
CONTRAINDICATIONS

Orenitram is contraindicated for patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class C)

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Abrupt discontinuation or sudden large reductions in dosage of Orenitram may result in worsening of PAH symptoms
Orenitram inhibits platelet aggregation and increases the risk of bleeding
Orenitram should not be taken with alcohol as release of treprostinil from the tablet may occur at a faster rate than intended
The Orenitram tablet shell does not dissolve. In patients with diverticulosis (blind-end pouches), Orenitram tablets can lodge in a diverticulum

DRUG INTERACTIONS/SPECIFIC POPULATIONS

Concomitant administration of Orenitram with diuretics, antihypertensive agents, or other vasodilators increases the risk of symptomatic hypotension
Orenitram inhibits platelet aggregation; there is an increased risk of bleeding, particularly among patients receiving anticoagulants
Co-administration of Orenitram and the CYP2C8 enzyme inhibitor gemfibrozil increases exposure to treprostinil; therefore, Orenitram dosage reduction may be necessary in these patients
Pregnancy Category C. Animal reproductive studies with Orenitram have shown an adverse effect on the fetus. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans
Safety and effectiveness in patients under 18 years of age have not been established
There is a marked increase in the systemic exposure to treprostinil in hepatically impaired patients

ADVERSE REACTIONS

In the 12-week placebo-controlled monotherapy study, adverse reactions with rates at least 5% higher on Orenitram than on placebo included headache, diarrhea, nausea, flushing, pain in jaw, pain in extremity, hypokalemia, and abdominal discomfort

For more information about Orenitram, please see the Full Prescribing Information (PDF) and Patient Information (PDF).

Remodulin product website


Indication
Remodulin is a prostacyclin vasodilator indicated for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH; WHO Group 1) to diminish symptoms associated with exercise. Studies establishing effectiveness included patients with NYHA Functional Class II-IV symptoms and etiologies of idiopathic or heritable PAH (58%), PAH associated with congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunts (23%), or PAH associated with connective tissue diseases (19%). It may be administered as a continuous subcutaneous infusion or continuous intravenous infusion; however, because of the risks associated with chronic indwelling central venous catheters, including serious blood stream infections, continuous intravenous infusion should be reserved for patients who are intolerant of the subcutaneous route or in whom these risks are considered warranted.
In patients with PAH requiring transition from Flolan® (epoprostenol sodium), Remodulin is indicated to diminish the rate of clinical deterioration. The risks and benefits of each drug should be carefully considered prior to transition.
Important Safety Information for Remodulin
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Chronic intravenous (IV) infusions of Remodulin are delivered using an indwelling central venous catheter. This route is associated with the risk of blood stream infections (BSI) and sepsis, which may be fatal. Therefore, continuous subcutaneous (SC) infusion is the preferred mode of administration.
Avoid abrupt withdrawal or sudden large reductions in dosage of Remodulin, which may result in worsening of PAH symptoms.
Titrate slowly in patients with hepatic or renal insufficiency because such patients will likely be exposed to greater systemic concentrations relative to patients with normal hepatic or renal function.
Remodulin dosage adjustment may be necessary if inhibitors or inducers of CYP2C8 are added or withdrawn. Co-administration of Remodulin with a CYP2C8 inhibitor increases exposure to treprostinil, or with an inducer, decreases exposure to treprostinil.

DRUG INTERACTIONS/SPECIFIC POPULATIONS

Remodulin is a potent pulmonary and systemic vasodilator.  Concomitant administration of Remodulin with blood pressure lowering agents, such as diuretics, antihypertensive agents, or other vasodilators, may increase the risk of symptomatic hypotension. 
Since Remodulin inhibits platelet aggregation, there may be an increased risk of bleeding, particularly among patients receiving anticoagulants.
Safety and effectiveness of Remodulin in pediatric patients have not been established. It is unknown if geriatric patients respond differently than younger patients. Caution should be used when selecting a dose for geriatric patients.
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies with Remodulin in pregnant women.  It is not known whether treprostinil is excreted in human milk.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Adverse Reactions: In clinical studies of SC Remodulin infusion, the most common adverse events reported were infusion site pain and infusion site reaction (redness and swelling). These symptoms were often severe and sometimes required treatment with narcotics or discontinuation of Remodulin. The IV infusion of Remodulin has been associated with a risk of blood stream infections, arm swelling, paresthesias, hematoma, and pain. Other common adverse events (≥3% more than placebo) seen with either SC or IV Remodulin were headache, diarrhea, nausea, jaw pain, vasodilatation, and edema.

Tyvaso product website



Indication

                            Tyvaso is a prostacyclin vasodilator indicated for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (WHO Group 1) to improve exercise ability. Studies establishing effectiveness included predominately patients with NYHA Functional Class III symptoms and etiologies of idiopathic or heritable PAH (56%) or PAH associated with connective tissue diseases (33%). 
                            
The effects diminish over the minimum recommended dosing interval of 4 hours; treatment timing can be adjusted for planned activities. 
While there are long-term data on use of treprostinil by other routes of administration, nearly all controlled clinical experience with inhaled treprostinil has been on a background of bosentan (an endothelin receptor antagonist) or sildenafil (a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor). The controlled clinical experience was limited to 12 weeks in duration.
                            
Important Safety Information for Tyvaso
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

The efficacy of Tyvaso has not been established in patients with significant underlying lung disease (such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Patients with acute pulmonary infections should be carefully monitored to detect any worsening of lung disease and loss of drug effect.
Tyvaso is a pulmonary and systemic vasodilator. In patients with low systemic arterial pressure, Tyvaso may cause symptomatic hypotension.
Titrate slowly in patients with hepatic or renal insufficiency, as exposure to treprostinil may be increased in these patients
Tyvaso inhibits platelet aggregation and increases the risk of bleeding, particularly in patients receiving anticoagulants.
Co-administration of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8 enzyme inhibitor gemfibrozil may increase exposure to treprostinil. Co-administration of the CYP2C8 enzyme inducer rifampin may decrease exposure to treprostinil. Increased exposure is likely to increase adverse events, whereas decreased exposure is likely to reduce clinical effectiveness.

DRUG INTERACTIONS / SPECIFIC POPULATIONS

The concomitant use of Tyvaso with diuretics, antihypertensives, or other vasodilators may increase the risk of symptomatic hypotension.
Co-administration of the CYP2C8 enzyme inhibitor gemfibrozil increases exposure to oral treprostinil. Co-administration of the CYP2C8 enzyme inducer rifampin decreases exposure to oral treprostinil. It is unclear if the safety and efficacy of treprostinil by the inhalation route are altered by inhibitors or inducers of CYP2C8.
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies with Tyvaso in pregnant women. It is not known whether treprostinil is excreted in human milk.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

The most common adverse events seen with Tyvaso in ≥4% of PAH patients and more than 3% greater than placebo in the placebo-controlled clinical study were cough (54% vs 29%), headache (41% vs 23%), throat irritation/ pharyngolaryngeal pain (25% vs 14%), nausea (19% vs 11%), flushing (15% vs <1%), and syncope (6% vs <1%).


Please see the Full Prescribing Information, Patient Package Insert, and the Tyvaso Inhalation System Instructions for Use manual.

Click here to view more.


Indication

Unituxin is a GD2-binding monoclonal antibody indicated, in combination with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-2 (IL-2), and 13-cis-retinoic acid (RA), for the treatment of pediatric patients with high-risk neuroblastoma who achieve at least a partial response to prior first-line multiagent, multimodality therapy.
Important Safety Information for Unituxin

BOXED WARNING

Serious Infusion Reactions

Serious and potentially life-threatening infusion reactions (facial and upper airway edema, dyspnea, bronchospasm, stridor, urticaria, and hypotension) occurred in 26% of patients treated with Unituxin. 
Administer required prehydration and premedication including antihistamines prior to each Unituxin infusion.
Monitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of an infusion reaction during and for at least four hours following completion of each Unituxin infusion.
Immediately interrupt Unituxin for severe infusion reactions and permanently discontinue Unituxin for anaphylaxis.


Neurotoxicity

Unituxin causes serious neurologic adverse reactions including severe neuropathic pain and peripheral neuropathy.
Severe neuropathic pain occurs in the majority of patients.
Administer intravenous opioid prior to, during, and for 2 hours following completion of the Unituxin infusion.
Severe (Grade 3) peripheral sensory neuropathy ranged from 2% to 9% in patients with neuroblastoma.
In clinical studies of Unituxin and related GD2-binding antibodies, severe motor neuropathy has occurred.  Resolution of motor neuropathy did not occur in all cases.
Discontinue Unituxin for severe unresponsive pain, severe sensory neuropathy, and moderate to severe peripheral motor neuropathy.




CONTRAINDICATIONS
Unituxin is contraindicated in patients with a history of anaphylaxis to dinutuximab.
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Serious Infusion Reactions
Serious infusion reactions requiring urgent intervention including blood pressure support, bronchodilator therapy, corticosteroids, infusion rate reduction, infusion interruption, or permanent discontinuation of Unituxin included facial and upper airway edema, dyspnea, bronchospasm, stridor, urticaria, and hypotension.  Infusion reactions generally occurred during or within 24 hours of completing the Unituxin infusion.  Due to overlapping signs and symptoms, it was not possible to distinguish between infusion reactions and hypersensitivity reactions in some cases. 
Severe (Grade 3 or 4) infusion reactions occurred in 35 (26%) patients in the Unituxin/13-cis-retinoic acid (RA) group compared to 1 (1%) patient receiving RA alone.


Neurotoxicity
Pain:  114 (85%) patients treated in the Unituxin/RA group experienced pain despite pre-treatment with analgesics including morphine sulfate infusion.  Severe (Grade 3) pain occurred in 68 (51%) patients in the Unituxin/RA group compared to 5 (5%) patients in the RA group.  For severe pain, decrease the Unituxin infusion rate to 0.875 mg/m2/hour. Discontinue Unituxin if pain is not adequately controlled despite infusion rate reduction and institution of maximum supportive measures. 
Peripheral Neuropathy:  Severe (Grade 3) peripheral sensory neuropathy occurred in 2 (1%) patients and severe peripheral motor neuropathy occurred in 2 (1%) patients in the Unituxin/RA group.  Permanently discontinue Unituxin in patients with peripheral motor neuropathy of Grade 2 or greater severity, Grade 3 sensory neuropathy that interferes with daily activities for more than 2 weeks, or Grade 4 sensory neuropathy.
Neurological Disorders of the Eye:

Neurological disorders of the eye experienced by two or more patients treated with Unituxin included blurred vision, photophobia, mydriasis, fixed or unequal pupils, optic nerve disorder, eyelid ptosis, and papilledema.
Interrupt Unituxin in patients experiencing dilated pupil with sluggish light reflex or other visual disturbances that do not cause visual loss. 
Upon resolution and if continued treatment with Unituxin is warranted, decrease the Unituxin dose by 50%.
Permanently discontinue Unituxin in patients who experience loss of vision and in patients with recurrent eye disorder following dose reduction.


Prolonged Urinary Retention:  Urinary retention that persists for weeks to months following discontinuation of opioids has occurred in patients treated with Unituxin.  Permanently discontinue Unituxin in patients with prolonged urinary retention that does not resolve with discontinuation of opioids.

Transverse Myelitis:  Transverse myelitis has occurred in patients treated with Unituxin.  Promptly evaluate any patient with signs or symptoms such as weakness, paresthesia, sensory loss, or incontinence.  Permanently discontinue Unituxin in patients who develop transverse myelitis.
                                          
                                        

Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS):  RPLS has occurred in patients treated with Unituxin.  Institute appropriate medical treatment and permanently discontinue Unituxin in patients with signs and symptoms of RPLS (e.g., severe headache, hypertension, visual changes, lethargy, or seizures).
                                        


Capillary Leak Syndrome
Severe (Grade 3 to 5) capillary leak syndrome occurred in 31 (23%) patients in the Unituxin/RA group and in no patients treated with RA alone.
Depending on severity, manage by immediate interruption, infusion rate reduction or permanent discontinuation of Unituxin.


Hypotension
Severe (Grade 3 or 4) hypotension occurred in 22 (16%) patients in the Unituxin/RA group compared to no patients in the RA group.
Prior to each Unituxin infusion, administer required intravenous hydration.  
Closely monitor blood pressure during Unituxin treatment.
Depending on severity, manage by immediate interruption, infusion rate reduction or permanent discontinuation of Unituxin.

Infection
Severe (Grade 3 or 4) bacteremia requiring intravenous antibiotics or other urgent intervention occurred in 17 (13%) patients in the Unituxin/RA group compared to 5 (5%) patients treated with RA alone.  Sepsis occurred in 24 (18%) of patients in the Unituxin/RA group and in 10 (9%) patients in the RA group.
Monitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of systemic infection and temporarily discontinue Unituxin in patients who develop systemic infection until resolution of the infection.


Bone Marrow Suppression
Severe (Grade 3 or 4) thrombocytopenia (39% vs. 25%), anemia (34% vs. 16%), neutropenia (34% vs. 13%), and febrile neutropenia (4% vs. 0 patients) occurred more commonly in patients in the Unituxin/RA group compared to patients treated with RA alone.
Monitor peripheral blood counts closely during Unituxin therapy. 

Electrolyte Abnormalities
Severe (Grade 3 or 4) hypokalemia and hyponatremia occurred in 37% and 23% of patients in the Unituxin/RA group, respectively, compared to 2% and 4% of patients in the RA group.
Monitor serum electrolytes daily during therapy with Unituxin. 

Atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome
Hemolytic uremic syndrome in the absence of documented infection and resulting in renal insufficiency, electrolyte abnormalities, anemia, and hypertension occurred in two patients following receipt of the first cycle of Unituxin.
Permanently discontinue Unituxin and institute supportive management. 

Embryo-Fetal Toxicity
Unituxin may cause fetal harm.
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment, and for two months after the last dose of Unituxin.  


ADVERSE REACTIONS
The most common serious adverse reactions (≥ 5%) are infections, infusion reactions, hypokalemia, hypotension, pain, fever, and capillary leak syndrome.
                            
The most common adverse drug reactions (≥ 25%) in Unituxin/RA compared with RA alone are pain (85% vs. 16%), pyrexia (72% vs. 27%), thrombocytopenia (66% vs. 43%), lymphopenia (62% vs. 36%), infusion reactions (60% vs. 9%), hypotension (60% vs. 3%), hyponatremia (58% vs. 12%), increased alanine aminotransferase (56% vs. 31%), anemia (51% vs. 22%), vomiting (46% vs. 19%), diarrhea (43% vs. 15%), hypokalemia (43% vs. 4%), capillary leak syndrome (40% vs. 1%), neutropenia (39% vs. 16%), urticaria (37% vs. 3%), hypoalbuminemia (33% vs. 3%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (28% vs. 7%), and hypocalcemia (27% vs. 0%).  In post-approval use of Unituxin, the adverse reactions of prolonged urinary retention, transverse myelitis, and reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome were observed.  Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency.

Adcirca product website


Indication

        Adcirca is a phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE-5) inhibitor indicated for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)(WHO Group 1) to improve exercise ability. Studies establishing effectiveness included predominately patients with NYHA Functional Class II–III symptoms and etiologies of idiopathic or heritable PAH (61%) or PAH associated with connective tissue diseases (23%).
                            
Important Safety Information for Adcirca
CONTRAINDICATIONS

Nitrates and Guanylate Cyclase (GC) Stimulators: Do not use ADCIRCA in patients taking medicines that contain nitrates or guanylate cyclase stimulators (such as riociguat), as the combination could cause a sudden, unsafe drop in blood pressure
Hypersensitivity Reactions: Patients with a known serious hypersensitivity to tadalafil should not take ADCIRCA

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Cardiovascular: Patients who experience anginal chest pain after taking ADCIRCA should seek immediate medical attention
Cardiovascular: Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (PDE-5is), including tadalafil, have mild systemic vasodilatory properties that may result in transient decreases in blood pressure.  Before prescribing ADCIRCA, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be adversely affected by such actions.  Pulmonary vasodilators may significantly worsen the cardiovascular status of patients with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) and administration of ADCIRCA to these patients is not recommended
Cardiovascular: The use of ADCIRCA with alpha blockers, blood pressure medications, or alcohol may lower blood pressure significantly and may lead to symptomatic hypotension (light-headedness or fainting)
Potential Drug Interactions: Tadalafil is metabolized predominately by CYP3A in the liver.  Use of ADCIRCA with potent CYP3A inhibitors, such as ketoconazole and itraconazole, should be avoided.  For patients on ADCIRCA therapy that require treatment with ritonavir, ADCIRCA should be discontinued at least 24 hours prior to starting ritonavir.  For patients on ritonavir therapy that require treatment with ADCIRCA, start ADCIRCA at 20 mg once a day.  Use of ADCIRCA with potent inducers of CYP3A, such as rifampin, should be avoided
Special Populations: The use of ADCIRCA is not recommended for patients with severe renal or hepatic impairment.  Please see Full Prescribing Information for dosing recommendations for patients with mild to moderate renal or hepatic impairment
Potential Drug Interactions: ADCIRCA contains the same ingredient (tadalafil) as Cialis®, which is used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED) and the signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).  The safety and efficacy of combinations of ADCIRCA with Cialis or other PDE-5is have not been studied.  Therefore, the use of such combinations is not recommended
Vision/Hearing: Patients who experience a sudden loss of vision in one or both eyes, which could be a sign of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), or sudden decrease or loss of hearing after taking ADCIRCA should seek immediate medical attention.
Prolonged Erection: In rare instances, men taking PDE-5is (including tadalafil) for ED reported an erection lasting more than four hours.  Male patients who experience a prolonged erection should seek immediate medical attention

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Adverse Reactions:  The most common adverse event with ADCIRCA is headache (42% ADCIRCA vs 15% placebo).  Other common adverse events (reported by ≥9% of patients on ADCIRCA and more frequent than placebo by 2%) include myalgia (14% vs 4%), nasopharyngitis (13% vs 7%), flushing (13% vs 2%), respiratory tract infection (13% vs 6%), extremity pain (11% vs 2%), nausea (11% vs 6%), back pain (10% vs 6%), dyspepsia (10% vs 2%), and nasal congestion (9% vs 1%)

Indication

                            Tyvaso is a prostacyclin vasodilator indicated for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (WHO Group 1) to improve exercise ability. Studies establishing effectiveness included predominately patients with NYHA Functional Class III symptoms and etiologies of idiopathic or heritable PAH (56%) or PAH associated with connective tissue diseases (33%). 
                            
The effects diminish over the minimum recommended dosing interval of 4 hours; treatment timing can be adjusted for planned activities. 
While there are long-term data on use of treprostinil by other routes of administration, nearly all controlled clinical experience with inhaled treprostinil has been on a background of bosentan (an endothelin receptor antagonist) or sildenafil (a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor). The controlled clinical experience was limited to 12 weeks in duration.
                            
Important Safety Information for Tyvaso
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

The efficacy of Tyvaso has not been established in patients with significant underlying lung disease (such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Patients with acute pulmonary infections should be carefully monitored to detect any worsening of lung disease and loss of drug effect.
Tyvaso is a pulmonary and systemic vasodilator. In patients with low systemic arterial pressure, Tyvaso may cause symptomatic hypotension.
Titrate slowly in patients with hepatic or renal insufficiency, as exposure to treprostinil may be increased in these patients
Tyvaso inhibits platelet aggregation and increases the risk of bleeding, particularly in patients receiving anticoagulants.
Co-administration of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8 enzyme inhibitor gemfibrozil may increase exposure to treprostinil. Co-administration of the CYP2C8 enzyme inducer rifampin may decrease exposure to treprostinil. Increased exposure is likely to increase adverse events, whereas decreased exposure is likely to reduce clinical effectiveness.

DRUG INTERACTIONS / SPECIFIC POPULATIONS

The concomitant use of Tyvaso with diuretics, antihypertensives, or other vasodilators may increase the risk of symptomatic hypotension.
Co-administration of the CYP2C8 enzyme inhibitor gemfibrozil increases exposure to oral treprostinil. Co-administration of the CYP2C8 enzyme inducer rifampin decreases exposure to oral treprostinil. It is unclear if the safety and efficacy of treprostinil by the inhalation route are altered by inhibitors or inducers of CYP2C8.
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies with Tyvaso in pregnant women. It is not known whether treprostinil is excreted in human milk.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

The most common adverse events seen with Tyvaso in ≥4% of PAH patients and more than 3% greater than placebo in the placebo-controlled clinical study were cough (54% vs 29%), headache (41% vs 23%), throat irritation/ pharyngolaryngeal pain (25% vs 14%), nausea (19% vs 11%), flushing (15% vs <1%), and syncope (6% vs <1%).


Please see the Full Prescribing Information, Patient Package Insert, and the Tyvaso Inhalation System Instructions for Use manual.

Unituxin product website






Dear Doctors: We have updated our Boxed Warning & Important Safety Information for Unituxin! 
Click here to view more.


Indication

Unituxin is a GD2-binding monoclonal antibody indicated, in combination with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-2 (IL-2), and 13-cis-retinoic acid (RA), for the treatment of pediatric patients with high-risk neuroblastoma who achieve at least a partial response to prior first-line multiagent, multimodality therapy.
Important Safety Information for Unituxin

BOXED WARNING

Serious Infusion Reactions

Serious and potentially life-threatening infusion reactions (facial and upper airway edema, dyspnea, bronchospasm, stridor, urticaria, and hypotension) occurred in 26% of patients treated with Unituxin. 
Administer required prehydration and premedication including antihistamines prior to each Unituxin infusion.
Monitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of an infusion reaction during and for at least four hours following completion of each Unituxin infusion.
Immediately interrupt Unituxin for severe infusion reactions and permanently discontinue Unituxin for anaphylaxis.


Neurotoxicity

Unituxin causes serious neurologic adverse reactions including severe neuropathic pain and peripheral neuropathy.
Severe neuropathic pain occurs in the majority of patients.
Administer intravenous opioid prior to, during, and for 2 hours following completion of the Unituxin infusion.
Severe (Grade 3) peripheral sensory neuropathy ranged from 2% to 9% in patients with neuroblastoma.
In clinical studies of Unituxin and related GD2-binding antibodies, severe motor neuropathy has occurred.  Resolution of motor neuropathy did not occur in all cases.
Discontinue Unituxin for severe unresponsive pain, severe sensory neuropathy, and moderate to severe peripheral motor neuropathy.




CONTRAINDICATIONS
Unituxin is contraindicated in patients with a history of anaphylaxis to dinutuximab.
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Serious Infusion Reactions
Serious infusion reactions requiring urgent intervention including blood pressure support, bronchodilator therapy, corticosteroids, infusion rate reduction, infusion interruption, or permanent discontinuation of Unituxin included facial and upper airway edema, dyspnea, bronchospasm, stridor, urticaria, and hypotension.  Infusion reactions generally occurred during or within 24 hours of completing the Unituxin infusion.  Due to overlapping signs and symptoms, it was not possible to distinguish between infusion reactions and hypersensitivity reactions in some cases. 
Severe (Grade 3 or 4) infusion reactions occurred in 35 (26%) patients in the Unituxin/13-cis-retinoic acid (RA) group compared to 1 (1%) patient receiving RA alone.


Neurotoxicity
Pain:  114 (85%) patients treated in the Unituxin/RA group experienced pain despite pre-treatment with analgesics including morphine sulfate infusion.  Severe (Grade 3) pain occurred in 68 (51%) patients in the Unituxin/RA group compared to 5 (5%) patients in the RA group.  For severe pain, decrease the Unituxin infusion rate to 0.875 mg/m2/hour. Discontinue Unituxin if pain is not adequately controlled despite infusion rate reduction and institution of maximum supportive measures. 
Peripheral Neuropathy:  Severe (Grade 3) peripheral sensory neuropathy occurred in 2 (1%) patients and severe peripheral motor neuropathy occurred in 2 (1%) patients in the Unituxin/RA group.  Permanently discontinue Unituxin in patients with peripheral motor neuropathy of Grade 2 or greater severity, Grade 3 sensory neuropathy that interferes with daily activities for more than 2 weeks, or Grade 4 sensory neuropathy.
Neurological Disorders of the Eye:

Neurological disorders of the eye experienced by two or more patients treated with Unituxin included blurred vision, photophobia, mydriasis, fixed or unequal pupils, optic nerve disorder, eyelid ptosis, and papilledema.
Interrupt Unituxin in patients experiencing dilated pupil with sluggish light reflex or other visual disturbances that do not cause visual loss. 
Upon resolution and if continued treatment with Unituxin is warranted, decrease the Unituxin dose by 50%.
Permanently discontinue Unituxin in patients who experience loss of vision and in patients with recurrent eye disorder following dose reduction.


Prolonged Urinary Retention:  Urinary retention that persists for weeks to months following discontinuation of opioids has occurred in patients treated with Unituxin.  Permanently discontinue Unituxin in patients with prolonged urinary retention that does not resolve with discontinuation of opioids.

Transverse Myelitis:  Transverse myelitis has occurred in patients treated with Unituxin.  Promptly evaluate any patient with signs or symptoms such as weakness, paresthesia, sensory loss, or incontinence.  Permanently discontinue Unituxin in patients who develop transverse myelitis.
                                          
                                        

Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS):  RPLS has occurred in patients treated with Unituxin.  Institute appropriate medical treatment and permanently discontinue Unituxin in patients with signs and symptoms of RPLS (e.g., severe headache, hypertension, visual changes, lethargy, or seizures).
                                        


Capillary Leak Syndrome
Severe (Grade 3 to 5) capillary leak syndrome occurred in 31 (23%) patients in the Unituxin/RA group and in no patients treated with RA alone.
Depending on severity, manage by immediate interruption, infusion rate reduction or permanent discontinuation of Unituxin.


Hypotension
Severe (Grade 3 or 4) hypotension occurred in 22 (16%) patients in the Unituxin/RA group compared to no patients in the RA group.
Prior to each Unituxin infusion, administer required intravenous hydration.  
Closely monitor blood pressure during Unituxin treatment.
Depending on severity, manage by immediate interruption, infusion rate reduction or permanent discontinuation of Unituxin.

Infection
Severe (Grade 3 or 4) bacteremia requiring intravenous antibiotics or other urgent intervention occurred in 17 (13%) patients in the Unituxin/RA group compared to 5 (5%) patients treated with RA alone.  Sepsis occurred in 24 (18%) of patients in the Unituxin/RA group and in 10 (9%) patients in the RA group.
Monitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of systemic infection and temporarily discontinue Unituxin in patients who develop systemic infection until resolution of the infection.


Bone Marrow Suppression
Severe (Grade 3 or 4) thrombocytopenia (39% vs. 25%), anemia (34% vs. 16%), neutropenia (34% vs. 13%), and febrile neutropenia (4% vs. 0 patients) occurred more commonly in patients in the Unituxin/RA group compared to patients treated with RA alone.
Monitor peripheral blood counts closely during Unituxin therapy. 

Electrolyte Abnormalities
Severe (Grade 3 or 4) hypokalemia and hyponatremia occurred in 37% and 23% of patients in the Unituxin/RA group, respectively, compared to 2% and 4% of patients in the RA group.
Monitor serum electrolytes daily during therapy with Unituxin. 

Atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome
Hemolytic uremic syndrome in the absence of documented infection and resulting in renal insufficiency, electrolyte abnormalities, anemia, and hypertension occurred in two patients following receipt of the first cycle of Unituxin.
Permanently discontinue Unituxin and institute supportive management. 

Embryo-Fetal Toxicity
Unituxin may cause fetal harm.
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment, and for two months after the last dose of Unituxin.  


ADVERSE REACTIONS
The most common serious adverse reactions (≥ 5%) are infections, infusion reactions, hypokalemia, hypotension, pain, fever, and capillary leak syndrome.
                            
The most common adverse drug reactions (≥ 25%) in Unituxin/RA compared with RA alone are pain (85% vs. 16%), pyrexia (72% vs. 27%), thrombocytopenia (66% vs. 43%), lymphopenia (62% vs. 36%), infusion reactions (60% vs. 9%), hypotension (60% vs. 3%), hyponatremia (58% vs. 12%), increased alanine aminotransferase (56% vs. 31%), anemia (51% vs. 22%), vomiting (46% vs. 19%), diarrhea (43% vs. 15%), hypokalemia (43% vs. 4%), capillary leak syndrome (40% vs. 1%), neutropenia (39% vs. 16%), urticaria (37% vs. 3%), hypoalbuminemia (33% vs. 3%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (28% vs. 7%), and hypocalcemia (27% vs. 0%).  In post-approval use of Unituxin, the adverse reactions of prolonged urinary retention, transverse myelitis, and reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome were observed.  Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency.

Orenitram (United Therapeutics Corp.): FDA Package Insert

 







DrugInserts.com
Prescription Medications



    


Orenitram: Package Insert and Label InformationBy United Therapeutics Corp. | Last revised: 22 June 2017
ORENITRAM- treprostinil tablet, extended releaseUnited Therapeutics Corp. 1. INDICATIONS AND USAGE 1.1 Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Orenitram is indicated for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (WHO Group 1) to improve exercise capacity. 
The study that established effectiveness included predominately patients with WHO functional class II-III symptoms and etiologies of idiopathic or heritable PAH (75%) or PAH associated with connective tissue disease (19%). When used as the sole vasodilator, the effect of Orenitram on exercise is about 10% of the deficit, and the effect, if any, on a background of another vasodilator is probably less than this. 
2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 2.1 Recommended Dosing 



Take Orenitram with food. Swallow Orenitram tablets whole; do not crush, split, or chew.
The recommended starting dose of Orenitram is 0.25 mg twice daily (BID) with food, taken approximately 12 hours apart or 0.125 mg three times daily (TID) with food, taken approximately 8 hours apart. Increase the dose to the highest tolerated dose. The recommended increment is 0.25 or 0.5 mg BID or 0.125 mg TID every 3-4 days. If dose increments are not tolerated consider titrating slower. 
The appropriate maintenance dose is determined by tolerability. 
If intolerable pharmacologic effects occur, decrease the dose in increments of 0.25 mg. Avoid abrupt discontinuation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 
2.2 Transitioning from Subcutaneous or Intravenous Routes of Administration of Treprostinil Decrease the dose of Remodulin while simultaneously increasing the dose of Orenitram. The dose of Remodulin can be reduced up to 30 ng/kg/min per day and the dose of Orenitram simultaneously increased up to 6 mg per day (2 mg TID) if tolerated. The following equation can be used to estimate a comparable total daily dose of Orenitram in mg using a patient’s dose of IV/SC treprostinil (in ng/kg/min) and weight (in kg).
 Orenitram total daily dose (mg) = 0.0072 × Remodulin dose (ng/kg/min) × weight (kg) 
2.3 Dose Adjustment in Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class A) start at 0.125 mg BID with 0.125 mg BID dose increments every 3 to 4 days. Avoid use of Orenitram in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class B). Orenitram is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class C) [see Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
2.4 Dose Adjustment for Use with CYP2C8 Inhibitors When co-administered with strong CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g., gemfibrozil) the initial dose is 0.125 mg BID with 0.125 mg BID dose increments every 3 to 4 days.
2.5 Interruptions and Discontinuation If a dose of medication is missed, the patient should take the missed dose as soon as possible, with food. If a patient misses two or more doses, restart at a lower dose and re-titrate.
In the event of a planned short-term treatment interruption for patients unable to take oral medications, consider a temporary infusion of subcutaneous or intravenous treprostinil. To calculate the total daily dose (mg) of treprostinil for the parenteral route use the following equation:
       Remodulin (ng/kg/min) =   139 × Orenitram total daily dose (mg)                           weight (kg)     When discontinuing Orenitram, reduce the dose in steps of 0.5 to 1 mg per day [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 
3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHSOrenitram (treprostinil) extended-release tablets are available in the following five strengths: 
 - 0.125 mg [White tablet imprinted with UT 0.125] - 0.25 mg [Green tablet imprinted with UT 0.25] - 1 mg [Yellow tablet imprinted with UT 1] - 2.5 mg [Pink tablet imprinted with UT 2.5] - 5 mg [Red tablet imprinted with UT 5] 4 CONTRAINDICATIONSSevere hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class C) [see Use In Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Worsening PAH Symptoms upon Abrupt Withdrawal Abrupt discontinuation or sudden large reductions in dosage of Orenitram may result in worsening of PAH symptoms. 
5.2 Risk of Bleeding Orenitram inhibits platelet aggregation and increases the risk of bleeding. 
5.3 Use in Patients with Blind-end Pouches  The tablet shell does not dissolve. In patients with diverticulosis, Orenitram tablets can lodge in a diverticulum.
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.
In a 12-week placebo-controlled monotherapy study (Study 1; WHO Group 1; functional class II-III), the most commonly reported adverse reactions that occurred in patients receiving Orenitram included: headache, diarrhea, nausea, and flushing. Table 1 lists the most common adverse reactions that occurred at a rate on Orenitram at least 5% higher than on placebo. 
Orenitram patients in Table 1 for Study 1 (N = 151) had access to 0.25 mg tablets at randomization. Approximately 91% of such patients experienced an adverse reaction, but only 4% discontinued therapy for an adverse reaction (compared to 3% receiving placebo). The overall discontinuation rate for any reason was 17% for active and 14% for placebo.   Table 1: Adverse Reactions with Rates at Least 5% Higher on Orenitram Monotherapy than on Placebo       Reaction Orenitram N=151 Placebo N=77     Headache 63% 19%   Diarrhea 30% 16%   Nausea 30% 18%   Flushing 15% 6%   Pain in jaw 11% 4%   Pain in extremity 14% 8%   Hypokalemia 9% 3%   Abdominal discomfort 6% 0%   Orenitram was studied in a long-term, open-label extension study in which 824 patients were dosed for a mean duration of approximately 2 years. About 70% of patients continued treatment with Orenitram for at least a year. The mean dose was 4.2 mg BID at one year. The adverse reactions were similar to those observed in the placebo-controlled trials. 
The safety of Orenitram was also evaluated in an open-label study transitioning patients from Remodulin. The safety profile during this study was similar to that observed in the three pivotal studies.
6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of Orenitram: dizziness, dyspepsia, vomiting, myalgia, and arthralgia.  Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Antihypertensive Agents or Other Vasodilators Concomitant administration of Orenitram with diuretics, antihypertensive agents or other vasodilators increases the risk of symptomatic hypotension.
7.2 Anticoagulants Treprostinil inhibits platelet aggregation; there is increased risk of bleeding, particularly among patients receiving anticoagulants.
7.3 Effect of CYP2C8 Inhibitors Co-administration of Orenitram and the CYP2C8 enzyme inhibitor gemfibrozil in healthy adult volunteers increases exposure to treprostinil. Reduce the starting dose of Orenitram to 0.125 mg BID and use 0.125 mg BID increments every 3 to 4 days [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C.
Animal reproductive studies with treprostinil diolamine have shown an adverse effect on the fetus. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans. 
In rats, treatment with treprostinil diolamine had no effect on reproductive performance or sperm motility at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day. The exposures at this dose level are about 10- (male) to 18- (female) fold the usual human exposure at the mean dose of 3.4 mg BID. 
In pregnant rats, reversible, dose-dependent decreases in body weight gain and food consumption were observed during the first four days of dosing in animals administered 10, 20 and 30 mg/kg/day treprostinil diolamine. In a dose range-finding study, there was a 17% decrease in the pregnancy rate in the animals administered 20 and 30 mg/kg/day. One dam in each of the 20 and 30 mg/kg/day had litters with no viable fetuses. In the definitive study (0, 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg/day), there were four treatment-related deaths, and a 32% decrease in the pregnancy rate for rats administered 20 mg/kg/day. There was an 8% decrease in the pregnancy rate in the animals administered 10 mg/kg/day. Across both studies, an increase in post-implantation loss was observed in animals administered 10 to 30 mg/kg/day, and a significant decrease in the mean number of live births was seen at dose levels ≥10 mg/kg/day. The no observed adverse effect level was 5 mg/kg/day (maternal, fetal viability and growth), and 20 mg/kg/day (teratogenicity), the highest dose tested in the definitive study. The exposures at 5 and 20 mg/kg/day doses represent 13 and 55 times, respectively, the human exposure.
For F1 progeny, a decreased copulation index was observed at the 5 and 10 mg/kg/day treprostinil diolamine dose levels in rats. The no observed effect levels for physical development, reflex development, exploratory behavior, learning and memory, and sexual maturation was 10 mg/kg/day. The no observed effect level for F1 progeny general development (based on body weight) was 10 mg/kg/day for females and ≤ 2.5 mg/kg/day for males; the no observed effect level for F1 reproductive performance was 2.5 mg/kg/day or 6 times the human exposure. 
In pregnant rabbits, the primary maternal adverse effects were gastrointestinal disturbance; dose-dependent decreases in mean body weight, body weight gain, and food consumption were observed. During the post-dose phase, the effect was reversed. In a dose range-finding study, there was a 17% decrease in the pregnancy rate for animals administered 4 mg/kg/day. A dose-dependent increase in post-implantation loss was observed. Two dams administered 4 mg/kg/day had litters with no viable fetuses; the mean fetal weight was slightly decreased in animals administered 4 mg/kg/day. In the definitive study, mean fetal weights were significantly decreased in animals administered 0.5 to 3 mg/kg/day of treprostinil diolamine. At doses of 1.5 and 3 mg/kg/day, external fetal and soft tissue malformations were observed in a few fetuses, and the total fetal skeletal malformations were significantly increased. The no observed adverse effect level was less than 0.5 mg/kg/day (maternal), 1.5 mg/kg/day (fetal viability and growth), and 0.5 mg/kg/day (teratogenicity). The 0.5 mg/kg/day dose represents about 5 times the human exposure. 
8.2 Labor and Delivery The effect of Orenitram on labor and delivery in humans is unknown. No treprostinil treatment-related effects on labor and delivery were seen in animal studies. 
8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether treprostinil is excreted in human milk or absorbed systemically after ingestion. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, choose Orenitram or breastfeeding.
8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 
8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Orenitram did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 
8.6 Patients with Hepatic Impairment There is a marked increase in the systemic exposure to treprostinil in hepatically impaired patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Contraindications (4), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
8.7 Patients with Renal Impairment No dose adjustments are required in patients with renal impairment. Orenitram is not removed by dialysis [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
10 OVERDOSAGESigns and symptoms of overdose with Orenitram during clinical trials reflect its dose-limiting pharmacologic effects and include severe headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and hypotension. Treat supportively.
11 DESCRIPTIONOrenitram is an extended release osmotic tablet for oral administration. Orenitram is formulated as the diolamine salt of treprostinil, a tricyclic benzindene analogue of prostacyclin. The chemical name is Acetic acid, 2-[[(1R ,2R ,3aS ,9aS)-2,3,3a,4,9,9a-hexahydro-2-hydroxy-1-[(3S)-3-hydroxyoctyl]-1H -benz[f]inden-5-yl]oxy]-, complexed with 2,2′-iminobis[ethanol] (1:1). The molecular formula is C23 H34 O5 .C4 H11 NO2 , the molecular weight is 495.65, and it has the following structural formula:
    (click image for full-size original) Orenitram tablets are formulated in five strengths, which contain 0.125 mg of treprostinil (equivalent to 0.159 mg treprostinil diolamine), 0.25 mg of treprostinil (equivalent to 0.317 mg treprostinil diolamine), 1 mg of treprostinil (equivalent to 1.27 mg treprostinil diolamine), 2.5 mg of treprostinil (equivalent to 3.17 mg treprostinil diolamine) or 5 mg of treprostinil (equivalent to 6.35 mg treprostinil diolamine). The formulations also contain xylitol, maltodextrin, sodium lauryl sulfate, magnesium stearate, cellulose acetate, triethyl citrate, polyvinyl alcohol, titanium dioxide, polyethylene glycol, and talc. In addition tablets may contain colorants FD&C Blue #2, iron oxide yellow, and iron oxide red. The imprinting ink contains shellac glaze, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol USP, iron oxide black, n-butyl alcohol, and propylene glycol.
Orenitram is designed to release treprostinil at a near zero-order rate using an osmotic tablet technology. The tablet core is coated with a semi-permeable membrane and has a laser-drilled aperture through the membrane. Upon contact with water (e.g., after ingestion), the core tablet absorbs water through the semi-permeable membrane. The water dissolves the water-soluble treprostinil diolamine and the water-soluble osmotic excipients, which creates hydrostatic pressure within the membrane, eventually forcing the drug out through the tablet at a controlled rate.
