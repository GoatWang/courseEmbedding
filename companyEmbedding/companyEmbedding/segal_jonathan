How Jonathan Segal Finds Creative Freedom Through an "Architect as Developer" Model
 



    	16:00 - 17 February, 2016
  






 Because we are the architect acting as the developer, we eliminate the change orders, we eliminate the RFIs, we eliminate the job directives - there's basically no chocolate mess, we don't have anybody to answer to. In this video from Breadtruck Films, San Diego architect Jonathan Segal speaks about how his business model of acting as a developer for his own architectural projects helped in the construction of his latest mixed-use project. The building - a seven-story concrete and glass structure which he named "Mr Robinson" thanks to its location at the corner of Robinson Avenue and Park Boulvard - was constructed in just 14 months as opposed to the 2 to 3 years that he would expect with the usual setup of architect, client and contractor (or "the bad triangle" as he calls it).

Jonathan Segal – The Architect With No Need For Clients
                    by Archipreneur   1 Comment
The Union Lofts in San Diego by Jonathan Segal © Paul Body
Designing and building your own ideas as an architect without seeking constant compromises with the client sounds like the perfect job. As an architect developer, Jonathan Segal lives the high life by taking the role of client, contractor and property manager of his projects, and reaps the benefits from each of these functions.
After completing his studies at University of Idaho and gaining experience at two architecture firms, Jonathan decided to start out on his own. He developed his first project when he was just twenty-five years old. He realized that, without client compromises to bog him down, he was capable of much more than he thought. Taking control of every aspect of his projects, from designing to financing to building, he gained a wide breadth of knowledge that he could put to practice.
Jonathan has an exceptional archipreneurial approach to his work, and a gift of combining business acumen with exquisite architecture. Using his architectural skills, as well as his deep understanding of space, light and texture, has allowed him to develop beautiful, well-planned buildings. This recognition of using space creatively is hard for regular developers. By applying his tenacious enthusiasm and sharp eye for location and placement to every project, Jonathan has been able to build and create great projects in urban neighborhoods in San Diego.
As such, he has achieved a great deal in the world of architecture and become a highly regarded developer in his own right. Jonathan has been awarded a multitude of honors for his work, including making the 2010 Residential Architect ‘RA50 Short List’, and winning Project of the Year at the 2012 Residential Architect Design Awards for ‘the Charmer’. He has also received numerous other accolades, including 24 State, national and local AIA awards for urban and residential design.
It sounds like a great way of doing architecture – but we should also be aware of the risks it entails. Acting as the developer also means taking on board all the risks that can arise from a project. Architect developers should have a certain degree of knowledge in real estate development in order to understand the whole scope of a project – from financial matters to the mechanics of the project structure. For instance, they need to know how it is possible to find and acquire land, how to assess which product will function for a specific market, and how to get project funding

How to go it alone in the world of architecture
Jonathan Segal has developed and designed a method for architecture practice that gives control back to the architect. He has also created his own product based on this method, an online course called ‘Architect As Developer’, which is very successful and further proof of his business sense.
These online seminars cover everything from development strategies and principles to construction loans and bank financing to land acquisition and construction contracts. After watching the foundation lessons, subscribers will gain access to ‘Jonny’s World’; a series of video updates about Jonathan’s latest projects and pro tips. The whole course is priced at around $500.
Jonathan says that by eliminating clients and contractors from the design and building process, architects have the ability to become the ‘owner’ of their own projects, directing them, and achieving financial independence. By learning the same skillsets and tools as developers, architects also have the power to take initiative and create whatever they want, exactly how they want it.
He recommends that new architects developers should start small, find a niche in which they are comfortable, and be prepared for something to go wrong. Jonathan also recommends that new architect developers build relationships with realtors who can point them in the right direction and help find available property. Jonathan says that maintaining relationships with your broker and treating your subcontractors well is of utmost importance when going it alone.
The true learning curve will only come when you really immerse yourself in the inception of your first project. If you are still at school or university and/or are interested in studying the whole method, Jonathan also teaches the Master’s program in Real Estate and Development at the Woodbury School of Architecture, alongside other experienced architect developers, such as Ted Smith.

You can hear more about Jonathan and his method and get a taste of how he operates in this thirteen-minute Jonathan Segal Documentary about his architecture practice.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
