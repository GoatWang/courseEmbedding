                Investment in film, television, or new media equity is highly speculative and inherently risky. There can be no assurance of the economic success of any motion picture, television, or new media endeavor. You may sustain a total loss of the funds you have invested.

Our Thoughts








Horror and Thriller genres are my passion, and I want to share that passion with the world. Creating great content that lives with the viewer is my goal.

Bringing the audience to the edge of their seat fascinates me. Virtual Reality is an exciting medium; soon we will have the ability to fully immerse the audience inside a haunted house.

We set out to create an exciting fund that could give investors access to top Hollywood talent at a small entry point. Slate financing provides the ability to mitigate risk and increase chances of a return.

Raven Investment Fund

If you were a university, would you give a portion of your endowment to a group of college students for them to manage? Anderson University did just that! Students in the investment concentration in the finance major, along with faculty members Terry Truitt and Brock Vaughters, run the Raven Investment Fund.
Imagine being a student who is responsible to manage a real account. Your team will be making trades that impact the endowment of the university. Pretty cool!
Students enrolled in BSNS 4150 (Investments), BSNS 4160 (Portfolio Management), and BSNS 6550 (Accounting and Financial Management in the International Economy) manage real dollar investments and earn academic credit.
Beginning in January of 2015, the Raven Investment Fund will manage over $1.3 million of invested capital.
The Raven Fund has outperformed the S & P 500 benchmark since the funds inception in 2007. In fact, at the 2010 Redefining Investment Strategy Education conference the Raven Fund was awarded first place in the core-style portfolio competition in the undergraduate division. This accomplishment was reported nationally via news media including FUNDfire, A Financial Times Service.

Risk Factors

Note: Investment in the film industry is highly speculative and inherently risky. There can be no assurance of the economic success of any motion picture since the revenues derived from the production and distribution of a motion picture depend primarily upon its acceptance by the public, which cannot be predicted. The commercial success of a motion picture also depends upon the quality and acceptance of other competing films released into the marketplace at or near the same time, general economic factors, and other tangible and intangible factors, all of which can change and cannot be predicted with certainty. You may sustain a total loss of the funds you have invested.
The entertainment industry in general, and the motion picture and television industry in particular, are continuing to undergo significant changes, primarily due to technological developments. Although these developments have resulted in the availability of alternative and competing forms of leisure time entertainment, such technological developments have also resulted in the creation of additional revenue sources through licensing of rights to such new media, and potentially could lead to future reductions in the costs of producing and distributing motion pictures. In addition, the theatrical success of a motion picture remains a crucial factor in generating revenues in other ancillary  media such as but not limited to DVD's and television. Due to the rapid growth of technology, shifting consumer tastes, and the popularity and availability of other forms of entertainment, it is impossible to predict the overall effect these factors will have on the potential revenue from and profitability of feature-length motion pictures.
Raven Fund I is in the organizational stage and is subject to all the risks incident to the creation and development of a new business, including the absence of a history of operations and minimal net worth. In order to prosper, the success of Raven Fund 1 will depend partly upon the ability of management to produce a film of exceptional quality at a lower cost, which can compete in appeal with higher-budgeted films of the same genre. In order to minimize this risk, management plans to participate as much as possible throughout the process and will aim to mitigate financial risks where possible. Fulfilling this goal depends on the timing of investor financing, the ability to obtain distribution contracts with satisfactory terms, and the continued participation of the current management.

                                                    What is the market for horror films 

The industry as a whole in North America is also thriving. According to the MPAA 2015 Theatrical Market Statistics, 69% of the U.S./Canadian population, ages 2 and over, saw at least one movie throughout 2015. This same report states, the average moviegoer buys 5.6 tickets per year and the average moviegoer will choose to see a feature film in the movie theater 49% of the time. Additionally, information below, highlights the current and future state of the industry as provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) Global Entertainment and Media Outlook 2014 – 2018 and Nielsen Q1. 2016 Total Audience reports.  Filmed entertainment revenue will surpass US$100bn in 2017 as emerging markets drive growth. Globally, filmed entertainment revenue will rise at a CAGR of 4.5% from US$88.3bn in 2013 to US$110.1bn in 2018, passing US$100bn in 2017. While some of this expansion will be driven by growing demand in emerging markets, notably China, mature markets such as the US, the UK and Japan will also continue to grow.  Box office resilience underscores the continuing popularity of the cinematic experience. Global box office revenue will exceed revenue from physical home video in 2014 and grow over the forecast period to US$45.9bn by 2018, from US$36.1bn in 2013, at a 4.9% CAGR.  Americans continue to consume more content daily. U.S. adults spent 10 hours, 39 minutes a day consuming media in the first quarter of 2016. That’s up a full hour from the first quarter of 2015, and it’s thanks to a substantial increase in Smartphone and tablet usage, according to Nielsen’s Q1 2016 Total Audience Report.  China will provide a challenge and an opportunity. China will overtake Japan to become the world’s third-largest market for filmed entertainment (behind the US and UK) in 2018. Total revenue in China will reach US$7.0bn, up from US$3.8bn in 2013, at a CAGR of 13%.  We believe the overall state of the domestic theatrical release window is healthy, with receipts on an upward swing for horror related feature films.  According to Nash Information Services 2015 Summary, $389 million at the box office was generated by horror films. That same report highlights that 24 horror related feature films were distributed in wide release (600+ screens) and over 46.1 million tickets were sold to horror seeking moviegoers.   The genre dedicated to scaring audiences has a long history of increased profits potential.  Horror genre is the last genre in which audiences do not expect lots of special effects and expensive star power.  This genre is built on low budgets and practical conventions, such as jump scares and gory content. Movies such as “The Blair Witch Project” and “Paranormal Activity” helped to bring a new spin to the genre by introducing found footage storytelling. This unique way of storytelling spawned many copycats and has even pushed into other genres.

Indie Crowd Funder Raven Fund 1 Has Registered Over $43 Million of Investor Interest
 Tweet Share22 Share1 +11 Reddit Pin EmailShares 24

February 15, 2017 @ 9:29 am By JD Alois 


Indie Crowd Funder, a crowdfunding platform set up to provide equity capital for films and entertainment, has seen solid progress on their Raven Fund 1.
Using Tier 2 of Reg A+, Raven Fund 1 has now garnered over $43 million in investor interest. Crowdfund Insider reported back in November that Raven Fund 1 had registered $15 million of investor interest in just seven days. Using Reg A+, an issuer may raise up to $50 million.
Now indications of investor interest are non-binding commitments from individual investors. The key for Indie Crowd Funder is keeping as much and as many of these investors committed to backing the fund. Under Reg A+, companies raising capital are allowed to “Test the Waters” to measure how much support an offer will capture. Right now, it looks like Raven Fund 1 is doing pretty well.
So what is Raven Fund 1?
The purpose of the Fund is to develop, produce, distribute, and manage a diversified portfolio of horror genre entertainment content, between $500,000 and $5 million dollars per product. This is a “blind pool” offering because the company has not yet identified any investments to develop with the net proceeds of this offering. The company expects to provide liquidity to shareholders by listing the common shares for trading on OTC Markets or another trading markets, within three years from the completion of the offering. Investors may get in with a minimum purchase of $100 (@$1 per share) according to their most recent filing.  Offering costs are pegged at $1 million so if Raven Fund 1 only hits the minimum level of investment of $2 million – 50% of the money is already gone.

As Indie Crowd Funder points out, the horror genre is concept driven and does not demand a costly “star” to carry the film.  There is a history of low budget horror flicks that have performed quite well over the years. Horror films can be a gift that keeps on giving.
The Offering Circular for the offer is viewable here.
