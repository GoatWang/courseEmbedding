Product Simplicity

14 July 2015



A lot has been read about simplicity in product development. Go ahead, Google it. My lesson in simplicity is the outcome of my experience at Wallaby. I founded Wallaby to produce the Wallaby Card. The Wallaby Card was to be one card to rule them all. It would be a single piece of plastic that allowed you access to all of your credit cards in one physical item and automatically choose the best card for every purchase to maximize rewards, minimize interest and fees—whatever you prefer.(Side Note: The Wallaby Card predates Coin, Stratos, Wocket, Plastc, etc., etc. and was conceived as a completely different solution. Wallaby Card was to be a software-based, cloud-based digital wallet with intelligent routing. The others are literally computers shaped like a credit card—that is they are hardware solutions.)When I described the Wallaby Card I received one of two reactions:Awesome! How can I get one?I don’t get it; I only have one debit/credit cardThis is why I knew I should quit my job and start a company.  I could explain it in a few sentences, in less than 30 seconds and a large portion of people would just ask how they could get one. The other people simply weren’t my market. Lacking classic Silicon Valley ambition, I hadn’t yet considered that my product should be for everyone; a subset served me fine. I knew that more than 70M people had more than one credit card and the average American carries more than three.Well, as you probably know if you read my blog, there is no Wallaby Card. For reasons I won’t get into here, I was never able to turn my original vision into a reality.What we did build is an intelligent decision-making software platform that does optimize for all the things a Wallaby Card was going to do (rewards, interest, fees, cash flow, etc.). We build the absolute largest and most complete database of credit card information in the US. We just don’t have a card and can’t process payments.Now when I explain Wallaby it sounds more like this:Wallaby is a personal finance software company. Our apps help users to save hundreds of dollars each year by making the right decision every time they shop—to maximize rewards, minimize interest, manage cash flow, or whatever their preference is.I think it’s great. We have lots of users and great growth. We sold the company on this software.That said, we haven’t quite put it all down into the simplest and best format yet. When I explain this, many people in our market (not market #2 above) are a little turned off because, it’s just another app. Yes, we’re all suffering from app overload.We need to make it more simple. We’re working on it (in reverse, our next version is more capable, but hopefully easier to use). Everyday I think about product planning and what to do next. Everyday I challenge myself to make it simple and find a way back to when people just got it. That’s the magic of an amazing idea and a great product. If you have stumbled on that, you have to keep building it. It’s a rare opportunity.

                                How does your service stand out?
                            

                                Every time I work with a client, I dedicate myself entirely to meet their specific needs. I always ensure that the finished product is of the highest quality, and that the artist is fully satisfied. Music is and has always been my passion, and I believe that having a "good ear" combined with technical knowledge, are a few key reasons why my service stands out.

                                What do you enjoy about the work you do?
                            

                                I enjoy the entire process. From meeting and connecting with the artists, to actually recording them, to editing and mixing their music, to then hearing how excited they are with the finished product. From musicians, to singers, rappers, or voiceover actors, i'm truly grateful to be able to help someone get one step closer to making their dream come true. I have a lot of fun helping other creative people bring their ideas to life.

5 Star Experience!
It was a very comfortable setting from the get-go. Very professional when it came to recording but still down to earth it was a great mix in what you would want in someone helping bring your project to life, he's very patient and wants to help you get your sound the way you want it while still putting his input in. It was a unique first experience, and I'm ready for the next.

Highly recommend!
I'm an aspiring rapper and am very new to the music production side of the business. I'm very glad that I got to meet up with Matt though. He truly cares about his clients and really excels when it comes to teaching them as well. From the studio session I was in I was already able to hear the professional quality sound of the music that was being created. Give Matt a try he won't disappoint!

Recommended Recording/Producing of Music
Working with Matt was a fantastic experience; the chilled back environment as well as his musical expertise really helped me produce the best sound I was capable of when recording. The equipment is professional grade & Matt has quite the talent for mixing as well as mastering. If you need a place to record &/or someone to mix & master your music, hit the homeboy, Matt, up!

Matthew was awesome. Very accommodating and friendly and had a very positive vibe, an extremely easy person to work with. He made sure we used the studio time to the fullest without unnecessarily elongating time causing us to spend more money.  The quality of work is incredible.  Will definitely come to him again with my music needs, a true professional.

Couldn't ask for a better "in home" recording experience! He works quick, has quality mic, and an attention to detail that make him a person I will continue to work with again and again. He provides constructive feedback and positive comments throughout, and works like a team member to create quality product! I left with a copy of my track and was happy with product turnout for it being a short session. We planned on mixing and fixing track up on the following session. He worked on touching up and mixing the song unpaid on his own time after I left and then sent me text message telling me to check my email. What i found in email was an amazing copy of my track that was already mixed, tweaked, and had added hip hop effects needed in today's world!! Dedicated to his craft and for sure someone you should hire!!

Matt was able to accommodate us as far as time was concerned and produced HIGH quality voice over in less than 24 hours after recording.  Would highly recommend.  Thanks Matt!!

Matthew was very accommodating and helpful with what needed to be done. He gave advice, which helped quite a bit, and provided a final product quickly and with great quality.
