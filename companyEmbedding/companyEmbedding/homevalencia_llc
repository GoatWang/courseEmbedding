Customer Questions & Answers








            Are these sheer?
        


Asked by: jess

            They are not 'blackout' panels, meaning light will come through.

The fabric is coarse like linen, and silver design looks more velvet. Material has weight. Looks much better in a distance, and when hung, it's beautiful. With exterior back lighting, the design appears to be much darker. I love them!!

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.

                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

Should you file a  DBA as a  sole owner, form an LLC, or Incorporate? In general, if you are one person,  and have a lot of personal assets, incorporate or form an LLC.  You will be protected from law suits/creditors and you may  save on business taxes.   An LLC is far superior to incorporation because it protects both your business and personal assets.

A home business needs all licensing as any other type of business.  Even if it is a home based business operated from home online having an internet website, it will need licenses such as a business license and a DBA to register the business name as well as other tax IDs such as a seller’s permit id if it sells taxable items.  A home business or home-based business or HBB is a small business that operates from the business owners home or his home office. In most cases, a home business employs few workers or employs family members to do the home business tasks.

Starting a Business On eBay requires at least a business license and a sellers permit.  The permit is required because each time you sell any merchandise as a business, you need to charge taxes.   You will collect the taxes for the eBay sold items and pay it to the state.  Another reason you need a sellers permit is that you will need to number to create a resale certificate each time you buy wholesale.  Note, that even if you sell wholesale, you will need a sellers permit.

In addition, for a permit to sell on eBay, you will need an assumed business name, DBA, and a business.  Also, note that you could incorporate or form an LLC instead of registering a DBA fictitious business name.
On eBay you can sell furniture, clothes, jewelry, electronics, and any woman & men accessories, however, you need to make sure that you have the licenses that are legally required to sell on eBay.

          LLC (Limited Liability Company) FAQs: 
Q:   Is setting up an LLC a better choice than filing a DBA?    
A:   Wanting to issue preferred or common shares requires a C corporation otherwise set up an LLC or file an S corp..  
deas XYZtch GotomobileusaCo.    
   this company name as well as any other business name must be filed with the clerk as a trade name registration and that requires a filing fee to be registered.  
   A trade registration is requred but if the owner wants to use the business name exclusively he or she cannot because anyone else can also file the same trade name.  Nor does the trade name registration protects the owner from personal legal or financial liability as forming a limited liability company (LLC) .   
Our recommendation that since you need to pay a fee to register the business name, simply form a limited liability company (LLC) for a similar fee and get both corporate status and protection for the name as well as personal liabilities.   
So, for instance, if someone slips and falls in your business premises, they can sue you personally if you are not a limited liability company (LLC).  
    Note that once you incorporate no one can register the limited liability company (LLC) name at the state level. 

Q:   Is Delaware the best state to incorporate or set up an llc?
A:    Best state is your state. 
Q:  How can I come up with a catchy name for my business? 
A:    You can also search for trademarks or on yahoo to find out if the name is taken or hire a consultant to help you name your business. 
Q:  Do I need a lot of capital to form an LLC? 
A:  No, you don't need capital to start an LLC. 
Q:   Does your service can set up the llc for me or  I need a lawyer? 
A:    No attorney needed. We can form the llc for you.
Q:   How do I apply for an llc LLC number?
A:   You can apply for a LLC number here online. Simple click on the order button - fill out the application - and submit it so we can obtain the ID for you . 
Q:   What are the benefits of havin a DUNS number? 
A:   You can use it to your benefit by providing favorable business information to make it more likely to get a loan from a lender bank. 
Q:   Do I need to pay sales tax to the state as an LLC?
A:   Paying sales tax depends on your state. For example in Oregon you dont need to pay sales tax but you still need a resale certificate to buy from other states wholesale  products.
