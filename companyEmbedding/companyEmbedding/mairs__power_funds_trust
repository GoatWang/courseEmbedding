                                    Growth Fund (MPGFX) Overview                            
Objective
The Mairs & Power Growth Fund seeks to provide shareholders with a diversified portfolio of common stocks that have the potential for above-average, long-term appreciation.
Investment Strategy

Commits to long-term investing in consistently growing companies with minimal turnover.
Focuses first on companies in Minnesota and the Upper Midwest.
Seeks companies with long-term, durable competitive advantages at reasonable prices.

Fund Characteristics

No load*
Low expense ratios
Tax efficient, low turnover
Regional focus
Multi-cap

The Fund focuses primarily on common stocks with some emphasis on foreign equity securities and convertible debt securities rated less than investment-grade.  Preference is given to holdings in companies with consistent, above-average growth, durable competitive advantages and financial strength. Recognizing that smaller capitalization companies can provide somewhat higher returns over longer time frames, some emphasis is placed on small companies to medium-sized companies, generally located in the Upper Midwest region. The Fund seeks to keep its assets reasonably fully invested at all times, maintain modest portfolio turnover rates, and to moderate risk by investing in a diversified portfolio of equity securities.
*You pay no sales charge for the purchase or sale of Fund shares and no 12b-1 marketing fees. You will, however, incur expenses for investment advisory, management and administrative services, which are included in annual fund operating expenses.

Objective
The Mairs & Power Balanced Fund seeks to provide capital growth, current income, and preservation of capital.
Investment Strategy

Commits to long-term investing with minimal turnover in consistently growing companies.
Focuses first on companies in Minnesota and the upper Midwest.
Seeks companies with long-term, durable competitive advantages as defined by Porter’s Five Forces at reasonable prices.
Diversifies across a portfolio of approximately 60% equity and 40% fixed income.

The Fund emphasizes investments in common stock and fixed income securities, with preference given to higher rated investment-grade fixed income securities (Baa or better by Moody’s Investors Service). Lower rated debt securities may be purchased if we believe the potential rewards outweigh the incremental risks. The Fund may also invest in foreign securities, which includes ADRs. The Fund may also invest in other investment vehicles. See the Fund’s prospectus for a complete list. The Fund seeks to keep its assets reasonably fully invested at all times, maintain modest portfolio turnover rates and moderate risk by investing in a diversified portfolio of equity and fixed income securities. 
The Fund is offered on a no-load basis.*
*You pay no sales charge for the purchase or sale of Fund shares and no 12b-1 marketing fees. You will, however, incur expenses for investment advisory, management and administrative services, which are included in annual fund operating expenses.

                            Mairs & Power's Small Cap Fund Closes to New Investors                    
Announcement - August 15, 2016
After careful deliberation, Mairs & Power has decided to close the Small Cap Fund (MSCFX/ the "Fund") to new investors effective as of the close of business on September 30, 2016 (the "Closing Date"). The Fund will remain open to investment by existing shareholders, existing Mairs & Power private clients, retirement plans with an existing agreement and new or existing clients of an individual financial adviser representative with pre-existing investments in the Fund.
Mairs & Power Growth Fund (MPGFX) and Mairs & Power Balanced Fund (MAPOX) remain open to new investors.
"With our disciplined, low turnover and long-term investment approach, we hold relatively concentrated positions in a carefully selected portfolio of companies. This strategy means that we manage our asset base carefully," said Mark Henneman, Chief Investment Officer of Mairs & Power, Inc. (the "Adviser"). "We manage capacity for each of our Funds individually, taking a conservative approach that considers, among other factors, total assets under management, the rate of asset growth and the availability of securities that meet the Funds' investment objectives."
"We believe this decision is in the best long-term interest of the Small Cap Fund's existing shareholders, as it allows us to maintain stable and balanced growth with the Fund. We remain confident in our ability to continue to find attractive investment opportunities within the small cap universe and we remain committed to protecting the interests of our Fund's shareholders. This soft close demonstrates that commitment," said Andrew Adams, lead portfolio manager of the Mairs & Power Small Cap Fund.
Launched in 2011, the Small Cap Fund has experienced significant, but manageable, asset flows. The Fund's performance success over one-, three-, and five-year periods led to strong asset growth from both existing and new investors. While this growth has not impacted the Adviser's ability to implement the Fund's stated investment strategy, the decision to close the Fund at this time followed careful deliberation and discussion on how best to serve the interests of existing shareholders by managing asset growth.
Complete guidelines on eligibility to invest in the Fund are available in the Fund's prospectus.
 
About the Small Cap Fund
The Small Cap Fund seeks above-average, long-term appreciation by investing in smaller companies with attractive business niches and prospects for profitable growth. Like all Mairs & Power mutual funds, the Small Cap Fund focuses the majority of its investments on companies located in the Upper Midwest. Lead portfolio manager Andrew R. Adams and co-manager Allen D. Steinkopf bring a total of 43 years of professional investment management experience to their roles, including a combined 14 years at Mairs & Power.

                            White Papers                    
Mairs & Power has produced two white papers - Why Minnesota Works for Investors and Focused Investing for the Long-Term
January 2017 - Why Minnesota Works for Investors, this white paper describes what we at Mairs & Power have long known; Minnesota and the Upper Midwest present an opportunity-rich landscape for investors.
April 2016 - Focused Investing For The Long-Term, this white paper explores why a low-turnover, buy-and-hold strategy works for investors and in particular how, in the current, short-term focused market, such a strategy may deliver an advantage to long-term oriented investors.




                            Full Economic Cycle Charts                    
As a bottom-up fundamental investor, Mairs & Power looks for investments that have "a sustainable competitive advantage" which implies that portfolio holdings will outperform their peers over a long time horizon. When we talk about the advantages of holding through a "economic cycle," the only cycle that is relevant is the economic business cycle fluctuating between periods of expansion and slowing of demand across the economy as measured by Gross Domestic Product growth.
The below charts illustrate the performance of both the Mairs & Power Growth Fund and the Mairs & Power Balanced Fund over five full economic cycles as defined by the national Bureau of Economic Research, measured trough-to-trough, as well as the current period where we are mid-cycle. Each Fund's performance is compared to its relevant benchmark, and in the case of the Growth Fund, with its market index.
These charts illustrate the Growth Fund outperformed its peer as measured by the Lipper Multi-Cap Core Fund Index through every cycle. Both Funds also outperformed their benchmark index in all economic cycles except the 1982-1991 cycle.
The underperformance during the 1982-1991 business cycle coincided with a historic shift in the economy - the dramatic reduction in inflation which had held stock valuations down in the previous cycle. As investors' expectations for inflation came down, there was an across-the-board expansion of stock valuations across the market, resulting in the only period of underperformance to the benchmarks. Both the Growth Fund and Balanced Fund significantly outperformed their benchmarks during the subsequent two cycles.

                            Escheatment and Abandoned Property                    
Mairs & Power Mutual Fund Investor Education on Escheatment and Abandoned Property - June 2015Escheatment is the process of turning over financial assets considered lost or abandoned property to a state authority.  Abandoned property is property that is unclaimed by its rightful owner or his or her heirs.  Unclaimed property refers to accounts in financial institutions and companies that have had no activity generated or contact with the owner for one year or longer.  States define abandoned property as one of, or a combination of, accounts without activity initiated by the account owner; accounts with an address deemed as undeliverable by the USPS; or uncashed checks.  Each state has its own rules concerning abandoned property.  The time periods for abandoned property range from three to five years.
It is important to note that abandoned property rules prevents Mairs & Power from recording systematic purchases or redemptions as contact as well as automatic reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. 
Please contact Shareholder Services at 800-304-7404 with any questions you have regarding this information.  If you have any questions regarding the laws specific to your state of residence, you may visit the National Association of Unclaimed Property Administrators website at www.unclaimed.org for more information.
If you received a notice that your account(s) are subject to escheatment, please perform one of the following:

Complete the Shareholder Signature(s) section in the notice mailed to you and return the entire letter in the envelope provided;

Mairs & Power Mutual Funds Announce Co-Portfolio Manager and Officer Changes

Jan 07, 2015, 10:05 ET
		  		  					
						 from   Mairs and Power 











 
















































 

 




















 


ST. PAUL, Minn., Jan. 7, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Mairs and Power, an independent, employee owned investment advisory firm, is pleased to announce new co-managers and a new President of its three no-load mutual funds – the Mairs & Power Growth Fund (MPGFX), Balanced Fund (MAPOX) and Small Cap Fund (MSCFX), effective January 1. 
Andrew Adams joins lead manager Mark Henneman as co-manager of the Growth Fund; Kevin Earley joins lead manager Ronald Kaliebe as co-manager of the Balanced Fund and Allen Steinkopf joins lead manager Andrew Adams as co-manager of the Small Cap Fund. Mark Henneman has been appointed President of the Mairs & Power Funds Trust (Trust).  
These executive changes culminate a long-term succession plan which begun several years ago in anticipation of William Frels mandatory retirement on December 31, 2014 as co-manager of the Growth and Balanced Funds and Trustee and President of the Trust. In 2006, Mr. Henneman and Mr. Kaliebe were named co-managers of the Growth Fund and Balanced Fund respectively and moved into lead manager positions of those funds in 2013. The conservative, long-term investment management approach of both the Growth Fund and the Balanced Fund will remain unchanged. 
"Succession planning is a natural component of Mairs & Power's long-term focus," said Jon A. Theobald, Chairman and C.E.O. of Mairs and Power, Inc. "As the oldest investment firm under continuous private ownership and management in Minnesota, we employ a deliberate and disciplined succession planning process to ensure consistency in our investment philosophy over time while providing growth and development opportunities for our investment professionals. All the individuals assuming new roles at our Funds have been groomed for these added responsibilities." 
Andrew Adams joined Mairs and Power, Inc. in 2006 as Vice President and Investment Manager. Mr. Adams was appointed manager of the new Mairs & Power Small Cap Fund which launched in August of 2011. He will continue as portfolio manager of the Small Cap Fund, and now joins veteran fund manager Mark Henneman as co-portfolio manager of the Growth Fund. Mr. Adams began his investment management career in 1997 as a securities analyst with Advantus Capital Management. Prior to joining Mairs & Power he co-managed the small-cap blend mutual fund at U.S. Bancorp Asset Management (now Nuveen Asset Management).
Kevin Earley joined Mairs and Power, Inc. in 2013 as Vice President, Equity Analyst and Investment Manager. He joins veteran fund manager Ronald Kaliebe as co-portfolio manager of the Balanced Fund. Mr. Earley began his investment management career as an equity analyst with FAF Advisors in 1997, later becoming a portfolio manager as part of the firm's mid-to-large cap value team. Prior to joining Mairs & Power, Mr. Earley co-managed two mutual funds at Nuveen Asset Management. 
Allen Steinkopf joined Mairs and Power, Inc. in September 2013 as Vice President and Investment Manager. He joins veteran fund manager Andrew Adams as co-portfolio manager of the Small Cap Fund.  Mr. Steinkopf began his investment management career as a research analyst with MIMLIC Asset Management in 1993 before assuming increasing responsibility as portfolio manager and senior analyst at Advantus. Prior to joining Mairs & Power, he most recently was senior portfolio manager of small cap equity and directly managed a small cap core mutual fund at Nuveen Asset Management. 
Mr. Henneman joined Mairs & Power in 2004 as Vice President and Investment Manager. In 2006 he was named co-manager of the Growth Fund and in 2013 he became lead manager of the Fund.  Mr. Henneman began his investment management career as an analyst with The St. Paul Companies (now Travelers Companies). He has worked as a portfolio manager with Advantus Capital Management and prior to joining Mairs and Power, Inc., he was Managing Director and Process Leader of mid- and large-cap value Investments at U.S. Bancorp Asset Management (now Nuveen Asset Management).
The Board of Trustees have nominated James D. Alt and Patrick A. Thiele to serve as Trustees of the Trust, subject to approval by shareholders of the Trust at a special meeting to be held in the second quarter of 2015. Current Trustees Norbert J. Conzemius, Bert J. McKasy, Mary Schmid Daugherty and Jon A. Theobald will be up for re-election. 
As of December 31, 2014, the Mairs & Power Growth Fund (MPGFX) held $4.2 billion in assets under management, the Balanced Fund (MAPOX) held $723 million in assets under management and the Small Cap Fund (MSCFX) held $162 million in assets under management.

All investments have risks. The Funds are designed for long-term investors. The Funds' share prices can fall because of weakness in the broad market, a particular industry, or specific holdings. Investments in small and midcap companies generally are more volatile. International investing risks include, among others, political, social or economic instability, difficulty in predicting international trade patterns, taxation and foreign trading practices, and greater fluctuations in price than United States corporations. The Balanced Fund is subject to yield and share price variances with changes in interest rates and market conditions. Investors should note that if interest rates rise significantly from current levels, bond fund total returns will decline and may even turn negative in the short-term. There is also a chance that some of the Fund's holdings may have their credit ratings downgraded or may default.

The maximum tax on interest income from CD’s, Bonds and Money market accounts is up to 35%
