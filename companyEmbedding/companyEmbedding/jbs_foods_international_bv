We estimate that the net proceeds to us from this offering, after deducting
estimated underwriting discounts and offering expenses that are payable by us,
will be approximately US$ million (or approximately US$      million if the
underwriters exercise the over-allotment option in full), assuming the JBS Foods
International common A shares are offered at US$      per JBS Foods
International common A share, which is the midpoint of the estimated price range
set forth on the cover page of this prospectus.

A US$1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed initial public offering price per
JBS Foods International common A share would increase (decrease) the net
proceeds to us from this offering by approximately US$       million, assuming
the number of shares offered by us as set forth on the cover page of this
prospectus remains the same, and after deducting estimated underwriting
discounts and offering expenses that are payable by us. Similarly, each increase
(decrease) of 100,000 shares in the number of JBS Foods International common A
shares offered by us would increase (decrease) the net proceeds to us from this
offering by approximately US$      million, assuming that the assumed initial
public offering price remains the same, after deducting estimated underwriting
discounts and offering expenses that are payable by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering to repay certain of our
indebtedness based on an evaluation of applicable interest rates, outstanding
principal amounts, maturity dates and such other factors as our management deems
to be important and consistent with our liquidity and risk management policies.
Currently, we expect to repay certain export financing agreements with annual
interest rates between 5.0% and 17.0% and maturities between 2017 and 2019.
Pending any specific application, the net proceeds from this offering may be
invested in cash and cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities.


Beef and Pork Industries

The beef and pork sectors are highly competitive in the markets in which we
operate. We believe that the main competitive factors in the beef and pork
industries are operational efficiency, product availability, quality and cost of
raw materials, manpower, price, quality, food safety, product distribution,
technological innovation and brand loyalty. Our ability to compete effectively
depends on our capacity to compete in these areas.

In the beef sector, our primary competitors are international beef producers,
such as Tyson Foods, National Beef Packing Company, LLC and Cargill Inc. in the
United States and Teys Bros Pty Ltd. and Nippon Meat Packers Ltd. in Australia.
In the pork sector, our primary competitors are Smithfield Foods, Inc., Tyson
Foods, Seaboard Foods and Hormel Foods Corporation in the United States and
Cooperativa Aurora—Cooperativa Central Oeste Catarinense Ltda. in Brazil.

In addition, our United States, Canadian and Australian beef operations also
compete with our and our affiliates’ South American beef operations to a limited
degree. For example, our Australian operations export to markets in the European
Union, Africa and the Middle East, Japan and South Korea, which are markets to
which our South American operations also export. We do not believe our
intra-company competition in these markets has a material adverse effect on our
current business.

Poultry Industry

The poultry sector is highly competitive in the markets in which we operate. We
believe that the main competitive factors in the poultry industry vary in
accordance with the market. In the retail market, we believe that competition is
primarily based on product quality, brand awareness, client service and price.
In the food services market, we believe that competition is primarily based on
consistent quality, product development, customer service and price. Our ability
to compete effectively depends on our capacity to compete in these areas.

In the poultry sector, our primary competitors are Tyson Foods and Sanderson
Farms, Inc. in North America, BRF, Inc. in Brazil and 2 Sisters Food Group in
Europe.


Company Description
We are one of the world’s largest food companies and the world’s largest protein
company in terms of revenue. Through strategic acquisitions in new geographies,
primarily in the United States, Australia, Brazil and Europe, we have created a
diversified global platform that allows us to prepare,


 package and deliver
fresh, processed and value-added beef, poultry, pork, lamb and sheep products
and animal by-products. During 2015 and the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2016, we sold our products in approximately 190 countries on six
continents. Our protein products are recognized through our well-known brands,
including “Swift,” “Swift Premium,” “1855,” “Pilgrim’s Pride,” “Pierce,” “Gold
Kist Farms” and “Del Dia” in North America, “Seara,” “Doriana” and “Cabaña Las
Lilas” in South America, “Primo,” “Great Southern” and “Beehive” in Australia
and New Zealand and “Moy Park” and “O’Kane” in Europe.

We believe that, as of September 30, 2016, we were one of the largest:

• beef producers in the world in terms of capacity, with operations in the
  United States, Canada, Australia, Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay and an
  aggregate daily processing capacity of approximately 47,800 head of cattle;

• poultry producers in the world in terms of capacity, with operations in the
  United States, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Brazil and the United Kingdom and an
  aggregate daily processing capacity of approximately 13.7 million chickens;

• pork producers in the United States and Brazil in terms of capacity, with 
  aggregate daily processing capacities of approximately 89,700 hogs and 
  21,200 hogs, respectively. We also operate one pork facility in Australia with
  a daily processing capacity of approximately 4,000 hogs; and

• lamb and sheep producers in the world in terms of capacity, with operations in
  Australia and an aggregate daily slaughtering capacity of approximately 23,800
  lambs.

We also believe that we are a significant producer of further processed and
value-added meat products in the world, with an aggregate monthly production
capacity of approximately 189,400 tons as of September 30, 2016.

Our fresh products include fresh and frozen cuts of beef, pork, lamb and sheep,
whole chickens and chicken parts. Our branded processed and value-added meat
products include products that are cut, ground and packaged in a customized
manner for specific orders and include frozen, cooked, canned, seasoned,
marinated and consumer-ready products.

We sell our products primarily to retailers (such as supermarkets, club stores
and other retail distributors), many of which products include our proprietary
brands, and foodservice companies (such as restaurants, hotels, foodservice
distributors and additional processors) in the countries where we operate our
facilities, which we classify as domestic sales, and elsewhere, which we
classify as export sales. As of September 30, 2016, we had more than 250,000
active customers worldwide, including retailers and wholesalers.

JBS S.A.


JBS Foods International engages in the food business internationally. It operates through four segments: Beef, Pork, Chicken, and Other. It offers fresh and processed beef, lamb, sheep, pork, and chicken. The company is also involved in leather business; and collagen, biodiesel fuel, hygiene and cleaning products, metal packaging, carriers, waste management, casings, and trading activities, as well as provides prepared food products.
Planned IPO and Investigations[edit]
In December 2016, JBS S.A. announced a re-organization plan, part of which involved planning an initial public offer in the United States for its international operations. The intended IPO is expected to be performed through the vehicle company JBS Foods International, as JBS S.A., J&F Investimentos and other companies of the group are involved in 6 different operations from the Brazilian Federal Police, including Operation Car Wash, Bullish, Greenfield, Carne Fraca and Cui Bono. The company's main shareholders, Joesley Batista and Wesley Batista collaborated with the Brazilian police as whistle-blowers[1] for Operation Car Wash, where they confessed over 12 years of crimes,[2] including bribery, active corruption, insider trading, and many other, which helped the JBS group to grow above the market after a series of acquisitions in part funded by loans from banks controlled by the state of Brazil.
Despite the active corruption scandals performed by the Batista brothers, Joesley Batista made it clear that the IPO was not canceled.[3]
After the testimonies provided by the Bastista brothers, Brazil's securities regulator launched four new probes against meatpacker JBS S.A. and other companies controlled by J&F Investimentos on May 19, 2017 to investigate suspicious trades made before markets were rattled by the revelation of a plea deal by the company's top executives.[4]

SAO PAULO, Brazil – JBS Foods International promoted Russ Colaco to CFO. Colaco will lead JBS SA’s spinoff of its international businesses in addition to taking on responsibility for all finance operations at JBS Foods International.
Colaco joined the company in February as director of strategy and corporate development. Before taking the post, he worked for Morgan Stanley as a managing director in the firm’s investment banking division. Colaco spent nine years at Morgan Stanley where he advised clients in the global retail and consumer segments. He also has worked extensively with JBS, the company said. Colaco earned an MBA from the Univ. of Chicago Booth School of Business.
“Russ brings strong financial expertise and a broad-based strategic perspective to JBS,” Wesley Batista, CEO, said in a statement. “He will play an important leadership role as we seek to fully implement our global strategy.” 
In May, JBS SA, the world’s largest meatpacker, announced plans to fold its international businesses and its Seara Alimentos chicken processing business into JBS Foods International and change JBS SA to JBS Brasil. JBS Brasil will hold the company’s Brazilian beef, biodiesel, collagen and carrier businesses along with its global leather business.

JBS S.A. Announces That Its Subsidiary JBS Foods International B.V. Plans to Conduct a Registered Initial Public Offering In the U.S.







      MATERIAL FACT
    

      JBS S.A. Announces That Its Subsidiary JBS Foods International B.V. Plans to Conduct a Registered Initial Public Offering In the U.S.
    

      JBS S.A. ("JBS" or the "Company"), in a further step towards advancing its planned reorganization, announces that its Board of Directors today unanimously approved the filing of a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") of its subsidiary JBS Foods International B.V. (which shall be converted into JBS Foods International N.V.) ("JBSFI") in connection with its plan to conduct an initial public offering ("IPO") on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") for its Class A common shares.
    

      JBSFI has its official seat and registered office address in The Netherlands and shall house all of the international businesses of JBS plus Seara. JBS S.A. will continue to manage and control the Brazilian beef business and related activities including leather processing.
    

      Wesley Mendonça Batista will be the Chairman, a non-executive director, of JBS Foods International. The Board of Directors of JBSFI will be composed of nine members, the majority of whom will be independent. Gilberto Tomazoni, who has held senior executive positions at JBS for the past four years, will be the CEO, while Russ Colaco will be CFO. The Company believes that this revised structure and proposed IPO reflects its global production platform, product portfolio and broad international customer base.
    

      The Company expects to complete the IPO during the first half of 2017. The timing, number of Class A common shares and price of the proposed offering have not yet been determined.
    

      This notice does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy securities, and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of that jurisdiction.
    

      With regard to this material fact, the management of JBS S.A. will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors tomorrow, December 06, 2016 at 10:00am (BRT) in Portuguese and 12:00pm (BRT) in English. Please use the following dial-in instructions:

With restructuring and renaming, JBS shares will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

São Paulo, Brazil — A dramatic reorganization of the world’s largest publicly traded meat company will give JBS S.A. (to be renamed JBS Foods International) improved access to global capital markets and will raise its profile in the institutional investor community, the company said.

Plans for the reorganization and details about the business were published Aug. 5 in registration statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Following a complex transaction, JBS Foods International will be a publicly traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “JBS.”

Under the reorganization, JBS S.A. will contribute all of its assets except its Brazilian beef business to a new holding company (designated as New Holdco). New Holdco will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of JBS International. JBS S.A., the retained Brazilian business, will become a consolidated subsidiary of JBS Foods International but will still trade separately on the Brazilian stock exchange (shares accounting for about 25% of the Brazilian business will continue to trade in this manner). Current shareholders of JBS S.A. common shares will receive one JBS Foods International share for every four JBS S.A. common share held on the distribution date. The transaction is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter.

In a company overview in the filing, JBS describes its business as one of the largest:

• Beef producers and exporters in the world with operations in the United States, Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, Australia and Canada and a capacity to slaughter about 82,400 head of cattle daily;
• Poultry producers in the world, with operations in the United States, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Brazil and the United Kingdom and capacity to slaughter 13.8 million chickens per day;
• Pork producers in Brazil and the United States, with daily capacity to slaughter a combined 110,500 hogs in these markets (in addition to capacity in Australia to slaughter 4,000 hogs per day);
• Lamb and sheep producers and exporters in the world, with operations in Australia and daily slaughtering capacity of about 23,100 lambs;
• And suppliers of further processed and value-added meat products in the world, with a total production capacity of about 204,100 tonnes as of March 2016.

JBS also is one of the largest leather tanners in the world.

“Our fresh products include fresh and frozen cuts of beef, pork, lamb and sheep, whole chickens and chicken parts,” JBS said. “Our processed and value-added meat products include products that are cut, ground and packaged in a customized manner for specific orders and include frozen, cooked, canned, seasoned, marinated and consumer-ready products. In addition, we produce and sell animal byproducts that are derived from our beef processing.”

The company also sells prepared food products, including ready-to-eat meals, frozen pizza and lasagna. JBS’s customers are mostly retailers and food service companies. As of March, JBS had more than 350,000 active customers. The company sells its products in 190 countries on 5 continents.

“Through strategic acquisition in new geographies, primarily in the United States, Australia, Brazil and Europe, we have created a diversified global platform that allows us to prepare, package and deliver fresh, processed and value-added beef, poultry, pork, lamb and sheep products and animal byproducts from our facilities located around the world,” JBS said.

The company’s North American brands include Swift, 1855, Pilgrim’s Pride, Pierce, Gold Kist Farms and Del Dia.

A business established in 1953 by Jose Batista Sborinho, “global protein powerhouse” would not have been an apt descriptor for the company’s first 50 years. Mr. Batista started the company operating a small slaughterhouse (daily slaughtering capacity: five head of cattle) in Anapolis in the State of Goias, about 100 miles southwest of Brasilia. Originally named Friboi Ltd., the company began expanding in the early 1970s through acquisitions and capital expenditures. By 2001, daily slaughter capacity in Brazil had reached 5,800 head of cattle.

In 2005, the company made its first international foray, acquiring Swift-Armour Argentina S.A., the largest beef producer and exporter in Argentina. The following year the corporation was renamed JBS S.A.

Frenetic expansion marked the following 10 years, including an initial public offering in Brazil in 2007 and the $1.5 billion acquisition of Swift & Co. in the United States that same year.

In 2008, JBS acquired National Beef Packing Co. and Smithfield Beef Group, Inc. in the United States and Tasman Group Ltd. in Australia.

In 2009, JBS acquired 65% of Pilgrim’s Pride Corp., one of the largest chicken processors in the United States. In transactions in 2014 and 2015, JBS acquired the Brazilian and Mexican poultry assets of Tyson Foods, Inc., and in March 2015 acquired Consolidated Food Holdings Pty Ltd. (known as Primo) for $1.2 billion. Primo is a leading processor of lamb, sheep and pork in Australia.

That same year, JBS acquired Moy Park Holdings Europe Ltd. for $1.5 billion. The transaction expanded JBS operations in Europe, including its portfolio of processed and high value-added products. Yet another transaction in 2015, completed in October, was a $1.4 billion acquisition of the Cargill Meat Solutions Corp. U.S. pork business.

Even after this expansion, the company’s principal shareholders remain Mr. Batista, his wife, Flora Mendonça Batista, and five of their children: Valere Batista Mendonça Ramos, Vanessa Mendonça Batista, Wesley Mendonça Batista, Joesley Mendonça Batista and Vivianne Mendonça Batista.

The Batista family owns 44.5% of JBS. The Brazilian National Economic and Social Development Bank owns 21.4% while Caixa, a financial institution owned by the Brazilian government, owns 7.3%. Other shareholders own 26.8%. Following the transaction, the family is expected to own 46.7% of JBS Foods International.

Since July, the company has been led by Wesley Mendonça Batista. The 46-year-old took the helm of the company’s global operations in 2011 and for four years before that was president and chief executive officer of JBS USA Holdings. In that role, he oversaw the U.S market following the 2007 acquisition of Swift & Company. Also during his tenure the Smithfield Beef and other beef businesses were acquired as was a controlling interest in Pilgrim’s Pride.

Before 2007, Mr. Batista spent 15 years as chief operating officer of the company’s operations in Brazil and Argentina. It was during this period the company became the largest beef producer and exporter in Latin America.

In 2015, JBS S.A. net income was 5,128.6 million reals (the exchange rate recently was 3.22 reals per dollar), up from 2,406.4 million in 2014 and 1,118.3 million in 2013. Net revenue was 162,914.5 million reals in 2015, up from 120,469.7 million in 2014 and 92,902.8 million in 2013. Gross profit and operating profit steadily improved during this period.

In the first three months of 2016, JBS S.A. sustained a loss of 3,802.6 million reals, versus a profit of 2,089.4 million in the same period in 2015. Sales were 43,911.9 million reals, up from 33,819 million. The loss was attributed in large measure to a surge in the value of the real — up 36% over the year. The currency swing also represented a significant headwind for the company in 2015. During this period, 85% of the company’s revenues came from sales outside of Brazil.

The company’s long-term debt as of March 31 was 43,198 million reals (plus another 21 million of current debt). The company said its financing strategy post-transaction will be to extend the average maturity of outstanding debt and reduce financing costs by “accessing lower-cost sources of finance, including through the international capital markets and export finance.” Yield on the company’s long-term debt hovered around 7% recently, a level analysts said is likely to decline following the restructuring.

The importance of financing as a driver of the JBS restructuring decision was emphasized by Wesley Batista.

“JBS doesn’t have the same access to capital as other global players,” he said in a recent interview with Bloomberg News. “We’re seeking a structure that better reflects the company JBS has become.”

The restructuring is taking place against a backdrop of turmoil in Brazil and at JBS. Enduring a severe recession, surging inflation and rising interest rates, the country’s political leadership has been wracked by scandal.

Brazil’s problems appear to have had serious spillover effect at JBS.

Joesley Batista is among a group of individuals who are subjects of a criminal complaint filed by the federal prosecutor’s office in Brazil related to financial transactions. The prospectus describes the proceeding as “in its early stages” but warns of the possibility the company’s reputation may be adversely affected. JBS is not a party to the complaint. More recently, JBS has been accused of making illegal political contributions, raising the specter of the company being dragged more deeply into Brazil’s political morass.

Still, the market reacted ebulliently to news of the restructuring plan. Shares of JBS jumped in trading on the Brazilian exchange by about 25% the day the plan was announced, lifting the company’s market capitalization to about $9 billion.

The prospectus offers a fairly deep look into JBS consolidated operations around the world. In the United States, JBS operates nine beef processing plants (daily capacity, 27,455 head of cattle) , five pork processing plants (89,700) and 23 poultry plants (6,207,626). The company’s U.S. corporate headquarters are in Greeley, Colo., about 60 miles north of Denver. JBS S.A. headquarters are in Sao Paulo, but the new business has been incorporated in Dublin, Ireland. The company also leased office space in New York City.
