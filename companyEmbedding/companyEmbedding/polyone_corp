The company[edit]
PolyOne is a provider of specialized polymer materials, services , and solutions with operations in specialty polymer formulations, color and additive systems, polymer distribution and specialty vinyl resins. They are also a highly specialized developer and manufacturer of performance enhancing additives, liquid colorants, and fluoropolymer and silicone colorants. Headquartered in Avon Lake, Ohio, PolyOne has employees at manufacturing sites and distribution facilities in North America, South America, Europe and Asia. They provide value to customers through their ability to link their knowledge of polymers and formulation technology with their manufacturing and supply chain capabilities to provide value added solutions to designers, assemblers and processors of plastics (their customers).
They operate in four reportable segments: (1) Global Specialty Engineered Materials; (2) Global Color, Additives and Inks; (3) Performance Products and Solutions; and (4) PolyOne Distribution. In February 2011, they sold their 50% equity interest in SunBelt Chlor Alkali Partnership (SunBelt), which was a reportable segment in prior periods.[4]
History[edit]
PolyOne was formed on August 31, 2000 from the consolidation of The Geon Company (Geon) and M.A. Hanna Company (Hanna). The merger between M.A. Hanna Company and The Geon Company in 2000 produced PolyOne Corporation, a Fortune 1000 company.[5] Geon’s roots date back to 1927 when BFGoodrich scientist Waldo Semon produced the first usable vinyl polymer. In 1948, BFGoodrich created a vinyl plastic division that was subsequently spun off through a public offering in 1993, creating Geon, a separate publicly held company. Hanna was formed in 1885 as a privately held company and became publicly held in 1927. In the mid-1980s, Hanna began to divest its historic mining and shipping businesses to focus on polymers. Hanna purchased its first polymer company in 1986 and completed its 26th polymer company acquisition in 2000.

The company[edit]
PolyOne is a provider of specialized polymer materials, services , and solutions with operations in specialty polymer formulations, color and additive systems, polymer distribution and specialty vinyl resins. They are also a highly specialized developer and manufacturer of performance enhancing additives, liquid colorants, and fluoropolymer and silicone colorants. Headquartered in Avon Lake, Ohio, PolyOne has employees at manufacturing sites and distribution facilities in North America, South America, Europe and Asia. They provide value to customers through their ability to link their knowledge of polymers and formulation technology with their manufacturing and supply chain capabilities to provide value added solutions to designers, assemblers and processors of plastics (their customers).
They operate in four reportable segments: (1) Global Specialty Engineered Materials; (2) Global Color, Additives and Inks; (3) Performance Products and Solutions; and (4) PolyOne Distribution. In February 2011, they sold their 50% equity interest in SunBelt Chlor Alkali Partnership (SunBelt), which was a reportable segment in prior periods.[4]
History[edit]
PolyOne was formed on August 31, 2000 from the consolidation of The Geon Company (Geon) and M.A. Hanna Company (Hanna). The merger between M.A. Hanna Company and The Geon Company in 2000 produced PolyOne Corporation, a Fortune 1000 company.[5] Geon’s roots date back to 1927 when BFGoodrich scientist Waldo Semon produced the first usable vinyl polymer. In 1948, BFGoodrich created a vinyl plastic division that was subsequently spun off through a public offering in 1993, creating Geon, a separate publicly held company. Hanna was formed in 1885 as a privately held company and became publicly held in 1927. In the mid-1980s, Hanna began to divest its historic mining and shipping businesses to focus on polymers. Hanna purchased its first polymer company in 1986 and completed its 26th polymer company acquisition in 2000.
