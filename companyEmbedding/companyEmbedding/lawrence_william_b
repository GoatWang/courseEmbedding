The protected books are then placed in a cardboard box to protect covers and corners.   Orders with a product price under 7 are shipped in waterproof bubble mailers.     Shipping will be your choice of usps media mail or priority mail.   Due to cost constraints, priority and international shipments may ship in a cardboard flat rate envelope.

Parenting and Teen Drug Use
The Most Recent Findings from Research, Prevention, and Treatment
Edited by Lawrence M. Scheier and William B. Hansen


Provides an overview of parental influences of intergenerational transmission of drug use, including genetics, behavioral modeling, and socialization
Highlights subtle reciprocal influences between parent and child and how they contribute to negative developmental outcomes including drug use
Discusses hallmark features of youth development including identity formation, psychological autonomy, parent-child communication, parental and peer support mechanisms and ways these can influence both anti- and pro-social behavior
Examines the latest in family-based prevention programs, paying particular attention to what makes certain programs "evidence-based" and how they incorporate the latest in drug research and family-based theories of behavior change
Reviews therapeutic goals of treatment, assessment strategies for youth entering treatment, the process of empowering youth, and the salient goals of treatment for high-risk youth
Reinforces the important role of parents and home environment as they influence positive youth adaptation








Parenting and Teen Drug Use
The Most Recent Findings from Research, Prevention, and Treatment
Edited by Lawrence M. Scheier and William B. Hansen



Description



Teen drug use is a critical and timely health issue that deeply affects adolescent development in a number of important areas, including social, cognitive, and affective functioning, as well as long-term health and wellbeing. Trends indicate that drug use is starting at an earlier age, the potency of several drugs is much stronger than in the past, and more new drugs are illegally being manufactured to provide faster, heightened effects. In addition, illegal use of prescription drugs and drug diversion or the sharing of prescription medication is also on the rise amongst teens. Parenting and Teen Drug Use provides comprehensive coverage of the most current research on youth drug use and prevention, carefully and meticulously presenting empirical evidence and theoretical arguments that underlie the mechanisms linking parental socialization and adolescent drug use. Written by leading experts, chapters examine the causes and consequences of drug use, the myriad ways to prevent it, and the latest findings from the prevention research community regarding what works, with a specific emphasis on parenting techniques that have shown the most promise for reducing or preventing drug use in teens. Parenting and Teen Drug Use will provide valuable insight to a wide audience of clinicians, treatment providers, school counselors, prevention experts, social workers, physicians, substance abuse counselors, students, and those who work with youth on a day-to-day basis to influence positive youth adaptation.

Reviews and Awards


"This is a terrific book. Scheier and Hansen bring forward an authoritative, comprehensive, and clinically valuable volume. Top-tier researchers and intervention developers present their own work, summarize the major developments connecting parenting practices and youth drug use, and specify a road map for family-based prevention and treatment professionals and scientists." -Howard A. Liddle, EdD, ABPP, Professor and Director, Department of Public Health Sciences and Center for Treatment Research on Adolescent Drug Abuse, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine
"This vade mecum will prove indispensable to the practitioner, researcher, and policymaker who needs access to the latest approaches and empirical evidence on the nexus of parenting and drug use among youth. Scheier and Hansen have done a great service to the field in compiling into a single volume the corpus of practical, scientific knowledge in this area."-Steven Schinke, PhD, D'Elbert and Selma Keenan Professor of Social Work, Columbia University
"This book thoroughly covers the topic of parenting and teen drug use. It is easy to read and full of research findings. The authors address theoretical arguments of parenting styles and the relationship to substance use in adolescence, along with presenting prevention and treatment programs. This book should be in the libraries of clinicians who work with teenagers and families." --Gary B Kaniuk, Psy.D., Doody's Health Science Book Review

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
