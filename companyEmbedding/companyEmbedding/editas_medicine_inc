Company Overview 
There are few times in our lives when science astonishes us - when we suddenly may be able to do something that once seemed out of reach. This is one of those moments.  







What if we could repair broken genes?
What if we could address the root cause of diseases caused by mutations in our DNA?
That’s what the team at Editas Medicine is striving to achieve. 








Editas Medicine is building the leading genome editing company dedicated to treating patients with genetically defined diseases.
At Editas Medicine, we believe we have entered a new era in genomic medicine as the growth of genomic information in recent years has significantly expanded our understanding of genetically defined diseases. Furthermore, a new technology known as CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) has the potential to achieve accurate, directed changes in DNA and fulfill the promise that started with the sequencing of the human genome – the potential to treat diseases at their source, at the DNA level. 









At Editas Medicine, we’re committed to harnessing the power and potential of genome editing to develop transformative medicines for patients suffering from serious diseases. 






Our Culture
Our values are the critical foundation upon which we have built – and continue to grow – the culture at Editas Medicine. They reflect how we think about the patients we aspire to help, the science we do, how we operate as a company, and who we hire.

CRISPR | Genome Editing, DNA Repair






















LATEST NEWS - June 13, 2017 - Editas Medicine to Participate in Investor…

read more 
more news 






more news



What is CRISPR? 
CRISPR is a dynamic, versatile tool that allows us to target nearly any genomic location and potentially repair broken genes. But what exactly is CRISPR? How does it work?  






CRISPR
CRISPR technology uses a protein-RNA complex composed of either the protein Cas9 or Cpf1, each of which binds to a guide RNA (gRNA) molecule that has been designed to recognize a particular DNA sequence. 



















How does CRISPR work?
Cas9 and Cpf1 can be reprogrammed to different sites or multiple sites using multiple gRNAs. The availability of the different engineered variants of Cas9 and Cpf1 allows for different types of cuts for genome editing, which include the following:
Cut & Revise and Cut & Remove typically result in disruption of a problematic gene or elimination of a mutation. These approaches leverage the cell's natural DNA repair mechanisms known as non-homologous end joining, or NHEJ, to complete the edit.
When a cell repairs a DNA cut by NHEJ, it leaves small insertions and deletions at the cut site, collectively referred to as indels. NHEJ can be used to either cut and revise the targeted gene or to cut and remove a segment of DNA. In the ''cut and revise'' process, a single cut is made. In the ''cut and remove'' process, two cuts are made, which results in the removal of the intervening segment of DNA. This approach could be used to delete either a small or a large segment of DNA depending on the type of repair desired.

The second mechanism – our Cut & Replace approach – leverages a different DNA repair mechanism known as homology directed repair, or HDR. In this approach, a DNA template is also provided, one that is similar to the DNA that has been cut. The cell can use the template to construct reparative DNA, resulting in the replacement of a defective genetic sequence with the correct one.








What makes us different?
Advantages of our genome editing platform 
In order to fully realize the broad potential of CRISPR technology to develop genomic medicines, we must be able to do the following:





Efficientlyedit a wide rangeof mutations




Reach the siteof disease




Tightly controlthe cuttingof DNA




Achievethe rightrepair





At Editas Medicine, we have developed a proprietary genome editing platform consisting of four interrelated components that are designed to meet these goals. Each component is underpinned by several specific technologies and capabilities. With our platform, we are able to design and optimize each element of our products necessary to achieve the desired edit, including the type of Cas9 or Cpf1, the sequence and structure of the guide RNA(s), the delivery vector, and elements to control expression in cells and drive the desired repair mechanism.
Cpf1 complements our expanding toolbox of CRISPR enzymes, increasing our ability to target additional disease mutations. This new enzyme uses a smaller, simpler guide-RNA, does not include a tracrRNA, and produces a different type of cut at the target DNA. 












What would CRISPR medicines look like?
Medicines utilizing CRISPR technology are likely to come in a variety of configurations that open the door to treating a wide range of diseases. They can be designed and optimized to provide efficient and tightly controlled delivery to the desired tissue or cell type. Our strategy is to leverage existing delivery technologies to target the relevant cell types while also exploring a variety of next-generation delivery approaches.

One Team. Many Voices. 







Our History
In 2013, several of the scientists credited with discovering and developing CRISPR joined forces to establish what is now called Editas Medicine. Those scientists – Feng Zhang, George Church and Jennifer Doudna – along with fellow founders Keith Joung and David Liu, were focused on translating the new technology into therapies that enable precise and corrective molecular modification to treat people with a broad range of diseases at the genetic level.
In November 2013, Editas Medicine secured a $43 million Series A financing led by Flagship Pioneering, Polaris Partners and Third Rock Ventures, with participation from the Partners Innovation Fund, and assembled a strong leadership team and board of directors. 









Exceptional People and Culture
The lifeblood of our company is our exceptional people and culture. We have purposefully built the team with a focus on passionate scientists and company-builders who have hands-on experience translating groundbreaking science into important new medicines.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.

We estimate that the net proceeds to us from the sale of the common stock
that we are offering will be approximately $84.6 million after deducting the
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. If the underwriters exercise in full their over-allotment option, we
estimate that the net proceeds from this offering will be approximately
$97.8 million after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us.

As of September 30, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $155.3 million. 
The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our financial 
flexibility, create a public market for our common stock, and to facilitate our
access to the public equity markets. We intend to use approximately $15 to $20 
million of the net proceeds from this offering for preclinical studies and 
clinical trials for our LCA10 program and up to $22 million of the net proceeds
from this offering for preclinical studies in our collaboration with Juno 
Therapeutics. We intend to use the remainder of the net proceeds from this 
offering for continued expansion of our platform technology, preclinical studies
of our research programs in addition to LCA10 and engineered T cells, working 
capital and general corporate purposes. We believe opportunities may exist from
time to time to expand our current business through acquisitions of 
complementary companies, products, or technologies. While we have no current 
agreements, commitments or understandings for any specific acquisitions at this
time, we may use a portion of the net proceeds for these purposes.

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash 
and cash equivalents represents our intentions based upon our current plans and 
business conditions. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary
significantly depending on numerous factors, including the progress of our
development and commercialization efforts, the status of and results from
clinical trials, any collaborations that we may enter into with third parties
for our programs, and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our management
will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this
offering. We have no current agreements, commitments, or understandings for any
material acquisitions or licenses of any products, businesses, or technologies.
Based on our planned use of the net proceeds from this offering and our existing
cash and cash equivalents, we estimate that such funds will be sufficient to
enable us to fund our operating expenses, debt service, and capital expenditure
requirements through at least the next 24 months. We have based this estimate on
assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital
resources sooner than we currently expect. We do not expect that the net
proceeds from this offering and our existing cash and cash equivalents will be
sufficient to enable us to fund the completion of development of any product
candidates we may develop.

Pending use of the proceeds as described above, we intend to invest the proceeds
in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities.


The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including in the gene therapy 
and genome-editing fields, are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies,
intense competition, and a strong emphasis on intellectual property and 
proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, development 
experience, and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, 
we face potential competition from many different sources, including major 
pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical, and biotechnology companies, academic
institutions and governmental agencies, and public and private research
institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and
commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may
become available in the future.

We compete in the segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and other 
related markets that utilize technologies encompassing genomic medicines to 
create therapies, including genome editing and gene therapy. There are
additional companies that are working to develop therapies in areas related to
our research programs.

Our platform and product focus is the development of therapies using CRISPR/Cas9
technology. Other companies developing CRISPR/Cas9 technology include Caribou 
Biosciences, CRISPR Therapeutics, and Intellia Therapeutics. In addition, there
have been and may continue to be discoveries of new CRISPR-based gene editing 
technologies, such as the recently discovered nuclease Cpf1. Cpf1 is early in 
its scientific characterization; however, its researchers have asserted that it
might provide advantages over Cas9 in genome editing applications, including 
that Cpf1 requires only one guide RNA in contrast to the two guide RNAs required
with Cas9, which could simplify the design and delivery of genome-editing tools,
and that Cpf1 generates staggered DNA cuts in contrast to the blunt-end cuts 
generated by Cas9, which could be advantageous for facilitating NHEJ-based gene
insertion.

There are additional companies developing therapies using additional genome 
editing technologies, including TALENs, meganucleases, Mega-TALs, and zinc 
finger nucleases. Potential advantages of these additional genome editing
technologies include their degree of scientific characterization to date, which
may allow for more rapid development of subsequent programs; the range of sites
that each is able to recognize and the location of the DNA cut relative to the
recognition sequence, each of which may allow for a different range of targets
to be addressed; and the orientation of the DNA ends that are left behind after
cutting. The companies developing these additional genome editing technologies
include bluebird bio, Cellectis, Poseida Therapeutics, Precision Biosciences,
and Sangamo Biosciences. Additional companies developing gene therapy products
include Abeona Therapeutics, AGTC Therapeutics, Avalanche Biotechnologies,
Dimension Therapeutics, REGENXBIO, Spark Therapeutics, uniQure, and Voyager 
Therapeutics. In addition to competition from other genome editing therapies or
gene therapies, any products that we develop may also face competition from 
other types of therapies, such as small molecule, antibody, or protein 
therapies.

Caribou Biosciences, CRISPR Therapeutics, and Intellia Therapeutics have all 
reported that they have obtained licenses to a family of patent applications
that was filed by the University of California, the University of Vienna, and
Emmanuelle Charpentier and has an earliest priority date which pre-dates the
priority dates of our in-licensed patents and patent applications. CRISPR
Therapeutics has reported that it has an exclusive license to patent rights from
Emmanuelle Charpentier. Caribou Biosciences has reported that it has an
exclusive license to patent rights from the University of California and the
University of Vienna. Intellia Therapeutics has reported that it has an
exclusive license to such rights from Caribou Biosciences in certain fields. The
University of California derives rights in such applications from an assignment
by Dr. Jennifer Doudna and certain other inventors listed on such applications.
Dr. Doudna was a founder of our company and entered into a consulting agreement
with us at the time of our founding. However, Dr. Doudna gave notice of
termination of that agreement in May 2014 after less than seven months of
service, and she has had no further engagement in our business since that time.
Dr. Doudna is also a founder of Caribou Biosciences and has been publicly
identified as an advisor to Intellia Therapeutics.

In addition, many of our current or potential competitors, either alone or with
their collaboration partners, have significantly greater financial resources and
expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, 
conducting clinical trials, and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers
and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and gene therapy
industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller
number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be
significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with
large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in
recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and
establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials,
as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our
programs. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our
competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective,
have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less
expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain
FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may
obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a
strong market position before we are able to enter the market. The key
competitive factors affecting the success of all of our programs are likely to
be their efficacy, safety, convenience, and availability of reimbursement.

If our current programs are approved for the indications for which we are
currently planning clinical trials, they may compete with other products
currently under development, including genome editing and gene therapy products.
Competition with other related products currently under development may include
competition for clinical trial sites, patient recruitment, and product sales.


Company Description
We are a leading genome editing company dedicated to treating patients with 
genetically defined diseases by correcting their disease-causing genes. We
believe that we have entered a new era of genomic medicine as the growth of
genomic information in recent decades has significantly expanded


 the
understanding of genetically defined diseases. A new technology known as CRISPR
(clustered, regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas9 (CRISPR
associated protein 9) has the potential to achieve precise, directed changes in
DNA. The confluence of these two streams of scientific endeavor, understanding
genetic defects and having the tools to be able to address them, creates the
opportunity for us to achieve a longstanding goal of medicine: to treat the root
causes of diseases at the genetic level. While genetic defects are now
recognized as the causes of many diseases, the vast majority of these diseases
lack effective treatments. Of the estimated 6,000 diseases that are known to be
caused by genetic mutations, we believe fewer than 5% are served by approved
therapies. Our mission is to translate the promise of our science into a broad
class of transformative genomic medicines to benefit the greatest number of
patients.

We are developing a proprietary genome editing platform based on CRISPR/Cas9 
technology. CRISPR/Cas9 uses a protein-RNA complex composed of the Cas9 enzyme 
bound to a guide RNA molecule designed to recognize a particular DNA sequence. 
The RNA molecule guides the Cas9 complex to the location in the genome that 
requires repair. Once there, the complex makes a specific cut in the DNA,
ultimately triggering the cell's DNA repair machinery to address the genetic
defect. Our platform consists of four interrelated components: nuclease
engineering, delivery, control and specificity, and directed editing. These
components are designed to develop medicines that specifically address a wide
variety of genetic targets, reach the site of disease safely and effectively,
tightly and specifically control the editing process, and drive the right kind
of genetic repair. Our preclinical drug discovery platform uses the flexibility
of CRISPR/Cas9 technology to enable rapid reprogramming of the Cas9-guide RNA
complex with the potential to direct it to almost any site in the human genome.
Using this platform, we aim to develop and advance a broad range of therapies
for genetically defined diseases.

Our product development strategy is to target genetically defined diseases with
an initial focus on debilitating illnesses where there are no approved 
treatments and where the genetic basis of disease is well understood. We are 
advancing over a dozen discovery research programs that we have selected based 
on our proprietary assessment criteria. Our most advanced research program is 
designed to address Leber Congenital Amaurosis type 10, or LCA10, a specific
genetic form of progressive blindness with no available therapies or potential
treatments in clinical trials in either the United States or European Union. The
localization of LCA10 disease in the eye allows us to efficiently apply our
technology in a context that is confined and relatively uncomplicated compared
to many of the systemic illnesses we also anticipate treating over time. We have
tested combinations of Cas9 and guide RNA pairs in cells that were taken from
patients with a specific mutation that causes LCA10 and demonstrated restoration
of normal messenger RNA and protein expression, suggesting that we successfully
corrected the LCA10 gene defect in these cells. We aim to initiate a clinical
trial in this program in 2017. We believe achievement of proof-of-concept in a 
disease of the eye has the potential to validate our platform technology, 
including its potential application to other organs and diseases.

Our additional research programs address genetic, infectious, and oncologic 
diseases of the liver, lung, blood, eye, and muscle. For example, we believe our
genome editing technologies have the potential to improve the characteristics of
cellular therapies, including engineered T cells to treat cancer. To realize 
this potential, in May 2015, we entered into a collaboration with Juno 
Therapeutics, a leader in the emerging field of immuno-oncology. We believe that
our genome editing technology has the potential to improve T cell persistence 
and overcome signals in the tumor microenvironment that reduce T cell activity.
In an in vitro study under this collaboration, Cas9-guide RNA complexes directed
against what we believe is an important T cell target gene demonstrated 
approximately 90% editing on average. By working with Juno Therapeutics, we hope
that together we will be able to discover and develop the next generation of 
engineered T cell therapies that have the potential to substantially advance the
field of cancer immunotherapy. We believe this collaboration exemplifies our 
strategy of selectively establishing alliances with leaders in their fields to 
realize the full therapeutic potential of genome editing.

Our company was founded by world leaders in genome editing who have collectively
made many fundamental discoveries in the field and have enabled the translation
of CRISPR from its origins in bacterial systems to its application in mammalian
cells. Through their service as consultants and advisors, our founders were 
instrumental in defining the initial scientific vision for our company. Among 
our founders, Drs. Feng Zhang, George Church, David Liu, and J. Keith Joung 
continue to provide important scientific guidance and insights to us through 
ongoing consulting and advisory arrangements. Their discoveries, along with 
inventions by scientists at our company, have led to our broad portfolio of 
intellectual property, including the patent estates licensed from those 
founders' institutions. Our portfolio includes 21 issued U.S. and European
patents and over 200 pending patent applications. We believe the breadth and
depth of our patent estate is a substantial asset and has the potential to
provide us with a durable competitive position in the marketplace.

The lifeblood of our company is exceptional scientists and company-builders with
experience across leading biopharmaceutical companies and academic research 
laboratories. Our company is distinguished by our leaders' substantial 
experience in translating groundbreaking scientific platforms into therapeutic 
products and product candidates at many successful biopharmaceutical companies.
We believe that our team and our culture are critical to our success, and we are
building a company with the values and people needed to realize the potential of
our platform and develop medicines for patients with many different genetically
defined diseases.

Every decade over the past 40 years, an important class of medicines has 
emerged, such as recombinant proteins, monoclonal antibodies, and RNA-based
drugs. These new categories of medicines have brought forth important therapies
for previously untreated diseases. In our view, genome editing with CRISPR/Cas9
has the potential to be one of the next major new categories. At Editas
Medicine, we believe we can make that potential a reality.
