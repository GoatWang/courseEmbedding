Xuong Nguyen-Huu

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Xuong Nguyen-Huu (Vietnamese: Nguyễn Hữu Xương; born in 1933 in Vietnam) is a pioneer of protein crystallography technology. His research focuses on the development of novel methods, such as protein crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy, for the determination of protein structures and biological macromolecules.[1][2]

Career[edit]
Nguyen received his B.S.E.E. in electrical engineering; M.S.E.E. from Ecole Superieure d'Electricite, Paris, France (1957); M.S. in Mathematics from University of Paris, Paris (1958); M.S. and Ph.D. in Physics from the University of California, Berkeley (1962).[1][3]
He is a Professor Emeritus of Physics, Biology, Chemistry & Biochemistry at UC San Diego since 1964.[3][4] He is a pioneer of protein crystallography technology [1] and of the field of Direct Detection Device (DDD) that will be used in Electron Microscopy.[2] He is also inventor of "Xuong’s X-Ray Machine" (or Xuong Machine) in 1975, an X-ray Multiwire Area Detector, which using Multi-wire Proportional Chambers and then Silicon detectors to help researchers map three-dimensional structure of receptor and allowed for high-speed data collection,[5] and can be used to find drugs to kill deadly viruses such as HIV (the AIDS virus), Polio etc.).[6]
His awards include Guggenheim Fellowship (1965–1966), NATO Senior Fellowship (1977), Fogerty Fellowship (Unable to accept, 1984), Union of Pacific Asian Communities Award (1985), UCSD Chancellor Associate Award (1992 [7]) and Charles E. Supper Instrumentation Award from American Crystallographic Association (2004).[8] He is also founder of Area Detector Systems Corporation [9]
He served as the President of the Vietnamese Alliance Association, 1976–1992 and was also Co-Founder and Ex-Chairman of "Boat People SOS Committee" from 1980 to 1990, which worked with another non-profit organizations to obtain visas for Vietnamese refugees (Boat people) and they successfully sent out rescue ships on the South China Sea to pick up drifting boat people, saving more than 3,500.[10][11][12]

Hóa Đơn Đặc Thù GTGT


Ngày 24/10/2003 Tổng Cục Thuế ra công văn số 3855 TCT/QĐ/AC cho phép Công ty TNHH TM SX Nguyên Xương Thịnh được in các loại Hoá đơn đặc thù cho các đơn vị sản xuất, kinh doanh, dịch vụ theo mẫu được cơ quan thuế chấp nhận. 









   Hóa đơn đặc thù là gì? Doanh nghiệp sẽ được lợi ích gì khi sử dụng hóa đơn đặc thù?
Hóa đơn đặc thù là hóa đơn GTGT do doanh nghiệp tự in theo đặc thù sản xuất kinh doanh riêng của doanh nghiệp. Sử dụng hóa đơn đặc thù doanh nghiệp sẽ có nhiều thuận lợi:








Khắc phục tình trạng mua, bán hóa đơn giả góp phần lành mạnh hóa lĩnh vực tài chính của đất nước.
Quảng bá thương hiệu doanh nghiệp đến với khách hàng do ngoài các tiêu chí bắt buộc của bộ Tài Chính, doanh nghiệp có thể in thêm các thông tin như logo, địa chỉ, sản phẩm, hình ảnh….. lên hóa đơn. 
Nâng cao trách nhiệm quản lý hóa đơn của doanh nghiệp. 
Uy tín của doanh nghiệp sẽ được nâng cao vì khách hàng không sợ mua phải hàng nháy, hàng giả. 
Sử dụng hóa đơn tự in nhiều liên bằng giấy Carbonless doanh nghiệp sẽ tiết kiệm thời gian giúp công tác quản lý khoa học và hiệu quả. 
Doanh nghiệp chủ động in ấn hóa đơn và đăng ký số lượng sử dụng cần thiết.
