Fund Details
The United States Oil Fund® LP (USO) is an exchange-traded security designed to track the daily price movements of West Texas Intermediate ("WTI") light, sweet crude oil. USO issues shares that may be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca.
The investment objective of USO is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares' NAV to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the spot price of light, sweet crude oil delivered to Cushing, Oklahoma, as measured by the daily changes in price of USO's Benchmark Oil Futures Contract, less USO's expenses.
USO's Benchmark is the near month crude oil futures contract traded on the NYMEX. If the near month futures contract is within two weeks of expiration, the Benchmark will be the next month contract to expire. The crude oil contract is WTI light, sweet crude oil delivered to Cushing, Oklahoma.
USO invests primarily in listed crude oil futures contracts and other oil-related futures contracts, and may invest in forwards and swap contracts. These investments will be collateralized by cash, cash equivalents, and US government obligations with remaining maturities of two years or less. 
USO's Fund Benefits

USO offers commodity exposure without using a commodity futures account.
USO provides "equity-like" features including, intra-day pricing, and market, limit, and stop orders.
USO provides portfolio holdings, market price, NAV and TNA on its website each day.

The performance data quoted above represents past performance. PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS. Investment return and value of the Fund shares will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance may be lower or higher than performance data quoted. 
The Fund's NAV is calculated by dividing the value of the Fund's total assets less total liabilities by the number of shares outstanding. Share price returns are based on closing prices for the Fund and do not represent the returns an investor would receive if shares were traded at other times.
† USO commenced operations on 04/10/2006

The above frequency distribution chart presents information about the difference between the daily market price for shares of the Fund and the Fund's reported net asset value. The amount that the fund's market price is above the reported NAV is called the premium. The amount that the fund's market price is below the reported NAV is called the discount. The market price is determined using the midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest offer on the listing exchange, as of the time that the Fund's NAV is calculated (usually 4:00 pm Eastern time). The horizontal axis of the chart shows the premium or discount expressed in basis points. The vertical axis indicates the number of trading days in the period covered by the chart. Each bar in the chart shows the number of trading days in which the Fund traded within the premium/discount range indicated.
 
* A basis point is equal to 1/100th of 1% and is used to denote the change in a financial instrument.

Fund Details
 The United States Short Oil Fund® LP (DNO) is an exchange-traded security designed to inversely reflect the movements of West Texas Intermediate ("WTI") light, sweet crude oil. DNO issues shares that may be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca. 
 The investment objective of DNO is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares' NAV to inversely reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the spot price of WTI light, sweet crude oil delivered to Cushing, Oklahoma, as measured by the daily changes in price of DNO's Benchmark Oil Futures Contract, less DNO's expenses. 
 DNO's Benchmark is the near month futures contract traded on the NYMEX. If the near month futures contract is within two weeks of expiration, the Benchmark will be the next month contract to expire. The crude oil contract is WTI light, sweet crude oil delivered to Cushing, Oklahoma. 
The portfolio takes short positions in crude oil interests to the fullest extent possible without being leveraged or unable to satisfy its current or potential margin or collateral obligations. These investments will be collateralized by cash, cash equivalents, and US government obligations with remaining maturities of two years or less. 
DNO's Fund Benefits

DNO offers commodity exposure without using a commodity futures account.
DNO provides "equity-like" features including, intra-day pricing, and market, limit, and stop orders.
DNO provides portfolio holdings, market price, NAV and TNA on its website each day.

USCF may discontinue this arrangement at any time, which could negatively impact an investment in DNO. If this agreement were terminated, the Annual Fund operating Expenses could increase, which would negatively impact your total return from an investment in DNO.

The General Partner has agreed to waive fees and reimburse expenses of the Fund limiting Total Annual Operating Expenses to 0.75% of the Fund's average net assets.
The Fund's NAV is calculated by dividing the value of the Fund's total assets less total liabilities by the number of shares outstanding. Share price returns are based on closing prices for the Fund and do not represent the returns an investor would receive if shares were traded at other times.

The above frequency distribution chart presents information about the difference between the daily market price for shares of the Fund and the Fund's reported net asset value. The amount that the fund's market price is above the reported NAV is called the premium. The amount that the fund's market price is below the reported NAV is called the discount. The market price is determined using the midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest offer on the listing exchange, as of the time that the Fund's NAV is calculated (usually 4:00 pm Eastern time). The horizontal axis of the chart shows the premium or discount expressed in basis points. The vertical axis indicates the number of trading days in the period covered by the chart. Each bar in the chart shows the number of trading days in which the Fund traded within the premium/discount range indicated.
 
* A basis point is equal to 1/100th of 1% and is used to denote the change in a financial instrument.

Dow extends technical breakout, near-term target within view 
U.S. stocks are higher early Wednesday, rising after a strong batch of earnings reports, and ahead of the Federal Reserve’s policy statement due out this afternoon. In the process, the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite and Dow industrials have concurrently tagged all-time highs, thus far in characteristically unspectacular, but nonetheless still bullish, technical form.

S&P 500 reaches uncharted territory, the 2,500 technical target within view
Technically speaking, the U.S. benchmarks have extended — or are vying to extend — a powerful 2017 uptrend.  On a headline basis, the S&P 500 and Dow industrials have reached uncharted territory, and the Nasdaq Composite is rising from its second-best close on record, as a small- and mid-cap breakout attempt concurrently remains underway.

S&P 500 nails the 2,405 support amid volatile second-quarter conclusion
Technically speaking, the U.S. benchmarks are concluding the second quarter against a slightly bending, but still bullish, bigger-picture backdrop.  Consider that the S&P 500 has nailed the breakout point — S&P 2,405 — and rallied respectably, preserving its uptrend.  Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite has been more firmly pressured, edging under its 50-day moving average, currently 6,154, and the retest remains underway.

Dow industrials maintain gap support, Nasdaq presses post-FAANG peak
U.S. stocks are slightly higher early Thursday, rising after crude-oil prices nailed a technical target, and subsequently rallied, punctuating a nearly 19% one-month downdraft.  Against this backdrop, the Nasdaq Composite is pressing notable resistance — the post-FAANG peak of 6,243 — while the S&P 500 and Dow industrials continue to digest an early-week break to record territory.

Technically speaking, two of the big three U.S. benchmarks have extended the persistent 2017 bull trend.  On a headline basis, the S&P 500 and Dow industrials have once again tagged all-time highs — reaching uncharted territory — while the Nasdaq Composite has thus far absorbed the mid-June downdraft, largely without incident.

S&P 500 maintains support amid second FAANG-fueled downturn
U.S. stocks are lower early Thursday, pressured amid ongoing reaction to the Federal Reserve’s policy directive, combined with a second round of FAANG-fueled selling pressure.  Against this backdrop, the S&P 500 has thus far maintained near-term support, circa 2,416, while the Nasdaq Composite remains more firmly pressured, partly as a source of funds deployed to other sectors.

USO Fund Description
The United States Oil Fund holds near-month NYMEX futures contracts on WTI crude oil.
  
USO FactSet Analytics Insight
USO, among the largest and most liquid oil ETPs available, delivers its exposure to oil using near-month futures. USO's huge asset base waves away any hint of closure risk, and its massive liquidity makes trading a snap. USO gets exposure to oil using derivatives, like all oil ETPs. Derivative returns can vary greatly from spot oil prices, but spot oil is uninvestable. USO holds front-month futures contracts on WTI, rolling into the next contract every month, just like our segment benchmark. This method is particularly sensitive to short-term changes in spot prices, but can also result in heavy roll costs. That makes USO a great vehicle for riding short-term moves in crude prices, but long-term holders may want to look at other options.USO is structured as a commodities pool, so expect a K-1 at tax time. Long-term holders will be taxed on any gains even if they didn’t sell shares. Alternatively, investors could also consider OIL, which follows the same strategy in an ETN wrapper. In all, USO does a great job of capturing the performance of the near-term oil futures market at a low all-in cost, earning it our Analyst Pick designation.

Dow extends technical breakout, near-term target within view 
U.S. stocks are higher early Wednesday, rising after a strong batch of earnings reports, and ahead of the Federal Reserve’s policy statement due out this afternoon. In the process, the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite and Dow industrials have concurrently tagged all-time highs, thus far in characteristically unspectacular, but nonetheless still bullish, technical form.

S&P 500 reaches uncharted territory, the 2,500 technical target within view
Technically speaking, the U.S. benchmarks have extended — or are vying to extend — a powerful 2017 uptrend.  On a headline basis, the S&P 500 and Dow industrials have reached uncharted territory, and the Nasdaq Composite is rising from its second-best close on record, as a small- and mid-cap breakout attempt concurrently remains underway.

S&P 500 nails the 2,405 support amid volatile second-quarter conclusion
Technically speaking, the U.S. benchmarks are concluding the second quarter against a slightly bending, but still bullish, bigger-picture backdrop.  Consider that the S&P 500 has nailed the breakout point — S&P 2,405 — and rallied respectably, preserving its uptrend.  Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite has been more firmly pressured, edging under its 50-day moving average, currently 6,154, and the retest remains underway.

Dow industrials maintain gap support, Nasdaq presses post-FAANG peak
U.S. stocks are slightly higher early Thursday, rising after crude-oil prices nailed a technical target, and subsequently rallied, punctuating a nearly 19% one-month downdraft.  Against this backdrop, the Nasdaq Composite is pressing notable resistance — the post-FAANG peak of 6,243 — while the S&P 500 and Dow industrials continue to digest an early-week break to record territory.

Charting the latest S&P 500 breakout amid bullish sector rotation
Technically speaking, two of the big three U.S. benchmarks have extended the persistent 2017 bull trend.  On a headline basis, the S&P 500 and Dow industrials have once again tagged all-time highs — reaching uncharted territory — while the Nasdaq Composite has thus far absorbed the mid-June downdraft, largely without incident.

S&P 500 maintains support amid second FAANG-fueled downturn
U.S. stocks are lower early Thursday, pressured amid ongoing reaction to the Federal Reserve’s policy directive, combined with a second round of FAANG-fueled selling pressure.  Against this backdrop, the S&P 500 has thus far maintained near-term support, circa 2,416, while the Nasdaq Composite remains more firmly pressured, partly as a source of funds deployed to other sectors.

Charting a garden-variety pullback, Dow industrials nail the breakout point (again)
True to 2017 form, the major U.S. benchmarks have flatlined following an initially powerful technical June breakout.  In the process, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has closely observed first support, across consecutive sessions, while the S&P 500 continues to hold relatively tightly to record highs.

United States Oil Fund LP (ETF)(NYSE:USO): Bounce Appears Short-Lived | ETF Daily News

































 





























































Examining Oil’s Dead Cat Bounce (USO)


 July 7, 2017 11:03am  NYSE:USO  



 




Crude Oil and linked ETFs have been very active this week not to mention volatile.




Lately we have seen August 8.50 put activity in the largest Crude Oil tracker USO (U.S. Oil Fund, Expense Ratio 0.77%), as the ETF closed yesterday at the $9.31 level but is being punished in today’s session, down close to 3%.
Just eleven trading sessions ago however the fund traded at a new 52-week low at the $8.65 level, so it is apparent that hedgers are entering the picture here given the recent dead cat bounce in Crude Oil. Year-to-date, USO has seen decent inflows to the tune of about $465 million in (with a total of over $3 billion in AUM currently), and it continues to hold the number one spot in the “Crude Oil” category in terms of its asset supremacy, which has been the case for years on end here since the fund’s inception in 2006, even taking into account well-documented issues that the fund has with contango.
The second largest fund in the category is the levered Bull product UCO (ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Crude Oil, Expense Ratio 0.95%, $883 million in AUM), which has also seen substantial asset inflows year-to-date (over $325 million in), presumably from portfolio managers whom have been positioning for a bounce in Crude prices.
As we have mentioned before in this piece and is currently the situation as well, the top end of “Crude Oil” linked ETPs in the spectrum all have a long bias, starting with USO and going throughout the top five funds in the space where DBO (PowerShares DB Oil, Expense Ratio 0.75%, $393 million in AUM) is the fifth ranked fund in terms of AUM.
The first “Inverse” or “Bear” ETP shows up at number six in this space in terms of asset size, the $127 million SCO (ProShares Ultra Short Bloomberg Crude Oil, Expense Ratio 0.95%) which has seen notable net outflows (-$145 million out) year-to-date. However, in the midst of the recent downside put buying in USO, given what some may see as a “dead cat bounce” type rally, it pays to make note of not only SCO but other Bear and Levered Bear ETPs in the space as they may very well see an uptick in interest in the near term.
These funds are DWT (VelocityShares 3X Inverse Crude Oil ETN, Expense Ratio 1.35%, $35 million in AUM), WTID (UBS ETRACS-ProShares Daily 3X Inverse Crude ETN, Expense Ratio 1.85%, $39.4 million in AUM), and the much smaller OILD (ProShares UltraPro 3X Short Crude Oil ETF, Expense Ratio 0.49%, $5.6 million in AUM), and SZO (PowerShares DB Crude Oil Short ETN, Expense Ratio 0.75%, $2.5 million in AUM).

The United States Oil Fund LP ETF (NYSE:USO) was trading at $9.04 per share on Friday morning, down $0.27 (-2.90%). Year-to-date, USO has declined -22.87%, versus a 8.00% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.
USO currently has an ETF Daily News SMART Grade of C (Neutral), and is ranked #52 of 130 ETFs in the Commodity ETFs category.

DNO Fund Description
The United States Short Oil provides -1x the daily return of futures contracts for light sweet crude oil delivered to Cushing, Oklahoma.
  
DNO FactSet Analytics Insight
DNO is a front-month-based inverse product tracking the front-month futures contract on light sweet crude oil. As an inverse ETF, it’s not intended as a long-term investment, but to be held only for its one-day exposure period. DNO’s strategy lies in shorting futures contracts, so returns will reflect price appreciation as well any return from “rolling” those futures contracts. Despite a relatively long track record, the fund has failed to attract significant interest. Still, check the latest spreads, volume and AUM data on this page. Traders may find much better liquidity at times in -2x SCO and -3x funds and DWTI.

Energy


Natural Gas, Light Sweet Crude Oil
VelocityShares® energy exchange traded product suite includes leveraged long and inverse positions in futures on natural gas, and light sweet crude oil as measured by the S&P GSCI indices. While institutional investors have available a variety of instruments (such as futures, swaps, and forwards) to express views on energy, this suite of exchange traded products provides a convenient alternative with unique capabilities.
These products provide institutional investors an exchange traded instrument for managing daily trading risk.  The long products are designed to change in value by a daily-resetting 3x multiple of any increase or decrease in the underlying index, while the inverse products are designed to change in value by a daily-resetting 3x multiple of the inverse of any increase or decrease in the underlying index. For example, an investor interested in being “short UNG” could express this view with the inverse natural gas ETN DGAZ.

ETN Risks
Important information about the VelocityShares ETNs is contained within the current prospectuses. For more complete information regarding the VelocityShares ETNs, download a prospectus from this site, call 1-877-5-VELOCITY or 1-203-992-4301, or write to Prospectus Inquiry, VelocityShares, 17 Old Kings Highway S, Darien, CT, 06820 to request a prospectus. You should read the prospectus carefully before making an investment decision.
Not all risks described below will apply to all products.  Please refer to the applicable prospectus supplement for a detailed discussion of risks applicable to a particular ETN.
An investment in the ETNs involves significant risks. Please read the more detailed explanation of risks relating to an investment in the ETNs in “Risk Factors” in the applicable pricing supplement.
The ETNs are intended to be daily trading tools for sophisticated investors to manage daily trading risks.  They are designed to achieve their stated investment objectives on a daily basis, but their performance over different periods of time can differ significantly from their stated daily objectives.  The ETNs are riskier than securities that have intermediate- or long-term investment objectives, and may not be suitable for investors who plan to hold them for a period other than one day.  Any decision to hold the ETNs for more than one day should be made with great care and only as the result of a series of daily (or more frequent) investment decisions to remain invested in the ETNs for the next one-day period.  Accordingly, the ETNs should be purchased only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of an investment linked to the underlying index and of seeking daily compounding leveraged long or leveraged inverse investment results, as applicable.  Investors should actively and frequently monitor their investments in the ETNs, even intra-day.  If an investor holds the ETNs for more than one day, it is possible that the investor will suffer significant losses in the ETNs even if the performance of the underlying index over the time the investor holds them is positive, in the case of the leveraged long ETNs, or negative, in the case of the leveraged inverse ETNs.
Because the ETNs are linked to the daily performance of the applicable underlying index and include either leveraged long or leveraged inverse exposure, adverse changes in the market price of the futures included in the underlying index will have a magnified adverse effect on the ETNs and a greater likelihood of causing such ETNs to be worth zero than if such ETNs were not linked to the leveraged inverse or leveraged long return of the applicable underlying Index.
The ETNs do not guarantee any return of principal at maturity, acceleration or redemption and do not pay any interest during their term.
Although the issuer intends to list or has listed the ETNs on NYSE Arca or NASDAQ, a trading market for your ETNs may not develop.  The issuer is not required to maintain any listing of the ETNs on NYSE Arca or any other exchange.  The issuer of the ETNs may delist the ETNs from any exchange for any reason at any time.
The issuer is not obligated to issue any particular amount of the ETNs and may suspend further issuances at any time.  If the issuer suspends further issuances of the ETNs, it is possible that the ETNs could begin to trade at a premium to the indicative value.  Any premium that develops may be reduced or eliminated at any time, including as a result of an announcement that the issuer will restart issuances or an announcement that the issuer will exercise its right to accelerate the ETNs for an amount based on the indicative value.  Paying a premium purchase price over the indicative value of the ETNs could lead to significant losses in the event the investor sells the ETNs at a time when such premium is no longer present in the marketplace or the ETNs are accelerated at the issuer’s option.
The trading price of the ETNs may vary considerably before any valuation date (as defined in each prospectus), due, among other factors, to fluctuations in the price or the volatility of the underlying index, and other events that are difficult to predict. At higher levels of volatility, and since the ETNs are not principal protected, there is a significant chance of a complete loss of ETN value even if the performance of the underlying index is flat.
The daily resetting of each ETN’s leveraged exposure to the underlying index is likely to cause each ETN to experience a “decay” effect, which is likely to worsen over time and will be greater the more volatile the underlying index.  The “decay” effect refers to a likely tendency of the ETNs to lose value over time independent of the performance of the underlying index.  Accordingly, the ETNs are not suitable for intermediate- or long-term investment, as any intermediate- or long-term investment is very likely to sustain significant losses, even if the underlying index appreciates (in the case of the leveraged long ETNs) or depreciates (in the case of the leveraged inverse ETNs) over the relevant time period.  Although the decay effect is more likely to manifest itself the longer the ETNs are held, the decay effect can have a significant impact on ETN performance even over a period as short as two days.
If the level of the underlying index decreases or does not increase sufficiently (or if it increases or does not decrease sufficiently in the case of inverse ETNs), to offset the effect of the Daily Investor Fee and any other applicable fees over the term of the ETNs, the investor will receive less than the amount invested upon sale, early redemption, acceleration or maturity of the ETNs.
Prior to maturity, you may, subject to certain restrictions described in the pricing supplement, offer the applicable minimum number of your ETNs to the issuer for redemption on an Early Redemption Date (as defined in the prospectus). You must offer for redemption at least the applicable minimum number of ETNs (typically 25’000 or 50’000 depending on the product) as set forth in the pricing supplement, or an integral multiple of such amount in excess thereof, at one time in order to exercise your right to cause the issuer to redeem your ETNs on any Early Redemption Date. In addition, the issuer may charge investors a redemption charge of a percentage of the Closing Indicative Value of any ETN that is redeemed at the investor’s option, at a rate as indicated in the applicable pricing supplement.  Please see the applicable pricing supplement for fees or charges relating to the ETNs.
Any payment on the ETNs is subject to the ability of the issuer to satisfy its obligations as they become due.
The risks listed above are not exhaustive. Investors should review the prospectus for each ETN, including all risk factors set forth therein, and consult their independent tax, accounting, legal and financial advisors before investing in any ETN.
