Meet Lou Simpson, Former Investment Star at Berkshire and New GuruFocus Guru

Many people connect
  Warren Buffett

  with his right-hand man, Charlie Munger. Fewer know, however,
  that up until a few years ago, a third mastermind made investing
  decisions at Berkshire Hathaway (
  BRK.A

  )(
  BRK.B

  ),
  Lou Simpson

  . Now that Simpson has founded his own firm, SQ Advisors LLC,
  GuruFocus today began to track the investor as its latest Guru.
  

Who Is
  Lou Simpson

  ?



  Buffett met Simpson in 1996 when he was CEO of Geico's capital
  operations and Buffett was completing his purchase of Geico.
  Impressed with his track record, Buffett kept Simpson on as chief
  investment officer.
  


  At his retirement from Berkshire subsidiary Geico in 2010,
  Simpson managed more than $4 billion worth of stocks. Throughout
  his time with Berkshire, Simpson and Buffett's stock picks
  overlapped sometimes due to similarities in their thinking, but
  both men clearly had independent processes and disagreed with
  each other sometimes as well.
  


  Several things the two men had in common were that they were both
  dedicated value investors, both maintained a concentrated
  portfolio, and both had big positions in three stocks: Wells
  Fargo (
  WFC

  ), Johnson 7 Johnson (
  JNJ

  ) and ConocoPhillips (
  COP

  ). Read a more detailed comparison of their investing approaches
  in Geoff Gannon's article, "
  How Does Lou Simpson's Stock Portfolio Compare to
  Warren Buffett's Stock Portfolio

  ?"
  


  Before joining GEICO in 1979 as senior vice president and chief
  investment officer, Simpson was president and CEO of Western
  Asset Management, a partner at Stein Roe and Farnham, and an
  economics instructor at Princeton University.
  

Portrait of a Disciplined Investor



  Buffett frequently sang the praises of Lou Simpson. Once, in his
  2004 investor letter, Buffett called him "a cinch to be inducted
  into the investment Hall of Fame" based on his return performance
  history. From 1980 to 2004, Simpson produced an average annual
  gain of 20.3%, compared to 13.5% for the S&P 500. In that
  time, he had only three negative years, and only four years of
  less than double-digit returns.
  


  Later, in 2006, Buffett intimated that Simpson, "a top-notch
  investor with an outstanding long-term record," would be the
  natural replacement for him as CEO of Berkshire, were Simpson not
  a mere six years younger than him.
  


  In a rare interview, Simpson in 2010 told the Chicago Tribune
  upon his retirement: "My approach is eclectic. I try to read all
  company documents carefully. We try to talk to competitors. We
  try to find people more knowledgeable about the business than we
  are. We do not rely on Wall Street-generated research. We do our
  own research. We try to meet with top management."
  

SQ Advisors LLC



  Quickly dissatisfied with retirement, Simpson opened his own
  investment-advisory firm, SQ Advisors LLC, in Naples, Fla., on
  Dec. 20, 2010, with his wife. He began the firm with $150 million
  to $200 million in assets under management, primarily the money
  of his family and friends and charities, he told Bloomberg. At
  Sept. 30, his total portfolio value totals $1.17 billion.
  


  Simpson currently has 15 stocks, with largest holdings of his
  former employer Berkshire Hathaway (
  BRK.B

  ), as well as Fiserv (
  FISV

  ), TE Connectivity Ltd. (
  TEL

  ), Lowe's Companies (
  LOW

  ) and Buffett favorite Wells Fargo (
  WFC

  ). In his Berkshire Hathaway days, Wells Fargo was both he and
  Buffett's second largest holding.
  


  In the third quarter, Simpson added to most of his holdings and
  reduced less than 1% of only Lowe's Companies Inc. and Dell Inc.
  (
  DELL

  ). He sold out of only one position as well, Oaktree Capital
  Group LLC (
  OAK

  ). Almost a third of the portfolio is weighted in the financial
  services sector, followed by consumer cyclical and technology
  stocks.

Mergers & Acquisitions
We provide clear, relevant and timely advice that is uniquely built on deep domain knowledge, keen strategic understanding and critical judgment that can only come from extensive experience.

Strategic positioning evaluation
Buy-side and sell-side M&A

Capital Raising



Capital Raising
With the deep domain knowledge and transaction expertise we have built in our coverage sectors, Union Square Advisors provides sound advisory services to corporate clients looking to raise private capital. For later-stage private companies seeking growth capital and/or partial liquidity for founders and early investors while remaining private, we work to optimally position our clients and match them with the investors best suited to help them further build their businesses. Our network of available financing sources includes a broad range of both domestic and international investors that focus on providing capital to technology companies – traditional venture capitalists, growth equity firms, private equity/buyout firms, mutual funds and hedge funds, as well as strategic investors looking to build closer partnerships with leading tech companies.

Board Advisory
As transactions in the technology sector have become increasingly complex and more likely to provoke tremendous investor scrutiny, companies considering their strategic alternatives must adhere to the highest fiduciary standards by following thorough, well-documented processes. Union Square Advisors is well suited to help Boards of Directors and Special Committees to navigate these challenging waters on issues relating to investor engagement, activist and hostile defense, shareholder value, corporate performance and financial fairness. We analyze the value and structure of the potential transaction, form and timing of consideration, expectations of investors and other observers, historical and projected performance of the companies involved, current trading multiples of relevant comparable companies, metrics from similar transactions, and other financial and operational data, all to ensure that our clients make critical strategic decisions that are in the best interests of their shareholders.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year
