Andrew Lloyd Webber and Don Black’s classic Tell Me on a Sunday is a one-woman show that charts the course of a young English girl newly arrived in New York.
Brimming with optimism, she sets out to seek success, companionship and, of course, love. But as she weaves her way through the maze of the city and her own anxieties, frustrations and heartaches she begins to wonder whether – in fact – she’s been looking for love in all the wrong places.
Tell Me on a Sunday was expanded from its original Marti Webb TV special to become a whole evening’s entertainment and also featured five brand new songs written especially for the production.
Following the extended West End season, starring Denise Van Outen, the new production toured the UK, starring Marti Webb, Patsy Palmer or Faye Tozer, depending on the venue.

By Jeeves, a musical based on the beloved stories of Bertie Wooster and his butler Jeeves by P.G Wodehouse, is a totally rewritten version of a 1975 production.
Featuring farcical site gags, nimble word-play, ingenious staging and 13 delightful songs composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber with lyrics by Alan Ayckbourn, it is as refreshing and English as a cup of tea…
When Bertie Wooster’s banjo mysteriously disappears just as he is about to give a concert in a church hall, his quick-witted and unflappable manservant Jeeves suggests that he entertain his audience by relating the hapless romantic misadventures of his circle of high-society London cronies. With members of the audience playing the roles of Bertie’s friends onstage and Jeeves serving as writer, composer, director and props master, an impromptu theatrical extravaganza unfolds.
The show opened in Scarborough, UK in 1996, transferring to the Duke of Yorks Theatre and the Lyric Theatre in London. The North American premier of By Jeeves was at the Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam in December 1996. A revised Goodspeed production played on Broadway at the Helen Hayes Theatre in 2001. By Jeeves has also been filmed for video release.
