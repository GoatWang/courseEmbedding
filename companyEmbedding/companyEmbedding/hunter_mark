Perfecting The Rimfire - Again



 Simple, one-button takedown for quick and easy field-stripping and proper chamber to muzzle cleaning.


 A recessed button in the back of the frame allows the upper receiver to tilt up and off of the grip frame without the use of tools.


 Ergonomic bolt stop.


 Internal cylindrical bolt construction ensures permanent sight to barrel alignment and higher accuracy potential than conventional moving slide designs.




 Contoured ejection port and easy-to-grasp bolt ears allow for durable and reliable operation round after round.


 Accurate sighting system features adjustable rear sight and drilled and tapped receiver for Weaver- or Picatinny-style rail for easy mounting of optics.


 Ambidextrous manual safety positively locks the sear in the  "SAFE" position when applied. Safety can be converted to left-side only with included washer.


 Features a conveniently located push-button magazine release on the left side of the frame.




Magazine drops free on release for faster reloading.

Description



The IR Hunter Mark III is the latest enhancement to the IR Hunter product family; the new MKIII continues the success of the MKII models. This new scope incorporates all the existing features of the existing MKII scope and adds a new state-of-the-art stadiametric rangefinder, five reticle patterns, and the ability to save multiple recital set points. With the new 60mm lens, the image quality is much sharper than the previous MKII. Additionally, users will be able to more accurately adjust their reticle position with digital position indicators.
The MKIII-60mm provides 4.5x to 36x magnification. This, combined with the BAE 640×480, 12 micron LWIR thermal core, delivers the best 24/7 image available. Day or night, this scope will help you see the unseen. One of the benefits of the 12 micron technology is that it provides 50% more magnification versus a 17 micron core with the same magnified optic. This feature enables your scope to see farther in a smaller and more compact size. Our 60mm scope provides the same magnification as a 90mm competing scope. Compared to other 17 micro scopes, our new 12 micron MKIII will find targets that other scopes just don’t see. Deep grass or dense tree lines disappear, and the thermal image seen by the MKIII are pronounced and clear. Compare our performance side by side, and your jaw will drop. As one customer put it, “I can’t believe what I haven’t been seeing; if I had not compared my old scope side by side, I would have never known what I was missing!”
The MKIII is feature packed and includes a dual lever LaRue weapon mount, a battery extender, a video/download cable with software, and a flip cap to make recalibration a breeze.

Industry Reviews
White's Electronics is looking forward to working with Michael, Daniel and the MetalDetector.com team. Their experience in the metal detecting industry is unmatched.
I have enjoyed working with Michael, Daniel and their team at Detector Electroics Corp. They have done a fine job representing the Detector Pro line since it was first introduced in 1996. One of the things I see them do is go the extra mile for their customers. It is always nice to see a family run business endure and we wish them many years of continued success.
We appreciate the partnership from Michael and Daniel at MetalDetector.com. As a family owned business, we choose our partners carefully. We have found that their team has done a fine job of representing our line. With thirty years of success under their belt, we expect that they will be a partner for many years to come.
We at Treasure Products, manufacturer of the Vibra-Probe and Vibra-Tector, want to congratulate Daniel and Michael on the admirable milestone of being in business for over three decades. The dedication and product knowledge that your staff exhibits has been a great benefit to us. We offer our best wishes for your continued success.
I have found that the team at MetalDetector.com has done a fine of job representing the entire JW Fishers line. They have partnered with us in helping to bring our products to both individuals, larger corporate and governmental organizations. Michael and Daniel have established a knowledgeable team that has done the job of getting the correct product in to the hands of each consumer. I wish them continued success as they represent our products in the years to come.
I have been impressed by the professional approach and the experience of Daniel, Michael and the entire team at Detector Electronics Corp. Three decades of superior customer care has been the key to their success and large sales volume.
We have enjoyed working with Michael, Daniel and their esteemed team at Detector Electronics Corp. We feel that they have been the best choice for representing the good reputation of the Makro Detectors in the region. They have been working towards 100% customer satisfaction ever since they started their cooperation with us as our exclusive Distributor in the USA and Canada. We are pleased to see both their business and the sales in their region continue to grow. It is nice to see both our family business and theirs growing together. We see our companies moving forward together for many years to come.
Garrett has a longstanding quality relationship with Detector Electronics Corp since the 1980s. I have seen them grow from a regional dealer to one of the largest internet dealers yet they have maintained that special care for the customer for over three decades. Their team of knowledgeable, helpful and friendly staff and family make their dealership a first choice for the treasure hunter.
MetalDetector.com has been a valuable business partner to Fisher Research Labs for many years. They continue to grow while still offering the best in customer service and after sale support, which is very important to FRL. We wish to congratulate them on 3 decades of business and stellar service to our mutual customers.  Having known Michael and Daniel along with their parents for 2 of the 3 decades they have been in business, I have seen their company grow year in and year out without sacrificing what’s important to all of us …customer service before, during and after the sale.  Their entire staffs knowledge of our product helps to ensure the customer gets the right detector for their needs regardless of what they might be.  We look forward to our future relationship and continued success of MetalDetector.com and their entire staff.
I recently had the pleasure of meeting with the team at MetalDetector.com at their newly expanded facility in Southborough, MA. I have to say that I was impressed with their operation and knowledge of the Teknetics product line. When the Teknetics product line was recently re-launched, MetalDetector.com was one of the first partners we contacted. They have had a long standing relationship with the brand as one of the original Teknetics dealers in the country. We value long standing relationships and are excited to have them as a member of our team.
It's been an honor and privilege working with the fine folks at Detector Electronics for over 25 years.  Having a family owned and run business ourselves, we know the "attention to detail" it takes to keep a business running smoothly with an emphasis on customer service.  It's no surprise that Sondra and David's fine sons, Michael and Daniel have continued in their parents tradition of being exemplary businesspeople who take the time and care enough to really know their clientele.  It's always been a pleasure working with you!
DRS Electronics, GmbH is proud to have Detector Electronics Corp. represent our products. I have known Michael and Daniel for over a decade. Their team is genuine and knowledgeable. They provide exceptional support and service to our customers. They are a recognized leader in the industry. Internationally their business is known for excellent customer support. Their presence is a great confidence for treasure hunters.

Customer Reviews

Dear Sondra, ...in addition to being the first metal detector company I found (after contacting several) which actually seemed to care about my order and which treated me like a valued customer, you also really worked hard from your end to make sure the purchase went through and the detector arrived at its destination on time. By the end I felt I was dealing with a friend rather than a faceless company on the net. Well done!
And, by the way, my 7 year old son Juanito found a nickel yesterday when he took his detector out for the first time! If things keep going this way the detector will have paid for itself within a few short decades! But seriously, he is really enjoying it and hoping to find his long-dreamed-of buried treasure some day.


Hello Folks,
Ordered 2 Garrett ACE 250's on 09-14-09 at noon… Received 09-15-09 at noon… You folks should be proud that you hold true to all you say, do and promise. It's very refreshing to work with a company that keeps the “old-world” values going, not too many people / companies out there that can even come close to what you provide.
Happy to do business with you,


Hello Dan,
Remember me?  I bought my Tesoro Tiger Shark from you...  It came just when you said it would, and works just as you told me it would.
Thanks for your help in sorting through the maze of detectors.


Dear Sondra,
1160 GRAM Meteorite! found 3 " underground. Don't ask where. One of many! As far as being excited I all most had a stroke. Here's a photo of one Meteorite I found on the surface, over 800 grams and a 447 gram one! The one in the middle is my first. The bar magnet has some small Iron meteorites on it.


Dear Detector Electronics,
I received the Tesoro Sand Shark today...and want to thank you. Tried it, love it, looking forward to many enjoyable hours with it. Knowing that it
is a "rare" domestically made item gives me double pleasure! Also...doing business with pro's (such as yourselves) was also a pleasure I will tell
others about! Forwarded a "glowing review" to you. Thanks again.


Dear Customer Service,
Just wanted to thank all involved in a recent shipment to me that was a gift for my grandkids. I ordered 2 detectors but for some reason only one was shipped. After calling your company you bent over backwards to get the second detector to me on time for giving to my grandchildren. I explained that we exchange gifts a week early so my children and their families can be in their homes Christmas morning since some travel distances are involved. The second detector arrived last Friday in time for our celebration last Saturday. --THANKYOU. I order quite a few things online and have experienced some terrible companies but you are the best.
Best regards and have a wonderful Holiday Season


Hi Guys,
I have just come in after spending an hour or at my local beach with my son, which is only a 5 minute walk from my home called Deception Bay. This is the first time i have ever used detector. The very first thing it detected in less than a minute was a two dollar coin, boy we were so excited!  Not by the amount, but by the fact that on its maiden voyage it detected a coin. We then detected a ten cent piece. We can't wait to take it to a popular beach and I will practice more with the settings.
I would like to thank you for your prompt service. My detector arrived at my door In Brisbane Australia in less than a week. This is the first time I have used any service like this outside of Australia, but with this kind of service and ease of buying and your range of goods this will be the first of many transactions.


I just wanted to say thank you to Scott who made my recent purchase so pleasent! I am enjoying my Tesoro's and have found lots of cool stuff so far. Just waiting for that first gold find! Thanks agian for all the help that was provided in making my decision!


Hi Scott,
I was amazed at how fast I received my BOUNTY HUNTER. The order arrived in perfect condition, and in only three days after I placed the on line order. The four part series about selecting the right product was also appreciated and helped me to make the right decision for my purchase. You are truly a company that takes care of business and most importantly your customers. It is a pleasure doing business with you and I will gladly recommend you to anyone that wants to buy a metal detector. Thanks for the GREAT SERVICE.


Dear Customer Service,
I am a very happy camper. Yesterday I took my Garrett Ace 250 out for the first time to some local parks. My total find was about 150 coins. The detector works so well and so easily. It only took me about a half an hour before I new what every button did. I am also very salified with the support I got from Dan & Sondra.
PS     I plan on buying my next detector from you.


Dear Sondra,
I purchased an Ace 250 from your site for my 7 year old son and now I am hooked! This is our first metal detector and the Ace does every thing it says it will. Thanks for the fast delivery and introducing my son and I to a great new hobby.

Sondra,
I got the detector-my husband was thrilled.... Thank you so much. You and Daniel have been so helpful.  I am a first time buyer and am feeling very lucky to have found your website. Daniel helped me to locate a really great detector and you have been extremely courteous and prompt in seeing my order through. I look forward using my new metal detector. Hope you have a wonderful holiday season....overall my experience ordering off of your website was convenient and customer service was great.  Thanks again.

Industry Reviews
White's Electronics is looking forward to working with Michael, Daniel and the MetalDetector.com team. Their experience in the metal detecting industry is unmatched.
I have enjoyed working with Michael, Daniel and their team at Detector Electroics Corp. They have done a fine job representing the Detector Pro line since it was first introduced in 1996. One of the things I see them do is go the extra mile for their customers. It is always nice to see a family run business endure and we wish them many years of continued success.
We appreciate the partnership from Michael and Daniel at MetalDetector.com. As a family owned business, we choose our partners carefully. We have found that their team has done a fine job of representing our line. With thirty years of success under their belt, we expect that they will be a partner for many years to come.
We at Treasure Products, manufacturer of the Vibra-Probe and Vibra-Tector, want to congratulate Daniel and Michael on the admirable milestone of being in business for over three decades. The dedication and product knowledge that your staff exhibits has been a great benefit to us. We offer our best wishes for your continued success.
I have found that the team at MetalDetector.com has done a fine of job representing the entire JW Fishers line. They have partnered with us in helping to bring our products to both individuals, larger corporate and governmental organizations. Michael and Daniel have established a knowledgeable team that has done the job of getting the correct product in to the hands of each consumer. I wish them continued success as they represent our products in the years to come.
I have been impressed by the professional approach and the experience of Daniel, Michael and the entire team at Detector Electronics Corp. Three decades of superior customer care has been the key to their success and large sales volume.
We have enjoyed working with Michael, Daniel and their esteemed team at Detector Electronics Corp. We feel that they have been the best choice for representing the good reputation of the Makro Detectors in the region. They have been working towards 100% customer satisfaction ever since they started their cooperation with us as our exclusive Distributor in the USA and Canada. We are pleased to see both their business and the sales in their region continue to grow. It is nice to see both our family business and theirs growing together. We see our companies moving forward together for many years to come.
Garrett has a longstanding quality relationship with Detector Electronics Corp since the 1980s. I have seen them grow from a regional dealer to one of the largest internet dealers yet they have maintained that special care for the customer for over three decades. Their team of knowledgeable, helpful and friendly staff and family make their dealership a first choice for the treasure hunter.
MetalDetector.com has been a valuable business partner to Fisher Research Labs for many years. They continue to grow while still offering the best in customer service and after sale support, which is very important to FRL. We wish to congratulate them on 3 decades of business and stellar service to our mutual customers.  Having known Michael and Daniel along with their parents for 2 of the 3 decades they have been in business, I have seen their company grow year in and year out without sacrificing what’s important to all of us …customer service before, during and after the sale.  Their entire staffs knowledge of our product helps to ensure the customer gets the right detector for their needs regardless of what they might be.  We look forward to our future relationship and continued success of MetalDetector.com and their entire staff.
I recently had the pleasure of meeting with the team at MetalDetector.com at their newly expanded facility in Southborough, MA. I have to say that I was impressed with their operation and knowledge of the Teknetics product line. When the Teknetics product line was recently re-launched, MetalDetector.com was one of the first partners we contacted. They have had a long standing relationship with the brand as one of the original Teknetics dealers in the country. We value long standing relationships and are excited to have them as a member of our team.
It's been an honor and privilege working with the fine folks at Detector Electronics for over 25 years.  Having a family owned and run business ourselves, we know the "attention to detail" it takes to keep a business running smoothly with an emphasis on customer service.  It's no surprise that Sondra and David's fine sons, Michael and Daniel have continued in their parents tradition of being exemplary businesspeople who take the time and care enough to really know their clientele.  It's always been a pleasure working with you!
DRS Electronics, GmbH is proud to have Detector Electronics Corp. represent our products. I have known Michael and Daniel for over a decade. Their team is genuine and knowledgeable. They provide exceptional support and service to our customers. They are a recognized leader in the industry. Internationally their business is known for excellent customer support. Their presence is a great confidence for treasure hunters.

Customer Reviews

Dear Sondra, ...in addition to being the first metal detector company I found (after contacting several) which actually seemed to care about my order and which treated me like a valued customer, you also really worked hard from your end to make sure the purchase went through and the detector arrived at its destination on time. By the end I felt I was dealing with a friend rather than a faceless company on the net. Well done!
And, by the way, my 7 year old son Juanito found a nickel yesterday when he took his detector out for the first time! If things keep going this way the detector will have paid for itself within a few short decades! But seriously, he is really enjoying it and hoping to find his long-dreamed-of buried treasure some day.

                                So far I have found trash at 18 inches (cans), nails 1-2 inches long at 12-18 inches in beach sand and a machete buried in the sand at the beach. So far it is a breeze to operate, still looking for the good stuff.                (Posted on 1/19/2016)


Best priced water detector available Review by Randy K

                                I have used this machine for three years and am beyond impressed. I paid for it within 6 months by finding under contract a $20-25k diamond ring. Since that time I have found numerous rings and other types of jewelry, all under contract. On my own time I have dug items as deep as 2 and a half feet deep. All on low mineralized and practically trash less beaches. That is the key, .... if you want depth and hunt in less mineralized, trashy conditions, buy the Sea Hunter.

                                I have owned one of these units for quite some time and have used it mostly in salt water on many Caribbean beaches. I must remark that this unit is one of the best detectors available today. It can discover an earring as deep as 21 inches of wet salty sand. I have used it in many scuba dives and it still is working as the first day out of the box. Your money is well invested, buy with confidence.                (Posted on 8/24/2015)

                                This is my second metal detector. This cost more, but is so much better, and I love going to the beach and detecting in the surf...without all that noise. Been treasure hunting in dry areas and it so accurate!

Quality and precision all the way! Review by Darlene H 

                                                I purchased the Garrett Mark II metal detector after shopping around and reading reviews. After a recent fishing trip to the Florida Keys, this detector was the best choice. Quality and precision all the way. No treasures... just a rush was good enough, until the next time. YOU WON"T be disappointed.                (Posted on 6/24/2014)

                                                Bought my Sea Hunter in April for use at Myrtle Beach and just returned from vacation where I used it for the first time. I found the detector easy to use and in no time I was digging up all sort of things and found it to be great fun. Did not find any true "treasure", but I did manage to defray the cost of the unit by fifteen cents that I did find. The true treasure was the pleasure I found in hearing the tones and the anticipation of what could be.                (Posted on 8/28/2012)

Product Description
Highly Recommended for – Beaches, Lakes, Oceans, and all Waterways.
The Garrett Sea Hunter Mark II has an unparalleled reputation among treasure hunters, law enforcement agencies and various industries as one of the most reliable and sophisticated submersible metal detectors of its kind. The Sea Hunter Mark II is an advanced microprocessor-driven instrument that is lightweight, highly durable and easy to use.
The Sea Hunter’s pulse induction (PI) circuitry provides excellent depth and enables you to find treasure without interference from salt water and most ground minerals.
Outstanding Features 
The Sea Hunter’s outstanding performance, custom-designed housing and multiple configurations make it superior to other underwater detectors available. Microprocessor-based circuitry in the Sea Hunter provides greater sensitivity, faster target response and comes with Garrett’s exclusive Discrete Target Elimination mode.
The custom designed double o- ring sealed housing is durable and lightweight, with individual, o-ring sealed battery and electronics compartments that makes battery replacement hassle free.
An 8″ epoxy-filled searchcoil and custom designed headphones, submersible to 200 feet, make the Sea Hunter Mark II highly stable and reliable. The Sea Hunter Mark II is very versatile, offering four stem arrangements to suit your search needs: the long stem with top stem mount, under cuff stem mount, hip mount and the short stem ScubaMate.
Each arrangement allows you the versatility to search on land, in shallow water or underwater, or in situations where a sealed detector is required.
The ScubaMate is ideal for diving while the long stem allows you to carry the control housing on your waist or shoulder, or stem mounted, is useful for searching on land or in shallow water.
Includes the following items:

8″ PROformance™ submersible search coil
Submersible Headphones
Belt pouch
Instructional DVD

Key Features:

Circuit type: Pulse Induction technology for automatic cancellation of salt/ground mineralization
Audio Threshold, Adjustable: adjust to user’s preference
User-adjustable Discrimination/Elimination
Hip Mount Belt/Pouch: reduces detector weight for long searches
Discrimination Modes: Two operating modes (Standard or Discrete) offer varying levels of non-ferrous target discrimination.

Discrete Trash Elimination: use to eliminate most pull tabs and foil without signficantly degrading sensitivity for rings and coins.
Standard Trash Elimination: provides the deepest possible detection; allows a very slow searchcoil sweep in areas with little trash.


Independently sealed battery compartment
Search Mode: Non-Motion All Metal Deepseeking Mode with Full Range PI discrimination

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
