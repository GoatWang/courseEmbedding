DALLAS, Feb. 6, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- David S. Huntley, AT&T* senior vice president and assistant general counsel, has been recognized as a Dallas Business Journal 2014 Minority Business Leader. The designation serves to recognize individuals providing both outstanding leadership within local corporations and noteworthy community contributions.
Huntley oversees a staff of 45 AT&T attorneys and managers throughout the United States. He was selected by a panel of judges, 22 business owners and corporate executives. He will be among the honorees at a Feb. 6 Omni Dallas hotel awards luncheon and his story will be featured in the Feb. 7 issue of the Dallas Business Journal.
"We are extremely proud that David has been selected for this award – a recognition of his work inside AT&T and within the many organizations for which he volunteers," said Wayne Watts, senior executive vice president and general counsel, AT&T. "We certainly concur that he richly deserves to be singled out not just as an attorney, but as a business leader and a caring person." 
The journal started its Minority Business Leader awards program in 2008 to highlight ethnic minorities who are corporate executives with high levels of responsibility at their companies. Winners must also play a strong leadership role outside their jobs in their communities. Huntley was nominated by lawyers at Haynes and Boone, LLP, who work with AT&T as a client.
Past honorees have included college presidents, retail executives, lawyers, IT company founders, health care executives and educators.
Huntley has served on the executive committee of the United Way of the Texas Gulf Coast, and at the Greater Houston Partnership, where he chaired the Government Relations Advisory Committee. In addition, he was a board member of the Greater Houston Convention and Visitors Bureau and served on the 2004 Houston Super Bowl Host Committee, a not-for-profit group dedicated to bringing acclaim to Houston and the NFL. Huntley was also a member of the Board of Trustees of the Texas Bar Foundation, the San Antonio Zoological Society and the San Antonio YMCA as well as the SMU Alumni Board and the Baylor Health Care System Foundation Board.
Huntley leads a mentor circle for the Dallas Chapter Community Network.  Community Network is an AT&T employee resource group that serves African-American employees.

David Huntley grew up in World War II England. After the war he served in Singapore with the Royal Engineers, and then worked for British Railways. Called to serve God in missions, he entered Christian ministry with the CIM (later renamed OMF International), and became a church-planter, teacher and Christian radio broadcaster.
He is married to Ruth, a fellow missions worker; their three grown children, Jill, Andrew and Lynette, were all born in Asia. David and Ruth have retired to the UK, and have five grandchildren.
