Khmer Resources Announces Inauguration of Hong Kong Office

Forges Exclusive Strategic Alliance with Hong Kong-based i-marker 


HONG KONG, Jan 17, 2013 - (ACN Newswire) - Khmer Resources Investment Holding Group Co. Limited ("Khmer Resources"), an energy development company headquartered in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, is pleased to announce today the inauguration of its Hong Kong office and the strategic partnership among Khmer Resources, Khmer International Media Group Corporation ("Khmer Media"), and i-marker Global Corporation ("i-marker "). Khmer Resources is the "window" company of Khmer Resources Investment Holding Group Co., Ltd ("Khmer Holding"), which owns rich mineral resources in Cambodia. The World Bank and International Monetary Fund expect Cambodia's GDP to expand around 7% per year, supported by the strong growth potential in agriculture, mining, processing and tourism industries. Furthermore, The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries are now the largest market for foreign investments by China enterprises, with a total investment of approximately USD12.5 billion in the past three years. It is believed that the establishment of Khmer Resources' office in Hong Kong should expand the channels for overseas investments in Cambodia and help to capitalize the country's rich natural resources.In December 2012, a Strategic Exclusive Partnership Agreement was signed among Khmer Resources, Khmer Media, and i-marker, with an effective period of ten years. According to the agreement, Khmer Media is to cooperate with related Institutions of the Cambodia Government to implement integration of the i-marker platform to major government procedures of Cambodia, including the immigration process, custom registration and clearance, passport issuance and registration, identity card issuance and so on. Khmer Media is to proactively promote the wider utilisation of i-marker's platform in Cambodia, and extending it to the other nine countries in ASEAN. His Excellency Oknia Cao Yunde (Rank of Minister), the Vice-President of Assistants & Advisors Team to Samdech Chea Sim - Chairman of the People's Party and President of the Cambodian Senate and Chairman of Khmer Resources commented: "The inauguration of our Hong Kong office connects international investors to a wide range of profitable projects in Cambodia and help foster the social and economic development of the country. We believe our presence in Hong Kong and the partnership with i-marker are the beginning of more mutually fruitful cooperation and development between Cambodia and the Greater China market in the future."After trading hours today, Hong Kong listed company China Railsmedia Corporation Limited ("China Railsmedia"; HKSE: 745) also announced that it has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with the existing shareholders of i-marker in relation to a proposed acquisition of i-marker. Mr. Hui Chi Yung, Chairman of China Railsmedia said: "Given the vast potential of mobile commerce platforms especially in high growth emerging markets in Asia, combined with the outstanding quality and capabilities of the i-marker platform, we have full confidence in the future of i-marker. Our plan is to fully seize the business opportunities around the ASEAN region so as to expand i-marker's geographical reach and broaden its revenue base."About Khmer Resources Investment Holding Group Co.

KKR typically seeks to make private equity investments in businesses with strong franchises, attractive growth prospects, leading market positions, and the ability to generate high returns on investments. The companies in which we invest are often in transition—positioned for new growth or in need of reorganization or enhanced focus. We also have the resources and expertise to provide growth capital, form partnerships with entrepreneurs, and create joint ventures or public-private partnerships. Our ability to be flexible allows us to pursue opportunities in emerging markets where attractive investment opportunities may require an investment approach other than the traditional buyout.
However, no matter the transaction structure or size, our approach remains the same. We strive to work as partners with the management teams of our portfolio companies, become deeply involved in the operations of our businesses, and harness our global partnership and internal capabilities to drive results.

Introduction to Investing




Many people just like you turn to the markets to help buy a home, send children to college, or build a retirement nest egg. But unlike the banking world, where deposits are guaranteed by federal deposit insurance, the value of stocks, bonds, and other securities fluctuates with market conditions. No one can guarantee that you’ll make money from your investments, and they may lose value.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission enforces the laws on how investments are offered and sold to you. Protecting investors is an important part of our mission. We cannot tell you what investments to make, but this website provides unbiased information to help you evaluate your choices and protect yourself against fraud.

Are you headed in the right direction? 

Visit the Roadmap to Saving and Investing
A few people may stumble into financial security. But for most people, the only way to attain financial security is to save and invest over a long period of time. You just need to have your money work for you. That’s investing.
Knowing how to secure your financial well-being is one of the most important things you’ll ever need in life. You don’t have to be a genius to do it. You just need to know a few basics, form a plan, and be ready to stick to it. There is no guarantee that you’ll make money from investments you make. But if you get the facts about saving and investing and follow through with an intelligent plan, you should be able to gain financial security over the years and enjoy the benefits of managing your money. For more information, SEC’s publication Saving and Investing: A Roadmap To Your Financial Security Through Saving and Investing.

Mutual Funds

What are mutual funds?
A mutual fund is a company that pools money from many investors and invests the money in securities such as stocks, bonds, and short-term debt. The combined holdings of the mutual fund are known as its portfolio. Investors buy shares in mutual funds. Each share represents an investor’s part ownership in the fund and the income it generates.

Why do people buy mutual funds?What types of mutual funds are there?What are the benefits and risks of mutual funds?How to buy and sell mutual fundsUnderstanding feesAvoiding fraudAdditional information
Why do people buy mutual funds?
Mutual funds are a popular choice among investors because they generally offer the following features:
Professional Management. The fund managers do the research for you. They select the securities and monitor the performance.
Diversification or “Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.” Mutual funds typically invest in a range of companies and industries. This helps to lower your risk if one company fails.
Affordability. Most mutual funds set a relatively low dollar amount for initial investment and subsequent purchases.
Liquidity. Mutual fund investors can easily redeem their shares at any time, for the current net asset value (NAV) plus any redemption fees.
What types of mutual funds are there?
Most mutual funds fall into one of four main categories – money market funds, bond funds, stock funds, and target date funds. Each type has different features, risks, and rewards.
Money market funds have relatively low risks. By law, they can invest only in certain high-quality, short-term investments issued by U.S. corporations, and federal, state and local governments.
Bond funds have higher risks than money market funds because they typically aim to produce higher returns. Because there are many different types of bonds, the risks and rewards of bond funds can vary dramatically.
Stock funds invest in corporate stocks. Not all stock funds are the same. Some examples are:
		Growth funds focus on stocks that may not pay a regular dividend but have potential for above-average financial gains.
Income funds invest in stocks that pay regular dividends.
Index funds track a particular market index such as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.
Sector funds specialize in a particular industry segment.

Target date funds hold a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments. Over time, the mix gradually shifts according to the fund’s strategy. Target date funds, sometimes known as lifecycle funds, are designed for individuals with particular retirement dates in mind.
What are the benefits and risks of mutual funds?
Mutual funds offer professional investment management and potential diversification. They also offer three ways to earn money:
Dividend Payments. A fund may earn income from dividends on stock or interest on bonds. The fund then pays the shareholders nearly all the income, less expenses.
Capital Gains Distributions. The price of the securities in a fund may increase. When a fund sells a security that has increased in price, the fund has a capital gain. At the end of the year, the fund distributes these capital gains, minus any capital losses, to investors.
Increased NAV. If the market value of a fund’s portfolio increases, after deducting expenses, then the value of the fund and its shares increases. The higher NAV reflects the higher value of your investment.
All funds carry some level of risk. With mutual funds, you may lose some or all of the money you invest because the securities held by a fund can go down in value. Dividends or interest payments may also change as market conditions change.
A fund’s past performance is not as important as you might think because past performance does not predict future returns. But past performance can tell you how volatile or stable a fund has been over a period of time. The more volatile the fund, the higher the investment risk.
How to buy and sell mutual funds
Investors buy mutual fund shares from the fund itself or through a broker for the fund, rather than from other investors. The price that investors pay for the mutual fund is the fund’s per share net asset value plus any fees charged at the time of purchase, such as sales loads.
Mutual fund shares are “redeemable,” meaning investors can sell the shares back to the fund at any time. The fund usually must send you the payment within seven days.
Before buying shares in a mutual fund, read the prospectus carefully. The prospectus contains information about the mutual fund’s investment objectives, risks, performance, and expenses. See How to Read a Mutual Fund Prospectus Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3 to learn more about key information in a prospectus.
Understanding fees
As with any business, running a mutual fund involves costs. Funds pass along these costs to investors by charging fees and expenses. Fees and expenses vary from fund to fund. A fund with high costs must perform better than a low-cost fund to generate the same returns for you.
Even small differences in fees can mean large differences in returns over time. For example, if you invested $10,000 in a fund with a 10% annual return, and annual operating expenses of 1.5%, after 20 years you would have roughly $49,725. If you invested in a fund with the same performance and expenses of 0.5%, after 20 years you would end up with $60,858.
It takes only minutes to use a mutual fund cost calculator to compute how the costs of different mutual funds add up over time and eat into your returns. See the Mutual Fund Glossary for types of fees.
Avoiding fraud
By law, each mutual fund is required to file a prospectus and regular shareholder reports with the SEC. Before you invest, be sure to read the prospectus and the required shareholder reports. Additionally, the investment portfolios of mutual funds are managed by separate entities know as “investment advisers” that are registered with the SEC. Always check that the investment adviser is registered before investing.

Thematic investing 

 












Research driven investing 



		Pala develops research driven, top-down investment themes to arrive at differentiated views on markets and value.

		Bringing together a team with diverse backgrounds in investing, trading, forecasting and operating mines to build robust investing strategies.

Flexibility to respond to opportunity 



		Pala’s flexible investment mandate allows capital to be quickly deployed in areas that maximize value - often where others can’t.

		Responding to the absence of investment opportunities in cobalt, owing to its role as a byproduct metal, Pala successfully built a portfolio of physical metal and royalties that was used to seed Cobalt 27.

		Entering the physical cobalt market allowed Pala to gain price exposure ahead of rising prices while running parallel efforts to develop an investable cobalt vehicle.


Investor’s only choice for pure play cobalt exposure

	 


		Cobalt 27 is listed on the TSX-V providing the broader investment community with the only investment option of scale to get exposure to the cobalt investment theme.

		Creating a publicly traded cobalt equity provided Pala with the liquidity required to manage and diversify its investment exposure.

		Pala is a supportive shareholder, lending its in depth knowledge of the cobalt market and in-house capabilities to enable Cobalt 27 to execute on its phase II business plan of undertaking cobalt streaming transactions.






Cobalt 27 is traded on the TSX-V and offers investors the only pure play way to gain exposure to the cobalt market

Backing the right team 



		Pala recognizes the value of a top caliber management team in making an investment successful.

		The management team at Concord was formed from the chief traders at Noble’s former LME metals trading group.
		

				Excellent track record and long history of working together.

				The existing relationships and know-how to execute from day one.

Executing turnaround 

 












History 


	 


		Pala acquired a 30% stake in Sierra Rutile (“SRL”), the Sierra Leonean mineral sands producer, in September 2010 and subsequently increased its holding to over 50%.

		When Pala first invested, SRL had suffered a series of setbacks:
		

				Its share price had been languishing near all-time lows for an extended period.

				The company was involved in a dispute with the Government of Sierra Leone regarding an outstanding government loan.

				Its assets had been chronically neglected of investment and maintenance, and the company was loss-making.





"Pala has been the driving force behind the success of Sierra Rutile. Upon its initial investment, Pala was quick to understand the value opportunity, and was hugely supportive in the development of our strategic plan, the institutionalization of change, and the optimization of business processes and controls. As a direct result of our partnership with Pala, we have successfully turned-around the business, and with a number of growth projects executed and under development, we have a strong future.”

		AMR was unable to raise funds and the development of Ban Phuchad failed



"Pala’s investment provided Asian Mineral Resources with access to turnaround skills and operational expertize that proved invaluable in bringing the Ban Phucproject into operation. Having achieved commercial production at Ban Phuc, Pala continues to bring important support as we focus on growth, including the depth of experience of Pala’s technical team and the strategic and commercial support provided by Pala in pursing our corporate objectives.
