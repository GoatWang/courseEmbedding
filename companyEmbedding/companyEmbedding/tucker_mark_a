Tucker to Mark Green: Why is the Paris Climate Agreement a good thing?

Former New York City Public Advocate Mark Green sparred with Tucker Carlson on Friday's "Tucker Carlson Tonight" over the Trump administration's decision this week to begin the process of leaving the landmark Paris climate accord that was signed by 195 countries worldwide in 2016.






Why, Carlson asked, is the climate agreement a good thing?
"You can’t make the perfect the enemy of the good," said Green, noting that data released by GOP pollster Frank Luntz showed a majority of voters in every state support staying in the Paris accord. "Every country sets its own standards [and it works] with peer pressure."
Carlson also said that supporters of the Paris Agreement are "lying" about what it actually says.
PARIS CLIMATE AGREEMENT: US WITHDRAWS AS TRUMP CALLS IT 'UNFAIR' 
"We do pledge to start reducing it. They have said, voluntarily, that we are aiming to reduce carbon over time," Green said. "The answer is, with Paris, countries have a moral-suasion, to keep progress."



Carlson called out Green for not answering his questions.
"Mar-a-Lago is gonna be underwater when Barron’s grandchildren are alive," said Green.

	Need a lawyer? 


	The Justia Lawyer Directory is a listing of lawyers, legal aid organizations, and pro bono legal service organizations. Whether you were injured, are accused of a crime, or are merely engaging in everyday affairs that affect your legal rights or property, an attorney can help you resolve problems or prevent new ones from arising. 


	Here are just a few situations where you might want to seek the advice of an attorney: 



		You were injured in a car or truck accident 
	

		You have been arrested and charged with a crime, such as DUI or shoplifting 
	

		You are considering separating from your spouse 
	

		You have been subjected to harassment or other discrimination at work 
	


	Use Justia to research and compare attorneys so that you can make an informed decision when you hire your counsel. 


	It is important to research an attorney before hiring him or her. Be sure to evaluate an attorney's experience (types of cases handled, prior results obtained, etc.). Although prior results are not indicative of the likelihood of success in your case, they can help you make an informed decision. 


	Also worth serious consideration is the attorney's location, particularly if you will be traveling to visit him or her for consultations. 


	Finally, research an attorney to see whether he or she has ever been subject to discipline. Although disciplinary actions do not necessarily impact the attorney's competence to handle your case, they may affect your decision whether to hire. 



Researching Attorney Discipline
Find out whether an attorney has ever been disciplined.

 Summer Toys and Games for Kids, PIX 11 ReportTucker Toys featured on PIX 11 News segment on summer toys and games for kids. Watch the video for the full story. 
Mark Nathan becomes CEO and President of Tucker ToysMark Nathan has assumed the role of CEO and president of Tucker Toys, while founder Mike Goldman is focusing on product design as Chief Product Officer. The changes were a result of Tucker Toys’ growth of 438 percent from 2013 to 2015.Tucker Toys released three new toy brands that were accepted in the toy industry and the special needs market, and the company had changed from a distributor-only manufacturer to a consumer-facing toy maker with direct-to-retail sales and e-commerce. While the Phlat Ball, the company’s most popular product, continues to receive international attention, new products have received 37 awards in the past year.

	Need a lawyer? 


	The Justia Lawyer Directory is a listing of lawyers, legal aid organizations, and pro bono legal service organizations. Whether you were injured, are accused of a crime, or are merely engaging in everyday affairs that affect your legal rights or property, an attorney can help you resolve problems or prevent new ones from arising. 


	Here are just a few situations where you might want to seek the advice of an attorney: 



		You were injured in a car or truck accident 
	

		You have been arrested and charged with a crime, such as DUI or shoplifting 
	

		You are considering separating from your spouse 
	

		You have been subjected to harassment or other discrimination at work 
	


	Use Justia to research and compare Tucker attorneys so that you can make an informed decision when you hire your counsel. 


	It is important to research an attorney before hiring him or her. Be sure to evaluate an attorney's experience (types of cases handled, prior results obtained, etc.). Although prior results are not indicative of the likelihood of success in your case, they can help you make an informed decision. 


	Also worth serious consideration is the attorney's location, particularly if you will be traveling to visit him or her for consultations. 


	Finally, research an attorney to see whether he or she has ever been subject to discipline. Although disciplinary actions do not necessarily impact the attorney's competence to handle your case, they may affect your decision whether to hire. 


Researching Attorney Discipline
Find out whether an attorney has ever been disciplined.

FAQ Lawyers Get ListedRelated Practice AreasAsbestos & MesotheliomaMedical MalpracticePersonal Injury
	Need a lawyer? 


	The Justia Lawyer Directory is a listing of lawyers, legal aid organizations, and pro bono legal service organizations. Whether you were injured, are accused of a crime, or are merely engaging in everyday affairs that affect your legal rights or property, an attorney can help you resolve problems or prevent new ones from arising. 


	Here are just a few situations where you might want to seek the advice of an attorney: 



		You were injured in a car or truck accident 
	

		You have been arrested and charged with a crime, such as DUI or shoplifting 
	

		You are considering separating from your spouse 
	

		You have been subjected to harassment or other discrimination at work 
	


	Use Justia to research and compare attorneys so that you can make an informed decision when you hire your counsel. 


	It is important to research an attorney before hiring him or her. Be sure to evaluate an attorney's experience (types of cases handled, prior results obtained, etc.). Although prior results are not indicative of the likelihood of success in your case, they can help you make an informed decision. 


	Also worth serious consideration is the attorney's location, particularly if you will be traveling to visit him or her for consultations. 


	Finally, research an attorney to see whether he or she has ever been subject to discipline. Although disciplinary actions do not necessarily impact the attorney's competence to handle your case, they may affect your decision whether to hire. 



Researching Attorney Discipline
Find out whether an attorney has ever been disciplined.

Insurance sounds boring and dreary to most people. Not for us at Tucker Mark M, however. While it is a serious business, we do not see insurance as boring - it is after all the business of keeping people in their homes, from going out of business and getting back on the road – essentially helping people lead normal lives and recover from disaster. This is interesting stuff! We are partnered with the right insurance carrier/s, people we have been doing business with for years. This enables us to comparison shop and gets you (our client) the best deal available. And the best deal is not always about price – but, hey – price is a big factor and we will never stop fighting to get you the best price. We help our clients with all kinds of insurance, but here are the main insurance types our agency focuses on -

Auto insurance – do you know what coverage you have? Most of our clients gloss over when we start talking liability, collision, comprehensive insurance coverages. And why do the limits have to be different based on your specific needs? Rest assured, we understand what is needed to operate a vehicle in and around Minneapolis, MN and will handle all the details for you.
Business Insurance – own or operate a business? Do you need insurance before you can execute on a job/contract? Not sure what type of insurance you need? Do you just need the minimum or are you thinking about future exposure to lawsuits and injury claims? Our commercial insurance agents are standing by to help you get the right policy to help your business succeed.
Homeowners insurance – who knows where the value lies in an insurance policy when it comes to something as local-specific as insurance for a structure, building, home in a specific location – your local insurance agent – that’s who! Let us showcase our knowledge of the area in and around Minneapolis, MN. You will be confident that you found the best local partner for your insurance needs.
Call us – let’s chat – 952-920-6627
