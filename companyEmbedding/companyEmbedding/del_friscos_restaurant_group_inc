Company Profile
Del Frisco's Restaurant Group, Inc. develops, owns and operates three contemporary, high end, complementary restaurant concepts: Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steak House, or Del Frisco's, Sullivan's Steakhouse, or Sullivan's, and Del Frisco's Grille, or the Grille. Each of our three concepts offers steaks as well as other menu selections, such as chops and fresh seafood, which are complemented by an extensive, award-winning wine selection. Our restaurants also use a distinctive, highly attentive serving process and offer sophisticated interior décors which we believe differentiate us from our peers by creating an upscale, high-energy environment.
While positioned within the fine dining segment, Del Frisco's, Sullivan's and the Grille have each developed distinctive appeal for both business and local dining customers. We believe our success reflects consistent execution across all aspects of the dining experience, from the formulation of proprietary recipes to the procurement and presentation of high quality menu items and delivery of excellent guest service.

DEL FRISCO'S RESTAURANT GROUP, INC. Company Profile

   Del Frisco's Restaurant Group operates two upscale steakhouse chains, Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steak House and Sullivan's, with about 30 locations in more than 15 states. The group also runs two more casual Del Frisco's Grille restaurants. Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steak House has about 10 locations, and offer upscale dining in a contemporary surrounding. The somewhat less pricey version of the 20-unit Sullivan's chain features an atmosphere reminiscent of a Chicago-style steakhouse. Both concepts serve premium cuts of beef along with seafood, lamb, and pork dishes, and both offer an extensive wine list. The company, controlled by Dallas-based private equity firm Lone Star Funds, went public in 2012.

Retailing Market Research Reports & Industry Analysis
Retailing is defined as any company involved in the sale of product or services. There are many ways to sell products. One can sell products online, in a storefront or by mail/catalog. Most brick and mortar stores have become chain stores that undercut mom and pop shops by purchasing large quantities in bulk and spread across multiple stores or in regions. 
	 Similarly, companies involved in selling products online or via mail/catalog are able to store product off premise and utilize replenishment systems or logistic companies to ship from off site locations.
Proper research can allow small businesses to expand their reach by creating an ecommerce store front or selling online. Retail outlets can be any product or service being sold. Convenience Stores, gas stations, home stores, technology stores, warehouse clubs, department stores, discount stores and chain stores are most well known. Having a strong base of suppliers is pivotal for the success of any retailer. Retailers can be affected by consumer confidence, personal income and interest rates on either credit cards or loans. Developing an in depth understanding of the parameters of retailing will aid in ensuring any company the success in a marketplace.

DEL FRISCO'S RESTAURANT GROUP, INC. Revenue and Financial Data

   Del Frisco's Restaurant Group operates two upscale steakhouse chains, Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steak House and Sullivan's, with about 30 locations in more than 15 states. The group also runs two more casual Del Frisco's Grille restaurants. Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steak House has about 10 locations, and offer upscale dining in a contemporary surrounding. The somewhat less pricey version of the 20-unit Sullivan's chain features an atmosphere reminiscent of a Chicago-style steakhouse. Both concepts serve premium cuts of beef along with seafood, lamb, and pork dishes, and both offer an extensive wine list. The company, controlled by Dallas-based private equity firm Lone Star Funds, went public in 2012.
