From its 
										humble beginnings in 1959 on the west 
										side of Plymouth, Indiana, Plymouth 
										Products has evolved into the premier 
										producer of backing pads, plates and 
										accessories for customers worldwide.
In 1999, 
										under new ownership, the company moved 
										its current headquarters on Jim Neu 
										Drive with a brand new office and 
										manufacturing complex.
Today 
										Plymouth Products continues to add to 
										its growing product line with the 
										addition of a new program consisting of 
										both high-end rubber pads and price 
										competitive plastic pads in both 
										air-cooled and smooth faced styles.

Sav-A-Disc?


																	Sav-A-Disc 
																	is a 
																	patented 
																	grinder 
																	backing 
																	plate and 
																	grinding 
																	system that 
																	significantly 
																	increases 
																	abrasive 
																	disc life 
																	and improves 
																	the quality 
																	of any 
																	surface 
																	preparation 
																	or finishing 
																	project.


																	Sav-A-Disc 
																	Operation  
																	The unique 
																	ribbed 
																	construction 
																	of the plate 
																	puts the top 
																	and the 
																	secondary 
																	grit layers 
																	of the 
																	abrasive 
																	disc to 
																	work. 
																	Because the 
																	plate 
																	rotates 
																	freely, the 
																	abrasive 
																	disc is 
																	constantly 
																	changing its 
																	position 
																	relative to 
																	the ribs of 
																	the plate. 
																	Each grain 
																	on the disc 
																	is forced to 
																	lie on an 
																	angle on the 
																	ribs of the 
																	plate. This 
																	action 
																	continually 
																	unloads the 
																	disc and 
																	re-sharpens 
																	the grain.
