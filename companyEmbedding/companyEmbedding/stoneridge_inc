History
Stoneridge has provided high-quality components for vehicles for more than 40 years. From our beginning as a contract manufacturer for a single customer, we have evolved to become a worldwide technology leader in our industry. Acquisitions and internal growth have driven our expansion into more diverse product lines and geographic markets.

Following are some of the highlights of the Company’s progress:
1965 – Company founded in Warren, Ohio, by D.M. Draime, as a one-customer, contract manufacturing business serving the automotive market. Draime remained Chairman of the Company’s Board of Directors until his death in 2006.
1988 – Stoneridge acquires the Joseph Pollak Corporation, a manufacturer of electronic and electromechanical switch products in Boston, Massachusetts. Pollak, established in 1909, traces its automotive roots to supplying 2-pole connectors to Ford Motor Company on the Model T.
1992 – Stoneridge acquires the Transportation Electronics Division of General Instruments, a manufacturer of power conversion modules and sophisticated instrumentation components. Located in El Paso, Texas and Juarez, Mexico, this acquisition was the starting point for our electronics business.
1995 – Stoneridge acquires the power door lock actuator business unit from Kelsey-Hayes. The business is relocated from Brighton, Michigan to Boston, Massachusetts and merged with the existing four-wheel drive actuator and fuel valve production within the Pollak division.
1996 – Seeking to leverage our capabilities and diversify our OEM customer base, Stoneridge acquires approximately 45% of Berifors AB (“Berifors”), a Sweden-based manufacturer of electronic display panels and instrumentation for the European truck and commercial vehicle markets.
1997 – Stoneridge completes its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange, ticker SRI. Stoneridge acquires the remaining 55% of Berifors (later renamed Stoneridge Electronics) in Sweden, which solidly establishes our European presence in vehicle electronics, and enters into a 50% joint venture agreement with PST Amazônia S.A. in Brazil, which provides us with a platform to expand further into the South American market.
1998 – Company acquires Hi-Stat Manufacturing Co., Inc., with plants in Lexington, Ohio and Sarasota, Florida. This leading supplier of vehicle sensor and switch products was the largest acquisition in Stoneridge’s history and it enabled us to “close the loop” in terms of our electrical systems capabilities.
1999 – Stoneridge acquires assets from a division of Delta Schoeller Limited. (later renamed Stoneridge Pollak Limited), based in the United Kingdom, to grow the Company’s presence in European markets for switch, actuator and sensor products. Stoneridge acquires TVI Europe, Ltd. (later renamed Stoneridge Electronics Limited), based in Dundee, Scotland, providing the Company with products, expertise and customer base expansion in the area of transport monitoring devices for commercial vehicles.
2004 – A joint venture was established with Minda Group, one of India’s major automotive suppliers, based in New Delhi, India. This joint venture meets the growing market for electronic instrumentation and vehicle information management systems in Asia.
A new representative office was opened in Shanghai, China, to manage existing supplier base  and to help secure new low-cost supply sources of components for use in our manufacturing operations.
2005 – The Company established a new subsidiary in Suzhou, China, for the manufacture of sensors, switches, electronic instrumentation and other related electromechanical products for the automotive and commercial vehicle markets.
2009 – Stoneridge acquires a 51% equity interest in Bolton Conductive Systems LLC (“BCS”), an electrical system supplier based in Walled Lake, Michigan.  BCS designs and manufactures a wide variety of electrical solutions for the military, automotive, marine, and specialty vehicle markets.
2011 – Stoneridge acquires an additional 24% ownership of PST Eletrônica S.A. (“PST”, formerly known as PST Industria Eletronica da Amazonia Limitada), a Brazil-based electronic system provider focused on security, infotainment and accessories primarily for the automotive and motorcycle markets.  At the conclusion of the transaction, Stoneridge’s ownership interest in PST increased from 50% to 74%.
2014 – Stoneridge acquires ownership of Motometer GmbHB, a Germany-based distributor of tachographs, accessories and the Motodrive analysis software.   Founded in 1912, MotoMeter is a well-recognized brand within the German commercial vehicle market.
Stoneridge sells its Wiring Business to Motherson Sumi Systems Ltd. to focus resources on our technology-driven business segments.

					Full Description



Stoneridge, Inc., incorporated on September 19, 1988, is a designer and manufacturer of engineered electrical and electronic components, modules and systems for the automotive, commercial, motorcycle, off-highway and agricultural vehicle markets. The Company operates through three segments: Control Devices, Electronics and PST. The Company operated in 25 locations in 12 countries as of December 31, 2016.Control DevicesThe Company's Control Devices segment designs and manufactures products that monitor, measure or activate specific functions within a vehicle. The segment includes product lines, such as sensors, switches, valves, and actuators. Sensor products are employed in vehicle systems, such as the emissions, safety, powertrain, braking, climate control, steering and suspension systems. Switches transmit signals that activate specific functions. The Company's switch technology is principally used in over two capacities, user-activated and hidden. User-activated switches are used by a vehicle's operator or passengers to manually activate rear defrosters and other accessories.

Our core solutions are Microsoft Dynamics 365, Microsoft Dynamics CRM, Microsoft Dynamics AX, Dynamics NAV and their related products. If you’re considering Stoneridge Software you might have Dynamics AX, Dynamics NAV or Dynamics CRM already in use at your business, or you might be looking at Microsoft Dynamics 365. Whether you’re already a Dynamics AX, NAV or CRM user, looking at migrating from an alternative Microsoft Dynamics product or considering Microsoft Dynamics for the first time, your investment in Stoneridge Software and Microsoft is a safe bet. We offer a broad set of capabilities and a remarkably experienced team of professionals to help you implement Dynamics solutions for your organization.





Microsoft Dynamics 365
One system that meets all your needs, Microsoft Dynamics 365 provides business intelligence and productivity through tight integration with the Office 365 apps you already use. With intelligent applications across accounting and operations (ERP) functionality and customer relationship management (CRM), Dynamics 365 connects your critical business actions and provides choices that are relevant to your business. You can begin with just what you need to run your business, and add apps as you evolve. Dynamics 365 provides these powerful tools, and access to much more:

Financial Management
Project Management and Accounting
Business Intelligence and Reporting
Production
Supply Chain Management
Procurement and Sourcing
Sales
Service Management

One of the most exciting aspects of the new Dynamics 365 offering is that it is designed for flexibility in your choice of plan, type of user and businesses of many sizes, giving you only what you need — when you need it. Get monthly plans—with apps packaged for savings—or standalone applications. Opt for full or light use. And select the edition that meets the needs of your large or small business, now and down the road.

Microsoft Dynamics CRM
Customer relationship management (CRM) is the electronic visibility and maintenance of relationships, and the tracking of information, sales, and communications – all in one place. Microsoft Dynamics CRM provides a channel for categorization, organization and company-wide accessibility to data at your fingertips across all devices.
Key Components:

Leads: creation, tracking, and management through entire sales cycle
Accounts/Contacts: relationships, participation in activities and hierarchy
Opportunities/Products: creation, tracking, visibility, and monitoring
Activities: calls, emails, appointments, tasks and surveys
Cases: service Management, tracking, and visibility
Workflow: automation of process and handoff of activity responsibility

Dynamics CRM tools centralize customer information, automate marketing interactions, provide business intelligence, and facilitate communications for increased productivity. Dynamics CRM tracks sales opportunities, analyzes data and allows you access to the information you need to deliver the best results for your customers.

Financial Management
Manufacturing
Multiple and International Sites
Project Management
Sales and Marketing
Service Management
Supply Chain Management
Business Intelligence

The functionality is particularly strong in managing complex supply chain and inventory, and is best for growing businesses without complicated organizational structure. The system is highly configurable and allows for customizations to meet your unique business requirements.

Microsoft Dynamics AX

Microsoft Dynamics AX has always been a powerful, agile Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution which includes core and industry-specific capabilities for your business. The most recent release of Dynamics AX is now called Dynamics 365 for Operations, but trust that Dynamics AX will still be used by many for years to come.
If your company is running Dynamics AX 2009 or Dynamics AX 2012, you won’t find a better team, equipped to support your current instance and ready for you when its time to upgrade. Find out how Stoneridge can help you continue to get the most from your Dynamics AX system in all areas of your business.

Software Assurance Transition Benefits for Microsoft Dynamics
Stoneridge Software often works with clients currently using other Microsoft Dynamics solutions like Dynamics GP and Dynamics SL. Over time, your business has changed and you might have determined that your current system no longer meets your needs, but you don’t want to lose the investment you made in the software licenses. You don’t have to. Microsoft offers Software Assurance Transition Benefits. By transitioning from your current Microsoft Dynamics product to another Microsoft Dynamics ERP solution, customers are able to “cash-in” their investment in Dynamics, and use that value towards Microsoft Dynamics 365 or Microsoft Dynamics NAV.
We will work closely with you and Microsoft to determine the value of your current Dynamics license and apply that towards the license cost of your new Microsoft Dynamics ERP solution. Just as we do with clients that are new to Dynamics, we go through the same discovery and demonstration process to ensure that switching to a new Dynamics solution will meet your unique requirements.
