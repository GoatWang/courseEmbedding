Kevin Curran, a veteran TV comedy writer-producer who won six Emmys as part of the staffs of The Simpsons and Late Night With David Letterman, died today at his Los Angeles home after a lengthy illness. He was 59. Simpsons showrunner Al Jean, who met Curran while they were at Harvard in the late 1970s, confirmed the news of Twitter:



.@TheSimpsons V v sad at the passing of Kevin Curran brilliantly funny and true friend https://t.co/hCoPUEV6xx
— Al Jean (@AlJean) October 25, 2016


 



NBC


Curran wrote nearly a dozen episodes of Fox’s The Simpsons and had been part of its producing team for the past 15 years, most recently as co-EP. He shared three Emmys for Outstanding Animated Program among 14 nominations spanning 2002-2016. Earlier in his career, he shared three consecutive writing Emmys for NBC’s Late Night With David Letterman, as the show began to dominate late-night TV and shake up the TV comedy world.
Jean said today in a statement: “Kevin Curran was a sweet, brilliant man who said many hilarious things, some unprintable, others which will live forever in a children’s cartoon.”







During his career, Curran also wrote for and held producer roles on the WB’s Unhappily Ever After (1997-99), NBC’s The Good Life (1994) and another early Fox comedy Married … With Children (1990-97). On the latter show, he also provided the voice for the wisecracking family dog Buck in dozens of episodes.

Very, very sad. Far too young. Condolences to his family.












Hollyvet • 						on  Oct 25, 2016 4:15 pm


Kevin Curran who I represented for many years at UTA was a most talented writer.  He was also a good human being.  I believe he was married to Helen Fielding and they had a son.  God bless you Kevin.

Went to a party once at his home, got to be 15 years ago, and he had Kato Kalin living in his guest house, and Robert Blake as a party guest.
