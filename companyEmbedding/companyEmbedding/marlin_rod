Description


(4) 30-50lb Blue Marlin Tournament Edition rods constructed with high carbon composite blank span wrap to minimize side loads and twist. The span wrap is construction is important when a fish takes off to the side. The rod will resist twist better than any rod we have tested. The rods measure at a comfortable 5’5″. Butt of the rod has black leather for comfort and nonslip grip. There is a gimbal cross on the butt of the rod butt for rod holders or fighting chairs. The rod also features 4 wide mouth winds on leader roller guides, and a double roller guide closest to the reel seat. This is our finest Blue Marlin Tournament Edition bent butt rod. It is ideal for Marlin, Yellow fin Tuna and record Wahoo. Not only does this rod perform but it is one of the best looking bent butt rods. A set of these on a tournament boat is quite the site. Excellent back bone and sensitive tip for the best action of and rod we have constructed. 100% CUSTOMER SATISFACTION OR YOUR MONEY BACK!

The rod also features 4 wide mouth winds on leader roller guides, and a double roller guide closest to the reel seat. This is our finest Blue Marlin Tournament Edition bent butt rod. It is ideal for Marlin, Yellow fin Tuna and record Wahoo. Not only does this rod perform but it is one of the best looking bent butt rods. A set of these on a tournament boat is quite the site. Excellent back bone and sensitive tip for the best action of and rod we have constructed. 100% CUSTOMER SATISFACTION OR YOUR MONEY BACK!

	        Since 1952, MARLEN has been a leading innovator in ostomy care. Offering an extensive line of one-piece and two-piece systems for Ileostomies (drainable), Colostomies (closed end) and Urostomies, MARLEN has always strived to provide the highest quality products while meeting the comfort and security needs of our customers.
MARLEN now offers a deep convex solution in all pouch types - UltraMax™ DEEP. The unique petal design creates a flexible, comfortable fit for all abdominal contours.
All Marlen Ostomy Pouches are manufactured using InteliShield™ Barrier Film, a patent-pending, state-of-the-art film from Vancive Medical Technologies. Since InteliShield makes our pouches PCV, PVdC and plasticizer-FREE, there is no more concern about the potential risks associated with the use of traditional films.
MARLEN offers a variety of one-piece ostomy systems including UltraMax™,  MaxPlus™ featuring a larger cutting surface up to 80mm, SuperFlat™, UltraLite™ and MiniMax™. For those who prefer a two-piece system, MARLEN offers UltraMax™ Gemini™. The MARLEN product offering does not end with pouching systems. MARLEN also has a choice of barriers including our MaxSeal™ Protective Barrier Ring and our UltraSeal™ Flexible Barrier Ring in both 2" and 4" sizes. A variety of ostomy accessories are also available that complement the product line.
Throughout the world, ostomy and wound care specialists turn to MARLEN for “Security by Design.”
