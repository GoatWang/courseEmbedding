Triferic









Bio-Pharma DevelopmentRockwell Medical has a reputation as an industry innovator with an extensive history of product development and successful new product launches, addressing unmet needs in the renal market since its founding in 1994.  The company recently commercially launched Triferic® (ferric pyrophosphate citrate), the first and only water-soluble iron drug in the world delivered via dialysate, to replace iron and maintain hemoglobin in adult patients with hemodialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease. The approval and commercialization of Triferic was based upon the results of a successful 11-year FDA clinical development program that included: two (2) in vitro primary pharmacodynamics studies, five (5) safety pharmacology studies, four (4) chronic-repeat-dose general toxicity studies, three (3) genotoxicity studies, six (6) reproductive and developmental toxicology studies, six (6) Phase I and 2 clinical studies and three (3) randomized, controlled, Phase 3 studies. In total, more than 100,000 doses of Triferic were safely administered as part of the clinical development program. Building upon that success, Rockwell is now developing new Triferic formulations targeting the treatment of iron deficiency anemia in other renal and cancer markets. These formulations include: Triferic IV Solution for chronic or acute care intravenous use; Triferic TPN Solution for total parenteral nutrition acute care applications; Triferic PD Solution for peritoneal dialysis in the home; and Triferic Orphan indication to treat iron-refractory, iron-deficiency anemia (IRIDA). In addition to Triferic, Rockwell has received FDA approval to market Calcitriol IV Injection, the lowest cost, lowest dose active form Vitamin D to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in dialysis patients. The 1 mcg dose injection packaged in vials is designed to be cost effectively administered during each dialysis session. Calcitriol is more potent than branded Vitamin D drugs and is shown to be therapeutically equivalent in safety and efficacy to these agents.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic-type reactions, some of which have been life-threatening and fatal, have been reported in patients receiving parenteral iron products. Patients may present with shock, clinically significant hypotension, loss of consciousness, and/or collapse. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity during and after hemodialysis until clinically stable. Personnel and therapies should be immediately available for the treatment of serious hypersensitivity reactions [
         
 
  see 
          
  
   Adverse Reactions (6) ].
        

 
Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in 1 (0.3%) of 292 patients receiving Triferic in two randomized clinical trials.
5.2 Iron Laboratory Testing Iron status should be determined on pre-dialysis blood samples. Post dialysis serum iron parameters may overestimate serum iron and transferrin saturation.
6 ADVERSE REACTIONSThe following adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling:
 Hypersensitivity reactions [
        
  
   see 
         
   
    Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ].
       
 
    6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug may not reflect the rates observed in practice.
In two randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials, a total of 292 patients were administered Triferic for periods of up to 1 year [
         
 
  see 
          
  
   Clinical Studies (14) ]. The mean total exposure in the randomized treatment period was 5 months. A total of 296 patients received placebo treatment for a similar time period. In the two studies, 64% were male and 54% were Caucasian. The median age of patients was 60 years (range, 20 to 89 years).
        

 
Adverse events occurring in 3% or greater of patients treated with Triferic in the randomized clinical trials are listed in Table 1.

In clinical trials, adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation included headache, asthenia, dizziness, constipation, nausea, hypersensitivity reactions, intradialytic hypotension, pruritus, and pyrexia.
Adverse reactions reported in the treatment extension period were similar to those observed in the randomized clinical studies.
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy   Risk Summary  
There are no data with Triferic use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk. No teratogenicity was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of ferric pyrophosphate citrate to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses 96 and 128 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 27.2 mg per dialysis [see 
           
 
  Data].
          

 
In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2%–4% and 15%–20%, respectively.   Data    Animal Data 
In a fertility and early embryonic development study in female rats, the maternally toxic ferric pyrophosphate citrate dose of 40 mg/kg administered three times per week by intravenous (IV) infusion was not toxic to the developing embryo.
In embryo-fetal developmental toxicity studies, ferric pyrophosphate citrate was administered during the period of organogenesis as a one-hour IV infusion to pregnant rats and rabbits.  No maternal or developmental toxicity was observed at doses up to 30 mg/kg/day in rats and 20 mg/kg/day in rabbits.  Maternally toxic doses affected embryo-fetal development, resulting in post-implantation loss due to early resorptions, abnormal placentae, decreased fetal body weight and fetal head and vertebral malformations at 90 mg/kg/day in rats and vertebral malformations at 40 mg/kg/day in rabbits.
A pre-and post-natal development study was conducted in pregnant rats with intravenous doses of ferric pyrophosphate citrate up to 90 mg/kg/day.  The maternally toxic dose of 90 mg/kg/day resulted in reductions in the number of live offspring and lower offspring body weights.  There were no adverse effects on survival of offspring at doses up to 30 mg/kg/day, or on behavior, sexual maturation or reproductive parameters of offspring at any dose level.
8.2 Lactation   Risk Summary  
There is no information regarding the presence of Triferic in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for Triferic and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Triferic or from the underlying maternal condition.
8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Triferic may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception measures to prevent pregnancy during treatment with Triferic and for at least 2 weeks following completion of therapy.
8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients.
8.5 Geriatric Use In controlled clinical trials, 99 (28.6%) patients ≥ 65 years of age were treated with Triferic. No overall differences in safety and efficacy were observed between older and younger patients in these trials  [
         
 
  see  
          
  
   Clinical Studies (14) ].
        

 
10 OVERDOSAGENo data are available regarding overdosage of Triferic in humans.

Rockwell Medical Enters Into Exclusive License Agreement  With Wanbang Biopharmaceutical Co., Ltd. to  Commercialize Triferic® in China
Rockwell to Receive $39 Million in Upfront and Milestone Payments  Plus Ongoing Earnings From Product Sales

WIXOM, Mich., Feb.  16, 2016  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rockwell Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ:RMTI), a fully-integrated biopharmaceutical company targeting end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) with innovative products and services for the treatment of iron replacement, secondary hyperparathyroidism and hemodialysis, announced today that it has signed exclusive licensing and manufacturing supply agreements with Wanbang Biopharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Wanbang), a subsidiary of Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical (Group) Co., Ltd. (Fosun Pharma, SHA: 600196 and HKG: 02196), for the rights to commercialize Rockwell's Triferic and Calcitriol for End-Stage-Renal-Disease (ESRD) patients, that also includes new therapeutic 
indications for Triferic, in the People's Republic of China. Triferic is Rockwell's proprietary iron replacement and hemoglobin maintenance drug for treating anemia. Calcitriol is Rockwell's generic (active vitamin D) injection for treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in dialysis patients.
Under the terms of the agreement, Wanbang will become the exclusive distributor for Triferic and Calcitriol in China for an initial commercial term of 10 years, with an extended term of 10 or more years based on achievement of annual minimum purchase requirements. In consideration for the exclusive rights, Rockwell will receive from Wanbang an upfront fee plus regulatory and revenue milestone payments totaling USD$39 million in aggregate. Notably, Rockwell will receive ongoing earnings from product sales of Triferic and Calcitriol, and other additional Triferic therapeutic indications. Rockwell retains manufacturing responsibility of all products. Wanbang is required to achieve annual minimum purchase requirements to retain exclusive commercialization rights. In addition to the hemodialysis 
indication, Wanbang has the exclusive right to develop and commercialize Triferic for new therapeutic indications for the Chinese market. Wanbang is responsible for all clinical, regulatory and marketing expenses for Triferic and Calcitriol in China as well as development and regulatory costs for new Triferic indications. "We are thrilled to establish this strategic partnership with Wanbang," stated Robert L. Chioini, Founder, Chairman and CEO of Rockwell. "China has been a top priority in our global Triferic licensing strategy, and this agreement further validates Triferic's potential for becoming the world-wide standard of care in iron maintenance therapy for the treatment of anemia. This commercialization arrangement enables Rockwell to enter into and capitalize on 
what is projected to become the largest dialysis market in the world. There are about 300,000 dialysis patients currently receiving hemodialysis in China and that market is expected to double over the next few years as the Chinese government, in conjunction with the private sector, establishes the infrastructure to serve the nearly 2 million patients who are presently in need of hemodialysis but lack access. We are very pleased with this commercialization arrangement in which our primary economic value will be derived from product sales in this fast-growing Chinese market." Mr. Chioini further stated, "We are excited to work with Wanbang, a leading company in the Chinese healthcare market and one of the key suppliers of biosimilar ESA product and other drugs in the renal space. Wanbang, and their 
experienced team, is highly skilled and intensely focused on leveraging their business into the forefront of the rapidly growing domestic dialysis market in China, and we expect them to have great success selling Triferic and Calcitriol." Mr. Yifang Wu, Chief Operating Officer of Fosum Pharma, Chairman and CEO of Wanbang, added, "We are very excited to have partnered with Rockwell Medical and to be able to have the opportunity to offer such great drugs to the Chinese hemodialysis market. We believe Triferic is a revolutionary iron replacement product that will greatly improve the lives of Chinese dialysis patients and we intend to work in partnership with Rockwell management to offer it to patients as fast as possible. The opportunity to 
market Triferic in other therapeutic indications is exciting as well. Wanbang is committed to addressing the needs of patients and healthcare providers with a comprehensive range of therapeutic options across home, in-center and hospital settings. This partnership enhances Wanbang's product portfolio with the addition of Rockwell's high-quality drug products." Wanbang Biopharmaceuticals is a leading pharmaceutical company in China that specializes in research, production and marketing of medicines for endocrinology, cardiovascular disease and renal diseases. Wanbang is a subsidiary of Fosun Pharma, which is listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SHA: 600196) and the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (HKG: 02196). Fosun Pharma, one of the major shareholders of Sino Pharma (HKG:1099) who 
is the largest drug distributor in China, is part of the Fosun Group, the leading non-state owned enterprise group in China, which is listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange (HKG:0656). In addition to its comprehensive therapeutic product portfolio, Wanbang and Fosun Pharma have sound relationships with public healthcare institutions and providers and directly own and operate a network of private hospitals in China. About TrifericTriferic is a unique iron replacement product that is delivered to hemodialysis patients via dialysate, replacing the ongoing iron loss that occurs during their dialysis treatment. Triferic is added to the bicarbonate concentrate 
on-site at the dialysis clinic. Once in dialysate, Triferic crosses the dialyzer membrane and enters the blood where it immediately binds to transferrin and is transported to the erythroid precursor cells to be incorporated into hemoglobin. Triferic delivers sufficient iron to the bone marrow and maintains hemoglobin without increasing iron stores (ferritin). Please visit www.triferic.com. About Rockwell MedicalRockwell Medical is a fully-integrated biopharmaceutical company targeting end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) with innovative 
products and services for the treatment of iron replacement, secondary hyperparathyroidism and hemodialysis. Rockwell's Triferic is indicated for iron replacement and maintenance of hemoglobin in hemodialysis patients. Triferic delivers iron to patients during their regular dialysis treatment, using dialysate as the delivery mechanism. Triferic has demonstrated that it safely and effectively delivers sufficient iron to the bone marrow and maintains hemoglobin without increasing iron stores (ferritin). Rockwell's FDA approved generic drug Calcitriol is for treating secondary hyperparathyroidism in dialysis patients. Calcitriol (active vitamin D) injection is indicated in the management of hypocalcemia in patients undergoing chronic renal dialysis.

	About Triferic


	Triferic is the only FDA approved drug indicated to replace iron and maintain hemoglobin in hemodialysis patients suffering from anemia. Via dialysate during each dialysis treatment, Triferic replaces the 5-7 mg iron loss that occurs in all patients, effectively maintaining their iron balance. Unlike IV iron products, Triferic binds iron immediately and completely to transferrin (carrier of iron in the body) upon entering the blood and it is then transported directly to the bone marrow to be incorporated into hemoglobin, with no increase in ferritin (stored iron and inflammation) and no anaphylaxis, addressing a significant unmet need in overcoming Functional Iron Deficiency (FID) in ESRD patients. Please visit www.triferic.com to view the Triferic mode-of-action (MOA) video and for more information.



	About Rockwell Medical


	Rockwell Medical is a fully-integrated biopharmaceutical company targeting end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) with innovative products and services for the treatment of iron replacement, secondary hyperparathyroidism and hemodialysis.


	Rockwell’s recent FDA approved drug Triferic is indicated for iron replacement and maintenance of hemoglobin in hemodialysis patients. Triferic delivers iron to patients during their regular dialysis treatment, using dialysate as the delivery mechanism. Triferic has demonstrated that it safely and effectively delivers sufficient iron to the bone marrow and maintains hemoglobin, without increasing iron stores (ferritin). Rockwell intends to market Triferic to hemodialysis patients in the U.S. dialysis market and globally.


	Rockwell’s FDA approved generic drug Calcitriol is for treating secondary hyperparathyroidism in dialysis patients. Calcitriol (active vitamin D) injection is indicated in the management of hypocalcemia in patients undergoing chronic renal dialysis. It has been shown to significantly reduce elevated parathyroid hormone levels. Reduction of PTH has been shown to result in an improvement in renal osteodystrophy.  Rockwell intends to market Calcitriol to hemodialysis patients in the U.S. dialysis market.


	Rockwell is also an established manufacturer and leader in delivering high-quality hemodialysis concentrates/dialysates to dialysis providers and distributors in the U.S. and abroad. As one of the two major suppliers in the U.S., Rockwell’s products are used to maintain human life by removing toxins and replacing critical nutrients in the dialysis patient’s bloodstream. Rockwell has three U.S. manufacturing/distribution facilities.


	Rockwell’s exclusive renal drug therapies support disease management initiatives to improve the quality of life and care of dialysis patients and are intended to deliver safe and effective therapy, while decreasing drug administration costs and improving patient convenience. Rockwell Medical is developing a pipeline of drug therapies, including extensions of Triferic for indications outside of hemodialysis. Please visit www.rockwellmed.com for more information.

Words such as “may,” “might,” “will,” “should,” “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “continue,” “predict,” “forecast,” “project,” “plan”, “intend” or similar expressions, or statements regarding intent, belief, or current expectations, are forward-looking statements.
