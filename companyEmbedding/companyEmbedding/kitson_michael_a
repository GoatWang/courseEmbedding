We are attempting to create a whole new type of business. We have created our own products, production processes and have had to train employees to do this. We are making the most sophisticated paddle boards we believe on the planet.  There was no manual on how to do this.  We had to do this through research and trial and error.  We have done this in America. Without any major help from banks or major investors. We have done this with our own savings. We are trying to create a business that all Americans could be proud of. Please be patient we are close to success. We expect big increases in production next week.
