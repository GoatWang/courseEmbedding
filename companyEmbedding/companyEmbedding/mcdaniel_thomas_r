 Mr. Tom McDaniel is an experienced and knowledgeable executive and director within the energy, CleanTech and healthcare sectors. His career spans a diverse and successful set of experiences as a CEO, CFO/financial expert and director of a variety of companies within the energy sector.

Prior to retirement, Mr. McDaniel was executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer of Edison International.

Thomas R. McDaniel
Mr. Tom McDaniel is an experienced and knowledgeable executive and director within the energy, CleanTech and healthcare sectors. His career spans a diverse and successful set of experiences as a CEO, CFO/financial expert and director of a variety of companies within the energy sector. As a director, Mr. McDaniel has chaired Audit, Compensation, Nominating and Governance and Finance Committees for public and private companies.  He currently serves as chairman of the board for Tendril (Smart grid/meter services) and a director of SunPower (Renewable energy), the SemGroup (Midstream oil & gas), Cypress Envirosystems (Energy efficiency) and SCAN (Healthcare for seniors).  In addition, he serves on the advisory boards of On Ramp Wireless (Smart grid/meter communication networks-electric, oil, gas & water) and Coda Automotive (Electric transportation/energy storage).
Mr. McDaniel retired from Edison International (EIX) on July 31, 2008 completing 37 years of service with the Company. EIX, with assets of $ 48 billion, is the parent company of Southern California Edison, a regulated electric utility, and the Edison Mission Group, an independent power company which develops, owns and operates fossil fuel and renewable energy generating projects across the US. Prior to retirement, Mr. McDaniel was executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer of Edison International. He was responsible for the company’s financial, risk management, controller, internal audit and IT functions. He was elected to this position in December, 2004.
Prior to January 1, 2005, McDaniel was chairman, chief executive officer and president of Edison Mission Energy, a power generation business specializing in the development, acquisition, construction, management, and operation of power production facilities. During this period, Edison Mission Energy owned generating plants in the US, Europe, Asia and Puerto Rico.  Mr. McDaniel became CEO and president on August 1, 2002 and was elected chairman on January 1, 2003.
McDaniel was also chief executive officer and a director of Edison Capital, a provider of capital and financial services supporting the growth of energy and infrastructure projects, products, and services both domestically and internationally. Edison Capital had interests in nuclear, coal, natural gas, waste to energy and wind generating and transmission projects in the US, Europe, Africa and Australia. The company was also an investor and sponsor of Latin American, Asian and Eastern European infrastructure funds. Edison Capital also established itself as a leading investor, asset manager, and syndicator of affordable housing projects that qualify for the Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program. McDaniel was elected president of Edison Capital in September 1987 in connection with the formation of this wholly-owned Edison International subsidiary.
McDaniel joined Southern California Edison in 1971 in the engineering department and, prior to forming Edison capital, he held a variety of management and senior management positions in the areas of corporate planning, customer service, and corporate finance.  McDaniel has a Bachelor of Science degree in civil engineering from UCLA. He completed graduate studies in business and corporate finance at California State University, Los Angeles, and the University of Southern California.
In February, 2009, Mr. McDaniel became a Director of SunPower Corp., a Silicon Valley-based manufacturer of high-efficiency solar cells, solar panels and solar systems for the domestic and international renewable energy market. SunPower Corp. (NASDAQ: SPWR) generated revenue of over $2.3 billion in 2011.
Mr. McDaniel is a Director of SemGroup Corporation, based in Tulsa, OK, a midstream energy service company, with revenue of more than $1.5 billion in 2011, providing the oil and gas industry with the means to move products from the wellhead to the wholesale marketplace.  SemGroup provides diversified services for end-users and consumers of crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids, refined products and asphalt.  Services include purchasing, selling, processing, transporting, terminaling and storage.
In September 2011, Mr. McDaniel became Chairman of the Board of Tendril.  Located in Boulder CO., Tendril provides utilities with wireless equipment and management software for Smart Grid communication networks that improve energy efficiency; lower operating costs and integrates renewable energy resources. Tendril’s wireless data collection solutions enable utilities to successfully implement demand response, time-of-use billing and critical peak pricing initiatives. Additionally, he is also a Director for Cypress Envirosystems, a subsidiary of Cypress Semiconductor; a leading Silicon Valley based technology company that develops and markets automation technologies that save energy and lower maintenance costs for commercial and industrial facilities.
Mr. McDaniel is a Director of the Senior Care Action Network (SCAN), a Medicare Advantaged HMO with annual revenues of approximately $2 billion which provides healthcare to senior citizens. He is a former Director of the $200 million SCAN Foundation whose mission is to support initiatives to improve the cost effectiveness and quality of healthcare for the elderly.
He serves on several advisory boards, including On-Ramp Wireless, Inc., a wireless communication technology company focusing on smart grid, energy efficiency, security and healthcare applications. Additionally he serves as an Advisor to the Board of Coda Automotive, which is a manufacturer and distributor of all-electric cars and energy storage systems.
