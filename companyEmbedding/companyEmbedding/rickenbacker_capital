As the inventor of the electric guitar, Rickenbacker have a history for producing some of the most innovative and highly sought-after instruments ever created. With a distinct look and an even more recognizable sound, Rickenbacker's lineup spans multiple eras of music, each offering their own flair and attitude. So if you're looking to become part of their rich history, you've definitely found the right place to start.

So how do you navigate such a legendary catalog of instruments? To be honest, it's only fair to give each of these guitars the time and research they deserve before making a decision. From guitars and basses to folk instruments and amps, the vintage collection here represents the best that Rickenbacker has to offer. 

The first thing you'll probably notice as you explore this instrument hall of fame are the all decades they traverse. With classic models from the 40s to the 80s, as well as more modern instruments that go right up to the year 2013, you'll feel like you've gone through a time warp and are experiencing every generation's definitive guitars and basses. Two of the most brand-defining guitars you may find in this section are the 325 and 360/12 electric guitars. Made famous by John Lennon and George Harrison respectively, these instrument helped define 60s rock and roll, bringing Rickenbacker into the spotlight... which they've never moved out of.  

Known for their jangle and chime-y tone, Rickenbacker instruments have been used by some of the biggest names in music history. Bands like The Beatles, The Who, The Byrds and Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers are just a few that have taken to the stage and the studio strapped with a Rickenbacker.  Bold, imaginative and playing a huge role in modern music, owning a Rickenbacker is seen almost as a rite of passage for serious musicians and collectors.
