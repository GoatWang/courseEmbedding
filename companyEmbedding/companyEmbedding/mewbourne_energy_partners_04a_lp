Meet Our Founder


 


Curtis W. Mewbourne, a native of Shreveport, Louisiana, obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering from the University of Oklahoma, where he has been honored as a Distinguished Graduate. After serving as an officer in the U.S. Army and working as a petroleum engineer in industry, he founded Mewbourne Oil Company in 1965. Mewbourne Oil is one of the most successful privately owned oil and gas producers in America. Mr. Mewbourne continues to operate the company privately.
In recognition of his longtime support, the University of Oklahoma named the Mewbourne School of Petroleum and Geological Engineering in his honor in May of 2000, and granted him the Honorary Degree of Doctor of Humane Letters in 2002. On November 2, 2007, the Mewbourne College of Earth & Energy was named in his honor and he was given the Trailblazer Award for his professional achievements and lifetime commitment to the energy center.

We believe that employing degreed professionals throughout the Company's operations provides the level of expertise and quality necessary for success in this industry. Since 1965, we have continually staffed the Company with a high ratio of energy professionals. 
 Mewbourne Oil Company presently employs approximately 400 people in eight offices. Of the total work force, 55 are geologists and land management, 70 are engineers and technical professionals and 50 are accountants and other administrative professionals. Mewbourne Oil Company is unique among independent operators in that it recruits and hires at colleges, conducts an extensive in-house training program and rotates job assignments among young professionals. The Company’s success can be directly attributed to the high standards it maintains in hiring and retaining top quality professionals. 
 The corporate offices are located in Tyler, Texas. The executive and administrative offices are located in Tyler, along with an accounting/financial group, a production operations and reservoir/engineering group, an exploration and land administration group, a capital market/investors services group, and an oil and gas marketing group. 
 The company maintains exploration offices in Amarillo, Texas, Midland, Texas and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The Amarillo office is involved in exploration and developmental activities in the Northeastern Texas Panhandle. The Midland office is involved in exploration and developmental activities for the West Texas and Southeastern New Mexico areas, while the Oklahoma City office provides the same functions for the Western Oklahoma area. The staff at these three offices is composed primarily of geologists and land management. 
 The company has operation offices in Perryton and Midland, Texas, Hobbs, New Mexico and Woodward, Oklahoma. The Perryton, Texas office is responsible for operations in the Northeastern Texas Panhandle; the Midland, Texas office is responsible for operations in West Texas; the Hobbs, New Mexico office is responsible for operations in Southeastern New Mexico; the Woodward Oklahoma office is responsible for operations in Western Oklahoma. These district offices are involved in drilling, completion and production of oil and gas wells. The staff at each of these offices is typically composed of supervisory, engineering and operations personnel involved in the drilling, completion and production of these wells. Wellsite geologists also work out of these operations offices. 
 A key determinant of Mewbourne Oil Company's success is the quality and dedication of its employees. Mewbourne Oil has been able to attract and retain qualified, loyal personnel, in part, because it conducts a significant operation in all aspects of the exploration and production business with minimal employee redundancies, organizational complexities, etc. As a result, individuals have meaningful responsibilities and are able to see directly their respective contributions to the enterprise.

About Us



Established in 1965, Mewbourne Oil Company has grown into one of the more prominent independent oil and natural gas producers in the Anadarko and Permian Basins of Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico. The company's success over the years can be attributed to a conservative approach to the business and a philosophy of managing all phases of operations from "prospect to pipeline."
From the Company's headquarters in Tyler, Texas, and with its three exploration offices located in Amarillo and Midland, Texas, and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, along with four operation offices located in Perryton and Midland, Texas, Woodward, Oklahoma, and Hobbs, New Mexico, Mewbourne Oil Company develops oil and natural gas prospects, acquires leasehold interests, and serves as the operator in the drilling, completion and production of oil and natural gas wells. The company has focused its efforts on two of this country's most prolific producing regions, the Anadarko and Permian Basins. The Anadarko and Permian Basins have produced more than 42 billion barrels of oil and 220 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and contain many of the largest oil and natural gas fields in the United States.
With over 50 years of experience operating in the Anadarko and Permian Basins, the Company has developed an organization with extensive knowledge of the operations and opportunities which exist in these two producing areas. The long history of oil and natural gas drilling in these basins has provided an abundance of valuable historical data. Mewbourne's professionals are adept at utilizing this data to secure leasehold rights, evaluate potential drill sites and assess operations
Historically, the Company has emphasized establishing long-life natural gas and oil reserves through the drilling of medium-depth vertical and horizontal wells between 3,000 and 20,000 feet deep. Prospective drill sites generally include field extensions, step-outs, trend plays and other anomalies that are believed to be contiguous to areas where the presence of oil and natural gas has already been established. The company currently operates over 2,100 wells.

Description of
Business




Mewbourne
Energy Partners 04-A, L.P. (the “Registrant” or the
“Partnership”), a Delaware limited partnership, is
engaged primarily in oil and gas development and production in
Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico, and was organized on
January 27, 2004. The offering of limited and general
partnership interests began June 10, 2004 as a part of an
offering registered under the name Mewbourne Energy Partners 04-05
Drilling Program, (the “Program”), and concluded
August 20, 2004, with total investor contributions of
$30,000,000 originally being sold to 1,118 subscribers of which
$27,235,000 were sold to 1,022 subscribers as general partner
interests and $2,765,000 were sold to 96 subscribers as limited
partner interests. During 2006, all general partner equity
interests were converted to limited partner equity interests. In
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, Mewbourne
Development Corporation (“MD”), a Delaware Corporation,
has been appointed as the Partnership’s managing general
partner. MD has no significant equity interest in the
Partnership.

 




2.



Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies




Reference is
hereby made to the Registrant’s Annual Report on Form 10-K
for 2009, which contains a summary of significant accounting
policies followed by the Partnership in the preparation of its
financial statements. These policies are also followed in preparing
the quarterly report included herein.

In
the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited financial
statements contain all adjustments of a normal recurring nature
necessary to present fairly our financial position, results of
operations, cash flows and partners’ capital for the periods
presented. The results of operations for the interim periods are
not necessarily indicative of the final results expected for the
full year.

New Accounting
Pronouncements

In
February 2010, FASB issued authoritative guidance which requires
additional information to be disclosed principally in respect of
Level 3 fair value measurements and transfers to and from Level 1
and Level 2 measurements. In addition, enhanced disclosure is
required concerning inputs and valuation techniques used to
determine Level 2 and Level 3 fair value measurements. The guidance
is generally effective for interim and annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2009; however, the requirements
to disclose separately purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements
in the Level 3 reconciliation are effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2010 (and for interim periods
within such years). Early adoption is allowed. The Partnership does
not anticipate any effect from this on its financial position or
results of operations.

In
January 2010, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU)
2010-03, “Oil and Gas Reserve Estimation and
Disclosures” to provide consistency with the new SEC rules.
The ASU amends existing standards to align the reserves calculation
and disclosure requirements under US GAAP with the
requirements in the SEC rules. The Partnership adopted the new
standards effective December 31, 2009. The new standards are
applied prospectively as a change in estimate.

Accounting for
Oil and Gas Producing Activities




The
Partnership follows the full-cost method of accounting for its oil
and gas activities. Under the full-cost method, all productive and
non-productive costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and
development of oil and gas properties are capitalized.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties
subject to amortization is computed on the units-of-production
method based on the proved reserves underlying the oil and gas
properties. At March 31, 2010 and 2009, all capitalized costs
were subject to amortization. Proceeds from the sale or other
disposition of properties are credited to the full cost pool. Gains
and losses on the sale or other disposition of properties are not
recognized unless such adjustments would significantly alter the
relationship between capitalized costs and the proved oil and gas
reserves. Capitalized costs are subject to a quarterly ceiling test
that limits such costs to the aggregate of the present value of
future net cash flows of proved reserves and the lower of cost or
fair value of unproved properties. There was no cost ceiling
write-down at March 31, 2010, whereas at March 31, 2010
there was a $4,737,908 cost ceiling write-down.

In
January 2009, the SEC issued revisions to the natural gas and oil
reporting disclosures, “Modernization of Oil and Gas
Reporting, Final Rule” (the “Final Rule”). In
January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) updated its oil and gas estimation and
disclosure requirements to align its requirements with the
SEC’s modernized oil and gas reporting rules. The update
amends the definition of proved reserves to use the average of
first-day-of-the-month prices during the twelve months preceding
the end of the reporting period, adds definitions used in
estimating and disclosing proved oil and natural gas quantities and
expands the disclosures required for equity-method investments. The
update must be applied prospectively as a change in accounting
principle that is inseparable from a change in accounting estimate
and is effective for entities with annual reporting periods ending
on or after December 31, 2009. The Partnership adopted the new
standards effective December 31, 2009.

Asset
Retirement Obligations




The
Partnership has recognized an estimated liability for future
plugging and abandonment costs. The estimated liability is based on
historical experience and estimated well life. The liability is
discounted using the credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Revisions to
the liability could occur due to changes in well ownership
interests or well plugging and abandonment costs, or if federal or
state regulators enact new well restoration requirements. The
Partnership recognizes accretion expense in connection with the
discounted liability over the remaining life of the
well.

A
reconciliation of the Partnership’s liability for well
plugging and abandonment costs for the three months ended
March 31, 2010 and the year ended December 31, 2009 is as
follows:

Related Party
Transactions




In
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, Mewbourne
Development Corporation (“MD”), a Delaware Corporation,
has been appointed as the Partnership’s managing general
partner. MD has no significant equity interest in the Partnership.
Mewbourne Oil Company (“MOC”) is operator of oil and
gas properties owned by the Partnership. Mewbourne Holdings, Inc.
is the parent of both MD and MOC. Substantially all transactions
are with MD and MOC.

In
the ordinary course of business, MOC will incur certain costs that
will be passed on to owners of the well for which the costs were
incurred. The Partnership will receive their portion of these costs
based upon their ownership in each well incurring the costs. These
costs are referred to as operator charges and are standard and
customary in the oil and gas industry. Operator charges include
recovery of gas marketing costs, fixed rate overhead, supervision,
pumping, and equipment furnished by the operator, some of which
will be included in the full cost pool pursuant to Rule 4-10(c)(2)
of Regulation S-X. Services and operator charges are billed in
accordance with the program and partnership agreements.

Table of
Contents

In
general, during any particular calendar year the total amount of
administrative expenses allocated to the Partnership by MOC shall
not exceed the greater of (a) 3.5% of the Partnership’s
gross revenue from the sale of oil and natural gas production
during each year (calculated without any deduction for operating
costs or other costs and expenses) or (b) the sum of $50,000
plus .25% of the capital contributions of limited and general
partners.

The
Partnership participates in oil and gas activities through a
Drilling Program Agreement (the “Program”). The
Partnership and MD are parties to the Program. The costs and
revenues of the Program are allocated to MD and the Partnership as
