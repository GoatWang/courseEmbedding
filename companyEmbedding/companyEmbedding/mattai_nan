Executive Profiles









Learn how encouragement from family and self-determination helped Nan Mattai achieve a top engineering position in a male-dominated industry.

The sounds of six siblings scampering around the modest home in Guyana, South America, where Nan Mattai was raised, are all but a distant memory. Still, the lessons learned within this middle class family left a lasting impression on the woman who now holds the most senior engineering position at Rockwell Collins.
A self-described perfectionist with a fierce, competitive nature, Mattai discovered the art of negotiation at an early age. A girl who was raised between four boys, she also quickly learned the importance of compromising and remaining flexible. Little did she realize at the time that those skills would help launch a career that has become more successful than she ever imagined.
“I believe in many ways that my childhood truly helped shape who I am today,” said Mattai. “I also believe I’m a little bit of both of my parents. I get the hard work ethic from my dad, and I get the perfectionist part of my personality from my mom.”

Identifying a science heroConstantly following in the footsteps of her older brother – who was enthralled with math and science – Mattai began formulating her career plans during her high school physics class.
But the accomplishments of Madame Marie Curie – who is best known as the discoverer of the radioactive elements polonium and radium, and the first person to win two Nobel prizes – is what really captured her attention. From that point on, she set her sights on becoming a research scientist. 
Due to the lack of sophisticated science laboratories in the all-girls high school she attended, Mattai found herself spending a great deal of time studying with her male counterparts at a nearby all-boys school. 
That’s where she met and fell in love with Roy Mattai, a man who shared her passion for math and science and – not long after high school – also began sharing her life.
“It turned out that Roy’s family lived about half-a-mile from where I grew up,” recalled Mattai. “I knew his parents and all of his brothers and sisters. I think the fact that I’ve known him for all of these years has helped us form a bond that is very strong and very deep.”

Journey to the MidwestIn the late 1970s, with a Bachelor of Science degree in math and physics from the University of Guyana in hand, Mattai and her husband relocated to Canada, where both enrolled in graduate programs at the University of Windsor. There, she completed her Master of Science degree in physics and began pursuing her Ph.D.
By the time the 1980s rolled around, the couple had obtained United States residency. They eventually found themselves, along with their two young sons, in Torrance, Calif., where Mattai began teaching at El Camino College.  
Not long after that, she decided to make a career switch.
“At the time, there were tons of jobs for software engineers in California, and I had developed good computer skills while doing my graduate work,” she recalled. “Roy was convinced that this was an area I would do well in.”
As it turned out, her husband was correct. Mattai accepted her first full-time engineering position in 1984 as an entry-level software programmer with Magnavox, West Coast. Her primary responsibility at the time was designing software for global positioning system (GPS) receivers.

The ascent beginsOver the next nine years, Mattai received five promotions at Magnavox, which is where she acquired many of her domain skills in GPS and satellite communications. She left the company as a principal software engineer in 1993, when she and her husband decided to move to the Midwest to be near his family, who had emigrated and settled near Joliet, Ill.
“We started looking at job opportunities within four hours of Joliet,” recalled Mattai. “Both of our skill sets lined up pretty well with what Rockwell Collins was doing, and the rest is history.”
In August of 1993, Nan Mattai joined Rockwell Collins as a software engineer, performing design and development for radio-based communication systems for the U.S. military. From there, her skill, intellect and ability to look at the big picture led to positions of increasing leadership, culminating in the one she holds today – senior vice president of Engineering & Technology.

‘Pioneer’ finds balanceWhile finding a work-life balance has not always been easy, Mattai has managed to find a happy medium with the support of her family, and by always thinking and planning for the weeks and months ahead. 
Outside of work, she enjoys cooking, reading, exercising and spending time with her husband. When possible, she and Roy visit their sons, who are now both married and living on the East Coast. Andy is a physician and lives with his wife, Cheryl, in Maryland. Son, Neil, is a pharmacist and lives in New York with his wife, Chand. 
When Mattai looks ahead to her retirement years, she wants to travel with her husband to the Far East. She also hopes to volunteer in local schools to promote the importance of math and science, and she would like to join her husband in his mission to assist underprivileged children in Guyana.
But no matter where she ends up when her retirement begins, she would like her colleagues at Rockwell Collins and throughout the aerospace and defense industry to remember her as a pioneer for women in engineering.
“I want people to use me as an example of how it’s possible to break through the glass ceiling, and be a successful female leader in a profession traditionally dominated by males,” said Mattai. “As a first generation immigrant to this country, I never imagined I’d be in the type of position that I am currently in. I think I’m a true testament that no matter what the challenges, you can overcome them and achieve your dreams.”
