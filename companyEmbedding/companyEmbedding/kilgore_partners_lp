the Regulations.

of the Partners and carrying values of all the Partnership’s
property may, in the General Partner’s discretion, be
adjusted to reflect the fair market value of the Partnership

ARTICLE 4 - ALLOCATIONS AND
DISTRIBUTIONS
 

4.1                               
Allocation of Profits and
Losses between the Partners . After giving effect to the
 
special allocations contained in paragraph 4.2
and any others required to be made by the Code or the Regulations,
profits and losses for each taxable year shall be allocated among
the Partners in proportion to their Partnership Interests, as set
forth in paragraph 3.2.
 

4.2. Special
Allocations . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, the following special allocations shall be made
if the circumstances require.
 

4.2.1. Qualified Income
Offset . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, if a Partner unexpectedly receives any
adjustments, allocations, or distributions described in
Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), (5), or (6) of the
Regulations or any amendment thereto, or receives an allocation of
loss which produces a negative capital account for any Partner
while any other Partner has a positive capital account, then items
of Partnership income, including gross income, shall be specially
allocated to such Partner to the extent necessary to eliminate any
capital
 
9 





 
account deficit. This paragraph is intended to
constitute a “qualified income offset” within the
meaning Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) of the Regulations.
 

4.2.2. Minimum Gain
Chargeback . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, if there is a net decrease in Partnership
“minimum gain,” as defined in Sections
1.704-2(b)(2) and 1.704-2(d) of the Regulations, during a
taxable year, each Partner shall be specially allocated, before any
other allocation, items of income and gain for such taxable year
(and, if necessary, subsequent years) in proportion to each
Partner’s share of the net decrease in Partnership
“minimum gain.” This paragraph is intended to comply
with the “minimum gain chargeback” provisions of
Section 1.704-(2)(f) of the Regulations.
 

4.2.3.
Section 704(c) Allocation
. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, items of income, gain, loss, and deduction with
respect to property contributed to the Partnership’s capital
will be allocated between the Partners so as to take into account
any variation between book value and basis, to the extent and in
the manner prescribed by Section 704(c) of the Code and
related Regulations.
 

4.2.4. Partner Nonrecourse
Deductions . Items of the Partnership’s loss,
deductions, and expenditures described in
Section 705(a)(2)(B) of the Code that are attributable to
the Partnership’s nonrecourse debt and are characterized as
Partner nonrecourse deductions under
Section 1.704-2(i) of the Regulations will be allocated
to the Partners’ capital accounts in accordance with
Section 1.704-2(i) of the Regulations.
 

4.2.5. Adjustments for Special
Allocations . If
the special allocations result in capital account balances that are
different from the capital account balances the Partners would have
had if the special allocations were not required, the Partnership
will allocate other items of income, gain, loss, and deduction in
any manner it considers appropriate to offset the effects of the
special allocations on the Partners’ capital account
balances. Any offsetting allocation required by this paragraph is
subject to and must be consistent with the special
allocations.
 

4.3. Tax
Allocations . For
federal income tax purposes, unless the Code or Regulations require
otherwise, each item of the Partnership’s income, gain, loss,
or deduction will be allocated to the Partners in proportion to
their allocations of the Partnership’s Profit or
Loss.
 

4.4. Distribution of Available
Funds .
The Partnership may distribute its
Available Funds to the Partners at such intervals as the General
Partner determines. All distributions of Available Funds will be
allocated between the Partners in proportion to their Partnership
Interests.
 

4.5. Substantial Economic
Effect . The
various provisions of this article are intended and will be
construed to ensure that the allocations of the Partnership’s
income, gain, losses, deductions, and credits have substantial
economic effect under the Regulations promulgated under
Section 704(b) of the Code.
