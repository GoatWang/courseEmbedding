At KKR we are particularly proud of our global, integrated approach. We operate as one firm, leveraging all of our businesses and partnering across the firm on behalf of our fund investors and the companies in which we invest. KKR’s Private Equity platform invests in and partners with industry-leading franchises and companies poised for significant improvement or growth that attract high-quality management teams. Moreover, we are disciplined investors, focusing on long-term business fundamentals.
Working Together
We look to partner closely and cooperatively with management teams and entrepreneurs that have track records of success. We believe that the combination of our industry knowledge, investment experience, and operational expertise provides KKR with an edge in identifying and creating value in investment opportunities. Our strategy is not only to work as partners with the management of our portfolio companies, but also to assist in the operations of our businesses and leverage all of the resources of our global platform.
Ways We Invest
In addition to traditional management buyouts and build-ups, the business seeks to find opportunities to provide growth capital, as well as minority investments, and public toe hold investments where we can partner with public companies and leverage our industry expertise and operational capabilities.
Our Experience
Throughout our history, we have consistently been a leader in the private equity industry, having completed more than 280 private equity investments in portfolio companies with approximately $542 billion of total entreprise value as of March 31, 2017.
On March 6, 2017, we announced the closing of our latest Americas Private Equity fund, KKR Americas XII Fund, a $13.9 billion fund focused on opportunistic investments in private equity-related transactions primarily in the United States, Canada and Mexico. More information can be found here.


On June 1, 2017, we announced the closing of our latest Asia Private Equity fund, KKR Asian Fund III, a $9.3 billion fund focused on investments in private equity transactions across the Asia Pacific region. More information can be found here.

	INTRODUCTION





	 




	This Amendment No. 4 (this Final Amendment) to the Rule 13e-3 Transaction Statement on Schedule 13E-3, together with the exhibits hereto (this Transaction Statement), is being filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) by (a) KKR Financial Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (KFN), the issuer of the KFN common shares that are the subject of the Rule 13e-3 transaction; (b) KKR & Co. L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (KKR); (c) KKR Fund Holdings L.P., an exempted limited partnership formed under the laws of the Cayman Islands (Fund Holdings); (d) KKR Group Holdings L.P., an exempted limited partnership formed under the laws of the Cayman Islands; (e) KKR Fund Holdings GP Limited, an exempted company formed under the laws of the Cayman Islands; (f) KKR Group Limited, an exempted company formed under the laws of the Cayman Islands; and (g) KKR Management LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (collectively, the Filing Persons), in connection with the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated December 16, 2013, by and among KKR, Fund Holdings, Copal Merger Sub LLC (Merger Sub) and KFN (the Merger Agreement).




	 




	This Final Amendment is being filed pursuant to Rule 13e-3(d)(3) to report the results of the transaction that is the subject of this Transaction Statement.




	 




	2














	 





	Item 15.         Additional Information





	(Regulation M-A Item 1011)






	 




	(c)          

	Other Material Information.

	Item 15(c) is hereby amended and supplemented as follows:




	 




	On April 30, 2014, at a special meeting of KFNs common shareholders, the holders of a majority of the outstanding KFN common shares entitled to vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement, including a majority of the outstanding KFN common shares entitled to vote on the Merger Agreement held by common shareholders other than KKR and its affiliates, affirmatively voted to adopt the Merger Agreement.




	 




	On April 30, 2014, a Certificate of Merger was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, pursuant to which Merger Sub was merged with and into KFN, with KFN continuing as the surviving entity and an indirect subsidiary of KKR (the Merger). At the effective time of the Merger, each KFN common share that was outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (excluding any KFN common shares held by KKR Fund Holdings or any of its subsidiaries or KFN or any of its wholly-owned subsidiaries) was converted into the right to receive 0.51 KKR common units, together with cash in lieu of fractional units.




	 




	As a result of the Merger, KFN common shares will cease trading on the New York Stock Exchange and became eligible for termination of registration under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Accordingly, KFN will file a Certification and Notice of Termination of Registration on Form 15 with the SEC in order to deregister its common shares under the Exchange Act.

all Profits allocated to such Partner pursuant to Section 5.04 and
any items of income or gain which are specially allocated pursuant
to Section 5.05; and shall be debited with all Losses allocated to
such Partner pursuant to Section 5.04, any items of loss or
