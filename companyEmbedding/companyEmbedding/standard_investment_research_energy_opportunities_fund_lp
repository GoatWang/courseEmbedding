Avenue is one of a handful of hedge funds that have seized on the sharp drop in oil prices to start new portfolios, convinced that there are strong companies that have been oversold. The Avenue Energy Opportunities Fund L.P. plans to invest in distressed and stressed companies in the energy and utilities sector in North America, the source said.  At the same time, the firm - run by brother and sister team Marc Lasry and Sonia Gardner - plans to shut down a $500 million hedge fund portfolio, Avenue International, where investors can withdraw their money on a quarterly basis. The fund, launched in July 1997, makes up less than 5 percent of the firm's total assets. It has returned an average net 7.35 percent per year but lost 0.42 percent in 2014. Avenue has roughly $2 billion in very liquid funds, including mutual funds, and roughly $11 billion in portfolios that are locked up as long as five years. A spokesman for the firm declined to comment.

Research & Development: The Science of Innovation
Economic vitality and social well-being depend upon affordable, safe and reliable energy. In today's world, the energy we use and the ways we use it are changing. For California to make the leap from the status quo to achieving climate and energy goals at the lowest possible cost, we need much more energy innovation. Rigorous, public and impartial research and development  (R&D) investments strategically diversify California's energy portfolio and move innovations through the pipeline from concept to market. Energy Commission R&D innovations advance the frontiers of science and technology to make California's energy safer, more reliable and less costly.
Explore projects in our Energy Innovation Showcase
An overview of what we do and why it matters
Energy Commission R&D Programs
The Energy Commission administers several R&D programs that drive innovation and advance science and technology in the fields of energy efficiency, renewable energy and advanced clean generation, energy-related environmental protection, energy transmission and distribution, and transportation. The new Electric Program Investment Charge (EPIC) program invests in improvements to the state's electricity systems. The Natural Gas Research, Development and Demonstration program invests in improvements to California's natural gas systems. The Public Interest Energy Research (PIER) Electric program will no longer fund new R&D though existing projects will continue through 2015.
EPIC: California's Investment in the 21st Century Electric Grid
EPIC is a new R&D program that replaces the ended Public Goods Charge's R&D program funding.  The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) created EPIC, selected the Energy Commission as one of the four administrators of EPIC funds, and approved the first triennial investment plans for EPIC expenditures on November 14, 2013.   The three other administrators are Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E), Southern California Edison (SCE), and San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E).  EPIC will fund innovative technologies, tools and approaches that provide benefits to electric ratepayers in PG&E, SCE, and SDG&E service territories through greater reliability, lower costs, increased safety, and enhanced environmental sustainability.  Providing benefits to these ratepayers is the primary goal because EPIC funds come from them.
EPIC is the most comprehensive statewide approach to creating new energy solutions, fostering regional innovation and bringing ideas to the marketplace. EPIC consolidates the R&D initiatives of the three largest investor-owned utility service areas into an aggregate program, which ensures no duplication in spending and also implements compliance with state energy policies. Under this program, Energy Commission electricity R&D will move energy technologies and products from the lab to life, make our electricity system safer and more reliable, lower costs and give ratepayers choices and control.  Find more information about the creation of EPIC. Read our first Triennial Investment Plan.
			 
A schedule of future planned funding opportunities for this program is available. 
The Vision for the Future
A vision for 2020 and beyond underlies the Energy Commission's investments of EPIC funds. The vision aligns proposed research, demonstration and deployment activities with the state's energy policies and aligns with major elements of California's investor-owned utilities' plans.
Energy Commission R&D under EPIC will help further advancements including:

A modern, flexible, technologically advanced electricity grid that is safer, is more reliable and gives ratepayers the ability to better control energy use
Highly efficient and zero-net-energy buildings with energy systems that are integrated with advanced communications capabilities
A better consumer energy experience built around choice made possible by better visualization tools, sophisticated and customer-friendly control options and seamless integration of renewables at customers' homes and businesses
A cleaner energy generation process using more diverse fuel sources and reduced environmental impacts
A transportation system that increasingly uses electricity and has a pathway to enable 1.5 million plug-in electric vehicles by 2025 and make electric vehicles more cost-effective and environmentally friendly for California consumers

The Energy R&D Division
The California Energy Commission's Energy R&D Division is composed of engineers, scientists and administrative and management professionals who collectively lead California's public interest energy research programs. The division collaborates with utilities, businesses, agencies, and local governments to create an action-oriented nexus for energy improvements. The division shares results of research publicly, invests in California and continually works to strengthen the innovation pipeline that brings research from the lab to life.

Note: the EPIC Ideas Exchange Docket is for information only.  All comments and suggestions posted are publicly accessible. We will review and consider all comments but will not respond to them individually.
Commitment to Diversity
The Energy Commission adopted a resolution strengthening its commitment to diversity in our funding programs. We continue to encourage disadvantaged and underrepresented  businesses and communities to engage in and benefit from our many programs. To meet this commitment, Energy Commission staff conducts outreach efforts and activities to:

Engage with disadvantaged and underrepresented groups throughout the state.
Notify potential new applicants about the Energy Commission's funding opportunities.
Assist applicants in understanding how to apply for funding from the Energy Commission's programs.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.

Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Data quoted is past performance and current performance may be lower or higher. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate, and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.Risk Factors: The value of the Fund's shares will change, and you could lose money on your investment. An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Investing in companies involved in one specified sector may be more risky and volatile than an investment with greater diversification. Investing in the energy sector can be riskier than other types of investment activities because of a range of factors, including price fluctuation caused by real and perceived inflationary trends and political developments, and the cost assumed by energy companies in complying with environmental safety regulations. These and other risks are more fully describe in the fund's prospectus. Not all funds or fund classes may be offered at all broker/ dealers.Index Description: S&P 1500 Energy Sector is an unmanaged index comprised of securities that represent the energy sector of the stock market. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.Performance results for some funds may include the effect of expense reduction arrangements. If those arrangements had not been in place, the performance results would have been lower.High recent returns are attributable, in part, to unusually favorable market conditions and may not be repeated or consistently achieved in the future.Fee Waiver and/or Expense Reimbursement: Through April 30, 2018, Ivy Investment Management Company (IICO), the Portfolio’s investment manager, Ivy Distributors, Inc. (IDI), the Portfolio’s distributor, and / or Waddell & Reed Services Company, doing business as WI Services Company (WISC), the Portfolio’s transfer agent, have contractually agreed to reimburse sufficient management fees, 12b-1 fees and / or shareholder servicing fees to cap the total annual ordinary portfolio operating expenses at 1.13%. Prior to that date, the expense limitation may not be terminated by WRIMCO, Waddell & Reed, WISC or the Board of Trustees.Pricing: All prices and year-to-date returns are based on closing quotes unless noted, as supplied to the NASDAQ by 6:00 p.m. Eastern time. YTD Prices can be updated 3 to 4 hours after the Daily Pricing information which can result in mismatching data.Style Analysis: The Morningstar Style Box reveals a fund's investment style. For equity funds the vertical axis shows the market capitalization of the stocks owned and the horizontal axis shows investment style (value, blend, or growth). For fixed-income funds, the vertical axis shows the credit quality of the bonds owned and the horizontal axis shows interest rate sensitivity as measured by a bond's effective duration. Morningstar seeks credit rating information from fund companies on a periodic basis (e.g., quarterly). In compiling credit rating information, Morningstar instructs fund companies to only use ratings that have been assigned by the following Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSROs): Moody's, Standard & Poor's, Fitch, and Egan-Jones. If two NRSROs have rated a security, fund companies are to report the lowest rating; if three or more NRSROs have rated the same security differently, fund companies are to report the rating that is in the middle. For example, if NRSRO X rates a security AA-, NRSRO Y rates the same security an A and NRSRO Z rates it a BBB+, the fund company should use the credit rating of 'A' in its reporting to Morningstar. PLEASE NOTE: Morningstar, Inc. is not itself an NRSRO nor does it issue a credit rating on the fund. An NRSRO rating on a fixed-income security can change from time-to-time. For credit quality, Morningstar combines the credit rating information provided by the fund companies with an average default rate calculation to come up with a weighted-average credit quality. The weighted-average credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a leading NRSRO. Bond funds are assigned a style box placement of "low", "medium", or "high" based on their average credit quality. Funds with a low credit quality are those whose weighted-average credit quality is determined to be less than "BBB-"; medium are those less than "AA-", but greater or equal to "BBB-"; and high are those with a weighted-average credit quality of "AA-" or higher. When classifying a bond portfolio, Morningstar first maps the NRSRO credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates (as determined by Morningstar's analysis of actual historical default rates). Morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund. Finally, Morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve. For interest-rate sensitivity, Morningstar obtains from fund companies the average effective duration. Generally, Morningstar classifies a fixed-income fund's interest-rate sensitivity based on the effective duration of the Morningstar Core Bond Index (MCBI), which is currently three years. The classification of Limited will be assigned to those funds whose average effective duration is between 25% to 75% of MCBI's average effective duration; funds whose average effective duration is between 75% to 125% of the MCBI will be classified as Moderate; and those that are at 125% or greater of the average effective duration of the MCBI will be classified as Extensive. For municipal bond funds, Morningstar also obtains from fund companies the average effective duration. In these cases static breakpoints are utilized. These breakpoints are as follows: (i) Limited: 4.5 years or less; (ii) Moderate: more than 4.5 years but less than 7 years; and (iii) Extensive: more than 7 years. In addition, for non-US taxable and non-US domiciled fixed income funds static duration breakpoints are used: (i) Limited: less than or equal to 3.5 years; (ii) Moderate: greater than 3.5 and less than equal to 6 years; (iii) Extensive: greater than 6 years.Unsubsidized yields reflect what the yield would have been without the effect of reimbursements and waivers. The adviser and its affiliates have or may voluntarily waive a portion of their fees (including, but not limited to, distribution and service (12b-1) fees) and reimburse certain expenses. There is no guarantee that the fund will avoid a negative yield. Such undertaking may be amended or withdrawn at any time. 12-Month Trailing Distribution Yield: at NAV refers to the 12-month historical cash flow paid over the past 12 months in dividends, divided by the past months ending NAV. Alpha, Beta, R-Squared, Standard Deviation, Sharpe Ratio and Capture Ratio are 5 year statistics. Alpha is a measure of a fund's actual returns and expected performance, given its level of risk (as measured by beta). Beta reflects the sensitivity of the fund's return to fluctuations in the market index. R-squared indicates how much of a fund's fluctuations were attributable to movements in the fund's benchmark. Standard deviation is a measure of how volatile a fund's returns are. Sharpe ratio is a measure of a fund's risk-adjusted performance. Capture ratio reflects the annualized product of fund vs. index returns for all months in which the index had a positive return (upside capture) or negative return (downside capture).The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance, and does not include the effects of sales charges. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.  © 2017 Morningstar, Inc.
