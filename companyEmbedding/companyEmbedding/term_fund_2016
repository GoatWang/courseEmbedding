10 Best Funds for Monthly Income









Kevin Baker




Dec 2, 2011 3:16 PM EST













 


























































 NEW YORK ( TheStreet Ratings) -- TheStreet Ratings reviews the risk-adjusted return performance of around 25,000 funds every month. Answering the call for monthly income, some open-end bond funds generate a nice monthly income stream while maintaining a high ranking in our risk-adjusted return ratings. For savers seeking monthly income, this makes them worthy of consideration for 2012 portfolios. Our list of the 10 Best Equity-Income Funds for 2012 is a good starting place for equity investors seeking income. However, investors with a less risk tolerance may prefer to produce income from bond funds. The 10 funds listed below are among the highest rated fixed-income funds generating a healthy level of monthly income and keeping expenses low.              Here are the 10 best fixed-income funds for monthly:    -----------------------------  10. Loomis Sayles Investment Grade Bond Fund   Loomis Sayles Investment Grade Bond Fund  ( LSIGX) seeks above average total investment return through a combination of current income and capital appreciation.

Expense Ratio: 0.55%  Load: 0.00%  Dividend Yield: 4.12%  Rated "A+" by TheStreet Ratings:    -----------------------------  How We Rate Funds  TheStreet Ratings condenses the available fund performance and risk data, including penalties for load charges, into a single composite opinion of each fund's risk-adjusted performance. This allows the unbiased identification of those funds that have historically done well and those that have underperformed the market. While there is no guarantee of future performance, these investment ratings provide a solid framework for making informed, timely investment decisions. In order to qualify for a rating, an open-end fund must either have three years of risk and return data or be an additional share class of an existing fund with at least three years of performance statistics.  Funds rated "A" or "B" are considered "Buy" based on a track record of higher than average risk-adjusted performance. Funds at the "C" level are rated as "Hold," while underperformers at the "D" and "E" levels our model ranks as "Sell."  -- -- Written by Kevin Baker in Jupiter, Fla.

Ratings are based on S&P, Moody's or Fitch, as applicable. A credit rating is an assessment provided by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) of the creditworthiness of an issuer with respect to debt obligations, including specific securities, money market instruments or other debts. Ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA (highest) to D (lowest); ratings are subject to change without notice. NR indicates the debtor was not rated, and should not be interpreted as indicating low quality. If securities are rated differently by the rating agencies, the higher rating is applied. Credit ratings are based largely on the rating agency's investment analysis at the time of rating and the rating assigned to any particular security is not necessarily a reflection of the issuer's current financial condition. The rating assigned to a security by a rating agency does not necessarily reflect its assessment of the volatility of a security's market value or of the liquidity of an investment in the security. For more information on the rating methodology, please visit the following NRSRO websites: www.standardandpoors.com and select 'Understanding Ratings' under Rating Resources on the homepage; www.moodys.com and select 'Rating Methodologies' under Research and Ratings on the homepage; www.fitchratings.com and select 'Ratings Definitions' on the homepage.

Â Risk & Other Considerations
			 


				Fund characteristics are subject to change daily. Provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the securities mentioned or securities in the sectors shown above. Credit quality and credit allocation are shown as a percentage of total net assets. Sectors are shown as a percentage of long-term investments. Securities are classified by sectors that represent broad groupings of related industries. Credit quality allocations based upon ratings as issued by Standard and Poor's and Moody's, respectively.

This data is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended for trading or selling purposes. Closed end funds, unlike open end funds, are not continuously offered. There is a one time public offering and once issued, shares of closed end funds are sold in the open market.

There is no assurance that a closed end fund will achieve its investment objective. Like any stock, a closed end fund's share price will fluctuate with market conditions and other factors. At the time of sale, your shares may have a market price that is above or below net asset value, and may be worth more or less than your original investment. Accordingly, it is possible to lose money investing in the Trust.

As the Fund approaches its Termination Date, the Fund may earn interest income at a more modest rate. As a result, the Fund's distributions during the wind-down period of approximately three to twelve months preceding the Termination Date may consist, in whole or in part, of a return of capital. 

CMBS differ from conventional debt securities because principal is paid back over the life of the security rather than at maturity. CMBS are subject to prepayment or call risk, which is the risk that a borrowerâs payments may be received earlier than expected due to changes in prepayment rates on underlying loans. An unexpectedly high rate of defaults on the mortgages held by a mortgage pool will adversely affect the value of CMBS and will result in losses to the Fund. 

Junk bonds involve a greater risk of default or price changes due to changes in the issuerâs credit quality. The values of junk bonds fluctuate more than those of high quality bonds and can decline significantly over short time periods. 

Because the assets of the Fund will be liquidated in connection with its termination, the Fund may be required to sell portfolio securities when
it otherwise would not, including at times when market conditions are not favorable, or at a time when a particular security is in default or bankruptcy, or otherwise in severe distress, which may cause the Fund to lose money. 

The Fundâs anticipated use of leverage by issuing Preferred Shares and other senior debt securities creates special risks for Common Shareholders, including potential interest rate risks and the likelihood of greater volatility of NAV and market price of, and distributions on, the Common Shares.

StyleboxThe stylebox gives information about a fundâs investment style in visual form.For equity funds, a styleboxâs rows and columns indicate market capitalization (small, mid, large) and investment style (value, blend, growth); for fixed income funds, its rows and columns indicate credit quality and/or duration (short, medium, long).Two important things about a fund are shown in its stylebox:Central tendency. The fundâs central tendency reflects the aggregate characteristics resulting from the fundâs approach to security selection. Because it is based on an analysis of the performance characteristics of the fundâs potential holdings over long periods, the central tendency is expected to be relatively stable. In the stylebox, it is shown as a dot within the shaded oval.Expected range. Within the fundâs universe of potential holdings, and depending on the fundâs investment approach, some categories of investments will be owned more frequently; together, they are known as the expected range. In the stylebox, the expected range of frequently owned categories is represented by a shaded oval.Note: Styleboxes for  fixed income funds uses duration rather than average weighted maturity. Duration is a more accurate measure of interest rate sensitivity because it takes into consideration all mortgage prepayments, puts, and adjustable coupons.

NAVFor funds with a fluctuating price per share, the net asset value (NAV) is the market value of a mutual fund's total assets, minus liabilities, divided by the number of shares outstanding. The value of a single share is called its share value or share price.For money market funds that seek to maintain a stable price per share, the NAV is calculated by valuing securities at amortized cost, which approximates market value.

SEC yield
A non-money market fund's SEC yield is based on a formula mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that calculates a fund's hypothetical annualized income, as a percentage of its assets. A security's income, for the purposes of this calculation, is based on the current market yield to maturity (in the case of bonds) or projected dividend yield (for stocks) of the fund's holdings over a trailing 30 day period. This hypothetical income will differ (at times, significantly) from the fund's actual experience; as a result, income distributions from the fund may be higher or lower than implied by the SEC yield.The SEC yield for a money market fund is calculated by annualizing its daily income distributions for the previousÂ seven days.

Fees and minimums




Purchase fee:
A fee charged by some mutual funds when an investor buys shares. This fee is not a sales charge or load because it is paid directly to the fund to offset the costs of trading certain securities.


None



Redemption fee:
A fee charged by some mutual funds when an investor sells shares. A redemption fee differs from a back-end load because the money is paid back into the fund. Many funds charge redemption fees only when shares are bought and then sold within a specific period of time, generally in an effort to discourage market-timing and short-term trading. Some brokers also charge their clients redemption fees for the sale of securities.

*Â Credit-quality ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA (highest) to D (lowest). âNRâ is used to classify securities for which a rating is not available. NR securities may include a fundâs investment in Vanguard Market Liquidity Fund or Vanguard Municipal Cash Management Fund, each of which invests in high-quality money market instruments and may serve as a cash management vehicle for the Vanguard funds, trusts, and accounts. U.S. Treasury, U.S. Agency, and U.S. Agency mortgage-backed securities appear under âU.S. Government.â Credit-quality ratings for each issue are obtained from Barclays using ratings derived from Moodyâs Investors Service (Moodyâs), Fitch Ratings (Fitch), and Standard & Poorâs (S&P). When ratings from all three agencies are available, the median rating is used. When ratings are available from two of the agencies, the lower rating is used. When one rating is available, that rating is used.

Risk and volatility are based on the share class with the earliest inception date.
Risk measures are calculated from trailing 36-month fund returns relative to the associated benchmarks.
The fund is designed for investors with a low tolerance for risk; however, the fundâs performance could be hurt by: Interest rate risk: The chance that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates. Interest rate risk should be low for the fund because it invests primarily in short-term bonds, whose prices are much less sensitive to interest rate changes than are the prices of long-term bonds.Income risk: The chance that the fundâs income will decline because of falling interest rates.Credit risk: The chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuerâs ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline. Credit risk should be low for the fund because it purchases only bonds that are of investment-grade quality.Index sampling risk: The chance that the securities selected for the fund, in the aggregate, will not provide investment performance matching that of the index. Index sampling risk for the fund should be low.

About the optionsFund share classesA fund may offer multiple share classes. The objectives, strategies, and policies for all share classes of a fund are identical. However, expense ratios vary by share class, reflecting the differing costs of providing services to the holders of each share class.Here are some of the key distinctions:Investor SharesTraditional shares for individual investors that typically feature low minimum initial investments.Admiralâ¢ SharesA lower-cost share class generally available without a minimum initial investment requirement to institutional investors and financial intermediary clients. Vanguard created Admiral Shares to recognize and encourage the cost savings stemming from large, long-standing investment accounts and to pass these savings on to the shareholders who generate them.Institutional SharesShares generally available to institutions or other investors with fund account balances of $5 million or more.Institutional Plus SharesShares generally available to institutions or other investors with fund account balances from $100 million to $200 million, depending on the fund.Institutional Select SharesShares generally available to large institutional investors. Fund account minimums range from $3 billion to $5 billion, depending on fund.ETF SharesExchange-traded shares of certain Vanguard index funds, ETF Shares combine the benefits of indexing, such as low costs and broad market diversification, with the trading and pricing flexibility of individual stocks.Vanguard ETF Shares are not redeemable with the issuing Fund other than in very large aggregations worth millions of dollars. Instead, investors must buy and sell Vanguard ETF Shares in the secondary market and hold those shares in a brokerage account. In doing so, the investor may incur brokerage commissions and may pay more than net asset value when buying and receive less than net asset value when selling.Notes:All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest.Â Â

The fundâs advisor, Vanguard Fixed Income Group, seeks to add value by making small adjustments to the fundâs maturity structure based on factors such as interest-rate outlook and slope of the yield curve.

Risk and volatility are based on the share class with the earliest inception date.
Risk measures are calculated from trailing 36-month fund returns relative to the associated benchmarks.
An investment in the fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the fundâs share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall bond market. The fundâs performance could be hurt by: Income risk: The chance that the fundâs income will decline because of falling interest rates.Interest rate risk: The chance that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates. Interest rate risk should be moderate for the fund because it invests primarily in intermediate-term bonds, whose prices are less sensitive to interest rate changes than are the prices of long-term bonds.Call risk: The chance that during periods of falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities with higher coupon rates or interest rates before their maturity dates. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bondâs call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fundâs income.Extension risk: The chance that during periods of rising interest rates, certain debt obligations will be paid off substantially more slowly than originally anticipated, and the value of those securities may fall. Extension risk is generally moderate for intermediate-term bond funds.Credit risk: The chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuerâs ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline. Credit risk should be low for the fund because it purchases only bonds that are of investment-grade quality.Liquidity risk: The chance that the fund may not be able to sell a security in a timely manner at a desired price. Liquidity risk is generally moderate for intermediate-term bond funds.Manager risk: The chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.Tax risk: The chance that all or a portion of the tax-exempt income from municipal bonds held by the fund will be declared taxable, possibly with retroactive effect, because of unfavorable changes in tax laws, adverse interpretations by the Internal Revenue Service or state or local tax authorities, or noncompliant conduct of a bond issuer.
