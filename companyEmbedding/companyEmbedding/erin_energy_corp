Prospective and Contingent Resource Disclaimer


This Competent Person’s Report contains estimates of "prospective resources" and "contingent resources." The Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") permits oil and gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose only “reserves,” as that term is defined under SEC rules.
Prospective resources are those quantities of petroleum estimated, as at a given date, to be potentially recoverable from undiscovered accumulations by application of future development projects. Contingent resources are those quantities of petroleum estimated, at a given date, to be potentially recoverable from known accumulations, but the applied projects are not yet considered mature enough for commercial development due to one or more contingencies.
Prospective resources have both an associated chance of discovery and a chance of development, while contingent resources have an associated chance of development. Investors should not assume there will be any discovery associated with prospective resources, or that any discovery or any contingent resources will be economically drillable or ever be upgraded into reserves.

Current ERN Stock Info




 


Erin Energy Corp. (ticker: ERN), a Houston-headquartered international oil producer, has assets based entirely in sub-Saharan Africa. The company operates in Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, and Gambia—from approximately 5 million acres.
Erin Energy’s Nigeria operations are offshore with a 100% working interest. The offshore production is connected to the Armada Perdana FPSO, or floating production, storage, and offloading vessel. The Aramada Perdana has a capacity of 40 MBOPD, and can store 1.1 million barrels of oil.
The company’s Ghana assets are under a 30% working interest in the expanded shallow water Tano block, where Erin Energy is currently evaluating the field’s economic potential.
Erin Energy has two licenses to operate in offshore Gambia—in an area that is 2,682 square kilometers.
The company is engaged in four production sharing contracts in Kenya, where it is evaluating the hydrocarbon potential in a 36,913 square-kilometer area.
Drilling to double production
As of July, Erin Energy announced that its drilling operations off of the Nigerian coast are expected to double the company’s production. Erin Energy will be spudding the Oyo-9 well at the end of July—which is expected to increase the field production by six to seven MBOPD.
As of the end of Q1, 2017, the company averaged a production rate of 5,500 BOPD.

Erin Energy has several prospects in its offshore Nigerian plays in addition to the Oyo prospect, such as the G Prospect, the Oyo Northwest Project, and the Ereng Prospect.
Farm-out with FAR Ltd.
In July, 2017 Erin Energy received the go-ahead from the Gambian government for a farm-out agreement with FAR Ltd., an Australian oil and gas company. Under the terms of the farm-out, FAR will acquire 80% interest and operatorship of Erin Energy’s A2 and A5 offshore blocks.
FAR will fund Erin Energy through its first exploration well in the blocks and will pay Erin Energy $5.18 million and will carry $8.0 million of Erin Energy’s share of the costs. The companies intend to drill the exploration well in late 2018.
