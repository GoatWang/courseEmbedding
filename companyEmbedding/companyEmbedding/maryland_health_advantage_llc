Managed Care Organization Serves Medicaid Recipients  Across Maryland
BALTIMORE – The  University of Maryland Medical System (UMMS) announced today that it has entered  into an agreement to acquire Riverside Health, Inc., a managed care  organization (MCO) providing health coverage to Medicaid enrollees in 20 of  Maryland’s counties and Baltimore City. The transaction is expected to close  when all required regulatory approvals have been received. 
Riverside  Health currently serves 25,000 lives enrolled in the state’s Maryland  HealthChoice Program. It is currently seeking approval from the U.S. Centers  for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to offer a Medicare Advantage Plan for  the plan year 2016. 
“The  acquisition of Riverside Health will pave the way for UMMS to enter the  Medicaid and Medicare managed care market in Maryland,” says Robert A. Chrencik,  University of Maryland Medical System’s president and chief executive officer. “We  are very fortunate to draw on Riverside Health’s expertise and infrastructure  as we move ahead toward offering a benefit plan including a Medicare Advantage product.  Offering insurance products fits well with our model to be a comprehensive  health services provider to the people of Maryland and beyond.”
Mark  Puente, president and chief executive officer of Riverside Health, Inc., says,  “Riverside Health was founded with the goal of improving health care for the  most vulnerable by bridging the gaps between providers and payors. Joining  UMMS provides us the opportunity to create synergies to continuously improve  the services we provide our members.”

The  agreement for UMMS to purchase Riverside Health was approved by the boards of  directors of UMMS and Riverside Health.
About University of  Maryland Medical System
The  University of Maryland Medical System currently includes 12 health systems and  hospitals across Maryland including the University of Maryland Baltimore  Washington Medical Center; University of Maryland Charles Regional Medical  Center; University of Maryland Medical Center; University of Maryland Medical  Center Midtown Campus; University of Maryland Rehabilitation & Orthopaedic  Institute; University of Maryland Shore Health System; University of Maryland  St. Joseph Medical Center; and University of Maryland Upper Chesapeake Health  System, as well as the freestanding University of Maryland Shore Emergency  Center at Queenstown and the University of Maryland Shore Nursing &  Rehabilitation Center in Chestertown. UMMS also operates Mt. Washington  Pediatric Hospital as a joint venture with Johns Hopkins.

The company of approximately 100  employees was founded in 2011. Its Medicaid plan has approximately 25,000 members  and operates in 20 counties across Maryland plus Baltimore City.

University of Maryland Health Advantage
University of Maryland Health Advantage (HMO and HMO-SNP) is a Medicare Advantage Plan that offers affordable benefit options and more savings than original Medicare. Our plans were created with your needs in mind. It started with the idea of connecting Maryland beneficiaries with a large local network of physicians and providers – all in an effort to combine Medicare coverage with added benefits and services, and better care overall. Plans are available to Medicare beneficiaries in the following Maryland areas: Anne Arundel County, Baltimore County, Baltimore City, Caroline County, Carroll County, Cecil County, Dorchester County, Harford County, Howard County, Kent County, Montgomery County, Queen Anne’s County, and Talbot County.

What is Medicare Supplemental Insurance (a.k.a. Medigap)?
When an American citizen turns 65 years of age, they have the option to enroll in Medicare (they may also qualify before the age of 65 if they are eligible for disability benefits). Basic Medicare, which includes Parts A and B, cover most of your basic hospital and doctor expenses, respectively. Unfortunately, "most" does not mean "all". The expenses which Medicare does not cover - sometimes referred to as "gaps" in coverage - are what Medicare Supplemental insurance protects you from. It is a private plan designed to cover the medical expenses where Traditional Medicare falls short of the mark.
Who is Eligible for Medicare Supplemental Insurance?
If any of the following scenarios apply to you, then you are already guaranteed "eligible" to purchase Medicare supplemental insurance:

You are currently covered under Medicare Parts A & B
You are within 6 months of turning 65
You are within 6 months of receiving Part B coverage
If you are about to lose your group health insurance plan

Please note that you may still be required to answer some medical questions about your overall health and wellness. For further clarification, or if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us at (888)-565-8918. Give us a call today.


When Can I Sign Up for Medicare Supplemental Insurance?
Based on the convoluted rules of Medicare enrollment, many seniors mistakenly believe that signing up for Medicare Supplement is similarly complicated. The good news is that you can sign up for Medigap insurance at any time. However, there are some "sweet spot" time frames which, if you apply during those opportunities, will make the process much easier:

The Initial Enrollment Period. During your first 6 months of Part B coverage, your acceptance is guaranteed, regardless of your current level of health
The "Guaranteed Issue" Period. If you are on the verge of losing coverage through an employer, you will have a "guaranteed issue" period lasting 63 days where you can purchase any Medicare Supplemental policy with no health questions asked.

If you apply for Medicare supplement at any point outside of these time frames, you will likely have to go through the complicated process of medical underwriting and answering lots of invasive health questions. To learn more, and to get help going through the process, call us today at (888)-565-8918.
Who Purchases Medicare Supplemental Insurance?
It doesn't matter whether you're struggling to get by, on a fixed income, or enjoying incredible wealth in your golden years - all seniors from all walks of life can benefit from a Medicare supplement insurance policy. Medicare provides standard coverage to every beneficiary, regardless of income. What it does not provide, however, is 100% coverage of your medical costs. Therefore, the more vulnerable you are to the gaps in Medicare coverage, the more you can benefit from the protection of a Medigap policy.
Where Do I Purchase Medicare Supplemental Insurance?
You, as a consumer, have a variety of options. While some prefer to look up nearby agents in their local Yellow Pages, the truth is that you'll get the best deal by doing your research and shopping around online. With the power of the internet, you can get more and better offers from several major companies who are all competing for your business.
You could contact each and every individual agency by yourself and spend hours filling out the same redundant online forms for quotes, or you can let us do all of the busy work for you. Compare multiple plans, prices, and agencies by filling out our one, simple online quote form today. We can help you get the best possible deal on virtually any available Medicare supplement policy.
Important Fact: How to Save Money!
All 10 available Medicare Supplement Plans are standardized by Medicare - this means that each plan offers identical benefits, regardless of where you live or what company is handling your policy. Therefore, the only difference is in price. And the best way to get the best price is to compare plans online and save!

Medicare Supplement vs. Medicare Advantage?




Who Is Medigap.com
We are a free and open source for information on Medicare-related topics, issues, and insurance products. For any consumer who is currently receiving Medicare benefits, or for consumers who will soon be enrolling in the Federal Medicare Program, we provide information on companies, agents, and insurance plans. With the help of our convenient, user-friendly website, you can compare plans, learn about benefits, and shop for the best deal amongst the best Medicare insurance companies in the country. Our website is ranked in the top 5 out of thousands of Medicare insurance comparison websites. If you are ready to start your free quote today, we can help.
What is a Medicare Advantage Plan (a.k.a. Medicare Part C)?
Medicare Advantage is a private health insurance policy, underwritten by a private health insurance company, which replaces your Medicare coverage. With a Medicare Advantage plan, only the private company is responsible for paying your medical claims - the government is no longer responsible for those expenses. Legally, the private company has to provide you with "equal or better" coverage than what you would get under Original Medicare Parts A & B. Some plans go above and beyond Original Medicare by offering consumers additional benefits, such as vision, dental, and more. 
Who is Eligible for Medicare Advantage Plan?
If you are thinking about purchasing a Medicare Advantage plan, you can rest assured that you are highly likely to be accepted if:

You are currently covered under Medicare Parts A & B
You are within 6 months of turning 65
You are within 6 months of receiving Part B coverage
If you are about to lose your group health insurance plan

You may be able to apply during other times, but you will likely have to answer a lot of questions about your current health status. And even if you apply during any of the opportune time frames mentioned above, a company can still reject you for serious health conditions (such as kidney failure). For more clarification on your eligibility and options, give us a call today at (888)-565-8918.


When Can I Sign Up for Medicare Advantage Plan?
Unlike a Medicare supplement insurance policy, you can only sign up for a Medicare Advantage policy during certain times of the year. And those are:/p>
      	
The annual open enrollment period which spans October 15th - December 7th 
If you are on the verge of losing credible coverage, such as a group health insurance plan
Within 3 months of turning 65, or enrolling in Medicare Parts A & B

Still confused? We can help. Give is a call (888)-565-8918 and let our experts clear up and confusion you may have.
Who Purchases Medicare Advantage Plans?
Seniors from all walks of life can benefit from a Medicare Advantage policy. It really doesn't matter what level of income you have to work with. The reason for this is because Original Medicare only covers so much in the first place - there are still significant "gaps" in coverage which you will have to pay for out of pocket if you do not purchase additional insurance. And there are some Medicare Advantage plans that are available for zero premiums, which everyone can afford. 
Where Do I Purchase Medicare Advantage?
There are several different roads you can take, but we find that the best option is to shop around online for a Medicare Advantage policy. The internet is full of helpful information on potential companies, policies, and prices so that you can find the best possible option to suit your medical needs. Our company works with many of the top agencies in the market, and we can use those connections to help you get the Medicare Advantage policy that you require. All you have to do is fill out our online quote form, and we can get you started today!
Important Fact: How to Save Money!


What is the Difference between Medicare Supplement Insurance and Medicare Advantage?
Although it can be easy to confuse the two, Medicare Supplement and Medicare Advantage insurance policies are two completely different plans. It is essential that seniors learn the difference between them. Here are some of the key differences to keep in mind:
Medigap

A private policy that works secondary to your government Medicare benefits
You keep the same doctors, networks, co-pays, and deductibles as Medicare
Low (or zero) out of pocket costs beyond the monthly premium

Medicare Advantage

A private policy that completely replaces your government Medicare benefits
Your doctors, networks, co-pays, and deductibles will likely be different from Medicare
Potentially high out of pocket costs, in addition to the monthly premium

How Can I Learn more about Medigap Insurance?
For more information, you should start your online quote comparison today. Our website can provide you this service for free. With such powerful information, it will be easy to see the differences in coverages and prices between top plans available in your area. Of course, if you have any questions, you can call our Medicare Advantage specialists directly by calling (888)-565-8918.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
