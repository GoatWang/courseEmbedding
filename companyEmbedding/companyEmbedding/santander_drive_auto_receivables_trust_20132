      Fitch Rates Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust 2013-5
    





November 21, 2013 02:06 PM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has assigned the following ratings to the Santander Drive 
      Auto Receivables Trust 2013-5 notes:
    

      --$223,000,000 class A-1 notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --$252,000,000 class A-2A notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$252,000,000 class A-2B notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$226,580,000 class A-3 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$201,920,000 class B notes 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$204,470,000 class C notes 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$100,960,000 class D notes 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$87,380,000 class E notes 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Marginally Weaker Credit Quality: The credit quality of 2013-5 is 
      representative of subprime borrowers. While the weighted average (WA) 
      Fair Isaac Corp. (FICO) score (590) and internal loss forecasting score 
      (LFS; 563) are relatively consistent with the prior three transactions, 
      the 2013-5 pool has a higher concentration in the weaker LFS score 
      buckets.
    

      Higher Credit Enhancement (CE): The cash flow distribution is a 
      sequential-pay structure. Initial hard CE totals 45.80% for the class A 
      up from 43% in 2013-4 (not rated by Fitch) and 2013-3, and is higher for 
      the class B, C and D notes, but unchanged for the class E notes. The 
      higher CE in 2013-5 compensates for the marginally weaker pool, lower 
      excess spread, and the incorporation of the unhedged floating-rate class 
      A-2B notes.
    

      Stable Portfolio/Securitization Performance: Delinquencies and losses on 
      SCUSA's portfolio and 2010-2012 securitizations declined from prior 
      years, supported by the improving U.S. economy and healthy used vehicle 
      values elevating recovery rates.
    

      Stable Corporate Health: SCUSA recorded solid financial results recently 
      and has been profitable since 2007. Fitch rates Santander, majority 
      owner of SCUSA, 'BBB+/F2' with a Negative Outlook.
    

      Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: SCUSA demonstrates 
      adequate abilities as originator, underwriter and servicer, as evidenced 
      by historical portfolio and securitizations' delinquency and loss 
      performance.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of SCUSA would not impair the timeliness of 
      payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case and could result in potential rating actions on the notes. Fitch 
      evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to SDART 2013-5 to 
      increased credit losses over the life of the transaction. Fitch's 
      analysis found that the transaction displays some sensitivity to 
      increased defaults and credit losses, showing a potential downgrade of 
      one or two categories under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case loss) 
      scenario, especially for the subordinate bonds. The notes could 
      experience downgrades of up to three or more rating categories, under 
      Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario. For both scenarios, the 
      senior tranche notes do not display negative rating sensitivities.
    

      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the 
      accompanying presale report.

Fitch Upgrades One Class of Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust 2013-1 | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Upgrades One Class of Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust 2013-1
    





November 17, 2014 04:41 PM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--As part of its ongoing surveillance, Fitch Ratings has upgraded one and 
      affirmed four classes of the Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust 
      2013-1 transaction as follows:
    

      --Class A-3 affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class B upgraded to 'AAAsf' from 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class C affirmed at 'Asf'; Outlook to Positive from Stable;
    

      --Class D affirmed at 'BBBsf'; Outlook to Positive from Stable;
    

      --Class E affirmed at 'BBsf'; Outlook to Positive from Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The rating actions are based on available credit enhancement and loss 
      performance. The collateral pool continues to perform within Fitch's 
      expectations. Under the credit enhancement structure, the securities are 
      able to withstand stress scenarios consistent with the current rating 
      and make full payments to investors in accordance with the terms of the 
      documents.
    

      Fitch's review is based on the initial base case cumulative net loss 
      (CNL) estimate of 16.25%. However, based on current loss trends, Fitch 
      projects CNL for this pool to be in the 14%-15% range.
    

      The ratings reflect the quality of Santander Consumer USA, Inc.'s retail 
      auto loan originations, the adequacy of its servicing capabilities, and 
      the sound financial and legal structure of the transaction.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      could produce loss levels higher than the current projected base case 
      loss proxy and impact available loss coverage and multiples levels for 
      the transaction. Lower loss coverage could impact ratings and Rating 
      Outlooks, depending on the extent of the decline in coverage.
    

      In Fitch's initial review of the transaction, the notes were found to 
      have limited sensitivity to a 1.5x and 2.5x increase of Fitch's base 
      case loss expectation. To date, the transaction has exhibited strong 
      performance with losses within Fitch's initial expectations with rising 
      loss coverage and multiple levels consistent with the current ratings. A 
      material deterioration in performance would have to occur within the 
      asset pool to have potential negative impact on the outstanding ratings.
    

      Fitch's analysis of the Representation and Warranties (R&W) of this 
      transaction can be found in Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust 
      2013-1 -- Appendix. These R&W are compared to those of typical R&W for 
      the asset class as detailed in the special report 'Representations, 
      Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in the Global Structured Finance 
      Transactions' dated April 17, 2012.

Moody's Assigns Definitive Ratings To Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust 2007-1 Asset Backed Notes

                            [Dow Jones & Company, Inc. · 2007-04-04] - The following is a press release  from Moody's Investors Service: Moody's Assigns Definitive Ratings To Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust 2007-1 Asset Backed Notes $1.2 Billion of Asset-Backed Securities Rated.
                        

                            New York,  April 04, 2007 -- Moody's Investors Service has assigned ratings to the  notes issued by Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust 2007-1.
                        

                            This  is the first subprime auto loan securitization for 2007 and the first  public transaction for Drive Financial Services Inc. (successor to Drive Financial Services LP).
                        

                            The complete rating action is as follows:
                        


                                Issuer: Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust 2007-1
                            

                                $204,000,000 5.324% Class A-1 Asset backed Notes, rated Prime-1
                            

                                $340,000,000 5.20% Class A-2 Asset backed Notes, rated Aaa
                            

                                $185,000,000 5.05% Class A-3 Asset backed Notes, rated Aaa
                            

                                $471,000,000 LIBOR + 0.05% Class A-4 Asset backed Notes, rated Aaa
                            


                            Moody's said the rating of Prime-1 for the Class A-1 notes is based primarily on the expected cashflows on the underlying receivables during the collection periods prior to the Class A-1 final maturity date, and partially on the financial guaranty insurance policy provided by Financial Guaranty Insurance Company (FGIC), whose insurance financial  strength rating is Aaa. The ratings of Aaa for the remaining classes of notes are based primarily on the FGIC policy. Moody's believes the risk  assumed by FGIC in insuring the notes is investment- grade at closing.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

the Administrator or the Servicer (to the extent set forth in the
Transaction Documents) may conduct the business of such trust, make
and execute contracts and other instruments on behalf of such trust
and sue and be sued.

SECTION 2.2. Office . The
office of the Issuer shall be in care of the Owner Trustee at the
Corporate Trust Office or at such other address as the Owner
Trustee may designate by written notice to the Residual
Interestholder, the Seller and the Administrator.

SECTION 2.3. Purposes and
Powers . The purpose of the Issuer is, and the Issuer shall
have the power and authority, to engage in the following
activities:

(a) to issue the Notes pursuant to
the Indenture and the Certificates pursuant to this Agreement, and
to sell, transfer and exchange the Notes and the Certificates and
to pay interest on and principal of the Notes and distributions to
the Residual Interestholder;

(b) to acquire the property and
assets set forth in the Sale and Servicing Agreement from the
Seller pursuant to the terms thereof, to make deposits to and
withdrawals from the Collection Account, the Reserve Account and
the Pre-Funding Account and to pay the organizational, start-up and
transactional expenses of the Issuer;

(c) to assign, grant, transfer,
pledge, mortgage and convey the Trust Estate pursuant to the

Interestholder any portion of the Trust Estate released from the

Amended and Restated 

Trust Agreement
(2013-2) 






The Owner Trustee is hereby authorized to engage
in the foregoing activities on behalf of the Issuer. Neither the
Issuer nor the Owner Trustee on behalf of the Issuer shall engage
in any activity other than in connection with the foregoing or
other than as required or authorized by the terms of this Agreement
or the other Transaction Documents.

SECTION 2.4. Appointment of the
Owner Trustee. The Seller hereby appoints the Owner Trustee as
trustee of the Issuer effective as of the date hereof, to have all
the rights, powers and duties set forth herein.

SECTION 2.5. Initial Capital
Contribution of Trust Estate . As of the date of the Original
Trust Agreement, the Seller sold, assigned, transferred, conveyed
and set over to the Owner Trustee the sum of $1. The Owner Trustee
hereby acknowledges receipt in trust from the Seller, as of such
date, of the foregoing contribution, which shall constitute the
initial Trust Estate and shall be deposited in the Collection
Account.

SECTION 2.6. Declaration of
Trust . The Owner Trustee hereby declares that it will hold the
Trust Estate in trust upon and subject to the conditions set forth
herein for the use and benefit of the Residual Interestholder,
subject to the obligations of the Issuer under the Transaction
Documents. It is the intention of the parties hereto that the
Issuer constitute a statutory trust under the Statutory Trust
Statute and that this Agreement constitute the governing instrument
of such statutory trust. It is the intention of the parties hereto
that, solely for federal income or state and local income,
franchise and value added tax purposes, so long as there is a
single beneficial owner of the Residual Interest, the Issuer will
be disregarded as an entity separate from such beneficial owner and
the Notes will be characterized as debt. The parties agree that,
unless otherwise required by appropriate tax authorities, the
Issuer will not file or cause to be filed annual or other necessary
returns, reports and other forms consistent with the
characterization of the Issuer as an entity separate from its
owner. In the event that the Issuer is deemed to have more than one
beneficial owner for federal income tax purposes, the Issuer will
file returns, reports and other forms consistent with the
characterization of the Issuer as a partnership (that is not
treated as a publicly traded partnership), and this Agreement shall
be amended to include such provisions as may be required under
Subchapter K of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
Effective as of the date hereof, the Owner Trustee shall have all
rights, powers and duties set forth herein and, to the extent not
inconsistent herewith, in the Statutory Trust Statute with respect
to accomplishing the purposes of the Issuer. The Owner Trustee has
heretofore filed the Certificate of Trust with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware as required by Section 3810(a)
of the Statutory Trust Statute, such filing hereby being ratified
and approved in all respects. Notwithstanding anything herein or in
the Statutory Trust Statute to the contrary, it is the intention of
the parties hereto that the Issuer constitute a “business
trust” within the meaning of Section 101(9)(A)(v) of the
Bankruptcy Code.

SECTION 2.7. Organizational
Expenses; Liabilities of the Holders .

(a) The Servicer shall pay
organizational expenses of the Issuer as they may arise.

Trust Agreement
(2013-2) 







(b) No Residual Interestholder
(including the Seller if the Seller becomes a Residual
Interestholder) shall have any personal liability for any liability
or obligation of the Issuer.

SECTION 2.8. Title to the Trust
Estate . Legal title to all the Trust Estate shall be vested at
all times in the Issuer as a separate legal entity.

SECTION 2.9. Representations and
Warranties of the Seller . The Seller hereby represents and
warrants to the Owner Trustee that:

(a) Existence and Power . The
Seller is a Delaware limited liability company validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has,
in all material respects, full power and authority required to own
its assets and operate its business as presently owned or operated,
and to execute, deliver and to perform its obligations under the
Transaction Documents to which it is a party. The Seller has
obtained all necessary licenses and approvals in each jurisdiction
where the failure to do so would materially and adversely affect
the ability of the Seller to perform its obligations under the
Transaction Documents and the Underwriting Agreement.

(b) Authorization and No
Contravention . The execution, delivery and performance by the
Seller of each Transaction Document to which it is a party and the
Underwriting Agreement (i) have been duly authorized by all
necessary action on the part of the Seller and (ii) do not
violate or constitute a default under (A) any applicable law,
rule or regulation, (B) its organizational instruments or
(C) any material agreement or instrument to which the Seller
is a party or by which its properties are bound (other than
violations of such laws, rules, regulations or agreements which do
not affect the legality, validity or enforceability of any of such
agreements and which, individually or in the aggregate, would not
materially and adversely affect the transactions contemplated by,
or the Seller’s ability to perform its obligations under, the
Transaction Documents to which it is a party).

(c) No Consent Required . No
approval, authorization or other action by, or filing with, any
Governmental Authority is required in connection with the
execution, delivery and performance by the Seller of any
Transaction Document other than UCC filings and other than
(i) approvals and authorizations that have previously been
obtained and filings which have previously been made and
(ii) approvals, authorizations or filings which, if not
obtained or made, would not have a material adverse effect on the
ability of the Seller to perform its obligations under the
Underwriting Agreement or the Transaction Documents to which it is
a party.

(d) Binding Effect . Each of
the Transaction Documents to which the Seller is a party and the
Underwriting Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Seller enforceable against the Seller in
accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium, receivership, conservatorship or other similar laws
affecting creditors’ rights generally and, if applicable the
rights of creditors of limited liability companies from
time

Amended and Restated 

Trust Agreement
(2013-2) 







to time in effect or by general
principles of equity or other similar laws of general application
relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights
generally and subject to general principles of equity.

(e) No Proceedings . There
are no actions, orders, suits or proceedings pending or, to the
knowledge of the Seller, threatened against the Seller before or by
any Governmental Authority that (i) assert the invalidity or
unenforceability of this Agreement or any of the other Transaction
Documents, (ii) seek to prevent the issuance of the Notes or
the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents or
(iii) seek any determination or ruling that would materially
and adversely affect the performance by the Seller of its
obligations under this Agreement or any of the other Transaction
Documents.

SECTION 2.10. Situs of Issuer
. The Issuer shall be located in the State of Delaware (it being
understood that the Issuer may have bank accounts located and
maintained outside of Delaware).

SECTION 2.11. Covenants of the
Residual Interestholders . Each Residual Interestholder, by
becoming a beneficial owner of the Residual Interest, hereby
acknowledges and agrees (a) that the Residual Interestholder
is subject to the terms, provisions and conditions of the
Certificate, to which the Residual Interestholder agrees to be
bound; and (b) that it shall not take any position in such
Residual Interestholder’s tax returns inconsistent with
Section 2.6 herein and Section 2.14 of the
Indenture.

ARTICLE III

RESIDUAL INTEREST AND TRANSFER OF
CERTIFICATES

SECTION 3.1. Initial
Ownership . Upon the formation of the Issuer and until the
issuance of the Certificate, the Seller shall be the sole
beneficiary of the Issuer, and upon the issuance of the
Certificate, the Seller will no longer be a beneficiary of the
Issuer, except to the extent that the Seller is the
Certificateholder.

SECTION 3.2. Authorization of the
Certificates . Concurrently with the sale of the Transferred
Assets to the Issuer pursuant to the Sale and Servicing Agreement,
the Owner Trustee shall cause the Certificates to be executed on
behalf of the Issuer, authenticated and delivered to or upon the
written order of the Seller, signed by its chairman of the board,
its president, its chief financial officer, its chief accounting
officer, any vice president, its secretary, any assistant
secretary, its treasurer or any assistant treasurer, without
further corporate action by the Seller. The Certificates shall
represent 100% of the beneficial interest in the Issuer and shall
be fully paid and nonassessable.

SECTION 3.3. Form of the
Certificate . Each Certificate, upon issuance, will be issued
in the form of a typewritten Certificate representing a definitive
Certificate, substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto.
The Owner Trustee shall execute and authenticate or cause to be
authenticated, each definitive Certificate in accordance with the
written instructions of the Seller.

Amended and Restated 

Trust Agreement
(2013-2) 







SECTION 3.4. Registration of the
Certificates . The Owner Trustee shall maintain at its office
referred to in Section 2.2 , or at the office of any
agent appointed by it and approved in writing by the Residual
Interestholder at the time of such appointment, a register for the
registration and transfer of any Certificate.

SECTION 3.5. Transfer of the
Certificate .

(a) The Certificateholder may
assign, convey or otherwise transfer all or any of its right, title
and interest in the Certificate; provided , that
(i) the Owner Trustee and the Issuer receive an Opinion of
Counsel stating that, in the opinion of such counsel, such transfer
will not cause the Issuer to be treated as a publicly traded
partnership for federal income tax purposes and (ii) the
Certificate may not be acquired by or for the account of or with
any assets of a Benefit Plan or any governmental, non-U.S., church
or any other employee benefit plan or retirement arrangement that
is subject to Similar Law; provided that the condition set
forth in (i)  above will not apply to a transfer of
100% of the Certificate or Certificates to an Affiliate of the
Seller or its designated nominee, provided such Affiliate shall
certify in writing to the Owner Trustee that it is a C Corporation
for U.S. federal income tax purposes (within the meaning of
Section 1361(a)(2) of the Code) or a disregarded entity 100%
owned (directly or indirectly) by a C Corporation for U.S. federal
income tax purposes (within the meaning of Section 1361(a)(2)
of the Code). By accepting and holding a Certificate (or any
interest therein), the holder thereof shall be deemed to have
represented and warranted that it is not, and is not purchasing the
Certificate (or any interest therein) on behalf of or with any
assets of, a Benefit Plan or any governmental, non-U.S., church or
any other employee benefit plan or retirement arrangement that is
subject to Similar Law. The Owner Trustee shall have no duty to
independently determine that the requirement in (ii)
 above is met and shall incur no liability to any person in
the event the holder of the Certificate does not comply with such
restrictions. Subject to the transfer restrictions contained herein
and in the Certificate, the Certificateholder may transfer all or
any portion of the beneficial interest in the Issuer evidenced by
such Certificate upon surrender thereof to the Owner Trustee
accompanied by the documents required by this Section. Such
transfer may be made by the registered Certificateholder in person
or by his attorney duly authorized in writing upon surrender of the
Certificate to the Owner Trustee accompanied by a written
instrument of transfer and with such signature guarantees and
evidence of authority of the Persons signing the instrument of
transfer as the Owner Trustee may reasonably require. Promptly upon
the receipt of such documents and receipt by the Owner Trustee of
the transferor’s Certificate, the Owner Trustee shall record
the name of such transferee as a Certificateholder and its
percentage of beneficial interest in the Issuer in the Certificate
register and issue, execute and deliver to such Certificateholder a
Certificate evidencing such beneficial interest in the Issuer. In
the event a transferor transfers only a portion of its beneficial
interest in the Issuer, the Owner Trustee shall register and issue
to such transferor a new Certificate evidencing such
transferor’s new percentage of beneficial interest in the
Issuer. Subsequent to a transfer and upon the issuance of the new
Certificate or Certificates, the Owner Trustee shall cancel and
destroy the Certificate surrendered to it in connection with such
transfer. The Owner Trustee may treat the Person in whose name any
Certificate is registered as the sole owner of the beneficial
interest in the Issuer evidenced by such Certificate.

Amended and Restated 

Trust Agreement
(2013-2) 







(b) As a condition precedent to any
registration of transfer under this Section 3.5 , the
Owner Trustee may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover
the payment of any tax or taxes or other governmental charges
required to be paid in connection with such transfer.

(c) The Owner Trustee shall not be
obligated to register any transfer of a Certificate unless each of
the transferor and the transferee have certified to the Owner
Trustee that such transfer does not violate any of the transfer
restrictions stated herein including, but not limited to clauses
(d)  and (e)  of this Section 3.5
. The Owner Trustee shall not be liable to any Person for
registering any transfer based on such certifications.

(d) No transfer (or purported
transfer) of all or any part of a Certificateholder’s
interest (or any economic interest therein), whether to another
Certificateholder or to a person who is not a Certificateholder,
shall be effective, and any such transfer (or purported transfer)
shall be void ab initio , and no person shall
otherwise become a Certificateholder if, after such transfer (or
purported transfer), the Issuer would have more than 95 direct or
indirect holders of an interest in the Certificates and the
Non-Investment Grade Notes (unless, with respect to the
Non-Investment Grade Notes, a Debt-For-Tax Opinion has been
delivered). For purposes of determining whether the Issuer will
have more than 95 holders of an interest in the Certificates and
the Non-Investment Grade Notes, as applicable, each Person
indirectly owning an interest through a partnership (including any
entity treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes), a
grantor trust or an S corporation (each such entity, a “
flow-through entity ”) shall be treated as a
Certificateholder or Noteholder, as applicable, unless the Seller
determines in its sole and absolute discretion, after consulting
with qualified tax counsel, that less than substantially all of the
value of the beneficial owner’s interest in the flow-through
entity is attributable to the flow-through entity’s interest
(direct or indirect) in the Issuer.

(e) No transfer shall be permitted
if the same is effected through an established securities market or
secondary market or substantial equivalent thereof within the
meaning of Section 7704 of the Code or would make the Issuer
ineligible for “safe harbor” treatment under
Section 7704 of the Code.

(f) Each transferee (i) shall
be required to represent and warrant that it is a Person who is a
U.S. Tax Person and (ii) shall provide a certification of
non-foreign status, in such form as may be requested by the Seller
or the Owner Trustee (e.g. IRS Form W-9), signed under penalties of
perjury (and such other certification, representations or opinion
of counsel as may be requested by the Seller or the Owner
Trustee).

SECTION 3.6. Lost, Stolen,
Mutilated or Destroyed Certificates . If (i) any mutilated
Certificate is surrendered to the Owner Trustee, or (ii) the
Owner Trustee receives evidence to its satisfaction that any
Certificate has been destroyed, lost or stolen, and upon proof of
ownership

satisfactory to the Owner Trustee together with
such security or indemnity as may be requested by the Owner Trustee
to save it harmless, the Owner Trustee shall execute and deliver a
new Certificate for the same percentage of beneficial interest in
the Issuer as the Certificate so mutilated, destroyed, lost or
stolen, of like tenor and bearing a different issue number, with
such notations, if any, as the Owner Trustee shall determine. Upon
the issuance of any new Certificate under this
Section 3.6 , the Issuer or Owner Trustee may require
the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other
governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any
transfer or exchange of the Certificate and any other reasonable
expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses of the Issuer
and the Owner Trustee) connected therewith. Any duplicate
Certificate issued pursuant to this Section 3.6 shall
constitute complete and indefeasible evidence of ownership in the
Issuer, as if originally issued, whether or not the lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate shall be found at any time.

SECTION 3.7. Appointment of the
Certificate Paying Agent . The Certificate Paying Agent shall
make distributions to Residual Interestholders from the Certificate
Distribution Account pursuant to Section 5.2 and shall
report the amounts of such distributions to the Owner Trustee and
the Servicer; provided , however , that no such
reports shall be required so long as the Seller or an affiliate of
the Seller is the sole Residual Interestholder. Any Certificate
Paying Agent shall have the revocable power to withdraw funds from
the Certificate Distribution Account for the purpose of making the
distributions referred to above. The Owner Trustee may revoke such
power and remove the Certificate Paying Agent if the Owner Trustee
determines in its sole discretion that the Certificate Paying Agent
shall have failed to perform its obligations under this Agreement
in any material respect. The Certificate Paying Agent shall
initially be Deutsche Bank, and any co-paying agent chosen by the
Certificate Paying Agent. Deutsche Bank shall be permitted to
resign as Certificate Paying Agent upon thirty
(30) days’ written notice to the Owner Trustee. If
Deutsche Bank shall no longer be the Certificate Paying Agent, the
Owner Trustee shall appoint a successor to act as Certificate
Paying Agent (which shall be a bank or trust company). The Owner
Trustee shall cause such successor Certificate Paying Agent or any
additional Certificate Paying Agent appointed by the Owner Trustee
to execute and deliver to the Owner Trustee an instrument in which
such successor Certificate Paying Agent or additional Certificate
Paying Agent shall agree with the Owner Trustee that as Certificate
Paying Agent, such successor Certificate Paying Agent or additional
Certificate Paying Agent shall hold all sums, if any, held by it
for payment to the Residual Interestholders in trust for the
benefit of the Residual Interestholders entitled thereto until such
sums shall be paid to such Residual Interestholders. The
Certificate Paying Agent shall return all unclaimed funds to the
Owner Trustee and upon removal of a Certificate Paying Agent such
Certificate Paying Agent shall also return all funds in its
possession to the Owner Trustee. The rights, protections,
indemnities and immunities of the Owner Trustee under this
Agreement shall apply to the Owner Trustee also in its role as
Certificate Paying Agent or Certificate Registrar for so long as
the Owner Trustee shall act as Certificate Paying Agent or
Certificate Registrar and, to the extent applicable, to any other
paying agent, certificate registrar or authenticating agent
appointed hereunder. Any reference in this Agreement to the
Certificate Paying Agent shall include any co-paying agent unless
the context requires otherwise.

adversely affects the interests of the Residual
Interestholder;

(c) the amendment, change or
modification of the Sale and Servicing Agreement, or the
Administration Agreement, except to cure any ambiguity or defect or
to amend or supplement any provision in a manner that would not

Residual Interestholders, commence a Bankruptcy Event with respect
to the Issuer. In considering whether to give or withhold written
consent to the Bankruptcy Event by the Issuer, the Owner Trustee,
with the consent of the Residual Interestholder, shall consider the
interests of the Noteholders in addition to the interests of the
Issuer and whether the Issuer is insolvent. The Owner Trustee shall
have no duty to give such written consent to a Bankruptcy Event by
the Issuer if the Owner Trustee shall not have been furnished (at
the expense of the Person that requested such letter be furnished

Owner Trustee) a letter from an

Trustee shall not be personally liable to any Noteholder or
Residual Interestholder on account of the Owner Trustee’s
good faith reliance on the provisions of this Section and no
Noteholder or Residual Interestholder shall have any claim for
breach of fiduciary duty or otherwise against the Owner Trustee for
giving or withholding its consent to any such Bankruptcy
Event.

(b) The parties hereto stipulate and
agree that no Residual Interestholder has power to commence any
Bankruptcy Action on the part of the Issuer.

SECTION 4.4. Restrictions on
Residual Interestholder’s Power . The Residual
Interestholder shall not direct the Owner Trustee to take or
refrain from taking any action if such action or inaction would be
contrary to any obligation of the Issuer or the Owner Trustee under
this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents or would be
contrary to Section 2.3 , nor shall the Owner Trustee
be obligated to follow any such direction, if given.

SECTION 4.5. Majority Control
. To the extent that there is more than one Residual
Interestholder, any action which may be taken or consent or
instructions which may be given by the Residual Interestholder
under this Agreement may be taken by Residual Interestholders
holding in the aggregate a percentage of the beneficial interest in
the Issuer equal to more than 50% of the beneficial interest in the
Issuer at the time of such action.

discharge

Trust Agreement
(2013-2) 






any duty of the Issuer or the Owner Trustee
hereunder or under any Transaction Document, and the Owner Trustee
shall not be liable for the default or failure of the Administrator
to carry out its obligations under the Administration Agreement and
shall have no duty to monitor the performance of the Administrator
or any other Person under the Administration Agreement or any other
document. The Owner Trustee shall have no obligation to administer,
service or collect the Receivables or to maintain, monitor or
otherwise supervise the administration, servicing or collection of
the Receivables.

SECTION 6.3. Action upon
Instruction .

(a) Subject to Article IV ,
and in accordance with the Transaction Documents, the Residual
Interestholder may, by written instruction, direct the Owner
Trustee in the management of the Issuer. Such direction may be
exercised at any time by written instruction of the Residual
Interestholder pursuant to Article IV .

(b) Subject to
Section 7.1 , the Owner Trustee shall not be required
to take any action hereunder or under any Transaction Document if
the Owner Trustee shall have reasonably determined or been advised
by counsel that such action is likely to result in liability on the
part of the Owner Trustee or is contrary to the terms hereof or of
any Transaction Document or is otherwise contrary to
law.

(c) Whenever the Owner Trustee is
unable to decide between alternative courses of action permitted or
required by the terms of this Agreement or any Transaction Document
or is unsure as to the application of any provision of this
Agreement or any Transaction Document or any such provision is
ambiguous as to its application, or is, or appears to be, in
conflict with any other applicable provision, or in the event that
this Agreement permits any determination by the Owner Trustee or is
silent or is incomplete as to the course of action that the Owner
Trustee is required to take with respect to a particular set of
facts, the Owner Trustee shall promptly give notice (in such form
as shall be appropriate under the circumstances) to the Residual
Interestholder requesting instruction as to the course of action to
be adopted or application of such provision, and to the extent the
Owner Trustee acts or refrains from acting in good faith in
accordance with any written instruction of the Residual
Interestholder received, the Owner Trustee shall not be liable on
account of such action or inaction to any Person. If the Owner
Trustee shall not have received appropriate instruction within ten
days of such notice (or within such shorter period of time as
reasonably may be specified in such notice or may be necessary
under the circumstances) it may, but shall be under no duty to,
take or refrain from taking such action, not inconsistent with this
Agreement or the Transaction Documents, as it shall deem to be in
the best interests of the Residual Interestholder, and shall have
no liability to any Person for such action or inaction.

SECTION 6.4. No Duties Except as
Specified in this Agreement or in Instructions . The Owner
Trustee shall not have any duty or obligation to manage, make any
payment with respect to, register, record, sell, dispose of, or
otherwise deal with the Trust Estate, or to otherwise take or
refrain from taking any action under, or in connection with, any
document contemplated hereby to which the Issuer or the Owner
Trustee is a party, except as expressly provided by the
