                        While basic sales methodologies instruct salespeople on the nuts and bolts of the sales process-who to approach in an organization, when to ask questions, and what to ask-ROI Selling takes them to a new level. Using a unique "360 Degree Measurement" technique, this guide provides practical tools for turning valuable customer feedback into a compelling case for their products and services.

					Selling Better Sleep: RSA Marketing Tips from Michael J. Breaus, HD, The Sleep Doctor	

HomeAccessoriesSelling Better Sleep: RSA Marketing Tips from Michael J. Breaus, HD, The Sleep Doctor 








It’s a common scenario—a customer walks into your store wanting to buy a new mattress, but doesn’t feel comfortable enough to even sit, much lay down, on the bed…now what?? The purchase of a mattress is like no other product. To a consumer it is a big ticket item with a very intimate purpose. You know it’s a product that has the ability to change your customer’s quality of life in a very short time. Consumers have a multitude of mattress products to choose from, and the choices can be overwhelming. Most consumers approach the purchase with reluctance or can be clueless as to where or how to start the buying process. But an RSA that knows how to start a conversation about sleep can be a hero to these consumers.
The RSA can be educated to ask mattress shoppers “conversation starters” that bring the customer comfortably into the buying process and ultimately help the RSA identify the best product choice for the customer. The RSA will also be able to help communicate product expectations to the customers that can result in better product satisfaction.
So how do you start this sleep conversation?
*The first question is one you probably already ask: How well did you sleep last night? The answer will tell you about their overall sleep satisfaction and asks a question about their current sleep quality.
*Find out what was good and what wasn’t good about their sleep. This can tell you if their sleep issues relate to their environment, their health or life stresses. Something as simple as knowing that they sleep with two kids and two dogs might let you know they need a bigger bed!
*Has their sleep changed recently? Do they think they sleep too much or too little? This is a great time to engage your customer in a discussion about their beliefs about sleep, and remind them of the benefits of great sleep:
-reduces weight
-strengthens immune system,
-increases mood,
-increases performance
-leads us to better decision making
-quicker and more creative thinking.
*Is snoring, temperature or reflux a problem when they are sleeping? The answer to this question leads to a discussion of specialty products, materials and accessories.
*Does pain affect your sleep? When pain affects sleep it is usually in one of two ways:
-Acute pain or pain from injury. This type of pain may require stabilization and memory foam near the surface will help.
-Chronic pain. This type of pain may benefit from more nighttime movement and a material like latex can help a resting body when it’s moving.
You don’t have to add Sleep Expert to your title to be successful at selling mattresses, but engaging your customer in a conversation about their sleep—and knowing how your product can benefit your customers’ sleep habits—is instrumental in keeping your customers happy and well-rested.
In short, the more you know about customers’ specific sleep needs and expectations, the more likely you are to sell products that will benefit and satisfy them, and keep them coming back.

Product Description
Michael J.Panzner – The New Laws of the Stock Market Jungle

 
Review
“A sophisticated trip through the ever-changing jungle.” –Barton Biggs, Managing Partner, Traxis Partners “Michael Panzner, an experienced investment professional, has written a great book! It contains so many interesting observations supported by well-selected figures that every investor will gain insights that will serve him well for the rest of his life!” –Marc Faber, Managing Director, Marc Faber Limited, Editor, Gloom, Boom & Doom Report “This book should be required reading for both old and new buy-side and sell-side institutional traders. How refreshing! An author who knows what he is writing about … and can write. The New Laws of the Stock Market Jungle will be required reading in my offices.” –Steve Leuthold, Chairman, Leuthold Weeden Capital Management, Chairman, The Leuthold Group “‘This time is different’ may be the most dangerous phrase in the investment lexicon, but sometimes things really are different. In this valuable book, Michael Panzner applies his encyclopedic knowledge of the markets over the last three decades to analyzing the many crucial ways in which investing today is, indeed, different than ever before.” –Mark Hulbert, Editor, Hulbert Financial Digest, Columnist, CBS Marketwatch “The New Laws of the Stock Market Jungle is definitely not for dummies. This sophisticated but lively book is for serious investors who want an insider’s perspective on making money in uncertain markets.” –Jon Markman, Contributing Editor, CBNC.com on MSN Money, and Senior Investment Strategist and Portfolio Manager, Pinnacle Investment Advisors “Stock market speculation is both an art and a science and with this book, Michael Panzner explains just why this is so in a way practical and thorough enough to actually help you invest and trade more intelligently. What more could anyone ask?” –Peter Navarro, author of If It’s Raining in Brazil, Buy Starbucks and When the Market Moves, Will You Be Ready? “Over the last decade, important changes in technology and trading rules have transformed the way that Wall Street operates, while new incentives for institutional investors have altered their behavior and our markets. Panzner’s book identifies new opportunities and threats and offers insights that can help investors to profit in the years ahead.” –John Nofsinger author of Investment Madness and Infectious Greed “Panzner’s book reveals many of the tools and tricks we professionals use every day to make money. If you wonder why the ‘little guys’ are always at a disadvantage and why many commentators and academics can’t seem to explain these markets, it is because they are unaware of these factors. Honestly, I wish he had not said a thing.” –Robert Jafek, Principal, Torrey Pines Capital, and former partner, Nicholas-Applegate Capital Management “As an equity dealer for a fund group managing nearly $30 billion, I have used Michael Panzner’s market insights and expertise on a daily basis to help me trade effectively. Now, through this book, his 20 years of market experience are available to everyone. From the seasoned investment professional to the casual investor, anyone looking to gain a better understanding of how new market forces are changing the dynamics of investing today, will benefit from reading this book.” –Ronald J. Lysek, Jr. International Equity Trader, Franklin Mutual Advisers, Inc. “This ‘bible’ on trading and markets is packed with the most up-to-date information. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand the intricacies of today’s stock market environment.” –Peter Tropaitis, Vice President, Senior Global Equity Trader, Federated Investors
From the Publisher
The stock market is undergoing revolutionary change: new players, new technologies, new information flows, and new macroeconomic conditions. These changes are radically impacting investors, whether they realize it or not. Now, Wall Street insider Michael J. Panzner shows you how to profit from the changes–instead of being victimized by them.
Discover how falling transaction costs and a barrage of data are transforming investment patterns, and how stocks are increasingly being bought and sold like commodities. Understand the impact of electronic trading, instant messaging, and hedge funds on intraday volatility and short-term direction. Learn how booms and busts have altered investor behavior and risk preferences, why today’s market is increasingly emotional, and why many traditional market indicators simply don’t work anymore.
From the growing role of derivatives to the increasing unpredictability of seasonal and cyclical patterns, this book takes you “under the hood” of today’s equity markets… so you can choose investments that win.
Why stock market investing is more treacherous than ever before Why many of yesterday’s key indicators and market patterns simply don’t work anymore
Breakthrough opportunities for radically new markets Finding new strategies for today’s completely new investing environment
Expecting the unexpected: what to do when the rules change Uncovering what’s really going on under the surface
Everything’s faster–and more chaotic How e-trading, instant messaging, and hedge funds are increasing volatility
What’s next on the horizon Emerging influences that may transform investing yet again

Article excerpt

The company is selling its consumer products division for $1.68
billion to Del Monte Pacific Limited, which already sells food under
the Del Monte brand in the Philippines and India.Del Monte Foods is finally shedding its canned fruits and
vegetables business.The company said late Thursday that it was selling its consumer
products division for $1.68 billion to Del Monte Pacific Limited,
the Singapore company that already sells food under the Del Monte
brand in the Philippines and India.The deal will let Del Monte Foods focus on what is now its
biggest business, pet foods. By the time the company sold itself to
a group led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts three years ago, it drew
about half of its $3.7 billion in revenue from sales of brands like
Meow Mix and Kibbles 'n Bits.It will also give Del Monte Pacific a door into the United
States, where consumer spending has been rising."We believe DMPL is the right company to build on the Consumer
Products segment's recent success and achieve its next phase of
growth," Dave West, the chief executive of Del Monte Foods, said in
