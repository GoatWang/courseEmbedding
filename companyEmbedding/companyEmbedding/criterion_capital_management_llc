Criterion Capital Management






Investments
Our team employs a fundamental investment approach driven by primary research and proprietary modeling. The investment philosophy is structured to create value by investing in growth & turnaround long positions, as well as tactical & secular short positions executed across the numerous verticals that comprise the TMT sectors. We invest with a longer-term time horizon with the belief that over time a company's stock price will rise or fall to reflect the underlying fundamentals of the company.
For long-side investments, Criterion focuses on what we believe are among the highest quality businesses from around the world, evaluating their fundamentals as defined by underlying business drivers, end market growth, quality of management, competitive barriers to entry, customer switching costs, pricing power and sustainability of margin structure. In contrast, our short-side investments are made in companies that we believe have declining earnings quality, increasingly competitive landscapes and slowing growth associated with maturing markets.
By using the twenty plus subsectors of TMT around the world, we build a diversified portfolio intended to offset both systematic market and stock specific risk while providing absolute returns over full market cycles.

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.
