Why Wyoming LLC and Corporations
Why Incorporate in Wyoming
Wyoming LLC fees and other expenses are less than most other states. Wyoming has no business license fees or officer filing fees.  This means we can deliver a quality company package with Wyoming LLC forms for much less than you would pay in Nevada or Delaware.  And, if you incorporate in Wyoming, your state renewal fee is, in most cases, $50, that is 92% less than what you will pay in Nevada for a corporation.
Click here to compare states.  Wyoming is also one of the most cost effective states to incorporate in and also to maintain, in the following years.  (Click here for pricing.)
Wyoming Corporate Services shows you why you should form a Wyoming LLC or corporation here. 
Asset Protection
A Wyoming LLC formation or corporation offers its officers and directors the highest degree of protection from lawsuits filed by disgruntled creditors or overzealous plaintiff attorneys.  Doing business as a Wyoming Corporation or LLC can give you advantages like asset protection and business privacy.
The first LLC statutes in the United States were instituted in Wyoming in 1977 and changed in 2010 to stay current with the times.  Since Wyoming has had limited liability companies available longer than any other state and has the strongest laws protecting members and managers of an LLC, we feel it is the state of choice for establishing LLC’s.
Privacy
Wyoming does not require the manager nor the members of a Wyoming LLC to be listed on a public database.   Nevada requires a tax ID number of the company and personal guarantee by you on the state’s business license.
Fast Wyoming Companies
For new Wyoming Corporation or Wyoming LLC formation, we can have your certified documents filed, stamped and returned to us by the state within 1 business day, after you place your order!   Just check the box for that service, in the “extra services” area of the order form.
Freedom
If you have a Wyoming LLC,  you can operate your Corporation and live anywhere in the world; you do not have to be a US citizen to incorporate in Wyoming.  But, in order to give substance to your operation, you should know about our Office Service Contract and learn how use of this inexpensive option will give “presence” to your remote corporate operations.  And, if you are not a US Citizen, we have a section for you to read here.
No State Taxes
Among the many other advantages of incorporation here, there are no State taxes for Wyoming LLCs. If you choose to incorporate in Wyoming, your company may not pay State taxes at all.  Stop for a minute and think what you paid last year in your States income tax.
If you are comparing Nevada and Wyoming LLCs, keep in mind that the Nevada has voted in a bill as of June 2015 installing a corporate gross receipts tax (no deductions allowed).  That means that some companies incorporating in Nevada will pay more in Nevada state taxes than they would in California!  This same bill raised the yearly fee for a Nevada corporation by 150%!  Nevada has raised rates on corporations by about 400% in the last 8 years!  Don’t gamble on Nevada.
According to the new 2017 edition of the Tax Foundation’s State Business Tax Climate Index, “Wyoming has the most business-friendly tax system of any state,” for the seventh year in a row.
Easy to move your company to Wyoming
Wyoming has made it easy to move your existing corporation to Wyoming.  You can move it from any other state to Wyoming.  That service is detailed here.
Special Easy-to-Use Wyoming Corporate Structures
Wyoming has Close Corporations.  These are special companies authorized by the Wyoming Legislature for small business owners.  One advantage of these corporations is that there is less paperwork required to keep them going.  Few states have them.  You can read about them here.
Wyoming now has Close LLCs.  Less paperwork.  Easier to manage.  This type of Wyoming LLC is perfect for a closely held family company.  You can see the details here.
Wyoming has Asset Protection Trusts. This is the best asset protection you can get inside the US. Details are here.
Wyoming Corporate Services, Inc. has been in business in Cheyenne, Wyoming since 2003.  We provide full time Resident Agent Services in the state of Wyoming. We specialize in helping you incorporate in “tax free” Wyoming and have strategies to help you lower your tax liability in your home state, increase your asset protection, and give you back your privacy. We think that you will find the information you need on this site to help you with your Wyoming LLC formation.

Tax Information

S-Corp


Tax Rate

There is no tax to the LLC on LLC income.  All profits or losses pass through and are taxed to the members.
There is no tax except in two limited circumstances: (1) Recognized built-in gains and  (2) Excess passive income.


Pass Through of Losses
Losses not passed through.
Losses passed through to members, subject to certain restrictions.

Fiscal Year
May use any fiscal year.  Personal Service Corps must use a calendar year, subject to certain exceptions.

Must use calendar year, subject to certain exceptions.

Fringe Benefits
Shareholders – Employees are eligible for most.
Members are ineligible for certain ones.
2% shareholders are ineligible for certain ones.


Tax Upon Sale
Potential double taxation. Corporation is taxed on sale of assets, shareholders taxed on dividends or capital gains tax.
Single tax at member level upon sale of appreciated assets.  Generally, no tax on distribution of appreciated assets.
Single tax at member level. Potential built-in gains taxed if corp. had appreciated property at time of S corp. election.



LLC Footnotes:
Here are a couple of other points about an LLC vs. a Corporation:
If you are looking for state tax savings, an LLC passes the tax through to the members. So, if the member(s) are in a state where you pay state taxes, you still pay state taxes on the profits that are passed through the LLC.
Also, in an LLC you can allocate the way you want the profits to be distributed and it does not have to be based upon the percentage of ownership. Here is an example: There are two members in an LLC that own it 50/50. However, one member is an investor only, who wants to protect his/her investment by controlling 50% of the company. But, the other member is the one doing all the work and who wants more than 50% of the profit. Just write in the agreement that the working member gets 75% of the profits, even though he/she only own 50% of the business.
S-Corp Footnotes
Here’s a point about the S-Corporation that could give people paying themselves a salary, an edge. With an S-Corp as long as you pay yourself a reasonable salary, you can take the balance as profit income. This could lower the amount of self-employment taxes that you have to pay.
Also, in Wyoming we establish all corporations as C Corporations. Wyoming does not have any state taxes, so has no need for S Corporations. If you want S Corporation status, and do not have a Wyoming LLC, you must file Form 2553 with the IRS, which is included in the corporate kit we send you, within 75 days from the date of formation of the company or by March 15th of any given tax year.
There are many factors which weigh in on what type of company to form. You should consult with your legal and/or accounting professional to make sure that you make the correct decision between an LLC or corporation.

Wyoming Corporation Benefits Over Nevada Incorporations
Why Wyoming is Better
The Wyoming Advantage
We believe that Wyoming is the best state in America in which to do business and we think we can make you a believer also.  In a moment, we will examine the many advantages of Wyoming LLCs and aged shelf companies, but let’s first take a look at what it doesn’t have:
Wyoming doesn’t have:

Personal income tax
Corporate income tax
Inventory tax
Gross receipts tax
Franchise tax
Burdensome regulations
Disclosure of shareholders
Business or “per-capita” tax
Excise tax
Sales, property and inheritance taxes are among the lowest in America

… AND CONSIDER THESE ADVANTAGES OF INCORPORATING IN WYOMING

Unlimited ability to issue stock — Most states set a limit on the number of shares that you are authorized to issue. Not with a Wyoming Corporation! You may issue as many shares as you wish (without any additional costs or fees) by simply making the proper entries in your Articles of Incorporation. (We will take care of all that for you.) Unlimited shares may be of paramount importance to you in particular, if you ever contemplate taking your company public.


You can be everything in Wyoming — Some states require that you have more than one person to serve as the various officers and directors of your corporation.  Again, not so in Wyoming!  One person can fill all of the required corporate positions, giving you the ultimate in flexibility and control.


You have a right to privacy with a Wyoming Corporation— The more information about you that appears in the public record, the easier it is for you to become a target of a lawsuit.  Wyoming has no requirement for the names of shareholders to be filed with the state.


Restrictions and corporate formalities are at an absolute minimum in Wyoming — If you would like less “red tape,” bureaucracy and restrictions in your business life, Wyoming is the place for you!


Low annual fees — The annual fees in Wyoming are based solely on the value of corporate assets located within the state. The minimum is $50 and a million dollars worth of assets within the state of Wyoming would cost you only $200. That’s right, $200 in fees for every million dollars worth of assets that you keep within the state of Wyoming and no fees for assets outside of the state.


As an officer or director, you cannot be held responsible for the debts of the corporation — Wyoming law is quite strong in this respect and holds generally that as long as you did not intentionally break the law, you are protected from claims against the corporation.


No minimum capitalization is required in Wyoming — You can fund your corporation with one dollar, with a million dollars, or the amount of your choice. And, while there are sound business reasons of avoiding “under capitalization,” the point is that the choice is yours and you enjoy the ultimate in flexibility.


Your directors” and/or shareholders” meetings may be held anywhere in the world — You are not required to hold meetings in Wyoming; indeed, you need never set foot within the state. Wyoming is rich in history and breathtaking scenery, but if your tastes run more to the Bahamas, Hawaii or, for that matter, the French Riviera, the choice is yours.


Stock in your Wyoming corporation may be issued in exchange for “anything of value” — You may use cash, of course, but also property, services or any valuable consideration at the total discretion of the board of directors which, you’ll remember, can be one person.


Lifetime proxy — John D. Rockefeller was the first individual to acquire a personal net worth of one billion dollars.  When asked late in life how he accomplished such a feat, he is reported to have shared with a young interviewer that his simple secret was to “own nothing and control everything.”  That is indeed wonderful advice for a host of reasons (consider, no one can take from you that which you do not own), but it is sometimes more easily said than done. By allowing another person or entity to own shares, you can use proxies to maintain complete control.  The problem is that most state laws require proxies to expire and be subsequently renewed every six or seven years.  If the “legal owner” declined to renew your proxy, you could be literally left with nothing and no recourse.  That is hardly a scenario that makes us feel secure, nor is it one that we would recommend to you.  However, realize that Wyoming allows for lifetime proxies, thereby protecting you from any such problem arising.
If you already have a corporation  — Once again, Wyoming offers unparalleled flexibility.  By filing a few simple forms (we will handle it for you start to finish), your existing corporation can become a bona fide Wyoming corporation.  Wait it gets even better!  Your existing corporation can retain its original incorporation date after becoming a Wyoming corporation.  Anyone examining the Wyoming public record will see a corporation dating back as far as your current corporation does.  You can promptly become a Wyoming corporation without losing the many benefits of your firm’s longevity and continuity of operation.
Be sure and check.  No matter if you are moving a company,  forming a new one, or looking to purchase,  check with your attorney to see if your company is doing anything that would require it to be registered in more than one state.

As you can see, there are numerous Wyoming corporation advantages that make it a better state to do business in. You can find countless other reasons as to why Wyoming is such a perfect environment for corporations here on our site or by contacting us at 1-800-990-0433.

Wyoming vs Nevada vs Delaware 
Where You Should Incorporate
 Nevada-vs-Wyoming –Delaware – Side By Side Comparison –Why Wyoming
Nevada vs. Wyoming
Wyoming state fees are 92% less than Nevada’s!  Just add that Wyoming corporation advantage up.  Be sure and include the Nevada “hidden” officer filing fees of $125 that you learn about only after you start your company there, a fee Nevada will hit you within 30 days after you start your company, and the $150, or more, filing fee based upon how many shares you want to be able to issue.   Oh, and add to that the state business license fee of $500 per year for a corporation!  You are going to be paying at least $625 per year, or more, in Nevada for a corporation, before any other services!
Wyoming has no business license fees or officer filing fees. This means we can deliver a quality company package for much less than you would pay in Nevada. And, your Wyoming state renewal fee is $50, in most cases, 92% less than what you will pay in Nevada. And, the nice thing about Wyoming is that is not the only reason to incorporate here.  Wyoming is one of the most cost effective states to incorporate in and also to maintain in following years.  We even offer shelf company services (Click here for pricing.)
According to the new 2016 edition of the Tax Foundation’s State Business Tax Climate Index, “Wyoming has the most business-friendly tax system of any state,” for the past 7 years in a row.
Perhaps you’re one of those who have read all the web sites that promote incorporating your business in Nevada. Here are some reasons explaining why we think Wyoming is the best state to incorporate:
1. Nevada does not share information with the IRS.
Wyoming Answer: Nevada makes the IRS mad. Wyoming does share information with the IRS, but only the information given by companies with real assets inside the state.  So the IRS is not targeting you because you are in a non-friendly state (like they may in Nevada).
2. Nevada allows bearer shares.
Wyoming Answer: Nevada’s law did not say anything about bearer shares, but that law was changed in 2007 to disallow bearer shares.  If you think you need bearer shares, call us first.  You are most likely being misled.  All states have outlawed bearer shares.
3. Nevada has privacy.
Wyoming Answer: Go to the Secretary of State of Nevada’s web site and type in a person’s last name and/or first name.  You will see a list of all companies that person is a part of in Nevada.  Go to the Secretary of State of Wyoming’s website and you will find that the only way to search on a company is by company name.  You cannot search using a person’s name.
4. No taxes in Nevada.
Wyoming Answer: No state income taxes on people or companies in Wyoming and Wyoming is not considering any–, Nevada is.  As of July of 2015 Nevada installed a corporate gross receipts tax (no deductions allowed), for some corporations.  That will mean that some companies in Nevada will pay more in state taxes than they would in California!  In fact some Nevada companies will be paying one of the highest state taxes in the nation!
Don’t gamble on Nevada; research Nevada incorporation myths.
Exploding the Delaware Myth
You may have heard that Delaware is the “incorporation capital” of America. It’s true!  More than 60% of Fortune 500 companies are incorporated in Delaware.  If you own a Fortune 500 company (and for your sake, we hope you do) then, by all means, you should strongly consider incorporating in Delaware.  However, if you are a small- or medium-sized business that is more concerned with tax benefits, flexibility, privacy and a minimum of bureaucracy and “red tape,” then Wyoming is the clear choice for you.
You see, Delaware has an excellent body of corporate case law spanning 110 years regarding such matters as management/shareholder issues and mergers/acquisitions.  That’s precisely why the Fortune 500 are drawn to the state of Delaware.  Delaware laws tend to be “pro-management” when it comes to minority shareholder disputes.  Huge public companies have literally hundreds of such disputes pending in the courts on any given day.  So, if you are managing a Fortune 500 company, Delaware’s case law offers many insights into what you can and cannot do, and what the likely consequences may be.  Unfortunately, Delaware also has corporate income tax, personal income tax, a state franchise tax, reporting requirements, and regulations compelling disclosure of substantial amounts of information resulting in far less privacy for you.  We are always surprised at how many otherwise knowledgeable professionals advise their small business/ entrepreneur clients to incorporate in Delaware.  Well intentioned though it may be, it is not sound advice.
Perhaps you’re one of those who received such advice and have incorporated your business in Delaware.  It’s not too late!  Refer to the preceding section and you will see that we can easily “move” your corporation to Wyoming and enjoy the advantages, while preserving the original incorporation date.

Why Wyoming
As you can see from the above list, when comparing Nevada vs. Wyoming incorporation advantages, Wyoming has several that Nevada does not.
Also, with the changes that Nevada has made to its laws, in 2003, 2005, 2009, 2012 and in 2015, Wyoming has become the best state in the nation to incorporate in.
If you are comparing price, Wyoming is about 65% less to incorporate in than Nevada.
Another thing that they will not tell you about Nevada.  The state is running a deficit and the Nevada State Legislature has been trying to pass a corporate income tax.  They did pass a gross receipts tax in 2015, which is the worst tax there is, since it does not allow for deductions.
Wyoming is not considering any business income tax.  Don’t gamble on Nevada passing more laws that could cost you more taxes after you incorporate there. Contact us to start your company in the best state to incorporate today!

Prepare & File the Articles of Organization



We will review the information, prepare your incorporation documents, and send them to the
state of formation.


























Certified Copy - Articles of Organization




That Certified Copy is an additional document that will be included with the filed Articles
for your company. It is from the Colorado Secretary of State and it is electronically signed and affixed with the Colorado State Seal and the signature of the Secretary. This provides additional supporting documentation as to the official nature of the filing.


























Certified Copy - Articles of Organization




That Certified Copy is an additional document that will be included with the filed Articles
for your company. It is from the California Secretary of State and it is electronically signed and affixed with the California State Seal and the signature of the Secretary. This provides additional supporting documentation as to the official nature of the filing.


























CL-1 Preparation & filing of the Initial Annual Report.




When filing for a corporation in South Carolina, the SC Secretary of State requires that an initial annual report be filed along with the necessary corporate charter documents. This initial report is the Form CL-1, and the state charges a fee of $25 for this in addition to the standard state corporate filing fee. We prepare and submit the Form CL-1 along with the Articles of Incorporation and all fees as required by the state for your new corporation.


























Preparation & filing of the Initial Annual Report




When filing for a new business in Washington, the WA Secretary of State requires that an initial annual report be filed along with the necessary corporate charter documents. The state charges a fee of $10 for this in addition to the standard state filing fee. We prepare and submit the initial Annual Report along with the Articles of Incorporation and all fees as required by the state for your new business entity.


























IRS Form 2553 Preparation



The 2553 Form, known as the Subchapter S election (or Election for Small Business), is required to be filed with the IRS to obtain S-Corporation status for purposes of federal taxation. Filing this Form with the IRS is used to convert a C-Corporation into an S-Corporation. IncFile.com will prepare the form and forward it to you (as it requires the signatures of the initial shareholders), along with instructions that include where to sign and submit the form.

IMPORTANT: Please note the Form 2553 is time sensitive and must be filed with the IRS within 75 days of your corporation filing date in order to obtain S-corporation tax status for the current year.



























NYS Form CT-6 Preparation



Unlike most states, New York has a state level of S-Corporation tax status, similar to the Federal S-corporation tax status. A Federal S-corporation may (but is not required to) elect to be taxed as a New York S-corporation by filing Form CT‑6 . When S-corporation is selected as the entity type, IncFile.com will also prepare the form CT-6 for your corporation, along with the Federal S-corporation election, free of charge. NOTE: The form will require the signature(s) of the initial shareholders. IncFile.com will prepare this form and return it to you with your filed corporation, and it will just need to be signed and dated where indicated, and submitted to the state (included with the instructions).

IMPORTANT: Please note the Form CT-6 is time sensitive and must be filed with the the state within 75 days of your corporation filing date in order to obtain the NYS S-corporation tax status for the current year.


























Unlimited Name Availability Searches



We conduct a thorough name search with the state corporation database and will work with you
as
long as needed to find an available company
name.

Does the price quoted include the state filing fee?

Yes, the price you see at the bottom of the page includes the state prescribed fee that is

Yes, although we offer 1 free year of Registered Agent service you will be permitted to
provide your own Registered Agent.



Will I need to sign anything?

Why Wyoming LLC and Corporations
Why Incorporate in Wyoming
Wyoming LLC fees and other expenses are less than most other states. Wyoming has no business license fees or officer filing fees.  This means we can deliver a quality company package with Wyoming LLC forms for much less than you would pay in Nevada or Delaware.  And, if you incorporate in Wyoming, your state renewal fee is, in most cases, $50, that is 92% less than what you will pay in Nevada for a corporation.
Click here to compare states.  Wyoming is also one of the most cost effective states to incorporate in and also to maintain, in the following years.  (Click here for pricing.)
Wyoming Corporate Services shows you why you should form a Wyoming LLC or corporation here. 
Asset Protection
A Wyoming LLC formation or corporation offers its officers and directors the highest degree of protection from lawsuits filed by disgruntled creditors or overzealous plaintiff attorneys.  Doing business as a Wyoming Corporation or LLC can give you advantages like asset protection and business privacy.
The first LLC statutes in the United States were instituted in Wyoming in 1977 and changed in 2010 to stay current with the times.  Since Wyoming has had limited liability companies available longer than any other state and has the strongest laws protecting members and managers of an LLC, we feel it is the state of choice for establishing LLC’s.
Privacy
Wyoming does not require the manager nor the members of a Wyoming LLC to be listed on a public database.   Nevada requires a tax ID number of the company and personal guarantee by you on the state’s business license.
Fast Wyoming Companies
For new Wyoming Corporation or Wyoming LLC formation, we can have your certified documents filed, stamped and returned to us by the state within 1 business day, after you place your order!   Just check the box for that service, in the “extra services” area of the order form.
Freedom
If you have a Wyoming LLC,  you can operate your Corporation and live anywhere in the world; you do not have to be a US citizen to incorporate in Wyoming.  But, in order to give substance to your operation, you should know about our Office Service Contract and learn how use of this inexpensive option will give “presence” to your remote corporate operations.  And, if you are not a US Citizen, we have a section for you to read here.
No State Taxes
Among the many other advantages of incorporation here, there are no State taxes for Wyoming LLCs. If you choose to incorporate in Wyoming, your company may not pay State taxes at all.  Stop for a minute and think what you paid last year in your States income tax.
If you are comparing Nevada and Wyoming LLCs, keep in mind that the Nevada has voted in a bill as of June 2015 installing a corporate gross receipts tax (no deductions allowed).  That means that some companies incorporating in Nevada will pay more in Nevada state taxes than they would in California!  This same bill raised the yearly fee for a Nevada corporation by 150%!  Nevada has raised rates on corporations by about 400% in the last 8 years!  Don’t gamble on Nevada.
According to the new 2017 edition of the Tax Foundation’s State Business Tax Climate Index, “Wyoming has the most business-friendly tax system of any state,” for the seventh year in a row.
Easy to move your company to Wyoming
Wyoming has made it easy to move your existing corporation to Wyoming.  You can move it from any other state to Wyoming.  That service is detailed here.
Special Easy-to-Use Wyoming Corporate Structures
Wyoming has Close Corporations.  These are special companies authorized by the Wyoming Legislature for small business owners.  One advantage of these corporations is that there is less paperwork required to keep them going.  Few states have them.  You can read about them here.
Wyoming now has Close LLCs.  Less paperwork.  Easier to manage.  This type of Wyoming LLC is perfect for a closely held family company.  You can see the details here.
Wyoming has Asset Protection Trusts. This is the best asset protection you can get inside the US. Details are here.
Wyoming Corporate Services, Inc. has been in business in Cheyenne, Wyoming since 2003.  We provide full time Resident Agent Services in the state of Wyoming. We specialize in helping you incorporate in “tax free” Wyoming and have strategies to help you lower your tax liability in your home state, increase your asset protection, and give you back your privacy. We think that you will find the information you need on this site to help you with your Wyoming LLC formation.

Single tax at member level upon sale of appreciated assets.  Generally, no tax on distribution of appreciated assets.
Single tax at member level. Potential built-in gains taxed if corp. had appreciated property at time of S corp. election.



LLC Footnotes:
Here are a couple of other points about an LLC vs. a Corporation:
If you are looking for state tax savings, an LLC passes the tax through to the members. So, if the member(s) are in a state where you pay state taxes, you still pay state taxes on the profits that are passed through the LLC.
Also, in an LLC you can allocate the way you want the profits to be distributed and it does not have to be based upon the percentage of ownership. Here is an example: There are two members in an LLC that own it 50/50. However, one member is an investor only, who wants to protect his/her investment by controlling 50% of the company. But, the other member is the one doing all the work and who wants more than 50% of the profit. Just write in the agreement that the working member gets 75% of the profits, even though he/she only own 50% of the business.
S-Corp Footnotes
Here’s a point about the S-Corporation that could give people paying themselves a salary, an edge. With an S-Corp as long as you pay yourself a reasonable salary, you can take the balance as profit income. This could lower the amount of self-employment taxes that you have to pay.
Also, in Wyoming we establish all corporations as C Corporations. Wyoming does not have any state taxes, so has no need for S Corporations. If you want S Corporation status, and do not have a Wyoming LLC, you must file Form 2553 with the IRS, which is included in the corporate kit we send you, within 75 days from the date of formation of the company or by March 15th of any given tax year.
There are many factors which weigh in on what type of company to form. You should consult with your legal and/or accounting professional to make sure that you make the correct decision between an LLC or corporation.

Wyoming Corporation Benefits Over Nevada Incorporations
Why Wyoming is Better
The Wyoming Advantage
We believe that Wyoming is the best state in America in which to do business and we think we can make you a believer also.  In a moment, we will examine the many advantages of Wyoming LLCs and aged shelf companies, but let’s first take a look at what it doesn’t have:
Wyoming doesn’t have:

Personal income tax
Corporate income tax
Inventory tax
Gross receipts tax
Franchise tax
Burdensome regulations
Disclosure of shareholders
Business or “per-capita” tax
Excise tax
Sales, property and inheritance taxes are among the lowest in America

… AND CONSIDER THESE ADVANTAGES OF INCORPORATING IN WYOMING

Unlimited ability to issue stock — Most states set a limit on the number of shares that you are authorized to issue. Not with a Wyoming Corporation! You may issue as many shares as you wish (without any additional costs or fees) by simply making the proper entries in your Articles of Incorporation. (We will take care of all that for you.) Unlimited shares may be of paramount importance to you in particular, if you ever contemplate taking your company public.


You can be everything in Wyoming — Some states require that you have more than one person to serve as the various officers and directors of your corporation.  Again, not so in Wyoming!  One person can fill all of the required corporate positions, giving you the ultimate in flexibility and control.


You have a right to privacy with a Wyoming Corporation— The more information about you that appears in the public record, the easier it is for you to become a target of a lawsuit.  Wyoming has no requirement for the names of shareholders to be filed with the state.


Restrictions and corporate formalities are at an absolute minimum in Wyoming — If you would like less “red tape,” bureaucracy and restrictions in your business life, Wyoming is the place for you!


Low annual fees — The annual fees in Wyoming are based solely on the value of corporate assets located within the state. The minimum is $50 and a million dollars worth of assets within the state of Wyoming would cost you only $200. That’s right, $200 in fees for every million dollars worth of assets that you keep within the state of Wyoming and no fees for assets outside of the state.


As an officer or director, you cannot be held responsible for the debts of the corporation — Wyoming law is quite strong in this respect and holds generally that as long as you did not intentionally break the law, you are protected from claims against the corporation.


No minimum capitalization is required in Wyoming — You can fund your corporation with one dollar, with a million dollars, or the amount of your choice. And, while there are sound business reasons of avoiding “under capitalization,” the point is that the choice is yours and you enjoy the ultimate in flexibility.


Your directors” and/or shareholders” meetings may be held anywhere in the world — You are not required to hold meetings in Wyoming; indeed, you need never set foot within the state. Wyoming is rich in history and breathtaking scenery, but if your tastes run more to the Bahamas, Hawaii or, for that matter, the French Riviera, the choice is yours.


Stock in your Wyoming corporation may be issued in exchange for “anything of value” — You may use cash, of course, but also property, services or any valuable consideration at the total discretion of the board of directors which, you’ll remember, can be one person.


Lifetime proxy — John D. Rockefeller was the first individual to acquire a personal net worth of one billion dollars.  When asked late in life how he accomplished such a feat, he is reported to have shared with a young interviewer that his simple secret was to “own nothing and control everything.”  That is indeed wonderful advice for a host of reasons (consider, no one can take from you that which you do not own), but it is sometimes more easily said than done. By allowing another person or entity to own shares, you can use proxies to maintain complete control.  The problem is that most state laws require proxies to expire and be subsequently renewed every six or seven years.  If the “legal owner” declined to renew your proxy, you could be literally left with nothing and no recourse.  That is hardly a scenario that makes us feel secure, nor is it one that we would recommend to you.  However, realize that Wyoming allows for lifetime proxies, thereby protecting you from any such problem arising.
If you already have a corporation  — Once again, Wyoming offers unparalleled flexibility.  By filing a few simple forms (we will handle it for you start to finish), your existing corporation can become a bona fide Wyoming corporation.  Wait it gets even better!  Your existing corporation can retain its original incorporation date after becoming a Wyoming corporation.  Anyone examining the Wyoming public record will see a corporation dating back as far as your current corporation does.  You can promptly become a Wyoming corporation without losing the many benefits of your firm’s longevity and continuity of operation.
Be sure and check.  No matter if you are moving a company,  forming a new one, or looking to purchase,  check with your attorney to see if your company is doing anything that would require it to be registered in more than one state.

As you can see, there are numerous Wyoming corporation advantages that make it a better state to do business in. You can find countless other reasons as to why Wyoming is such a perfect environment for corporations here on our site or by contacting us at 1-800-990-0433.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
