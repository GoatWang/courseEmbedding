balanced fund quarterly report
June 30, 2017

	Economic Commentary
	


                    Volatility surrounding Trump�s presidency continues to fuel uncertainty in global markets. We have started to
see a shift in policy from central banks around the world. The accommodative monetary policies that markets
have become accustomed to are nearing their end as reflationary forces are surfacing. In particular, in Canada,
which has seen strong economic growth and employment, the central bank has altered its interest rate outlook
and has moved from the possibility of a potential rate cut to a near-term rate hike. The Canadian dollar has
rallied dramatically on this change in sentiment by the Bank of Canada as the market was not contemplating
any movement in the bank rate for the balance of the year. The strong performance of the loonie is somewhat
surprising given the depressed oil market. Lower prices and elevated inventory levels have had a negative
impact on the oil market. The U.S. Federal Reserve hiked rates for the second time this year at their June
meeting. However, market expectations for the next hike have been pushed out possibly until early 2018, likely
due to lower than expected inflation. In Europe, the central bank has shifted their outlook as reflationary forces
have become evident and they hinted at a possible winding down of their quantitative easing program. The
Eurozone economy has grown steadily over the past four years and the unemployment rate has declined.

Investment Process
The portfolio construction process for balanced portfolios incorporates the development of a tactical asset allocation policy by the investment team that reflects the relative valuation of the component asset classes.
Our asset class valuation methodology factors in the long-term earnings power of corporations and the level of long-term interest rates.  This top-down determination may be adjusted to reflect the input of the asset class specialists with respect to their analyses of values from a bottom-up perspective.  The process is not designed to generate frequent changes in asset mix policy but rather to indicate when asset classes are significantly mispriced. 
The structuring of the equity component of the Fund is the responsibility of a team of portfolio managers, each of whom has assigned global sector responsibilities.  Their focus is on identifying mispriced securities through independent fundamental research supported by proprietary valuation models.
The fixed income team collaborates on the development of duration and sector allocation policy.  Each team member is accountable for specific value-added strategies which combined support those primary policies.

June 30, 2017 - President Trump
Donald Trump’s election victory has created a
great deal of economic uncertainty around the
world. Allegations that Trump divulged secrets to
the Russians as well as interfered with the
subsequent FBI investigation have cast doubt on
the credibility of his presidency. There have also
been delays in Trump’s implementation of his
campaign promises. He has yet to table a health
care reform bill that will receive senate approval
and his reform of the tax code keeps getting
pushed back, with the possibility that it may not
occur until next year. All of these issues create
uncertainty in global financial markets.l class="links">

Lincluden Investment Management Ltd.
Head office:
Mississauga, ON

Assets Managed:
US $18 Billion (2016-06-30)




                "Lincluden Investment Management is a colossal investment talent that has quietly built a reputation of value investing know-how for more than 30 years. Their ability to interpret the Canadian dividend landscape and translate that into investment success year over year is why we are so excited for our investors of the NEI Northwest Canadian Dividend Fund."
            
- Daniel Solomon, Chief Investment Officer, NEI Investments


Company Profile

                Lincluden Investment Management (Lincluden) is an employee owned (40% employees / 60% Morguard Investment) investment management firm headquartered in Mississauga, Canada with combined assets under management (AUM) of $18B. Founded in 1982, Lincluden invests in a broad spectrum of asset classes for institutional clients, that include equity, fixed income, balanced and real estate. They adhere to a strict value philosophy across all their products.
            

Investment Approach

                Lincluden's approach to Canadian dividends is rooted in a time-tested value discipline that focuses on uncovering mispriced securities and identifying great businesses with a focus on long-term investing. Fundamental to this approach is the proprietary and independent research conducted within the firm, that quantitatively grades and qualifies companies on their business & financial quality, historical volatility and valuation attractiveness. 
                

                    Companies are assigned an overall business quality score based on the aggregation of the aforementioned criteria and selected according to their quality, required price discount, targeted yield and maximum weighting within the portfolio. Capital protection is paramount in this investment approach, and Lincluden exercises a strong sell discipline when a valuation target has been achieved or a change in company fundamentals occurs.
