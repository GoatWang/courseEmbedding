    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

History[edit]
Federated Investors was founded in 1955 by high school classmates John F. Donahue, Richard B. Fisher, and Thomas J. Donnelly.[3]
Aetna acquired a majority ownership stake in Federated Investors in 1982; at the time Federated had nearly $30 billion in assets under management.[4] In 1989, Federated management bought out Aetna for $345 million, reestablishing majority control of the company.[5] In 1996, Federated management paid $100 million to acquire the remaining 25% stock ownership still held by Aetna.[6] Federated completed an initial public offering on the NYSE on May 14, 1998.[7]
In 1991 Federated established Federated International Management Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary in Dublin, Ireland, becoming the first U.S. company whose registered money market funds were approved for distribution to the European community. In 1998, Federated launched a venture with Frankfurt insurer LVM-Versicherungen to offer Federated funds in Germany and other German-speaking countries.[8]
In April 2012 Federated Investors, Inc. completed its acquisition of Prime Rate Capital Management LLP (PRCM), a London, United Kingdom-based provider of institutional liquidity and fixed income products, from Matrix Group Limited they did not purchase this company. Federated Prime Rate Capital Management's AAA-rated liquidity funds, known as Qualifying Money Market Funds, serve the corporate and institutional market. The funds, totaling approximately $4.0 billion USD (GBP 2.5 billion) in assets, are rated AAA by both Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings.[9]
In September 2012, Federated Investors announced that it had bought around $4.4 billion in assets from Fifth Third Asset Management Inc.[10]

History[edit]
Federated Investors was founded in 1955 by high school classmates John F. Donahue, Richard B. Fisher, and Thomas J. Donnelly.[3]
Aetna acquired a majority ownership stake in Federated Investors in 1982; at the time Federated had nearly $30 billion in assets under management.[4] In 1989, Federated management bought out Aetna for $345 million, reestablishing majority control of the company.[5] In 1996, Federated management paid $100 million to acquire the remaining 25% stock ownership still held by Aetna.[6] Federated completed an initial public offering on the NYSE on May 14, 1998.[7]
In 1991 Federated established Federated International Management Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary in Dublin, Ireland, becoming the first U.S. company whose registered money market funds were approved for distribution to the European community. In 1998, Federated launched a venture with Frankfurt insurer LVM-Versicherungen to offer Federated funds in Germany and other German-speaking countries.[8]
In April 2012 Federated Investors, Inc. completed its acquisition of Prime Rate Capital Management LLP (PRCM), a London, United Kingdom-based provider of institutional liquidity and fixed income products, from Matrix Group Limited they did not purchase this company. Federated Prime Rate Capital Management's AAA-rated liquidity funds, known as Qualifying Money Market Funds, serve the corporate and institutional market. The funds, totaling approximately $4.0 billion USD (GBP 2.5 billion) in assets, are rated AAA by both Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings.[9]
In September 2012, Federated Investors announced that it had bought around $4.4 billion in assets from Fifth Third Asset Management Inc.[10]

Federated Investors, Inc. And EquiTrust Mutual Funds Announce Transition Of Assets






Business Wire




Apr 15, 2011 2:24 PM EDT













 


















































  Federated Investors, Inc. (NYSE: FII), one of the nation's largest investment managers, announced today that it has reached an agreement to reorganize the portfolios of EquiTrust Series Fund, Inc. and EquiTrust Variable Insurance Series Fund into comparable mutual funds managed by Federated. The EquiTrust Mutual Funds, currently managed by FBL Financial Group, Inc. (NYSE: FFG) affiliate EquiTrust Investment Management Services, Inc., consist of approximately $515 million in equity, fixed income and money market assets. The announcement was made by J. Christopher Donahue, president and chief executive officer of Federated Investors, and James E. Hohmann, chief executive officer of FBL Financial Group, Inc.  As a part of the transaction, the portfolios of EquiTrust Series Fund, Inc. and EquiTrust Variable Insurance Series Fund will be transitioned into existing Federated mutual funds with similar investment objectives. The financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed.  “These reorganizations will allow EquiTrust Mutual Fund shareholders to participate in a significantly larger—and more diverse—family of funds with similar investment objectives," said Hohmann. "Federated Investors is a leader in asset management and mutual fund administration, and our boards are confident that our shareholders will benefit from this access to an expanded set of fund options as they focus on their financial goals and objectives."  The boards of directors of Federated Investors, the Federated Funds and the EquiTrust Funds have approved the planned transitions, which are now subject to the approval of EquiTrust Mutual Fund shareholders. It is anticipated that the EquiTrust Mutual Funds’ shareholder meetings to approve these reorganizations will be held in July 2011.  “As the landscape for investment managers has evolved over the past several years, more firms have approached Federated about opportunities for business transactions that help them better accommodate their strategic plans,” said Donahue. “We are pleased EquiTrust chose to work with Federated, and we will continue to look for opportunities to work with insurers, banks and broker-dealers as they evaluate their long-term goals.”

History[edit]
Federated Investors was founded in 1955 by high school classmates John F. Donahue, Richard B. Fisher, and Thomas J. Donnelly.[3]
Aetna acquired a majority ownership stake in Federated Investors in 1982; at the time Federated had nearly $30 billion in assets under management.[4] In 1989, Federated management bought out Aetna for $345 million, reestablishing majority control of the company.[5] In 1996, Federated management paid $100 million to acquire the remaining 25% stock ownership still held by Aetna.[6] Federated completed an initial public offering on the NYSE on May 14, 1998.[7]
In 1991 Federated established Federated International Management Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary in Dublin, Ireland, becoming the first U.S. company whose registered money market funds were approved for distribution to the European community. In 1998, Federated launched a venture with Frankfurt insurer LVM-Versicherungen to offer Federated funds in Germany and other German-speaking countries.[8]
In April 2012 Federated Investors, Inc. completed its acquisition of Prime Rate Capital Management LLP (PRCM), a London, United Kingdom-based provider of institutional liquidity and fixed income products, from Matrix Group Limited they did not purchase this company. Federated Prime Rate Capital Management's AAA-rated liquidity funds, known as Qualifying Money Market Funds, serve the corporate and institutional market. The funds, totaling approximately $4.0 billion USD (GBP 2.5 billion) in assets, are rated AAA by both Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings.[9]
In September 2012, Federated Investors announced that it had bought around $4.4 billion in assets from Fifth Third Asset Management Inc.[10]

Federated Investors, Inc. Announces Plans for Retail Money Market Funds
- Continues to refine product line in response to 2014 money market fund rules

June 04, 2015 08:35

PITTSBURGH, June 4, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Federated Investors, Inc. (NYSE: FII), one of the nation's largest investment managers, today announced further refinements to its plan to restructure the company's line of money market funds by delineating which money market funds will be classified as retail money market funds under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's 2014 rules.  In addition, the company announced a series of planned mergers with the aim of strengthening and streamlining its money market fund offerings.  Federated expects to announce its institutional money market fund product line in the future.  "While Federated's clients don't need to make any changes to their investments now, the planned adjustments to Federated's product line are the result of an active and ongoing dialogue with our large, diversified client base," said J. Christopher Donahue, president and chief executive officer.  "As a leading provider of liquidity management services for 40 years, Federated continues to work with our clients in an effort to meet their liquidity needs today and in the future."Retail money market fundsIf all of the anticipated fund mergers are completed, Federated expects to offer the six retail prime and national municipal funds listed in the table below.  The company also anticipates offering the 13 state-specific money market funds listed below as retail money market funds subject to board approval.  Each of the funds named below will continue to permit institutional investors to invest in the funds until Oct. 14, 2016, when the SEC rule changes go into effect.  Retail prime and national municipal money market fundsFederated Capital Reserves Fund Federated Prime Cash Obligations Fund Federated Municipal Obligations Fund Federated Tax-Free Obligations Fund Federated Municipal Trust Tax-Free Money Market Fund Retail state-specific money market fundsFederated California Municipal Cash TrustFederated New Jersey Municipal Cash TrustFederated Connecticut Municipal Cash TrustFederated New York Municipal Cash TrustFederated Florida Municipal Cash TrustFederated North Carolina Municipal Cash TrustFederated Georgia Municipal Cash TrustFederated Ohio Municipal Cash TrustFederated Massachusetts Municipal Cash TrustFederated Pennsylvania Municipal Cash TrustFederated Michigan Municipal Cash TrustFederated Virginia Municipal Cash TrustFederated Minnesota Municipal Cash TrustEach retail money market fund will continue to seek a stable $1.00 per share net asset value (NAV).  Retail money market mutual funds are defined by the 2014 money market fund rules as funds that have policies and procedures reasonably designed to limit all beneficial owners of the fund to natural persons.  Generally, individuals may continue to invest in retail money market funds through their brokerage account, retirement accounts, education and savings accounts, as well as through ordinary trusts.  Federated Automated Cash Management Trust, Federated Prime Cash Series and Federated Municipal Cash Series are expected to be merged into other retail money market funds before the deadline to designate a fund as retail or institutional.  Money market fund mergersIn an effort to strengthen and streamline its retail money market fund offerings, Federated plans a series of fund mergers for certain prime, municipal and government money market funds.  The three retail and four government money market funds listed below are expected to be merged into designated retail and government money market funds with similar investment objectives and principal investment strategies. Federated began notifying its money market fund shareholders of the planned mergers on June 3, 2015.  Pending any required approvals, the company expects the mergers to be completed in late 2015.  Current retail fundPost-merger fundFederated Automated Cash Management TrustFederated Prime Cash Obligations FundFederated Prime Cash SeriesFederated Prime Cash Obligations FundFederated Municipal Cash SeriesFederated Municipal Obligations Fund Current government fundPost-merger fundFederated Treasury Cash SeriesFederated Trust for U.S. Treasury Obligations Federated Government Cash SeriesFederated Government Obligations FundFederated Liberty U.S. Government Money Market FundFederated Government Reserves FundFederated Automated Government Cash ReservesFederated Government Obligations Tax-Managed FundIn addition to the mergers delineated above, in order to institute the SEC's required changes to Rule 2a-7, Federated plans to conduct a proxy of Money Market Obligations Trust, the registrant for the majority of Federated's money market mutual funds, beginning in late June.Refinements to Federated's money market fund product line will continue to evolve as market, client or regulatory changes/guidance occur before the Oct. 14, 2016, final compliance date for the 2014 money market fund rules. Certain refinements, mergers and other changes also remain subject to fund board, shareholder and other reviews or approvals.  The company continues to work with institutional clients to create various institutional floating net asset value money market funds, separate accounts and private funds in an effort to better meet their liquidity needs.
