Are you considering purchasing a new home? Are you thinking about selling your current home? Or, maybe you're just eager to refinance while interest rates are low?
Whatever the case may be, you'll need to know the value of the property in question. Our home value search can provide you with a wealth of information, and unlike a costly appraisal, it's completely free.
Our home prices are calculated using a proprietary algorithm that takes recent comparable sales, neighborhood data, and specific property information into account when creating a broad property value estimate.
We're not suggesting that you use our home value estimate in lieu of an appraisal from a trained professional when selling, purchasing, or refinancing, but it's the perfect source when you just need a reasonable estimate and you don't want to wait.
In addition to a ballpark value figure, you'll have access to valuable data, incuding transaction histories, home features, mortgage insurance and property tax estimates, and recent local sales.
And if you're looking for mortgage or refinance rates, you'll find them right there, right where you need them: on our price estimate page.
Whether you're just daydreaming or you've started hunting for a home in earnest, we hope you'll find our free home pricing page to be a valuable research tool.

What Will Be the Lasting Impact of Brexit on US Mortgages?
Steve Cook
 Although Britain will not actually implement June’s Brexit referendum to leave the European Union until next March at the earliest, it has already made a major impact on US mortgage rates. Will the long term impact of Brexit be as significant?
Within days of the referendum, uncertainty about the potential impact of Brexit on European economies caused investors to sell riskier global stocks and buy safer...

    See all 9 reviews5.0 out of 5 starsthis thing is sturdy and has worked very well during my trainingByFather Abrahamon December 26, 2014Verified PurchaseBeen using this for flight training the last 6 months or so. I've heard David Clark is hard to go wrong with and I have to agree, this thing is sturdy and has worked very well during my training. I like the robustness of the military style headsets and am very impressed with the quality of the conversion over to make this a two-plug GA model. Works very well. Microphone has to be basically touching your lips, but I think that is by design and it works well when located correctly. The adjustable volume knob on the side is also pretty handy. They have the regular foam earpieces, but I don't find them to be uncomfortable even on long flights. I may upgrade to the gel earpieces at some point because its relatively inexpensive, but I'm really not in a huge hurry, they totally meet my needs as they are. I'm sure I'll have these things for many years to come.0Comment|

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsBest headset for the priceByJ. Luffon December 9, 2015Verified PurchaseGreat quality for an unbeatable price. I wish I had a David Clark headset from day one in my flight training, and now I can finally say, "Yes, it is a David Clark."  The fit can be set pretty much perfectly if you take the time to preflight it properly, and I haven't found a reputable FBO yet that doesn't stock replacement parts for David Clark headsets yet. If your looking for the last headset you'll ever have to buy as a General Aviation pilot, look no further. Absolutely would buy again (won't have to though) and I always recommend David Clarks to aspiring pilots.0Comment|
