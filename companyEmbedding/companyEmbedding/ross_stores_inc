History[edit]




A Ross store in Hillsboro, Oregon


Ross Department Store was first opened in San Bruno, California, in 1950 by Morris "Morrie" Ross. Morris would work 85 hours a week doing all of the buying and bookkeeping for his department store. In 1958 Ross sold his store to William Isaacson to become a residential and commercial real estate developer.[5]Isaacson built the company to six stores, located in San Bruno, Pacifica, Novato, Vacaville, Redwood City, and Castro Valley. In 1982 a group of investors, including Mervin Morris, founder of the Mervyns chain of department stores, purchased the six Ross Department Stores in San Francisco, changed the format to off-price retail units, and within three years rapidly expanded the chain to 107 stores under Stuart Moldaw and Don Rowlett.[6][7] By the end of 1995 the chain reached an annual sales of $1.4 billion with 292 stores in 18 states. By 2012 Ross reached $9.7 billion for the fiscal year with 1,091 stores in 33 states with an additional 108 for Dd's Discounts in 8 states.[8] Ross moved it's headquarters from Newark to Pleasanton, California, in the Tri-Valley area, in 2003.
Barbara Rentler took the place of CEO Michael Balmuth on June 1, 2014, thereby becoming the 25th woman chief executive officer of a Fortune 500 company, Ross Stores.[9] Ross also moved it's headquarter from Pleasanton to neighboring Dublin in 2014.[10]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

History[edit]




A Ross store in Hillsboro, Oregon


Ross Department Store was first opened in San Bruno, California, in 1950 by Morris "Morrie" Ross. Morris would work 85 hours a week doing all of the buying and bookkeeping for his department store. In 1958 Ross sold his store to William Isaacson to become a residential and commercial real estate developer.[5]Isaacson built the company to six stores, located in San Bruno, Pacifica, Novato, Vacaville, Redwood City, and Castro Valley. In 1982 a group of investors, including Mervin Morris, founder of the Mervyns chain of department stores, purchased the six Ross Department Stores in San Francisco, changed the format to off-price retail units, and within three years rapidly expanded the chain to 107 stores under Stuart Moldaw and Don Rowlett.[6][7] By the end of 1995 the chain reached an annual sales of $1.4 billion with 292 stores in 18 states. By 2012 Ross reached $9.7 billion for the fiscal year with 1,091 stores in 33 states with an additional 108 for Dd's Discounts in 8 states.[8] Ross moved it's headquarters from Newark to Pleasanton, California, in the Tri-Valley area, in 2003.
Barbara Rentler took the place of CEO Michael Balmuth on June 1, 2014, thereby becoming the 25th woman chief executive officer of a Fortune 500 company, Ross Stores.[9] Ross also moved it's headquarter from Pleasanton to neighboring Dublin in 2014.[10]

ROSS STORES, INC. 
 
Product Sourcing and Human Rights 
 
 
 
Approach to Sourcing and Human Rights 
 
At Ross Stores, Inc. (“Ross”), which includes Ross Dress for Less and dd’s DISCOUNTS chains, 
ethical business practices are at the core of our culture and can be seen every day in the way we 
treat our constituents, from customers and associates to vendors and investors.  This focus on 
ethical business practices is also reflected in Ross’ policy that we will not knowingly purchase 
merchandise from any manufacturer involved in the use of child, slave, prison, or forced labor. 
 
Ross is an off-price retailer with more than 1,000 stores across the country.  The majority of the 
apparel, footwear, accessories, and home-related merchandise sold in our stores are purchased 
from suppliers after they have been produced and imported to other retailers’ specifications. 
 
Though Ross does not have direct control over the manufacturing processes for these 
products, we require suppliers to uphold our ethical standards, both contractually and 
through enforcement.  While Ross orders and imports some products directly through its 
international buying agents and from manufacturers, they represent the minority of merchandise 
sold in our stores.  For these items, we have additional requirements in place to further 
compliance. 
 
Ross’ standards and requirements related to sourcing and human rights are incorporated in various 
Company documents, including Ross’ Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, Vendor 
Compliance Manual, Purchase Orders, Vendor Indemnification Agreements, and Buying Agent 
Agreements. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is located under Corporate Governance 
in the Investors section of www.rossstores.com and our Vendor Compliance Manual can be 
found at http://partners.rossstores.com. 
 
Ross communicates its standards and requirements to vendors, buyers and overseas buying agents 
during our purchasing processes. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ROSS STORES, INC. 5130 Hacienda Drive, Dublin, CA  94568 (925) 965-4400 
 
 
Ross’ Sourcing and Human Rights Standards 
 
Vendors, manufacturers, and other business partners of the Company are required to comply with 
all applicable federal, state, local, and international laws relating to the manufacture and production 
of products sold to Ross, including compliance with all applicable laws relating to labor 
compensation, working conditions, child, slave, prison or forced labor, environmental protection, 
product safety, corruption or bribery (including foreign corrupt practices), building and working 
condition safety, and similar obligations. 
 
Ross will not knowingly purchase any product whose manufacture involved the use of any child, 
slave, prison or forced labor; any labor where workers are not provided wages or safe working 
environments as required by law; or products made in violation of established environmental or 
consumer product safety requirements. 
 
To the extent contractors or subcontractors are involved in the production of goods supplied to 
Ross, vendors must ensure that these parties adhere to the laws and regulations. 
 
Training and Enforcement of Ross’ Standards 
 
Ross provides initial training for new buying associates, as well as ongoing training and 
updates to buyers and other associates involved in our product sourcing. Further, Ross monitors 
and assesses our supply chain for compliance related to product safety and local, national and 
international labor, and human trafficking laws. 
 
For products sold in our stores for which Ross is the direct importer, the Company requires the 
following: 
 
• Ross trains and instructs overseas buying agents, shippers, product testing lab resources, and 
associates involved in imports, on Company standards, and on policies and protocols relating 
to import products. 
• Buying agents are required to conduct in-person inspections of vendor factories,  whether 
announced or unannounced . 
• Ross conducts audits of buying agent inspection reports to verify that they are complete, 
comprehensive and up-to-date. 
• Ross also requires its overseas buying agents to request available third-party factory 
inspection reports of direct import suppliers, and to review those third-party reports and 
disclose any concerns to Ross compliance personnel in the Legal department. 
 
If Ross becomes aware that any vendor has been found to be out of compliance with Ross' 
requirements or procedures regarding the above, including any applicable local, national or 
international labor or human trafficking laws, Ross will take appropriate responsive action, which 
could include suspending shipments of a vendor’s merchandise and/or terminating the business 
relationship.

About ROSS STORES, INC.


   Ross wants you to dress for less. A leading off-price apparel retailer (behind TJX Cos. and Kohl's), Ross operates some 1,370 Ross Dress for Less and nearly 200 dd's Discounts stores that sell closeout merchandise, including men's, women's, and children's clothing, at prices well below those of department and specialty stores. While apparel accounts for more than half of sales, it also sells small furnishings, toys and games, luggage, and jewelry. Featuring the Ross "Dress for Less" trademark, the chain targets 18- to 54-year-old white-collar shoppers from primarily middle-income households. Ross and dd's stores are located in strip malls in over 35 states and mostly in the western US and Guam.
  
Operations

   Ross Stores operates two brands of off-price retail apparel and home fashion stores: Ross Dress for Less and dd's DISCOUNTS. Ross does a roaring trade in off-price apparel and home fashion chain, offering first-quality, in-season, name-brand, and designer apparel, as well as accessories, footwear, and home decor at between 20%-60% off department and specialty store regular prices.
  

   Launched in 2004, dd's DISCOUNTS serves one of the fastest-growing demographic markets in the US. The ultra-low-price spinoff, which offers brand-name apparel at a 20%-70% discount, has grown to almost 200 locations in about 15 states, including big ones such as California, Florida, and Texas. The stores, which average 28,400 square feet, are located in strip shopping centers in urban and suburban neighborhoods.
  

   The retailer operates six distribution processing facilities: three in California, two in South Carolina, and one in Pennsylvania. These distribution centers are the sole source of its stores merchandise. Additionally, the discounter owns four and leases three other warehouse facilities for packaway storage. To distribute merchandise to stores on a regular basis, Ross Stores enlists the help of third-party cross docks. Shipments are made by contract carriers to stores between three and six times per week depending on the location.
  
Geographic Reach
More than 50% of California-based retailer's stores are located in the states of California, Texas, and Florida. The company's distribution centers and warehouses are in Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and California.
Aside from the territory of Guam, Ross does not have an international presence. 
Sales and Marketing

   Ross Stores relies primarily on television as a medium to share the Ross Dress for Less value proposition with its current and potential customers. The company believes that television advertising is the most efficient and cost-effective medium while it continues to use additional channels to build brand awareness. However, advertising for its dd's DISCOUNTS stores is focused on new store grand openings and local grass roots initiatives.
  
Financial Performance

   Ross Stores' annual sales have risen more than 40% since 2011 thanks to rapid store expansion and steady same-store sale growth of between 3% and 7% per year. Its annual profits have kept pace with top line growth over the period as the chain has managed to slow its overhead cost growth.
  

   The fast-growing chain's sales jumped 8% to $12.9 billion -- a $1 billion gain -- during fiscal 2017 (ended January) mostly thanks to continued store growth. Comparable store sales also increased a solid 4%.
Net income was up 10% to $1.1 billion due to lower cost of goods sold, partially offset by higher selling, general, and administrative expenses. Cash from operating activities grew 14% to $1.6 billion due to higher net income.   
Strategy

   Ross Stores continues its aggressive retail expansion strategy, opening additional stores based on market penetration, local demographic characteristics, competition, expected store profitability, and the ability to leverage overhead expenses. The company expects there's room in the US to support at least 2,000 Ross locations and 500 dd's DISCOUNTS locations.
  

   Indeed, the chain has expanded its store count by 40% to 1,533 at the end of 2016 from 1,125 at the end of 2011. During 2016 alone, the retailer added 87 net new stores (including 71 Ross stores) in established regions and in the less-tapped Midwest markets (including its first stores in the Dakotas). It plans to open a further 90 stores in 2017.

   Other objectives the discount chain emphasized in 2016 included: maintaining a sufficient library of well-known brands, labels, and fashions sold with strong discounts; meeting customer needs on a local basis; delivering an "off-price customer" suited shopping experience; and managing effective and competitive store growth in all of its markets.
  

   To boost its relationships with suppliers, Ross does not require them to provide markdown/promotional allowances or return privileges. This, combined with opportunistic purchases (closeouts such as manufacturer overruns and canceled orders), allows the company to obtain large discounts on merchandise. As a result, Ross Stores' customers typically pay 20% to 60% less than department and specialty store prices. Ross holds down costs by offering minimal service and few frills inside its stores.
