SAN DIEGO, June 25, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- OncoSec Medical Inc. ("OncoSec") (NASDAQ:   ONCS), a company developing DNA-based intratumoral cancer immunotherapies, today announced the appointment of Richard B. Slansky as the Company's Chief Financial Officer, effective July 6, 2015. Mr. Slansky is responsible for leading financial operations and activities for OncoSec as well as managing financial plans and budgets. Veronica Vallejo, the current Chief Financial Officer of OncoSec, resigned from her position effective June 24, 2015 to pursue other opportunities. 
"We could not be more pleased to have Richard join our executive team at OncoSec. Richard's seasoned background in strategic financial planning and management of publicly traded companies will help us further advance our clinical programs and achieve future growth objectives," said Punit Dhillon, CEO and President of OncoSec. "We also want to thank Veronica Vallejo, who has served as our Chief Financial Officer since 2011. We deeply appreciate her dedication and valuable contributions to OncoSec's growth."     
Mr. Slansky brings more than 25 years of senior management experience to OncoSec and has a proven track record managing financial investments for life science and technology companies. Prior to joining OncoSec, Mr. Slansky held various financial leadership positions, including: Chief Financial Officer at GenMark Diagnostics, Inc., a publicly traded DNA diagnostics company; Chief Financial Officer at Digirad Corporation, a publicly held specialty nuclear medical device company; and President, Chief Financial Officer and Director at SpaceDev, Inc., a publicly held space technology and aerospace company. 
In his previous positions, Mr. Slansky showed a high success rate in raising capital, as well as balancing fiscal discipline and aggressive growth by cultivating business partnerships between R&D, sales, finance, and operations support. In addition, he has been instrumental in investing in technology and implementing process improvements, which fostered a culture of innovation and operational excellence in his companies. 
Mr. Slansky earned a bachelor's degree in economics and science from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business and a master's degree in business administration in finance and accounting from the University of Arizona. 
As an inducement material to Mr. Slansky entering into employment with OncoSec, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of OncoSec has approved the grant to Mr. Slansky of an option to purchase up to 150,000 shares of its common stock at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of OncoSec's common stock on the July 6, 2015 grant date of the option.  The option will have a term of ten (10) years and will generally be forfeited if not exercised before the expiration of that term, or, if earlier, after the ninetieth (90th) day after termination of Mr. Slansky's employment.  Twenty-five percent (25%) of the shares underlying the award shall vest on the expiration of a ninety (90) day probationary period after the effective date of Mr. Slansky's employment and the remaining seventy-five percent (75%) of the shares underlying the award shall vest in thirty-three (33) equal monthly installments thereafter.  The option will be granted outside of OncoSec's 2011 Equity Incentive Plan, but will be subject to terms similar to those of non-qualified stock options granted under such plan.  This description of the inducement option grant to Mr. Slansky is in satisfaction of the disclosure requirements set forth in NASDAQ Listing Rule 5635(c)(4).

 Digirad names Slansky as CFO 






   

 






 Feb 19, 2009 | Sarah Lamberti  

 



 



 






 Digirad, a provider of diagnostic imaging products, personnel and equipment leasing services, has named Richard B. Slansky as its chief financial officer (CFO), effective March 9. 
He will replace Interim CFO Todd Clyde, who will continue to serve as president and CEO, the company said.  
With more than 25 years of experience as a CFO at both public and private companies, Slansky has served for the past six years as the president and CFO of SpaceDev, a space technology and aerospace company acquired by Sierra Nevada in December 2008, according to the Poway, Calif.-based Digirad. 
Prior to SpaceDev, Slansky served as interim CFO for Woodlands, Tex.-based Quick Strike Resources. He has also served as CFO at Path 1 Network Technologies; Nautronix; Alexis; and Calbiochem-Novabiochem International (aka C-N Biosciences), all located in the San Diego area.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/22/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
