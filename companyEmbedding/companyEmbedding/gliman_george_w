Follow this contractor

















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Minnesota:













Does Gilman, George W carry a valid contracting license?



Licenses are required for all residential building contractors and residential remodelers who contract with a homeowner to construct or improve dwellings by offering more than one special skill. Owners working on their own property must also be licensed if they build or remodel for the sole purpose of speculation or resale.











How important is contractor licensing in Minnesota?



Contractors acting as sole proprietors, or qualifying persons for a construction related business entity, must pass a two part exam. The first section tests building code compliance knowledge. Section two tests a candidate's understanding of Minnesota business and law.











Your liability risk when hiring Gilman, George W



Licensed contractors in Minnesota must carry both active workers' compensation and general liability insurance policies. Request a copy of the insurance certificate for each before any work begins. 











Financial recourse when hiring Gilman, George W



The purpose of the Minnesota Contractor Recovery Fund is to compensate consumers who have suffered losses due to a licensed contractor's fraudulent, deceptive, or dishonest practices, conversion of funds, or failure to perform. All licensed contractors are required to pay a fee to the fund. The total amount that can be paid out against any one licensed contractor is $75,000. If multiple claims are filed against the same contractor, they are prorated. In these situations, you may not be able to recover your entire loss. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Minnesota, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

The Gilman School /ˈɡɪlmən/ is a private preparatory school for boys located in the Roland Park neighborhood of Baltimore, Maryland. Founded in 1897 as the Country School for Boys, it was the 1st country day school in the United States.[2] Gilman enrolls approximately 1,003 students, ranging from kindergarten to 12th grade, under the instruction of 146 faculty members.[1] It is a member of the Association of Independent Maryland Schools[3] and the Maryland Interscholastic Athletic Association.[4]
Described by author C. Fraser Smith as "Baltimore's most prestigious preparatory academy,"[5] Gilman enjoys strong academic and athletic reputations.[6] In 2002, Worth Magazine rated Gilman among the top 30 feeder schools in the U.S.,[7] signifying the high rate of matriculation by Gilman graduates at top colleges and universities.[8] Its graduates are known to be intensely loyal to the school. Approximately 75% of the Board of Trustees are graduates of the school, one of the highest percentages of any educational institution in the United States.[9] Of Gilman's 16 varsity athletic programs, 15 have won conference championships since 2000,[10] and in recent years its football and lacrosse teams have appeared at or near the top of national rankings.[11][12]
The school takes its name from Daniel Coit Gilman, the first president of The Johns Hopkins University and an early supporter of efforts by Anne Galbraith Carey to form an all-boys day school.[13] Prominent graduates of Gilman include author Walter Lord, sportswriter Frank Deford, former Arizona Governor Fife Symington, former Maryland Governor Bob Ehrlich, former United States Senator Daniel Brewster, Congressman John Sarbanes, and internationally renowned composer Christopher Rouse.

History[edit]
Gilman was founded as The Country School for Boys by Baltimore resident Anne Galbraith Carey, with assistance from Daniel Coit Gilman (1831–1908, the first president of Johns Hopkins University, 1876–1908). The school opened its doors on September 30, 1897, in the old "Homewood" Mansion (now known as the Homewood Museum, off North Charles Street, constructed 1800 in Georgian-Federal style architecture, for Charles Carroll Jr. (1775–1825), also known as Charles Carroll of Homewood, son of Charles Carroll of Carrollton (1737–1832), last surviving signer of the Declaration of Independence). By 1910, J.H.U. began moving its campus north from its former downtown location along North Howard Street by Little Ross, West Centre and West Monument Streets, in the neighborhood of Mount Vernon-Belvedere to the newly named "Homewood" campus and constructing its first campus buildings of similar matching Georgian - Federal styles. In 1910, the Country School moved to its current 68-acre (275,000 m²) campus further north in the city to Roland Park, along Roland Avenue, just south of the Belvedere Avenue (and the future Northern Parkway). Here was begun one of the first planned suburban developments in America by the new Roland Park Company in 1891. At that time the institution changed its name to "The Gilman Country School for Boys", in honor of the seminal figure in its founding, Dr. Gilman. In 1951, "Country" was dropped from the name.[14]
Gilman has two sister schools: Bryn Mawr School, across Northern Parkway from Gilman to the north and Roland Park Country School, across Roland Ave to the west. All three schools coordinate some Upper School (grades 9–12) classes to the extent that some classes have students from all three schools.
Academics[edit]




An open-air classroom at Gilman, in use from 1911 to 1922[15]


The school has three divisions: Lower School (kindergarten through grade five), Middle School (grades six through eight) and Upper School (grades nine through twelve).
At the Upper School level, students are required to take courses in history, mathematics, English, science, and a foreign language each semester; an intramural or interscholastic sport each season; and a minimum of art, music, and religion instruction over four years.[16] Students must also fulfill a community service requirement[16] and may choose to participate in a range of extracurricular activities.[17]
A number of courses permit cross-registration by students from two neighboring girls' schools: Bryn Mawr and Roland Park Country School. In turn, Gilman students, primarily seniors, are able to enroll in equivalent courses at these sister schools.[16] Starting junior year, students are allowed to take necessary classes like English and other subjects at the sister schools. The school offers numerous courses, several through the tri-school collaboration. Cross-registration also allows for a variety of languages to be offered, which currently include French, Spanish, Latin, Ancient Greek, Chinese, Russian, Arabic, and German.
Athletics[edit]
Gilman enjoys a tradition of athletic success.[6] Since the year 2000, 12 Gilman varsity teams have won at least one conference championship.[18] Overall, the school sponsors 16 sports; most teams have varsity and junior varsity programs, while some have fresh-soph and/or middle school squads.[19]
Gilman is perhaps best known for its success in football and lacrosse. The football team has won 2 Maryland Interscholastic Athletic Association (MIAA) "A" Conference championships in the last 11 seasons.[18] The 2002 team finished 10–0 and was ranked 14th in the United States by USA Today's Super 25 high school football poll.[20] That team featured the Associated Press's Offensive and Defensive Player of the Year in quarterback Ambrose Wooden and lineman Victor Abiamiri. Both players went on to star at Notre Dame, and Abiamiri now plays for the Philadelphia Eagles. The 2005 team was ranked 12th in the nation in USA Today's Super 25 high school football poll.[21]
The lacrosse team, led by coach, upper school history teacher, and Gilman alumnus (Class of 1987) Brooks Matthews, was ranked the #1 high school team in the United States by LaxPower at the conclusion of both the 2008 and 2009 seasons.[12] The team has captured 15 "A" conference titles in MIAA.[18] The lacrosse program has produced many stars in college lacrosse such as Barney Ehrmann.
During the 2005–06 school year, six Gilman varsity squads (football, golf, ice hockey, squash, tennis & track and field) won conference titles. In 2008–09, the volleyball team won its first MIAA title, while the squash and swimming teams also won conference championships.[18]
Gilman's biggest rival is the McDonogh School,[22] located in suburban Owings Mills. A football game between the two schools has taken place every fall since 1914.[22] Gilman leads this series, 60-35-5, including a win in the 100th game in 2015.[23]

Awards[edit]




Commencement ceremonies held in front of Gilman's Auditorium


Gilman confers over 50 awards at the upper school level for achievement in academics, athletics, student leadership, and extracurricular activities.[28] Most prizes are bestowed on seniors; a smaller number are granted to underclassmen by design or as circumstances warrant. The majority are given on Awards Day, held each year in late May, while a handful of the highest honors are withheld until Founders Day, the day of Gilman's commencement ceremonies.[29]

The William A. Fisher Medallion is accorded to a junior or senior "who has rendered the highest service that can be rendered the School by leadership based on the influence of character."[30]
The William S. Thomas Scholarship Prize, consists of seven awards: six given to the top scholar of grades 8 to 12 and one for the valedictorian, as determined by academic achievement over the course of four years.[30]
The William Cabell Bruce Jr. Athletic Prize honors the upper school student "most conspicuous for general proficiency in athletic sports and exercises over a two-year period."[30]
The Daniel Baker Jr. Memorial is awarded to the senior who "through thoughtfulness and by reason of his character, has contributed to the general welfare of his fellow men."[30]
The Edward Fenimore Award recognizes the senior who has best exemplified the characteristics of "courage, determination, perseverance, and accomplishment."[30]
The Peter Parrott Blanchard Award is given to the upper school student who "by his cheerful helpfulness ... has greatly contributed to the successful and pleasant life in the School."[30]
The Redmond C. S. Finney Award celebrates the student who has distinguished himself "through his dedication to and practice of those human values necessary to eliminate racism, prejudice, and intolerance."[30]
The Daniel C. Ammidon Award recognizes students in grades 6-12 for their "outstanding citizenship and commitment to the Gilman Community."[30]

The Gilman School /ˈɡɪlmən/ is a private preparatory school for boys located in the Roland Park neighborhood of Baltimore, Maryland. Founded in 1897 as the Country School for Boys, it was the 1st country day school in the United States.[2] Gilman enrolls approximately 1,003 students, ranging from kindergarten to 12th grade, under the instruction of 146 faculty members.[1] It is a member of the Association of Independent Maryland Schools[3] and the Maryland Interscholastic Athletic Association.[4]
Described by author C. Fraser Smith as "Baltimore's most prestigious preparatory academy,"[5] Gilman enjoys strong academic and athletic reputations.[6] In 2002, Worth Magazine rated Gilman among the top 30 feeder schools in the U.S.,[7] signifying the high rate of matriculation by Gilman graduates at top colleges and universities.[8] Its graduates are known to be intensely loyal to the school. Approximately 75% of the Board of Trustees are graduates of the school, one of the highest percentages of any educational institution in the United States.[9] Of Gilman's 16 varsity athletic programs, 15 have won conference championships since 2000,[10] and in recent years its football and lacrosse teams have appeared at or near the top of national rankings.[11][12]
The school takes its name from Daniel Coit Gilman, the first president of The Johns Hopkins University and an early supporter of efforts by Anne Galbraith Carey to form an all-boys day school.[13] Prominent graduates of Gilman include author Walter Lord, sportswriter Frank Deford, former Arizona Governor Fife Symington, former Maryland Governor Bob Ehrlich, former United States Senator Daniel Brewster, Congressman John Sarbanes, and internationally renowned composer Christopher Rouse.

History[edit]
Gilman was founded as The Country School for Boys by Baltimore resident Anne Galbraith Carey, with assistance from Daniel Coit Gilman (1831–1908, the first president of Johns Hopkins University, 1876–1908). The school opened its doors on September 30, 1897, in the old "Homewood" Mansion (now known as the Homewood Museum, off North Charles Street, constructed 1800 in Georgian-Federal style architecture, for Charles Carroll Jr. (1775–1825), also known as Charles Carroll of Homewood, son of Charles Carroll of Carrollton (1737–1832), last surviving signer of the Declaration of Independence). By 1910, J.H.U. began moving its campus north from its former downtown location along North Howard Street by Little Ross, West Centre and West Monument Streets, in the neighborhood of Mount Vernon-Belvedere to the newly named "Homewood" campus and constructing its first campus buildings of similar matching Georgian - Federal styles. In 1910, the Country School moved to its current 68-acre (275,000 m²) campus further north in the city to Roland Park, along Roland Avenue, just south of the Belvedere Avenue (and the future Northern Parkway). Here was begun one of the first planned suburban developments in America by the new Roland Park Company in 1891. At that time the institution changed its name to "The Gilman Country School for Boys", in honor of the seminal figure in its founding, Dr. Gilman. In 1951, "Country" was dropped from the name.[14]
Gilman has two sister schools: Bryn Mawr School, across Northern Parkway from Gilman to the north and Roland Park Country School, across Roland Ave to the west. All three schools coordinate some Upper School (grades 9–12) classes to the extent that some classes have students from all three schools.
Academics[edit]

The school has three divisions: Lower School (kindergarten through grade five), Middle School (grades six through eight) and Upper School (grades nine through twelve).
At the Upper School level, students are required to take courses in history, mathematics, English, science, and a foreign language each semester; an intramural or interscholastic sport each season; and a minimum of art, music, and religion instruction over four years.[16] Students must also fulfill a community service requirement[16] and may choose to participate in a range of extracurricular activities.[17]
A number of courses permit cross-registration by students from two neighboring girls' schools: Bryn Mawr and Roland Park Country School. In turn, Gilman students, primarily seniors, are able to enroll in equivalent courses at these sister schools.[16] Starting junior year, students are allowed to take necessary classes like English and other subjects at the sister schools. The school offers numerous courses, several through the tri-school collaboration. Cross-registration also allows for a variety of languages to be offered, which currently include French, Spanish, Latin, Ancient Greek, Chinese, Russian, Arabic, and German.
Athletics[edit]
Gilman enjoys a tradition of athletic success.[6] Since the year 2000, 12 Gilman varsity teams have won at least one conference championship.[18] Overall, the school sponsors 16 sports; most teams have varsity and junior varsity programs, while some have fresh-soph and/or middle school squads.[19]
Gilman is perhaps best known for its success in football and lacrosse. The football team has won 2 Maryland Interscholastic Athletic Association (MIAA) "A" Conference championships in the last 11 seasons.[18] The 2002 team finished 10–0 and was ranked 14th in the United States by USA Today's Super 25 high school football poll.[20] That team featured the Associated Press's Offensive and Defensive Player of the Year in quarterback Ambrose Wooden and lineman Victor Abiamiri. Both players went on to star at Notre Dame, and Abiamiri now plays for the Philadelphia Eagles. The 2005 team was ranked 12th in the nation in USA Today's Super 25 high school football poll.[21]
The lacrosse team, led by coach, upper school history teacher, and Gilman alumnus (Class of 1987) Brooks Matthews, was ranked the #1 high school team in the United States by LaxPower at the conclusion of both the 2008 and 2009 seasons.[12] The team has captured 15 "A" conference titles in MIAA.[18] The lacrosse program has produced many stars in college lacrosse such as Barney Ehrmann.
During the 2005–06 school year, six Gilman varsity squads (football, golf, ice hockey, squash, tennis & track and field) won conference titles. In 2008–09, the volleyball team won its first MIAA title, while the squash and swimming teams also won conference championships.[18]
Gilman's biggest rival is the McDonogh School,[22] located in suburban Owings Mills. A football game between the two schools has taken place every fall since 1914.[22] Gilman leads this series, 60-35-5, including a win in the 100th game in 2015.[23]

Awards[edit]




Commencement ceremonies held in front of Gilman's Auditorium


Gilman confers over 50 awards at the upper school level for achievement in academics, athletics, student leadership, and extracurricular activities.[28] Most prizes are bestowed on seniors; a smaller number are granted to underclassmen by design or as circumstances warrant. The majority are given on Awards Day, held each year in late May, while a handful of the highest honors are withheld until Founders Day, the day of Gilman's commencement ceremonies.[29]

The William A. Fisher Medallion is accorded to a junior or senior "who has rendered the highest service that can be rendered the School by leadership based on the influence of character."[30]
The William S. Thomas Scholarship Prize, consists of seven awards: six given to the top scholar of grades 8 to 12 and one for the valedictorian, as determined by academic achievement over the course of four years.[30]
The William Cabell Bruce Jr. Athletic Prize honors the upper school student "most conspicuous for general proficiency in athletic sports and exercises over a two-year period."[30]
The Daniel Baker Jr. Memorial is awarded to the senior who "through thoughtfulness and by reason of his character, has contributed to the general welfare of his fellow men."[30]
The Edward Fenimore Award recognizes the senior who has best exemplified the characteristics of "courage, determination, perseverance, and accomplishment."[30]
The Peter Parrott Blanchard Award is given to the upper school student who "by his cheerful helpfulness ... has greatly contributed to the successful and pleasant life in the School."[30]
The Redmond C. S. Finney Award celebrates the student who has distinguished himself "through his dedication to and practice of those human values necessary to eliminate racism, prejudice, and intolerance."[30]
The Daniel C. Ammidon Award recognizes students in grades 6-12 for their "outstanding citizenship and commitment to the Gilman Community."[30]

The Gilman School /ˈɡɪlmən/ is a private preparatory school for boys located in the Roland Park neighborhood of Baltimore, Maryland. Founded in 1897 as the Country School for Boys, it was the 1st country day school in the United States.[2] Gilman enrolls approximately 1,003 students, ranging from kindergarten to 12th grade, under the instruction of 146 faculty members.[1] It is a member of the Association of Independent Maryland Schools[3] and the Maryland Interscholastic Athletic Association.[4]
Described by author C. Fraser Smith as "Baltimore's most prestigious preparatory academy,"[5] Gilman enjoys strong academic and athletic reputations.[6] In 2002, Worth Magazine rated Gilman among the top 30 feeder schools in the U.S.,[7] signifying the high rate of matriculation by Gilman graduates at top colleges and universities.[8] Its graduates are known to be intensely loyal to the school. Approximately 75% of the Board of Trustees are graduates of the school, one of the highest percentages of any educational institution in the United States.[9] Of Gilman's 16 varsity athletic programs, 15 have won conference championships since 2000,[10] and in recent years its football and lacrosse teams have appeared at or near the top of national rankings.[11][12]
The school takes its name from Daniel Coit Gilman, the first president of The Johns Hopkins University and an early supporter of efforts by Anne Galbraith Carey to form an all-boys day school.[13] Prominent graduates of Gilman include author Walter Lord, sportswriter Frank Deford, former Arizona Governor Fife Symington, former Maryland Governor Bob Ehrlich, former United States Senator Daniel Brewster, Congressman John Sarbanes, and internationally renowned composer Christopher Rouse.

History[edit]
Gilman was founded as The Country School for Boys by Baltimore resident Anne Galbraith Carey, with assistance from Daniel Coit Gilman (1831–1908, the first president of Johns Hopkins University, 1876–1908). The school opened its doors on September 30, 1897, in the old "Homewood" Mansion (now known as the Homewood Museum, off North Charles Street, constructed 1800 in Georgian-Federal style architecture, for Charles Carroll Jr. (1775–1825), also known as Charles Carroll of Homewood, son of Charles Carroll of Carrollton (1737–1832), last surviving signer of the Declaration of Independence). By 1910, J.H.U. began moving its campus north from its former downtown location along North Howard Street by Little Ross, West Centre and West Monument Streets, in the neighborhood of Mount Vernon-Belvedere to the newly named "Homewood" campus and constructing its first campus buildings of similar matching Georgian - Federal styles. In 1910, the Country School moved to its current 68-acre (275,000 m²) campus further north in the city to Roland Park, along Roland Avenue, just south of the Belvedere Avenue (and the future Northern Parkway). Here was begun one of the first planned suburban developments in America by the new Roland Park Company in 1891. At that time the institution changed its name to "The Gilman Country School for Boys", in honor of the seminal figure in its founding, Dr. Gilman. In 1951, "Country" was dropped from the name.[14]
Gilman has two sister schools: Bryn Mawr School, across Northern Parkway from Gilman to the north and Roland Park Country School, across Roland Ave to the west. All three schools coordinate some Upper School (grades 9–12) classes to the extent that some classes have students from all three schools.
Academics[edit]

The school has three divisions: Lower School (kindergarten through grade five), Middle School (grades six through eight) and Upper School (grades nine through twelve).
At the Upper School level, students are required to take courses in history, mathematics, English, science, and a foreign language each semester; an intramural or interscholastic sport each season; and a minimum of art, music, and religion instruction over four years.[16] Students must also fulfill a community service requirement[16] and may choose to participate in a range of extracurricular activities.[17]
A number of courses permit cross-registration by students from two neighboring girls' schools: Bryn Mawr and Roland Park Country School. In turn, Gilman students, primarily seniors, are able to enroll in equivalent courses at these sister schools.[16] Starting junior year, students are allowed to take necessary classes like English and other subjects at the sister schools. The school offers numerous courses, several through the tri-school collaboration. Cross-registration also allows for a variety of languages to be offered, which currently include French, Spanish, Latin, Ancient Greek, Chinese, Russian, Arabic, and German.
Athletics[edit]
Gilman enjoys a tradition of athletic success.[6] Since the year 2000, 12 Gilman varsity teams have won at least one conference championship.[18] Overall, the school sponsors 16 sports; most teams have varsity and junior varsity programs, while some have fresh-soph and/or middle school squads.[19]
Gilman is perhaps best known for its success in football and lacrosse. The football team has won 2 Maryland Interscholastic Athletic Association (MIAA) "A" Conference championships in the last 11 seasons.[18] The 2002 team finished 10–0 and was ranked 14th in the United States by USA Today's Super 25 high school football poll.[20] That team featured the Associated Press's Offensive and Defensive Player of the Year in quarterback Ambrose Wooden and lineman Victor Abiamiri. Both players went on to star at Notre Dame, and Abiamiri now plays for the Philadelphia Eagles. The 2005 team was ranked 12th in the nation in USA Today's Super 25 high school football poll.[21]
The lacrosse team, led by coach, upper school history teacher, and Gilman alumnus (Class of 1987) Brooks Matthews, was ranked the #1 high school team in the United States by LaxPower at the conclusion of both the 2008 and 2009 seasons.[12] The team has captured 15 "A" conference titles in MIAA.[18] The lacrosse program has produced many stars in college lacrosse such as Barney Ehrmann.
During the 2005–06 school year, six Gilman varsity squads (football, golf, ice hockey, squash, tennis & track and field) won conference titles. In 2008–09, the volleyball team won its first MIAA title, while the squash and swimming teams also won conference championships.[18]
Gilman's biggest rival is the McDonogh School,[22] located in suburban Owings Mills. A football game between the two schools has taken place every fall since 1914.[22] Gilman leads this series, 60-35-5, including a win in the 100th game in 2015.[23]

Awards[edit]




Commencement ceremonies held in front of Gilman's Auditorium


Gilman confers over 50 awards at the upper school level for achievement in academics, athletics, student leadership, and extracurricular activities.[28] Most prizes are bestowed on seniors; a smaller number are granted to underclassmen by design or as circumstances warrant. The majority are given on Awards Day, held each year in late May, while a handful of the highest honors are withheld until Founders Day, the day of Gilman's commencement ceremonies.[29]

The William A. Fisher Medallion is accorded to a junior or senior "who has rendered the highest service that can be rendered the School by leadership based on the influence of character."[30]
The William S. Thomas Scholarship Prize, consists of seven awards: six given to the top scholar of grades 8 to 12 and one for the valedictorian, as determined by academic achievement over the course of four years.[30]
The William Cabell Bruce Jr. Athletic Prize honors the upper school student "most conspicuous for general proficiency in athletic sports and exercises over a two-year period."[30]
The Daniel Baker Jr. Memorial is awarded to the senior who "through thoughtfulness and by reason of his character, has contributed to the general welfare of his fellow men."[30]
The Edward Fenimore Award recognizes the senior who has best exemplified the characteristics of "courage, determination, perseverance, and accomplishment."[30]
The Peter Parrott Blanchard Award is given to the upper school student who "by his cheerful helpfulness ... has greatly contributed to the successful and pleasant life in the School."[30]
The Redmond C. S. Finney Award celebrates the student who has distinguished himself "through his dedication to and practice of those human values necessary to eliminate racism, prejudice, and intolerance."[30]
The Daniel C. Ammidon Award recognizes students in grades 6-12 for their "outstanding citizenship and commitment to the Gilman Community."[30]

The Gilman School /ˈɡɪlmən/ is a private preparatory school for boys located in the Roland Park neighborhood of Baltimore, Maryland. Founded in 1897 as the Country School for Boys, it was the 1st country day school in the United States.[2] Gilman enrolls approximately 1,003 students, ranging from kindergarten to 12th grade, under the instruction of 146 faculty members.[1] It is a member of the Association of Independent Maryland Schools[3] and the Maryland Interscholastic Athletic Association.[4]
Described by author C. Fraser Smith as "Baltimore's most prestigious preparatory academy,"[5] Gilman enjoys strong academic and athletic reputations.[6] In 2002, Worth Magazine rated Gilman among the top 30 feeder schools in the U.S.,[7] signifying the high rate of matriculation by Gilman graduates at top colleges and universities.[8] Its graduates are known to be intensely loyal to the school. Approximately 75% of the Board of Trustees are graduates of the school, one of the highest percentages of any educational institution in the United States.[9] Of Gilman's 16 varsity athletic programs, 15 have won conference championships since 2000,[10] and in recent years its football and lacrosse teams have appeared at or near the top of national rankings.[11][12]
The school takes its name from Daniel Coit Gilman, the first president of The Johns Hopkins University and an early supporter of efforts by Anne Galbraith Carey to form an all-boys day school.[13] Prominent graduates of Gilman include author Walter Lord, sportswriter Frank Deford, former Arizona Governor Fife Symington, former Maryland Governor Bob Ehrlich, former United States Senator Daniel Brewster, Congressman John Sarbanes, and internationally renowned composer Christopher Rouse.

History[edit]
Gilman was founded as The Country School for Boys by Baltimore resident Anne Galbraith Carey, with assistance from Daniel Coit Gilman (1831–1908, the first president of Johns Hopkins University, 1876–1908). The school opened its doors on September 30, 1897, in the old "Homewood" Mansion (now known as the Homewood Museum, off North Charles Street, constructed 1800 in Georgian-Federal style architecture, for Charles Carroll Jr. (1775–1825), also known as Charles Carroll of Homewood, son of Charles Carroll of Carrollton (1737–1832), last surviving signer of the Declaration of Independence). By 1910, J.H.U. began moving its campus north from its former downtown location along North Howard Street by Little Ross, West Centre and West Monument Streets, in the neighborhood of Mount Vernon-Belvedere to the newly named "Homewood" campus and constructing its first campus buildings of similar matching Georgian - Federal styles. In 1910, the Country School moved to its current 68-acre (275,000 m²) campus further north in the city to Roland Park, along Roland Avenue, just south of the Belvedere Avenue (and the future Northern Parkway). Here was begun one of the first planned suburban developments in America by the new Roland Park Company in 1891. At that time the institution changed its name to "The Gilman Country School for Boys", in honor of the seminal figure in its founding, Dr. Gilman. In 1951, "Country" was dropped from the name.[14]
Gilman has two sister schools: Bryn Mawr School, across Northern Parkway from Gilman to the north and Roland Park Country School, across Roland Ave to the west. All three schools coordinate some Upper School (grades 9–12) classes to the extent that some classes have students from all three schools.
Academics[edit]

The school has three divisions: Lower School (kindergarten through grade five), Middle School (grades six through eight) and Upper School (grades nine through twelve).
At the Upper School level, students are required to take courses in history, mathematics, English, science, and a foreign language each semester; an intramural or interscholastic sport each season; and a minimum of art, music, and religion instruction over four years.[16] Students must also fulfill a community service requirement[16] and may choose to participate in a range of extracurricular activities.[17]
A number of courses permit cross-registration by students from two neighboring girls' schools: Bryn Mawr and Roland Park Country School. In turn, Gilman students, primarily seniors, are able to enroll in equivalent courses at these sister schools.[16] Starting junior year, students are allowed to take necessary classes like English and other subjects at the sister schools. The school offers numerous courses, several through the tri-school collaboration. Cross-registration also allows for a variety of languages to be offered, which currently include French, Spanish, Latin, Ancient Greek, Chinese, Russian, Arabic, and German.
Athletics[edit]
Gilman enjoys a tradition of athletic success.[6] Since the year 2000, 12 Gilman varsity teams have won at least one conference championship.[18] Overall, the school sponsors 16 sports; most teams have varsity and junior varsity programs, while some have fresh-soph and/or middle school squads.[19]
Gilman is perhaps best known for its success in football and lacrosse. The football team has won 2 Maryland Interscholastic Athletic Association (MIAA) "A" Conference championships in the last 11 seasons.[18] The 2002 team finished 10–0 and was ranked 14th in the United States by USA Today's Super 25 high school football poll.[20] That team featured the Associated Press's Offensive and Defensive Player of the Year in quarterback Ambrose Wooden and lineman Victor Abiamiri. Both players went on to star at Notre Dame, and Abiamiri now plays for the Philadelphia Eagles. The 2005 team was ranked 12th in the nation in USA Today's Super 25 high school football poll.[21]
The lacrosse team, led by coach, upper school history teacher, and Gilman alumnus (Class of 1987) Brooks Matthews, was ranked the #1 high school team in the United States by LaxPower at the conclusion of both the 2008 and 2009 seasons.[12] The team has captured 15 "A" conference titles in MIAA.[18] The lacrosse program has produced many stars in college lacrosse such as Barney Ehrmann.
During the 2005–06 school year, six Gilman varsity squads (football, golf, ice hockey, squash, tennis & track and field) won conference titles. In 2008–09, the volleyball team won its first MIAA title, while the squash and swimming teams also won conference championships.[18]
Gilman's biggest rival is the McDonogh School,[22] located in suburban Owings Mills. A football game between the two schools has taken place every fall since 1914.[22] Gilman leads this series, 60-35-5, including a win in the 100th game in 2015.[23]

Awards[edit]




Commencement ceremonies held in front of Gilman's Auditorium


Gilman confers over 50 awards at the upper school level for achievement in academics, athletics, student leadership, and extracurricular activities.[28] Most prizes are bestowed on seniors; a smaller number are granted to underclassmen by design or as circumstances warrant. The majority are given on Awards Day, held each year in late May, while a handful of the highest honors are withheld until Founders Day, the day of Gilman's commencement ceremonies.[29]

The William A. Fisher Medallion is accorded to a junior or senior "who has rendered the highest service that can be rendered the School by leadership based on the influence of character."[30]
The William S. Thomas Scholarship Prize, consists of seven awards: six given to the top scholar of grades 8 to 12 and one for the valedictorian, as determined by academic achievement over the course of four years.[30]
The William Cabell Bruce Jr. Athletic Prize honors the upper school student "most conspicuous for general proficiency in athletic sports and exercises over a two-year period."[30]
The Daniel Baker Jr. Memorial is awarded to the senior who "through thoughtfulness and by reason of his character, has contributed to the general welfare of his fellow men."[30]
The Edward Fenimore Award recognizes the senior who has best exemplified the characteristics of "courage, determination, perseverance, and accomplishment."[30]
The Peter Parrott Blanchard Award is given to the upper school student who "by his cheerful helpfulness ... has greatly contributed to the successful and pleasant life in the School."[30]
The Redmond C. S. Finney Award celebrates the student who has distinguished himself "through his dedication to and practice of those human values necessary to eliminate racism, prejudice, and intolerance."[30]
The Daniel C. Ammidon Award recognizes students in grades 6-12 for their "outstanding citizenship and commitment to the Gilman Community."[30]

The Gilman School /ˈɡɪlmən/ is a private preparatory school for boys located in the Roland Park neighborhood of Baltimore, Maryland. Founded in 1897 as the Country School for Boys, it was the 1st country day school in the United States.[2] Gilman enrolls approximately 1,003 students, ranging from kindergarten to 12th grade, under the instruction of 146 faculty members.[1] It is a member of the Association of Independent Maryland Schools[3] and the Maryland Interscholastic Athletic Association.[4]
Described by author C. Fraser Smith as "Baltimore's most prestigious preparatory academy,"[5] Gilman enjoys strong academic and athletic reputations.[6] In 2002, Worth Magazine rated Gilman among the top 30 feeder schools in the U.S.,[7] signifying the high rate of matriculation by Gilman graduates at top colleges and universities.[8] Its graduates are known to be intensely loyal to the school. Approximately 75% of the Board of Trustees are graduates of the school, one of the highest percentages of any educational institution in the United States.[9] Of Gilman's 16 varsity athletic programs, 15 have won conference championships since 2000,[10] and in recent years its football and lacrosse teams have appeared at or near the top of national rankings.[11][12]
The school takes its name from Daniel Coit Gilman, the first president of The Johns Hopkins University and an early supporter of efforts by Anne Galbraith Carey to form an all-boys day school.[13] Prominent graduates of Gilman include author Walter Lord, sportswriter Frank Deford, former Arizona Governor Fife Symington, former Maryland Governor Bob Ehrlich, former United States Senator Daniel Brewster, Congressman John Sarbanes, and internationally renowned composer Christopher Rouse.

History[edit]
Gilman was founded as The Country School for Boys by Baltimore resident Anne Galbraith Carey, with assistance from Daniel Coit Gilman (1831–1908, the first president of Johns Hopkins University, 1876–1908). The school opened its doors on September 30, 1897, in the old "Homewood" Mansion (now known as the Homewood Museum, off North Charles Street, constructed 1800 in Georgian-Federal style architecture, for Charles Carroll Jr. (1775–1825), also known as Charles Carroll of Homewood, son of Charles Carroll of Carrollton (1737–1832), last surviving signer of the Declaration of Independence). By 1910, J.H.U. began moving its campus north from its former downtown location along North Howard Street by Little Ross, West Centre and West Monument Streets, in the neighborhood of Mount Vernon-Belvedere to the newly named "Homewood" campus and constructing its first campus buildings of similar matching Georgian - Federal styles. In 1910, the Country School moved to its current 68-acre (275,000 m²) campus further north in the city to Roland Park, along Roland Avenue, just south of the Belvedere Avenue (and the future Northern Parkway). Here was begun one of the first planned suburban developments in America by the new Roland Park Company in 1891. At that time the institution changed its name to "The Gilman Country School for Boys", in honor of the seminal figure in its founding, Dr. Gilman. In 1951, "Country" was dropped from the name.[14]
Gilman has two sister schools: Bryn Mawr School, across Northern Parkway from Gilman to the north and Roland Park Country School, across Roland Ave to the west. All three schools coordinate some Upper School (grades 9–12) classes to the extent that some classes have students from all three schools.
Academics[edit]

The school has three divisions: Lower School (kindergarten through grade five), Middle School (grades six through eight) and Upper School (grades nine through twelve).
At the Upper School level, students are required to take courses in history, mathematics, English, science, and a foreign language each semester; an intramural or interscholastic sport each season; and a minimum of art, music, and religion instruction over four years.[16] Students must also fulfill a community service requirement[16] and may choose to participate in a range of extracurricular activities.[17]
A number of courses permit cross-registration by students from two neighboring girls' schools: Bryn Mawr and Roland Park Country School. In turn, Gilman students, primarily seniors, are able to enroll in equivalent courses at these sister schools.[16] Starting junior year, students are allowed to take necessary classes like English and other subjects at the sister schools. The school offers numerous courses, several through the tri-school collaboration. Cross-registration also allows for a variety of languages to be offered, which currently include French, Spanish, Latin, Ancient Greek, Chinese, Russian, Arabic, and German.
Athletics[edit]
Gilman enjoys a tradition of athletic success.[6] Since the year 2000, 12 Gilman varsity teams have won at least one conference championship.[18] Overall, the school sponsors 16 sports; most teams have varsity and junior varsity programs, while some have fresh-soph and/or middle school squads.[19]
Gilman is perhaps best known for its success in football and lacrosse. The football team has won 2 Maryland Interscholastic Athletic Association (MIAA) "A" Conference championships in the last 11 seasons.[18] The 2002 team finished 10–0 and was ranked 14th in the United States by USA Today's Super 25 high school football poll.[20] That team featured the Associated Press's Offensive and Defensive Player of the Year in quarterback Ambrose Wooden and lineman Victor Abiamiri. Both players went on to star at Notre Dame, and Abiamiri now plays for the Philadelphia Eagles. The 2005 team was ranked 12th in the nation in USA Today's Super 25 high school football poll.[21]
The lacrosse team, led by coach, upper school history teacher, and Gilman alumnus (Class of 1987) Brooks Matthews, was ranked the #1 high school team in the United States by LaxPower at the conclusion of both the 2008 and 2009 seasons.[12] The team has captured 15 "A" conference titles in MIAA.[18] The lacrosse program has produced many stars in college lacrosse such as Barney Ehrmann.
During the 2005–06 school year, six Gilman varsity squads (football, golf, ice hockey, squash, tennis & track and field) won conference titles. In 2008–09, the volleyball team won its first MIAA title, while the squash and swimming teams also won conference championships.[18]
Gilman's biggest rival is the McDonogh School,[22] located in suburban Owings Mills. A football game between the two schools has taken place every fall since 1914.[22] Gilman leads this series, 60-35-5, including a win in the 100th game in 2015.[23]

Awards[edit]




Commencement ceremonies held in front of Gilman's Auditorium


Gilman confers over 50 awards at the upper school level for achievement in academics, athletics, student leadership, and extracurricular activities.[28] Most prizes are bestowed on seniors; a smaller number are granted to underclassmen by design or as circumstances warrant. The majority are given on Awards Day, held each year in late May, while a handful of the highest honors are withheld until Founders Day, the day of Gilman's commencement ceremonies.[29]

The William A. Fisher Medallion is accorded to a junior or senior "who has rendered the highest service that can be rendered the School by leadership based on the influence of character."[30]
The William S. Thomas Scholarship Prize, consists of seven awards: six given to the top scholar of grades 8 to 12 and one for the valedictorian, as determined by academic achievement over the course of four years.[30]
The William Cabell Bruce Jr. Athletic Prize honors the upper school student "most conspicuous for general proficiency in athletic sports and exercises over a two-year period."[30]
The Daniel Baker Jr. Memorial is awarded to the senior who "through thoughtfulness and by reason of his character, has contributed to the general welfare of his fellow men."[30]
The Edward Fenimore Award recognizes the senior who has best exemplified the characteristics of "courage, determination, perseverance, and accomplishment."[30]
The Peter Parrott Blanchard Award is given to the upper school student who "by his cheerful helpfulness ... has greatly contributed to the successful and pleasant life in the School."[30]
The Redmond C. S. Finney Award celebrates the student who has distinguished himself "through his dedication to and practice of those human values necessary to eliminate racism, prejudice, and intolerance."[30]
The Daniel C. Ammidon Award recognizes students in grades 6-12 for their "outstanding citizenship and commitment to the Gilman Community."[30]

The Gilman School /ˈɡɪlmən/ is a private preparatory school for boys located in the Roland Park neighborhood of Baltimore, Maryland. Founded in 1897 as the Country School for Boys, it was the 1st country day school in the United States.[2] Gilman enrolls approximately 1,003 students, ranging from kindergarten to 12th grade, under the instruction of 146 faculty members.[1] It is a member of the Association of Independent Maryland Schools[3] and the Maryland Interscholastic Athletic Association.[4]
Described by author C. Fraser Smith as "Baltimore's most prestigious preparatory academy,"[5] Gilman enjoys strong academic and athletic reputations.[6] In 2002, Worth Magazine rated Gilman among the top 30 feeder schools in the U.S.,[7] signifying the high rate of matriculation by Gilman graduates at top colleges and universities.[8] Its graduates are known to be intensely loyal to the school. Approximately 75% of the Board of Trustees are graduates of the school, one of the highest percentages of any educational institution in the United States.[9] Of Gilman's 16 varsity athletic programs, 15 have won conference championships since 2000,[10] and in recent years its football and lacrosse teams have appeared at or near the top of national rankings.[11][12]
The school takes its name from Daniel Coit Gilman, the first president of The Johns Hopkins University and an early supporter of efforts by Anne Galbraith Carey to form an all-boys day school.[13] Prominent graduates of Gilman include author Walter Lord, sportswriter Frank Deford, former Arizona Governor Fife Symington, former Maryland Governor Bob Ehrlich, former United States Senator Daniel Brewster, Congressman John Sarbanes, and internationally renowned composer Christopher Rouse.

History[edit]
Gilman was founded as The Country School for Boys by Baltimore resident Anne Galbraith Carey, with assistance from Daniel Coit Gilman (1831–1908, the first president of Johns Hopkins University, 1876–1908). The school opened its doors on September 30, 1897, in the old "Homewood" Mansion (now known as the Homewood Museum, off North Charles Street, constructed 1800 in Georgian-Federal style architecture, for Charles Carroll Jr. (1775–1825), also known as Charles Carroll of Homewood, son of Charles Carroll of Carrollton (1737–1832), last surviving signer of the Declaration of Independence). By 1910, J.H.U. began moving its campus north from its former downtown location along North Howard Street by Little Ross, West Centre and West Monument Streets, in the neighborhood of Mount Vernon-Belvedere to the newly named "Homewood" campus and constructing its first campus buildings of similar matching Georgian - Federal styles. In 1910, the Country School moved to its current 68-acre (275,000 m²) campus further north in the city to Roland Park, along Roland Avenue, just south of the Belvedere Avenue (and the future Northern Parkway). Here was begun one of the first planned suburban developments in America by the new Roland Park Company in 1891. At that time the institution changed its name to "The Gilman Country School for Boys", in honor of the seminal figure in its founding, Dr. Gilman. In 1951, "Country" was dropped from the name.[14]
Gilman has two sister schools: Bryn Mawr School, across Northern Parkway from Gilman to the north and Roland Park Country School, across Roland Ave to the west. All three schools coordinate some Upper School (grades 9–12) classes to the extent that some classes have students from all three schools.
Academics[edit]




An open-air classroom at Gilman, in use from 1911 to 1922[15]


The school has three divisions: Lower School (kindergarten through grade five), Middle School (grades six through eight) and Upper School (grades nine through twelve).
At the Upper School level, students are required to take courses in history, mathematics, English, science, and a foreign language each semester; an intramural or interscholastic sport each season; and a minimum of art, music, and religion instruction over four years.[16] Students must also fulfill a community service requirement[16] and may choose to participate in a range of extracurricular activities.[17]
A number of courses permit cross-registration by students from two neighboring girls' schools: Bryn Mawr and Roland Park Country School. In turn, Gilman students, primarily seniors, are able to enroll in equivalent courses at these sister schools.[16] Starting junior year, students are allowed to take necessary classes like English and other subjects at the sister schools. The school offers numerous courses, several through the tri-school collaboration. Cross-registration also allows for a variety of languages to be offered, which currently include French, Spanish, Latin, Ancient Greek, Chinese, Russian, Arabic, and German.
Athletics[edit]
Gilman enjoys a tradition of athletic success.[6] Since the year 2000, 12 Gilman varsity teams have won at least one conference championship.[18] Overall, the school sponsors 16 sports; most teams have varsity and junior varsity programs, while some have fresh-soph and/or middle school squads.[19]
Gilman is perhaps best known for its success in football and lacrosse. The football team has won 2 Maryland Interscholastic Athletic Association (MIAA) "A" Conference championships in the last 11 seasons.[18] The 2002 team finished 10–0 and was ranked 14th in the United States by USA Today's Super 25 high school football poll.[20] That team featured the Associated Press's Offensive and Defensive Player of the Year in quarterback Ambrose Wooden and lineman Victor Abiamiri. Both players went on to star at Notre Dame, and Abiamiri now plays for the Philadelphia Eagles. The 2005 team was ranked 12th in the nation in USA Today's Super 25 high school football poll.[21]
The lacrosse team, led by coach, upper school history teacher, and Gilman alumnus (Class of 1987) Brooks Matthews, was ranked the #1 high school team in the United States by LaxPower at the conclusion of both the 2008 and 2009 seasons.[12] The team has captured 15 "A" conference titles in MIAA.[18] The lacrosse program has produced many stars in college lacrosse such as Barney Ehrmann.
During the 2005–06 school year, six Gilman varsity squads (football, golf, ice hockey, squash, tennis & track and field) won conference titles. In 2008–09, the volleyball team won its first MIAA title, while the squash and swimming teams also won conference championships.[18]
Gilman's biggest rival is the McDonogh School,[22] located in suburban Owings Mills. A football game between the two schools has taken place every fall since 1914.[22] Gilman leads this series, 60-35-5, including a win in the 100th game in 2015.[23]

Awards[edit]




Commencement ceremonies held in front of Gilman's Auditorium


Gilman confers over 50 awards at the upper school level for achievement in academics, athletics, student leadership, and extracurricular activities.[28] Most prizes are bestowed on seniors; a smaller number are granted to underclassmen by design or as circumstances warrant. The majority are given on Awards Day, held each year in late May, while a handful of the highest honors are withheld until Founders Day, the day of Gilman's commencement ceremonies.[29]

The William A. Fisher Medallion is accorded to a junior or senior "who has rendered the highest service that can be rendered the School by leadership based on the influence of character."[30]
The William S. Thomas Scholarship Prize, consists of seven awards: six given to the top scholar of grades 8 to 12 and one for the valedictorian, as determined by academic achievement over the course of four years.[30]
The William Cabell Bruce Jr. Athletic Prize honors the upper school student "most conspicuous for general proficiency in athletic sports and exercises over a two-year period."[30]
The Daniel Baker Jr. Memorial is awarded to the senior who "through thoughtfulness and by reason of his character, has contributed to the general welfare of his fellow men."[30]
The Edward Fenimore Award recognizes the senior who has best exemplified the characteristics of "courage, determination, perseverance, and accomplishment."[30]
The Peter Parrott Blanchard Award is given to the upper school student who "by his cheerful helpfulness ... has greatly contributed to the successful and pleasant life in the School."[30]
The Redmond C. S. Finney Award celebrates the student who has distinguished himself "through his dedication to and practice of those human values necessary to eliminate racism, prejudice, and intolerance."[30]
The Daniel C. Ammidon Award recognizes students in grades 6-12 for their "outstanding citizenship and commitment to the Gilman Community."[30]

The Gilman School /ˈɡɪlmən/ is a private preparatory school for boys located in the Roland Park neighborhood of Baltimore, Maryland. Founded in 1897 as the Country School for Boys, it was the 1st country day school in the United States.[2] Gilman enrolls approximately 1,003 students, ranging from kindergarten to 12th grade, under the instruction of 146 faculty members.[1] It is a member of the Association of Independent Maryland Schools[3] and the Maryland Interscholastic Athletic Association.[4]
Described by author C. Fraser Smith as "Baltimore's most prestigious preparatory academy,"[5] Gilman enjoys strong academic and athletic reputations.[6] In 2002, Worth Magazine rated Gilman among the top 30 feeder schools in the U.S.,[7] signifying the high rate of matriculation by Gilman graduates at top colleges and universities.[8] Its graduates are known to be intensely loyal to the school. Approximately 75% of the Board of Trustees are graduates of the school, one of the highest percentages of any educational institution in the United States.[9] Of Gilman's 16 varsity athletic programs, 15 have won conference championships since 2000,[10] and in recent years its football and lacrosse teams have appeared at or near the top of national rankings.[11][12]
The school takes its name from Daniel Coit Gilman, the first president of The Johns Hopkins University and an early supporter of efforts by Anne Galbraith Carey to form an all-boys day school.[13] Prominent graduates of Gilman include author Walter Lord, sportswriter Frank Deford, former Arizona Governor Fife Symington, former Maryland Governor Bob Ehrlich, former United States Senator Daniel Brewster, Congressman John Sarbanes, and internationally renowned composer Christopher Rouse.

History[edit]
Gilman was founded as The Country School for Boys by Baltimore resident Anne Galbraith Carey, with assistance from Daniel Coit Gilman (1831–1908, the first president of Johns Hopkins University, 1876–1908). The school opened its doors on September 30, 1897, in the old "Homewood" Mansion (now known as the Homewood Museum, off North Charles Street, constructed 1800 in Georgian-Federal style architecture, for Charles Carroll Jr. (1775–1825), also known as Charles Carroll of Homewood, son of Charles Carroll of Carrollton (1737–1832), last surviving signer of the Declaration of Independence). By 1910, J.H.U. began moving its campus north from its former downtown location along North Howard Street by Little Ross, West Centre and West Monument Streets, in the neighborhood of Mount Vernon-Belvedere to the newly named "Homewood" campus and constructing its first campus buildings of similar matching Georgian - Federal styles. In 1910, the Country School moved to its current 68-acre (275,000 m²) campus further north in the city to Roland Park, along Roland Avenue, just south of the Belvedere Avenue (and the future Northern Parkway). Here was begun one of the first planned suburban developments in America by the new Roland Park Company in 1891. At that time the institution changed its name to "The Gilman Country School for Boys", in honor of the seminal figure in its founding, Dr. Gilman. In 1951, "Country" was dropped from the name.[14]
Gilman has two sister schools: Bryn Mawr School, across Northern Parkway from Gilman to the north and Roland Park Country School, across Roland Ave to the west. All three schools coordinate some Upper School (grades 9–12) classes to the extent that some classes have students from all three schools.
Academics[edit]




An open-air classroom at Gilman, in use from 1911 to 1922[15]


The school has three divisions: Lower School (kindergarten through grade five), Middle School (grades six through eight) and Upper School (grades nine through twelve).
At the Upper School level, students are required to take courses in history, mathematics, English, science, and a foreign language each semester; an intramural or interscholastic sport each season; and a minimum of art, music, and religion instruction over four years.[16] Students must also fulfill a community service requirement[16] and may choose to participate in a range of extracurricular activities.[17]
A number of courses permit cross-registration by students from two neighboring girls' schools: Bryn Mawr and Roland Park Country School. In turn, Gilman students, primarily seniors, are able to enroll in equivalent courses at these sister schools.[16] Starting junior year, students are allowed to take necessary classes like English and other subjects at the sister schools. The school offers numerous courses, several through the tri-school collaboration. Cross-registration also allows for a variety of languages to be offered, which currently include French, Spanish, Latin, Ancient Greek, Chinese, Russian, Arabic, and German.
Athletics[edit]
Gilman enjoys a tradition of athletic success.[6] Since the year 2000, 12 Gilman varsity teams have won at least one conference championship.[18] Overall, the school sponsors 16 sports; most teams have varsity and junior varsity programs, while some have fresh-soph and/or middle school squads.[19]
Gilman is perhaps best known for its success in football and lacrosse. The football team has won 2 Maryland Interscholastic Athletic Association (MIAA) "A" Conference championships in the last 11 seasons.[18] The 2002 team finished 10–0 and was ranked 14th in the United States by USA Today's Super 25 high school football poll.[20] That team featured the Associated Press's Offensive and Defensive Player of the Year in quarterback Ambrose Wooden and lineman Victor Abiamiri. Both players went on to star at Notre Dame, and Abiamiri now plays for the Philadelphia Eagles. The 2005 team was ranked 12th in the nation in USA Today's Super 25 high school football poll.[21]
The lacrosse team, led by coach, upper school history teacher, and Gilman alumnus (Class of 1987) Brooks Matthews, was ranked the #1 high school team in the United States by LaxPower at the conclusion of both the 2008 and 2009 seasons.[12] The team has captured 15 "A" conference titles in MIAA.[18] The lacrosse program has produced many stars in college lacrosse such as Barney Ehrmann.
During the 2005–06 school year, six Gilman varsity squads (football, golf, ice hockey, squash, tennis & track and field) won conference titles. In 2008–09, the volleyball team won its first MIAA title, while the squash and swimming teams also won conference championships.[18]
Gilman's biggest rival is the McDonogh School,[22] located in suburban Owings Mills. A football game between the two schools has taken place every fall since 1914.[22] Gilman leads this series, 60-35-5, including a win in the 100th game in 2015.[23]

Awards[edit]




Commencement ceremonies held in front of Gilman's Auditorium


Gilman confers over 50 awards at the upper school level for achievement in academics, athletics, student leadership, and extracurricular activities.[28] Most prizes are bestowed on seniors; a smaller number are granted to underclassmen by design or as circumstances warrant. The majority are given on Awards Day, held each year in late May, while a handful of the highest honors are withheld until Founders Day, the day of Gilman's commencement ceremonies.[29]

The William A. Fisher Medallion is accorded to a junior or senior "who has rendered the highest service that can be rendered the School by leadership based on the influence of character."[30]
The William S. Thomas Scholarship Prize, consists of seven awards: six given to the top scholar of grades 8 to 12 and one for the valedictorian, as determined by academic achievement over the course of four years.[30]
The William Cabell Bruce Jr. Athletic Prize honors the upper school student "most conspicuous for general proficiency in athletic sports and exercises over a two-year period."[30]
The Daniel Baker Jr. Memorial is awarded to the senior who "through thoughtfulness and by reason of his character, has contributed to the general welfare of his fellow men."[30]
The Edward Fenimore Award recognizes the senior who has best exemplified the characteristics of "courage, determination, perseverance, and accomplishment."[30]
The Peter Parrott Blanchard Award is given to the upper school student who "by his cheerful helpfulness ... has greatly contributed to the successful and pleasant life in the School."[30]
The Redmond C. S. Finney Award celebrates the student who has distinguished himself "through his dedication to and practice of those human values necessary to eliminate racism, prejudice, and intolerance."[30]
The Daniel C. Ammidon Award recognizes students in grades 6-12 for their "outstanding citizenship and commitment to the Gilman Community."[30]
