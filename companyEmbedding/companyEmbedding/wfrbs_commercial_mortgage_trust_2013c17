Fitch Affirms WFRBS Commercial Mortgage Trust 2013-C17 | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms WFRBS Commercial Mortgage Trust 2013-C17
    





September 15, 2016 05:16 PM Eastern Daylight Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has affirmed 13 classes of WFRBS Commercial Mortgage Trust 
      2013-C17 pass-through certificates. A detailed list of rating actions 
      follows at the end of this release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      As of the August 2016 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal 
      balance has been reduced by 2.9% to $878.6 million from $904.4 million 
      at issuance. Currently, there are no specially serviced loans and there 
      is one Fitch Loan of Concern (1.1% of the pool). Three loans totaling 
      10.5% of the pool are defeased, including the second largest loan in the 
      pool.
    

      The largest loan in the pool, Hilton Sandestin Beach Resort & Spa 
      (8.4%), is a 10-year interest-only (I/O) loan secured by a 598-room 
      full-service beachfront hotel located within the 2,400-acre Sandestin 
      Resort in Destin, Florida. The loan is performing better than expected 
      with net operating income (NOI) approximately 24.2% above bank 
      underwriting levels. The increase in NOI is largely due to increased 
      room revenue with RevPAR at the subject increasing 15.4% to $163 as of 
      July 2016 TTM from $141 as of August 2013 TTM. Notably, a 198-room 
      tower, which was under renovation at issuance, came back online in 2014. 
      The servicer reported 4.85x debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) for 
      year-end 2015 compared with 4.34x for year-end 2014. Occupancy was 68.2% 
      as of year-end 2015 compared with 69.4% at year-end 2014.
    

      The third largest loan (6.3%) is secured by 997,549 square feet (sf) of 
      the 1.6 million sf Westfield Mission Valley Mall in San Diego, CA. The 
      property is well-located just north of San Diego, immediately off of 
      Interstate 8. The Westfield Mission Valley Mall has 115 stores and is 
      anchored by Macy's (non-collateral), Target, Bed Bath & Beyond and 
      Nordstrom Rack. The loan has a companion $100 million pari passu note 
      which is part of the WFRBS 2013-C16 transaction. The collateral is 
      performing roughly in line with underwritten expectations with NOI down 
      2.5% from issuance. As of year-end 2015 the property was 99.4% occupied 
      versus 98.8% at issuance. Servicer reported year-end 2015 DSCR was 
      3.16x, compared with year-end 2014 DSCR of 3.04x. Notably, one of the 
      tenants at the property, Sports Chalet (4.7%), recently filed for 
      bankruptcy protection and is no longer in its space.
    

      The Fitch Loan of Concern, Staybridge Suites - Minot, is a 102-room 
      hotel located in Minot, North Dakota. The property has exhibited 
      significantly weaker financial performance as a result of the 
      floundering oil and gas exploration in North Dakota. Year-end 2015 DSCR 
      was 1.30x, down from 1.66x at year-end 2014 and 2.41x at year-end 2013. 
      Occupancy also declined to 74.8% as of year-end 2015 compared to 79.7% 
      in 2014 and 85% in 2013. The borrower noted that the decline in 
      operating performance was partially the result of rate reductions 
      granted to top corporate accounts in an effort to remain competitive 
      with the local market. According to a Smith Travel Research report, the 
      hotel is the top performer in RevPAR in its competitive set and has been 
      since 2014.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      The Rating Outlooks on all classes remain Stable. Fitch does not foresee 
      positive or negative ratings migration until a material economic or 
      asset-level event changes the transaction's overall portfolio-level 
      metrics.
    

      USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10
    

      No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.
    

      Fitch has affirmed the following classes:
    

      --$22.7 million class A-1 at 'AAAsf', Outlook Stable;
    

      --$166.9 million class A-2 at 'AAAsf', Outlook Stable;
    

      --$125 million class A-3 at 'AAAsf', Outlook Stable;
    

      --$236.9 million class A-4 at 'AAAsf', Outlook Stable;
    

      --$55.8 million class A-SB at 'AAAsf', Outlook Stable;
    

      --$73.5 million class A-S at 'AAAsf', Outlook Stable;
    

      --$58.8 million class B at 'AA-sf', Outlook Stable;
    

      --$31.6 million class C at 'A-sf', Outlook Stable;
    

      --$47.5 million class D at 'BBB-sf', Outlook Stable;
    

      --$15.8 million class E at 'BBsf', Outlook Stable;
    

      --$9 million class F at 'Bsf', Outlook Stable;
    

      --Interest - Only class X-A at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable
    

      --Interest - Only class X-B at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      Fitch does not rate the class G or class X-C certificates.

Press Releases
Date of Release: November 3, 2016
DBRS Confirms All Classes of WFRBS Commercial Mortgage Trust 2013-C17


November 3, 2016







DBRS Limited (DBRS) has today upgraded the ratings on the following classes of Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2013-C17 issued by WFRBS Commercial Mortgage Trust 2013-C17:

-- Class B to AA (sf) from AA (low) (sf)
-- Class C to A (sf) from A (low) (sf)

Additionally, DBRS has confirmed the ratings on the following classes:

-- Class A-1 at AAA (sf)
-- Class A-2 at AAA (sf)
-- Class A-3 at AAA (sf)
-- Class A-4 at AAA (sf)
-- Class A-SB at AAA (sf)
-- Class A-S at AAA (sf)
-- Class X-A at AAA (sf)
-- Class X-B at AAA (sf)
-- Class X-C at AAA (sf)
-- Class D at BBB (low) (sf)
-- Class E at BB (sf)
-- Class F at B (sf)

All trends are Stable. DBRS does not rate the first loss piece, Class G.

The ratings upgrades reflect the performance of the overall pool as well as the benefit of defeasance collateral in the transaction. At issuance, the transaction consisted of 84 loans secured by 134 commercial and multifamily properties. The pool has since experienced a collateral reduction of 3.1% as the result of scheduled amortization, with all of the original 84 loans remaining in the pool. Three loans, including the second-largest loan, together representing 10.5% of the current pool balance, are fully defeased. Excluding the defeased loans, the pool reported a weighted-average (WA) debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) of 2.08 times (x) and a WA debt yield of 13.1% based on YE2015 financials. Comparatively, the prior-year reporting showed a WA DSCR and WA debt yield of 1.90x and 12.1%, respectively. 

As of the October 2016 remittance, there are nine loans on the servicers watchlist, representing 11.3% of the current pool balance. The largest three loans on the watchlist, representing 7.2% of the current pool balance, were placed on the watchlist for deferred maintenance issues. Each of these loans reported occupancies of at least 90.0% and healthy DSCRs. The loans are expected to be removed from the servicers watchlist once the deferred maintenance issues are resolved. One loan on the watchlist is further discussed below.

The Staybridge Suites  Minot (Prospectus ID#26), representing 1.1% of the current pool balance, is secured by a 102-room hotel, built in 2012, located in Minot, North Dakota. This loan was placed on the servicers watchlist in August 2015 as a result of a decline in performance, which is directly attributable to the deteriorating market conditions in the area. The region is going through a transition period, as it is heavily reliant on the oil and gas industry. The decline in oil prices over the past several years has had a negative economic impact for the area. The subject property generates most of its room nights from corporate accounts and the servicer reports that the demand segmentation consists of 60% transient business and 40% extended stay. As a result, the overall performance of the market and subject has declined; however, the subject continues to perform near the top of its competitive set. Based on the trailing 12 month April 2016 Smith Travel Research report, the subject reported an occupancy of 68.2%, an average daily rate (ADR) of $100.76 and a revenue per average room (RevPAR) of $68.76. Comparatively, the competitive set reported an occupancy of 52.6%, ADR of $86.92 and RevPAR of $45.76. At YE2014, the subject reported an occupancy of 80.0%, an ADR of $120.57 and a revenue RevPAR of $96.48, while the competitive set reported an occupancy of 62.4%, an ADR of $106.62 and a revenue RevPAR of $66.49. According to the most recent financials, the annualized Q1 2016 DSCR was 0.53x, decreasing from the YE2015 DSCR of 1.08x and the YE2014 DSCR of 1.44x. Given the overall decline in the market and the effects of decreasing demand, DBRS expects this loan to continue to underperform expectations from issuance. As such, this loan was modeled with an increased probability of default. 

At issuance, DBRS shadow-rated one loan, Westfield Mission Valley (Prospectus ID#3, representing 6.3% of the current pool balance), as investment grade. DBRS has today confirmed that the performance of this loan remains consistent with investment-grade loan characteristics. 

The ratings assigned to Classes D, E and F materially deviate from the higher ratings implied by the quantitative model. DBRS considers a material deviation to be a rating differential of three or more notches between the assigned rating and the rating implied by the quantitative model that is a substantial component of a rating methodology; in this case, the assigned ratings reflect the sustainability of loan performance trends not demonstrated.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

This news came on the heels of a report from the Commerce Department stating that retail sales declined 0.3%... 
US REITs Feeling Effects from Turmoil in Greece and ChinaInternational economic forces have taken center stage this week, affecting both US stock markets and REITs.

A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this release.KEY RATING DRIVERSAs of the August 2016 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal balance has been reduced by 2.9% to $878.6 million from $904.4 million at issuance. Currently, there are no specially serviced loans and there is one Fitch Loan of Concern (1.1% of the pool). Three loans totaling 10.5% of the pool are defeased, including the second largest loan in the pool.The largest loan in the pool, Hilton Sandestin Beach Resort & Spa (8.4%), is a 10-year interest-only (I/O) loan secured by a 598-room full-service beachfront hotel located within the 2,400-acre Sandestin Resort in Destin, Florida. The loan is performing better than expected with net operating income (NOI) approximately 24.2% above bank underwriting levels. The increase in NOI is largely due to increased room revenue with RevPAR at the subject increasing 15.4% to $163 as of July 2016 TTM from $141 as of August 2013 TTM. Notably, a 198-room tower, which was under renovation at issuance, came back online in 2014. The servicer reported 4.85x debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) for year-end 2015 compared with 4.34x for year-end 2014. Occupancy was 68.2% as of year-end 2015 compared with 69.4% at year-end 2014.The third largest loan (6.3%) is secured by 997,549 square feet (sf) of the 1.6 million sf Westfield Mission Valley Mall in San Diego, CA. The property is well-located just north of San Diego, immediately off of Interstate 8. The Westfield Mission Valley Mall has 115 stores and is anchored by Macy's (non-collateral), Target, Bed Bath & Beyond and Nordstrom Rack. The loan has a companion $100 million pari passu note which is part of the WFRBS 2013-C16 transaction. The collateral is performing roughly in line with underwritten expectations with NOI down 2.5% from issuance. As of year-end 2015 the property was 99.4% occupied versus 98.8% at issuance. Servicer reported year-end 2015 DSCR was 3.16x, compared with year-end 2014 DSCR of 3.04x. Notably, one of the tenants at the property, Sports Chalet (4.7%), recently filed for bankruptcy protection and is no longer in its space.The Fitch Loan of Concern, Staybridge Suites - Minot, is a 102-room hotel located in Minot, North Dakota. The property has exhibited significantly weaker financial performance as a result of the floundering oil and gas exploration in North Dakota. Year-end 2015 DSCR was 1.30x, down from 1.66x at year-end 2014 and 2.41x at year-end 2013. Occupancy also declined to 74.8% as of year-end 2015 compared to 79.7% in 2014 and 85% in 2013. The borrower noted that the decline in operating performance was partially the result of rate reductions granted to top corporate accounts in an effort to remain competitive with the local market. According to a Smith Travel Research report, the hotel is the top performer in RevPAR in its competitive set and has been since 2014.RATING SENSITIVITIESThe Rating Outlooks on all classes remain Stable. Fitch does not foresee positive or negative ratings migration until a material economic or asset-level event changes the transaction's overall portfolio-level metrics.USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to this rating action.Fitch has affirmed the following classes:--$22.7 million class A-1 at 'AAAsf', Outlook Stable;--$166.9 million class A-2 at 'AAAsf', Outlook Stable;--$125 million class A-3 at 'AAAsf', Outlook Stable;--$236.9 million class A-4 at 'AAAsf', Outlook Stable;--$55.8 million class A-SB at 'AAAsf', Outlook Stable;--$73.5 million class A-S at 'AAAsf', Outlook Stable;--$58.8 million class B at 'AA-sf', Outlook Stable;--$31.6 million class C at 'A-sf', Outlook Stable;--$47.5 million class D at 'BBB-sf', Outlook Stable;--$15.8 million class E at 'BBsf', Outlook Stable;--$9 million class F at 'Bsf', Outlook Stable;--Interest - Only class X-A at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable--Interest - Only class X-B at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable.Fitch does not rate the class G or class X-C certificates.Additional information is available at 'www.fitchratings.com'.Read MoreApplicable CriteriaCounterparty Criteria for Structured Finance and Covered Bonds (pub. 01 Sep 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/886006Criteria for Rating Caps and Limitations in Global Structured Finance Transactions (pub. 16 Jun 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/882401Global Structured Finance Rating Criteria (pub. 27 Jun 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/883130U.S. and Canadian Fixed-Rate Multiborrower CMBS Surveillance and U.S. Re-REMIC Criteria (pub. 13 Nov 2015)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/873395Additional DisclosuresDodd-Frank Rating Information Disclosure Formhttps://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/press_releases/content/ridf_frame.cfm?pr_id=1011776Solicitation Statushttps://www.fitchratings.com/gws/en/disclosure/solicitation?pr_id=1011776Endorsement Policyhttps://www.fitchratings.com/jsp/creditdesk/PolicyRegulation.faces?context=2&detail=31ALL FITCH CREDIT RATINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
