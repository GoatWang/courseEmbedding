Short Interest In Herc Holdings Moves 23.2% Higher
The most recent short interest data has been released for the 06/15/2017 settlement date, which shows a 337,730 share increase in total short interest for Herc Holdings Inc , to 1,791,331, an increase of 23.23% since 05/31/2017. Total short interest is just one way to look at short data; another metric that we here at Dividend Channel find particularly useful is the "days to cover" metric because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares traded.

Welcome to Herc Holdings Inc!
We are a newly independent and publicly traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under “HRI.” Founded in 1965 as a part of Hertz Global Holdings, Inc., we previously were known as Hertz Equipment Rental Corporation or “HERC.”  We now operate in the U.S. under our new brand, Herc Rentals.  We generated revenue of $1.6 billion in 2016 and offer customers a diversified fleet of equipment valued at $3.6 billion1. We serve customers through 270 company-owned locations, primarily in North America, and have approximately 4,800 employees.
Through the years, we have been widely recognized as a pioneer and leader in the equipment rental industry, setting the standard for service and creating the performance metrics that are now commonplace for rental equipment companies.
With a new leadership team in place and a savvy, experienced and invigorated “Team Herc” sales and branch organization – we are excited as we move into this new corporate chapter. Our new brand and new name signifies a new mission – to be the supplier of choice, the employer of choice, and the investment of choice in our industry. We invite you to learn more about us!

Larry Silber
President and Chief Executive Officer

Zacks Rank:



                                                 3-Hold     3     




Style Scores:



A Value | A Growth | F Momentum | A VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.
