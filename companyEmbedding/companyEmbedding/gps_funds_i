GPS Dividend Equity strategy seeks cash flow and appreciation and holds small to large-cap names that offer attractive and stable dividend yields.
GPS Tactical ETF strategy seeks appreciation and minimal drawdowns by tactically rotating between equity and fixed income ETFs.
GPS Growth strategy seeks appreciation and holds equity positions with above average growth rates in earnings, sales, and improving profitability.

Concentrated Position
If you have concentrated position with your portfolio, it presents a few additional consideration and possible complication. Extreme Volatility, Tax Consequences, Company and Market Risk are just few of them.
At GPS, we can customize a strategy to manage concentrated position. These strategies can achieve risk protection, enhancing return, and manage tax liability, etc.
Option Income Portfolio
Option Income Portfolio may be better suited for investors who are more risk adverse, yet demand consistent return. This unique portfolio strategy has achieved consistent return which is above the respective traditional bond portfolio with incremental risk. If you like steady return, low market correlation and enhance return, please contact us!
Annuity
If you have an existing annuity, check with GPS for a free consultation. We can propose options to broaden your investment choice, lower your current fee and tighten the investment control within the annuity.

I first invested with GPS in January 2001. The initial investment represented 1.25% of my SMSF, 40% being in shares. I have since added to and multiplied that initial investment, in both Select and Pooled GPS funds, until it now represents about 40% of my SMSF, with less than 10% in shares, and I now sleep much better at night. As GPS has never let me down, I have strongly recommended it to friends and relatives looking for a safe investment with a steady income stream.

Some fifteen years ago I was introduced to a young accountant, Paul Hales. During one of our conversations relating to investments Paul mentioned GPS. To my surprise he said he had invested his mother’s fund with GPS. I subsequently contacted Bruce Atkinson and Richard Woodhead to acquire some further insight into just how the company worked. Today, all of this is very much history. GPS keeps us up to date with available first mortgages as they come on line, and we choose which we wish to go with. If at any time I need an update, this information is only a phone call away. This access to Richard and Bruce is always available. Something I find very impressive. Yes, I am a very happy investor.

I have had my super fund invested with GPS since early 2002 after I noticed their small advertisement in the local paper. After contacting GPS, and meeting with their then small team, I was impressed by their genuine desire to closely determine investment opportunities and monitor progress during construction. From that time my individual investments have grown, and thanks to their diligence I have never experienced a loss. Added to the fact that I receive a monthly return, I know that my investments are in safe hands. I am happy to recommend friends to GPS.

I have a considerable amount of my SMSF and private finances invested with GPS. Why? I believe they are extremely ethical and their knowledge of the Brisbane property market, and lending procedures, leaves nothing to be desired. They are always willing to answer your questions and treat you as a real person, not just another client. There are numerous ways you can invest, with great interest rates from 4.75% to 9.11%*. You can go with the Access Fund, with monthly access to your capital, or  the Select Fund that allows you to choose exactly where your funds are placed, or reinvest your interest in the Pooled Fund yielding an enticing rate of 9.11%*. I find this flexibility useful and have no hesitation in recommending GPS to any investor.

One of the reasons GPS can provide investors with above market returns is due to our operating a niche product (service, skill and culture are other reasons).
In general terms, GPS loans are too big for the bank manager but too small for their property departments.
When re-engineering the GPS business post-GFC, there were several items I wanted to enshrine into the GPS business model, such as:
1. We do senior debt, senior debt and only senior debt. We do not do second mortgages, mezzanine funding, joint ventures and the like.
2. We stick to our long-established and proven niche product.
3. It is all about looking after our investors’ best interests. The rest will follow from providing good service.
4. Not to become an institution. To stick to being a small and tightly run business.
My initial study was on the viability of the business where I developed the following graph, which shows the income to GPS against funds under management.

What came out of the study is that if you do not have enough funds under management you cannot generate a consistent return with fixed overheads eating away at profit. Then came the strong return phase, which included overheads for a small but competent team that was not reliant upon one or two people. The graph then shows that as the business becomes larger and heading towards being an institution, the overhead costs and margin from lending reduced profitability.
I then looked at investors’ returns. The graph was quite similar, which means the best interests of investors and GPS coincide. When there is a smaller amount of funds under management a consistent return was not possible, as usage ratios were lower. Then came the strong return phase to investors, where there was consistent usage of funds under management. Returns to investors then starts to drop. The traditional GPS loan product and market only has a limited depth, and increasing lending past this point leads to either a lowering of quality of loans, or lending into more competitive markets. By the time you are at institution size you are doing home loans, as that is where the volume is in the Australian lending market. If you are lending money at around 4% to borrowers and want a margin, then investors are going to get very little return.
Another aspect was my personal knowledge of loans. When lending is only a small part of the overall business, it can be left to others. There is then the number of loans which my comprehension can absorb. As the number of loans increases beyond my capacity to comprehend, my knowledge of each loan declines.
Thanks to the loyal and long-established GPS investor base, we are now sitting in the “niche market” quadrant for funds under management.
I revisited my analysis work on this topic when reviewing the 2016 fund performance summary from another well-known mortgage fund. In five years, their funds under management has grown from approximately $450 million to approximately $1.1 billion, but returns on their pooled fund have gone from 7.65% to 5.23%. Distributions from the GPS Invest Pooled Fund have grown in this period to a very consistent 8.75% p.a. I think this proves my point. However, I am confident that the other well-known mortgage fund would not agree.

Global Payment Solution (GPS)

Increase funds transfer efficiency and control with Montran Global Payment Solution.
Montran Sets Standard

Montran created the Global Payments Industry, a business of which so many proclaim "World Leadership".  None can claim to match our breadth, scope and adaptability.  Montran sets the World Standard.

The need for a new payments hub

Mergers and globalization in the banking industry are driving the need for an interoperative payments hub that enables global banks to compete more effectively. Automation, standardization, and Straight‐Through Processing are essential to success in such a marketplace, as are management of domestic and worldwide regulatory requirements, as well as reliable liquidity and risk management.

Montran Global Payment Solutions
The latest open‐system release of Montran’s successful and proven Global Payment System (GPS) is an online system for the automatic processing of all payments both foreign and domestic. In addition to being a SWIFT Ready application, Montran’s GPS has certified interfaces to clearing and settlement systems all over the world.
A truly global solution, GPS consolidates all payment infrastructures into a payment hub that supports multiple banks and branches, in multiple countries, using multiple currencies, in multiple languages.
Running on all popular platforms and relational databases, GPS delivers outstanding scalability and reliability.
Better funds management control
Montran’s liquidity management tracks positions throughout the day in real‐time. Interoperable with payment and communication data, this module provides immediate access to global currency position information and controls payment scheduling, routing and re‐routing in accordance with procedures specified by the bank.
Increase straight-through processing
GPS reduces operational costs and increases throughput by maximizing the rates of Straight-Through Processing (STP), enhancing the quality of received messages with the techniques evolved over its decades of international experience. Montran Users can expect the highest possible STP rates.
Improve operational efficiency
By multiple payment-related applications, such as our well established Investigation Compensation System, DDA Current Account System, General Ledger products, and Global Webstation, the Montran solution eliminates the costs and overhead of supporting multiple systems. GPS also reduces risk exposure by providing consolidated views of the bank’s position while improving the quality of customer service.
Montran Payment Gateway System
The Montran Payment Gateway provides a portal to communication networks, including SWIFT and other messaging providers, back-office systems and payments involving National Electronic Payment Systems (NEPS) such as RTGS, ACH and CSD. Flexible system architecture allows the Payment Gateway to adapt to any configuration requirement, including access from branches around the world. To facilitate STP for payment and message information, the Gateway accepts messages and payments in standard SWIFT FIN and MX, SEPA, ISO, XML, and proprietary formats. Outgoing payments and messages likewise comply with the requirements of SWIFT FIN and MX, SEPA, ISO, NEPS and comparable interfaces. The Payment Gateway uses a Thin Client to provide access to both head office and branches.
Montran Payment Services
Transformations in banking and payment technologies, such as IP replacing other protocols and the use of SWIFTNet and XML, are being adapted by clearing systems such as CHIPS, Fedwire, TARGET2, CLS and other CSMs. These institutions establish the standards for Payment Services, creating opportunities for a broad range of services for the bank’s clients. Montran’s use of modular components fully automates client payment services while significantly reducing the cost and risk associated with implementing complex payment applications. Montran offers solutions ranging from a simple client connection delivering payments to a system that provides a broad range of global services. An implementation of Client Payment Services comprises a variety of Payment Origination and Delivery options, all relevant Monitoring displays and broad-based Reporting facilities. Payment services include the processing of a full range of settlement and clearing transactions including SEPA credit transfers and direct debits, foreign currency transactions including conversion, correspondent payments, remittances, checks, and foreign drafts.  Instructions are enriched with Commission and Charges including special customer conditions, settlement instructions, economic codes, and accounting entries. Output messages are formatted and transmitted and acknowledgements are sent.

Other Features

Global Positioning -  allows real-time liquidity management, tracks positions throughout the day, and dynamically routes messages.
Flexible Customizations -  addresses each bank's specific requirements through the use of layered software implementations.
Message Standardization - usage of a common internal format allows automatic transformation to and from the appropriate SWIFT, ISO, or clearing formats and the bank's front-office and back-office systems.
Security - provides high-level, sophisticated security mechanisms that are approved and certified by central banks and industry organizations.
Extended Filtering System (EFS) - system for the identification and blocking of transactions involving parties found on OFAC (Office of Foreign Asset Control), Global Watch Lists, LAC (Local Asset Control), European and other countries' AML Lists.  EFS can be configured to run as independent module or integrated with GPS. 
Rules Engines - to reduce dependency upon the vendor, GPS provides Rules Engines throughout the application with an emphasis on Flow Control, Commissions and Charges, and Payment Type and Value Date determination, as well as the parametric controls that have proven valuable to customers.  Furthermore, a suite of user-level testing tools allows the bank to simulate potential modifications. 





GPS Core Modules

Global WebStation -  a powerful three-tier, cross-platform, client-facing, Java-based application that enables the user to exercise complete control over accounts at the host bank.
Liquidity Management -  a real-time multi-currency funds control management system that uses data produced by the payments and communication modules and provides immediate access to global monetary position information and control over scheduling and release of payments. Includes Cash pooling and sweeping of balances for one or more sets accounts in a tree structure.
Universal Interface -  a comprehensive middleware solution that automates the exchange of information between the funds transfer networks and any external system. It enables SWIFT-style, ISO, and XML message exchange to control account balance information, advice of receipt, disposition of payments and posting of daily activity, as well as general payment processing and advising.
Message Gateway -  allows multiple applications, banks and branches to share resources, and facilitates the exchange of payment messages to and from SWIFT, Clearing and Settlement Systems, back-office interfaces, and other interoperative products.
Mandate Management -  comprehensive management system allows mandates to be maintained either manually or from external systems such as a centralized ACH.  This module can run independently interfacing with the bank's own Payment System or can be integrated with Montran GPS to validate transactions in real-time against the mandates.





Security
The Montran GPS provides the highest level of protection and confidentiality of transaction information in the industry. The security standards are designed to meet or exceed those of the SWIFT network, even when not directly interfacing with SWIFT. Data access security is provided through both digital signature and encryption technology based on Public Key Technology. For any sensitive operation a four or even six‐eye approval policy is applied. Screens are designed to be user friendly and intuitive with customizable menus by way of user profile functions. The system supports integration with an LDAP server as a Centralized User Repository, Single Sign On and two‐factor authentication.

        Last updated: August 2016
    




There's almost no excuse for getting lost anymore. Using GPS (global positioning system) is a fact of modern life—whether it's on your smartphone, built into your car, or as a stand-alone portable navigation device that can be moved from car to car.
Most of us are familiar with how GPS makes travel easier. You can choose routing preferences (fastest, no tolls, or most fuel-efficient) and sometimes get real-time traffic info. The system works via satellite and can be set to show icons for gas stations or hospitals, or direct you to points of interest like national parks or tourist attractions.  
Many factors will determine which GPS system is best for you, including price, features, screen size, and portability—but most important: Are you glued to your smartphone? If so, you’ll be drawn to phone apps or in-car infotainment systems. We give the pros and cons of portable units, as well as built-ins and apps.









Life is a Highway
You can choose from many GPS systems—those that harness the power of your smartphone, versions that are built-in to the car, and portable units, the last of which we have actually tested. Check our full GPS Ratings for more (available to subscribers).
















Smartphone GPS Apps

Typical advantages of these are that they are often free, involve hardware (a phone) that you already own, and are always up-to-date.
How they work: Hop in the car with your smartphone and choose a pre-loaded app such as Google Maps or Apple Maps (or download the likes of Here, Waze, or Mapquest) and your phone service gives you multiple options for a smoother trip, complete with traffic views, alternate-route suggestions, and warnings if you’re going too fast. The often-bright displays of these apps can make them easy to read on a sun-drenched dashboard. Plus, you don’t have to buy any other GPS device—because you already have the smartphone—nor do you have to worry about carrying around a portable navigation device (PND).
Phones can also do things PNDs can't, such as warn you to leave early for a calendar appointment if traffic looks bad. Or, based on your past history, a phone app shows estimated travel time to your frequent destination on the lock screen. If you don't particularly like the navigation app that came with your phone, you have other great choices via the app store, many of them free (see “Free Ride: Top Map Apps” below for more info). Compared to portables or most in-dash options, the apps are easier to update, automatically loading the latest maps.
Consider this: Using phone-based phone GPS apps eats up precious data from your monthly plan, and some conk out during phone calls or when your cellular signal drops. (Some apps work around this by saving maps to your phone, so you won't lose your way—even if you lose phone service.) Whichever option you choose, you’ll likely need to purchase a mount, car charger (since navigation can quickly deplete a battery), and possibly a data plan for your phone (if you don’t already have one).











In-Car Infotainment Systems With Factory GPS

Carmakers' built-in proprietary infotainment systems typically work without a plugged-in smartphone.
How they work: It used to be that integrated factory systems were often the most expensive type of navigation aid. However, more and more cars are rolling off the assembly line complete with multifaceted infotainment systems that combine hardware and software to do things like regulate climate controls, provide updates on the engine and other systems, offer Bluetooth connectivity, in-car internet, wifi, and, typically, offer a navigation option.
Newer cars have the infotainment system screen built into the dashboard, and you adjust it using the touchscreen, steering wheel controls, or voice commands. With older cars that aren’t infotainment system-capable, you could install a GPS unit but would still need a professionally installed aftermarket head unit to run a full infotainment system. Like PNDs, built-in GPS systems work via satellite, so you won’t end up lost if you lose cell phone service.
Consider this: In our tests, we find that the quality of the carmakers’ branded infotainment systems varies widely and high-rated systems don’t necessarily align with high-rated cars. If you don't like the infotainment system that came with your car, you can opt for phone-based apps such as Google's Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, which plug your smartphone into a car that supports either app.
See our reviews of infotainment systems proprietary to brands as well as the favorites from our survey covering more than 58,000 cars.












Android Auto and Apple CarPlay

These integrated infotainment systems are built into your car, or professionally installed aftermarket, and use either a plugged-in Android smartphone or iPhone as a conduit.
How they work: Increasingly, new cars come equipped with infotainment systems, a mix of hardware and software that combines information and entertainment to give access to navigation and audio systems, USB and Bluetooth connectivity, in-car internet, and wifi, among other features. There are proprietary infotainment systems from carmakers such as Chrysler, GM, and Hyundai that run without a phone (see “In-Car Infotainment Systems…” for more on these), but more and more automakers are supporting these two smartphone-based infotainment systems from Google and Apple. Android Auto and Apple CarPlay plug into a system-supporting car and, voila, you’re seamlessly connected. A modified version of your smartphone screen (with larger icons and an edited-down menu) appears on the in-dash screen, allowing you to use the phone and apps in a less distracting way. Since you’re already addicted to…er, familiar with your smartphone’s ways, this saves the bother of learning the ins and outs of an automaker’s (possibly clunky) proprietary system. Older cars would need a professionally-installed aftermarket head unit. The current market price for Caplay/Android Auto-capable units is around $500 (installed).

Consider this: Since it’s your phone, you already know how it works, and can “Hey, Siri” and “Ok Google” as usual. However, these platforms only run approved apps—for example, you can’t get Google Maps on Apple's system, and you might want to check that your favorite music-streaming service or podcatcher is supported. The phone-powered navigation automatically updates maps and other apps.




















Telematics Systems

These “concierge”-style call buttons came on the scene in the mid 1990s.
How they work: Carmakers combine GPS and cellular technology to access emergency help or a variety of convenience services from the vehicle. Systems include BMW Assist, GM OnStar, Toyota Entune, Hyundai Blue Link, Lexus Safety Connect, and Mercedes-Benz mbrace. Specific services—both paid and free—vary. The systems typically offer a menu of services, including emergency crash notification and assistance, a stolen-vehicle locater, and roadside assistance. Some telematics systems will unlock your car door remotely.
Navigation is typically one of the services provided, via a basic graphic display showing each coming turn along with voice direction. Advantages include ease of use and being able to ask for directions by talking to a human at the other end of the line, even while driving. Another plus is that you don't have to pay for updated mapping information. Older cars with telematics but lacking dash screens will have you interact with a computerized voice when getting directions.
Consider this: On the downside, these systems can be expensive and you have to be in an area with good cell phone coverage for them to work. Typically, The vehicle has to be equipped from the factory, although some companies offer costly aftermarket installation. Car companies may offer an initial trial period of the service, then charge a service fee. It’s a good idea to study up beforehand on what is a paid service and what’s not. Check with individual carmakers for more info about particular systems.











Portable GPS

The name says it all—they can move with you from car to car.
How they work: Like built-in systems, these are connected to a satellite, so—unlike cell phone apps—they can never freeze and leave you stranded when you lose phone service. Portables usually offer the same features as built-in systems, plus more—and often cost less. Typically, the volume can be turned up louder than phone apps. Portables are compact and easy to carry with you or share with others. Real-time traffic reporting is usually reasonably priced and voice commands are sometimes available. We’ve found that map updates are less costly (than with built-ins); some models even come with lifetime updates for a modest charge. Some newer models come with Bluetooth hands-free calling and dashboard camcorders that can save footage of a trip, and, in the case of an accident, capture still images.
Consider this: Screens are usually smaller than in-dash models, and potentially hard to read. Voice command programming capability is so-so, compared to the best car systems. These should be securely mounted and placed where they won’t interfere with airbag deployment or block visibility. Other disadvantage: Your phone already has built-in GPS with a free app. Buying a portable device is an additional purchase—and something to carry around.

It’s worth noting that battery life is minimal or can decrease over time. If the battery loses its charge, you have to connect via power cord. It’s best to routinely charge the battery; when batteries die on some models, the unit must be replaced. And, usually, when you leave the car, a portable should be hidden or removed to deter thieves. Prices range from about $80 to $400.
Portable GPS Ratings





















Oh, the Places You’ll Go
Most GPS navigators will home in on a destination, but not always via the most efficient route. A few tips tailored to your typical travel conditions tell you what you can’t live (or drive) without.
Easy to Use
Making navigation easier is the prime directive of these gadgets, so look at our ease-of-use scores in the Ratings for PNDs. The models that tested high for us make it especially easy to enter destinations (even by speaking them) and give the most helpful directions. Some interfaces are more intuitive than others, and low-scorers can be awkward, slow, or both.
Keeps Track of Traffic
If you tend to stick to a routine on your commute or errands, you might get the most use out of a navigation system or app that offers real-time traffic info. You’ll know about—and avoid—accidents, road closures, and speed traps. Bear in mind that traffic reporting on portable GPS units or pre-infotainment-system built-ins is not perfect; it can be inaccurate or outdated. Phone apps that offer real-time traffic allow you to peek in on traffic cameras and allow for crowd sourced tips on tie-ups and detours.
Shows Stamina
If you have more than one car or often rent cars, you might prefer a portable system or smartphone app that’s always there riding shotgun on your travels. If you’ll be using a PND for walking or accessing multimedia features outside of the car, look for a battery that has at least two hours on a charge.
The Matter of Size
If you have a hard time deciphering tiny maps, consider a built-in or infotainment system, which generally have larger screens. You can even go really big with special PNDs for commercial trucks, vans, and RVs (since dashboards are farther away from the driver’s seat). These models will also take into account low-bridge clearance and parkway restrictions. However, if you often pack a GPS unit in your suitcase, you may want to go smaller: For a PND screen large enough to read easily without blocking your view, we’ve found a 4-inch diagonal screen a good compromise for travelers, but for regular use, a 4.7-inch size is easier to work with.








            Latest GPS Ratings
        











Free Ride: Top Map Apps
If you’re a fan of your phone, you’re probably already using a free navigation app. These are some we like.
Apple Maps
Offers 3D views as well as the bird's-eye-view Flyover feature. You'll get real-time traffic monitoring and turn-by-turn spoken directions. It even gives public transportation guidance and help remembering  where you parked. Ask Siri to take you there (wherever that is), bookmark locations on Maps, and save them to the cloud. You can access them later via your Mac, iPad, iPhone, or iPod Touch. As of now, you can only get this app on iOS devices.
Google Maps
This worldwide app offers constant updating of maps and features, which can be downloaded for a limited time for offline use. You can get real-time GPS navigation, traffic, and transit help. Find and make pit stops along the way for a fill-up (at a gas station or a café). Street View and indoor imagery help keep you on track whether you’re outside or in (helpful for large places such as malls, museums, or stadiums). Available on iOS and Android.
Here Maps
Drive, ride, or walk with worldwide map coverage, turn-by-turn voice guidance, speed limit info, and nearby POI. Offline maps and navigation ensures that you know your way (via downloaded maps) whether you have a data connection or not. You also get public transit directions for over 900 cities around the world. There is even a biking option. Available on iOS and Android.
Waze
This community based traffic and navigation app allows you and other drivers in your area to share real-time traffic and road info. Users drive with the app open to passively contribute traffic and other road data (there’s also an active community of online map editors). Waze can also actively give a heads-up regarding accidents or any other hazards. You’ll get turn-by-turn voice guided navigation, active re-routing, and alerts re speed cameras. Available on iOS and Android.

Features That Go the Distance
Consider these options (and our GPS Ratings) when buying a portable navigation device (PND).














Power Supply All portable systems can be powered through a car's 12-volt socket, and all have an internal rechargeable battery. We found that those units typically operate for 2 to 4 hours on a charge, although our testing has revealed significant variance among models. Internal power also allows you to practice using the system and program driving destinations while you are away from the car, or to use the device as a hand-held tool when traveling, walking, or bicycling. An AC power adapter is sometimes included with the systems, allowing the device to be used and recharged indoors. Many can also be charged via a computer’s USB port.
 






Screen Size We've tested portable systems with screens ranging from 3.5 to 7 inches. The smallest can be hard to see, and their small touch-screen buttons can make it tedious to enter an address. On the other hand, the largest units can be bulky to carry, and tend to obstruct more of your view when mounted to the windshield. A 4-inch screen (measured diagonally) is acceptable, but 4.7-inch screens are easier to read and use, while still being easily portable. Larger screens are increasingly available, and these big units can be especially useful for trucks or RVs where the windshield is far from the driver.
 






Real-Time Traffic Reports Units with traffic information can alert you to a problem or slowdown ahead in time to avoid it. The real-time data is available to subscribers through a cell-phone network, FM signal, or satellite radio service. The quality of information—like any traffic reporting—can vary or be less than current. We're seeing more and more devices with free, advertising-supported traffic information, but some are still subscription based, and some require an additional receiver costing up to $100. Some models factor in historical traffic data when calculating routes and can guide you around known congestion patterns, such as rush-hour traffic. 
 






Detour Request If you see traffic building up ahead, a manual "detour" button will find you an alternative route. Some models allow the user to select a specific distance to route around a problem. Traffic-capable devices integrate their traffic information with detouring functions, prompting a user to choose an alternative route when traffic conditions are unfavorable. That can be helpful in evaluating options before changing course.

(Basically, it tells you which exit ramp is yours.) And the lane assistance indicates the appropriate lane (via an arrow) for the driver to travel in order to execute their upcoming maneuver.

Mounting Hardware Manufacturers typically use an angled rigid arm to attach the unit to a suction cup or magnet. Look for a unit that is easy to install and remove from the mount. Typically, a unit slides onto a mount or snaps into it. The power cord either plugs into the mount or directly into the unit. We've found the most convenient models have the cord plugging directly into the mount, allowing you to snap in and release the unit with the push of a button. Check local laws for any restrictions on placement.
 






Foreign Languages Many units offer spoken and displayed directions in Spanish and French, in addition to English, and several have even more choices. Some TomTom models can provide spoken directions in more than 30 languages, but can't display them all on the screen. For specific language needs, check with the device manufacturer's website for the latest out-of-the-box abilities and additional language features that might be available by download.

Lifetime Maps If this comes with your GPS, it typically means that you can download multiple maps annually for the life of the unit (or as long as it’s supported) for no additional charge. (Note that this may require your PND to be hooked up to a computer for around an hour).

Front Camera Some portables now have the ability to record video. These dashcams are useful in case of accident; some models even sense the impact of a crash and lock in the relevant video or still footage.

3D and Satellite Views These add-ons show details of the terrain and altitude, or actual aerial satellite imagery. This is useful for travelers (including off-road drivers and hikers); data can also be shared via social media.

                    Google Maps is the most well-known worldwide app available with constant updating of maps and features which can be downloaded for a limited time for offline use.  Street View—among the almost unlimited pieces of location information provided—is a favorite feature.  Google has proven itself to be reliable and dependable.
                



                    Here Maps is owned by an automobile consortium of manufacturers that include Audi, BMW and Daimler (Mercedes).  It offers worldwide map coverage and has offline options so that regional maps can be downloaded and used without a mobile connection.  The consortium powers major mapping providers and government clients.  Destinations can be saved for quick access at a later date.
                



                    Magellan develops and distributes vehicle navigation, crossover GPS, and outdoor handheld navigation products.  It currently sells RoadMate and SmartGPS brand lines for automobiles.
                



                    TomTom offers products covering portable automobile and motorcycle navigation, in-dashboard navigation and car control services as well as navigation software for installation on mobile devices.  Presently the brand lineup includes the GO and the VIA for automobiles.
                



                    Waze, purchased by Google in 2013, is the world’s largest community-based traffic and navigation app available.  Its local driving community advises of traffic tie-ups, police traps, and low gas prices, among its many other features.
