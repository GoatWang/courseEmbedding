Galenfeha, Inc. Completes Field Testing, Begins Production and Shipping of New Battery System

Jul 28, 2014, 08:30 ET
		  		  							
						 from   Galenfeha, Inc. 











 
















































 

 




















 


SHREVEPORT, La., July 28, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- After successful field testing, the management team of Galenfeha, Inc. (GLFH), is pleased to announce the start of production and shipping of its Microprocessor Controlled LiFePO4 Dry-Cell Battery System. Third-party field testing of the system yielded incredibly positive results in both automation/measurement as well as chemical injection-pump scenarios. 
Galenfeha's patent pending technology easily reaches a 2-1 ratio in consistent voltage delivery and a 10-1 ratio in overall life-cycle longevity compared to current lead acid battery systems. This proprietary battery system provides unparalleled short-circuit and overcharge protection, representing a vertical leap in safety and reliability versus existing technology. 
Unique features of Galenfeha's new battery system include:

Environmentally friendly, short circuit controlled to eliminate accidental arcing and possibility for explosion 
Requires no voltage/charge interface device for use with solar panels 
Via thermistor driven environmental data input, the unit will self-regulate its internal temperature to eliminate cold climate damage and dramatically improve lifespan 
Will not freeze as it contains no liquid 
Will not overcharge 
Will not over discharge 
Will not allow the reversion of polarity which will cause an explosion in conventional batteries 
Significantly lower in weight to reduce the potential for weight related employee injuries 
Has an integrated "sleep mode" which allows energy storage of 90% capacity for over a year 
No lead and no sulfuric acid 
Will not explode 
Possesses a re-charge cycle capability of up to 4000 cycles at the current state of 11.9V discharge vs. less than 850 cycles on conventional lead acid technology. 
Galenfeha is presently in production of its new product line and is now accepting purchase orders. The company shipped its initial customer order on Friday, July 25, 2014. 
Galenfeha, Inc. is an engineering services and product development/manufacturing company serving the oil, gas, and energy industries. Led by President/CEO James Ketner, the company is continually researching and developing new products to aid energy producers in reducing costs, increasing efficiency, and reducing global pollution.

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the selling 
security holders. All of the net proceeds from the sale of our common stock 
will go to the selling security holders. We have agreed to bear the expenses 
relating to the registration of the common stock for the selling security 
holders.


Our initial power generation product is unique to the natural gas market
therefore there is no direct competitor; however, our product would be
considered a replacement for the traditional combination of deep cycle lead-acid
batteries and solar panels. In each of these industries, there are a large
number of companies around the world manufacturing deep cycle lead-acid
batteries and solar panels. According to an annual market survey done by Photon
International, the top 10 solar module players are dominated by Chinese
companies; the US companies listed were First Solar and SunPower.

Today the main solution for powering remote well locations comprises a
combination of lead-acid deep-cycle battery and portable solar panels. Both of
these products are required to create the current power source for remote
computerized flow meters for our initial target market. Major modes of failure
of deep-cycle batteries are loss of the active material due to shedding of the
plates, and corrosion of the internal grid that supports active material. The
capacity of a deep cycle battery is usually limited by electrolyte capacity and
not by the plate mass, to improve life expectancy. Solar power has its drawbacks
as well. According to an article posted to clean energy ideas the disadvantage
of Solar Energy include high upfront installation costs, large surface area
required, dependence on the weather, no night-time functionality. The article
can be found here: www.clean-energy-ideas.com/solar/solar-energy/disadvantages-
of-solar-energy.

In each of these industries, there are a large number of companies around the
world manufacturing deep cycle lead-acid batteries and solar panels. According
to an annual market survey done by Photon International, the top 10 solar module
players are dominated by Chinese companies; the US companies listed were First
Solar and Sunpower. Among the leaders in the deep-cycle lead acid battery
manufacturers are Exide Technologies, NorthStar Battery and Crown Batteries. All
of these companies have well established manufacturing and distribution networks
worldwide.

We believe our product will have none of the inherent issues associated with
technologies currently being used to power remote well production locations. Our
product is not dependent on nor affected by weather conditions, nor does it
contribute to the carbon footprint or climatic change issues because it uses the
naturally occurring flow of kinetic energy within natural gas pipelines to
create power. We believe our product will produce clean, sustainable power as
long as the well is producing gas. We believe that our greatest challenges will
be establishing a broad distribution network, creating a supply chain management
system and commercializing our product to the greater portion of North America.


Company Description
Galenfeha was incorporated on March 14, 2013 under the laws of the State of
Nevada with a fiscal year end of December 31. We are an engineering company that
will be providing engineering services and an alternative power generation
product mainly to natural gas producers. Not only will we be


 providing
contractual engineering services, we hope to implement our proprietary product
into the mainstream of natural gas production sites, and sell the product to
natural gas producers through a distribution network of oil field services
companies.

Currently, computerized flow meters used in remote natural gas production
locations are powered by lead acid, deep-cycle marine batteries that are in turn
powered by solar panels, which can be subject to weather conditions and require
significant space and specialized maintenance. Depending on the size of the
natural gas operation, there may be multiple flow meters per production site.

Galenfeha is developing a kinetic energy solution that would eliminate or reduce
the dependence on the solar panel-lead acid battery combination, and provide a
simple, easy to install mechanism that utilizes the energy that already exists
within the natural gas pipeline to power the computerized flow meters. During
August of 2013, a series of successful bench tests proved the feasibility of our
product. Our product operates in the gas flow, and utilizes the existing kinetic
energy flowing through natural gas in recovery pipelines to generate power for
the computerized flow meter that measure a well’s output. We believe this
product will generate an abundance of power, enough to support the flow
computers power requirements and spare capacity that could be resold to regional
power distributers. We believe our product will reduce the dependence on
conventional options such as expensive solar panels and hazardous lead acid
batteries, which have historically been used at natural gas production sites to
power computerized flow meters.

We also believe that our product delivers several significant benefits to
natural gas producers and the energy industry as a whole. This technology is
designed to:

. simplify the current kluge of apparatus needed to monitor computerized flow 
  meters, 

. generate a reliable, lower carbon footprint source for computerized flow 
  meters, 

. increase clean energy production, and 

. provide additional revenue as an alternative energy source for redistribution
  to local utilities.
