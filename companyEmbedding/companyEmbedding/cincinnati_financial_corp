Cincinnati Financial Corporation Vs. Aflac Inc.: What Is The Best Insurer For A Dividend Seeker? - Aflac Incorporated (NYSE:AFL) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Cincinnati Financial Corporation Vs. Aflac Inc.: What Is The Best Insurer For A Dividend Seeker?Mar.20.17 | About: Aflac Incorporated (AFL) The CrickAnt Long only, value, insurance, mid-capSummaryCincinnati Financial Corporation and Aflac Inc. are considered as the best-in-class listed insurers for any dividend seekers, retirees, or passive investors.As they increase their dividends gradually, the long-term investors love these stocks.Hence it sounds logical to ask ourselves if one of the companies is better performing.That's why I decided to review both companies to see if one of them is performing better and which stock should be part of a passive portfolio.Notes for the readers Most of the figures are based on the financial reports of Aflac Inc. (NYSE:AFL) and Cincinnati Financial Corp (NASDAQ:CINF). The Buckeye State Or The Japanese US-Based Duck? 

 Source: Internal For most of the dividend seekers, retirees, or passive investors, Cincinnati Financial Corp. and Aflac Inc. are the best-in-class listed insurers which increase their dividends gradually, rewarding the long-term investors. I am not a dividend seeker nor a retiree nor a passive investor. In the future, I would be classified at least in one of this category (especially becoming an early retiree if I have the chance to have the capital to live with the received dividends). But for the moment, the Ohio-based P&C insurer or the US's largest provider of supplemental insurance are not on my wish list. However, I am still interested in the insurance companies and their ability to generate an extraordinary amount of cash, either thanks to a strong operating performance or an excellent capital management. And sometimes the insurers have a strong track record at the operating level and at an investing level. But at least being Warren B. or one if his spiritual heirs, insurers' top management should choose between operating performance and investment performance.
 Regarding the profile of the two companies, both insurers seem to have a good operating performance, but let's have a look more deeply to see if one of them is performing better. Competitive Position: The Growing Dwarf And The Would-Be Declining Giant 

 Source: Internal Cincinnati Financial Corp. is a P&C multiline insurer which provides products for various business lines and operates mainly in the United States. On the contrary, Aflac Inc. is a leading niche insurer, only focused on one type of health insurance product, in the U.S. and Japan, which is its primary market. Regarding net earned premiums, Aflac is bigger than Cincinnati. The US's largest provider of supplemental insurance collects four times more premiums than Cincinnati Financial Corp. 

 Source: Internal However, the trend is more positive for the Ohio-based P&C insurer than for Aflac. In 5 years, the earned premiums grew by $1,188 million, while Aflac earned in 2016 $3.2 billion less than in 2012. Is Aflac a declining giant? Not exactly. As the central part of its business comes from Japan, the insurer is exposed to the fluctuations in the yen/dollar exchange rate. At a constant rate, Aflac's earned premiums increased over the 5 years, but the fluctuations in the yen/dollar exchange rate completely hid the growth of the turnover. Hence, both the insurers are growing companies, but foreign currency rate fluctuations harshly impact one of them.
 Operating Performance: The Domination Of The US-based Mikado 

 Source: Internal At operating performance level, there is no match. Aflac wins undoubtedly. With a 5-year average combined ratio of 93.6%, the health insurer has a strong track record. Does Cincinnati Financial lose money when it writes new policies? No, it does not. With a 94.3% combined on the average, the P&C insurer monitors its business extremely well. Cincinnati's net loss ratio is even lower than Aflac's, thanks to an extensive diversification regarding lines of business (Aflac is mainly concentrated on cancer insurance policies and health voluntary supplemental insurance policies), a strong loss control practices and good standards regarding pricing methodology. 

 Source: Internal However, the expense ratio is around 30%, due to the commissions paid to distribution channel and other administrative costs. 

 Source: Internal By comparing only Aflac's U.S. subsidiary, we arrive at the same conclusion; with a 38% net expense ratio, Aflac's cost efficiency is lower in the U.S. than Cincinnati's. Hopefully, for Aflac, the central part of the business is written in Japan, where the company is the market leader, is very well implemented, and distributes its products through multiple distribution channels (e.g. banks, brokers, tied-agents). In the end, Aflac's Japanese subsidiary is very well cost efficient and impacts the total net expense ratio of the U.S. insurer positively.
 Another thing should be pointed out: the technical result of Aflac is less volatile than Cincinnati's. Every year, Aflac delivers a combined ratio of around 94%. For the Ohio-based P&C insurer, it is not as stable as for Aflac. The main reason is that the P&C multiliner is more exposed to the catastrophes (flood, hail, wind, etc.), as it sells traditional non-life insurance products. Hence, one year could be harshly impacted by one big natural catastrophe in spite of a well-designed reinsurance program. Regarding earnings per share, Aflac overwhelms Cincinnati Financial Corp. 

 Source: Internal The reasons are the following:  Aflac is bigger than the Ohio-based P&C insurance company and delivers a better combined ratio Aflac repurchases a good portion of its shares every year, causing the earnings per share to increase accordingly The investment income is higher for Aflac than for Cincinnati Financial Corp.  However, it is also important to moderate two of the above remarks. The 5-year EPS growth of Cincinnati Financial Corp. is 38.1%, while the earnings per share increased only by 5.1% for Aflac, mainly impacted by the foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Aflac Inc. remains in my view a stronger company regarding operating performance than Cincinnati Financial Corp. Share Repurchase Program: The No-Match 

 Source: Internal By looking at the figures, it is evident that one company repurchases its shares every year, while the other one does not, and even issues new shares. From 2012 to 2016, the number of outstanding shares of the multiliner increased by 1.7%, while the niche insurer repurchased 11.8% of its share in the same period. Hence, there is no match. Aflac wins.
 Dividend Policy: The No-Match, Again? 

 Source: Internal Both companies are well known for increasing the annualized paid dividend almost every year. A lot of retirees, dividend seekers, and passive investors are willing to purchase shares of Aflac or Cincinnati Financial Corp., even if both stocks are overvalued because they know the capital allocation of these companies is focused on rewarding the long-term shareholders. But is one of the companies more generous? Definitely yes. On an absolute basis, Cincinnati pays a higher dividend than Aflac does. However, Aflac has two advantages compared to the Ohio-based insurer:  Aflac's payout ratio is lower than Cincinnati's. In other words, Aflac has more leeway either to increase its dividend or to smoothen a decrease of its results due to a deterioration of the claims situation. With a 5-year average payout ratio of 57.0%, Cincinnati should deliver better results year after year to avoid drawing down cash reserves.  

 Source: Internal Another thing which should be pointed out is related to the dividend growth. With 23.9% 5-year growth, Aflac is more regular than Cincinnati is. 


 Source: Internal An investor could expect Aflac to increase its annual dividend by 5%, while the dividend increase is slightly more volatile from Cincinnati. However, in both the cases, we could see that the dividend growth is lower year after year. From Aflac's perspective, we could expect to maintain a 5% increase, either thanks to better results arising from fluctuation effects in the yen exchange rate or due to the growth of payout. From Cincinnati Financial Corporation, we could expect its dividend to increase by 4% annually. Hence Aflac wins, but at long term, both companies could be less attractive if the dividend growth slows. Debt & Financial Condition: A Draw With an A+ rating delivered by Fitch, Moody's (NYSE:MCO) and S&P (NYSE:SPGI), Aflac is considered as a reliable insurance company and issued notes accordingly. With a net debt position of around $500 million ($5.3 billion debt - $4.9 billion cash), Aflac is not too highly leveraged. With 10 million net debt position, Cincinnati is less leveraged than the US-based health insurer. With an A+ rating, Cincinnati Financial Corp. is also assessed by the credit rating agencies as an insurer with a strong financial situation. However, the interest paid by Cincinnati Financial Corp is relatively higher than those paid by Aflac. The long-term debt notes of the P&C multiliner were issued at around 6.2%-6.9%, while Aflac issued extinguished high-yield notes in the past to issue new bonds with a lower yield (2%-4% depending on the maturity date) or high-yield notes (around 6%) with a longer maturity (2039 and after). A better net debt position vs. a lower debt burden: it is a draw. Financial Performance: Let's Take A Pragmatic Approach As value investors, we are always interested in the stock valuation. As retirees or dividend seekers, we are not focused on the stock price. We are only interested in knowing if we will receive more money than the year before, if the dividend payment will remain sustainable, and if we don't lose money in case we should purchase our stocks.
 If an investor had invested $100 in Aflac in 2011 and reinvested the dividends, he would have more than $200 at the end of 2016. 

 Source: Aflac's 2016 annual report In the same period, he would have $300 if he would have invested $100 in Cincinnati Financial Corporation. 

 Source: Cincinnati Financial Corporation's 2016 annual report To make a long story short, an investor will be richer by having invested in Cincinnati Financial Corporation than in Aflac Inc. Conclusion: Cincinnati Financial Corporation or Aflac Inc.? On a pure stock performance perspective, I would choose Cincinnati Financial Corporation. It seems that the market considered in the past the multiliner as more resilient and more profitable than the US-based niche insurer. However, if I would only have a look at the metrics, I would pick up Aflac Inc. More efficient operationally speaking, completely focused on increasing the value delivered to its shareholders through its stock repurchase program and its dividend policy, and more pragmatic and smarter on the debt management, Aflac Inc. seems to be a must-have stock. Considering the above statements, I would invest in both stocks. But it would be considered by many as a non-committal choice. Hence, if I had to choose only one, I would pick Aflac Inc. up, as I appreciate a lot the niche insurers.

					Full Description



Cincinnati Financial Corporation, incorporated on March 4, 1992, is an insurance holding company. As of December 31, 2016, the Company was engaged in the business of property casualty insurance marketed through independent insurance agencies in 41 states. The Company operates through five segments: Commercial lines insurance, Personal lines insurance, Excess and surplus lines insurance, and Life insurance and Investments. The Company's subsidiaries include The Cincinnati Insurance Company, CSU Producer Resources Inc. and CFC Investment Company. The Cincinnati Insurance Company owns four additional insurance subsidiaries. The Company's market property casualty insurance group includes two of those subsidiaries: The Cincinnati Casualty Company and The Cincinnati Indemnity Company. This group writes a range of business, homeowner and auto policies. Other subsidiaries of The Cincinnati Insurance Company includes The Cincinnati Life Insurance Company, which provides life insurance, disability income policies and fixed annuities, and The Cincinnati Specialty Underwriters Insurance Company, which offers excess and surplus lines insurance products.The two non-insurance subsidiaries of Cincinnati Financial Corporation are CSU Producer Resources Inc., which offer insurance brokerage services to independent agencies, so that their clients can access the Company's excess and surplus lines insurance products, and CFC Investment Company, which offers commercial leasing and financing services to its agencies, their clients, and other customers. The Company offers an array of insurance products through the independent agency distribution channel. The Company offers insurance coverages for business property and liability, automobiles and homes.Commercial Lines Insurance SegmentThe Company's Commercial Lines Insurance Segment provides five commercial business lines: commercial casualty, commercial property, commercial auto, workers' compensation and other commercial lines. Commercial casualty provides coverage to businesses against third-party liability from accidents occurring on their premises or arising out of their operations, including injuries sustained from products or liability related to professional services. Specialized casualty policies may include similar coverage, such as umbrella liability or employment practices. The commercial casualty business line includes liability coverage written as part of commercial package policies. Commercial property provides coverage for loss or damage to buildings, inventory and equipment caused by covered causes of loss, such as fire, wind, hail, water, theft and vandalism, as well as business interruption resulting from a covered loss. Commercial property also includes other coverages, such as inland marine insurance, which covers losses related to builder's risk, cargo or equipment. Various property coverages can be written as standalone policies or can be added to a commercial package policy.The Commercial auto business line protects businesses against liability to others for both bodily injury and property damage, medical payments to insureds and occupants of their vehicles, physical damage to an insured's own vehicle from collision and various other perils, and damages caused by uninsured motorists. Workers' compensation covers employers for government-specified benefits from work-related injuries to employees. Other commercial lines include various other types of insurance products for businesses, including management liability and surety, specialty packages, and machinery and equipment. The management liability and surety business line includes director and officer (D&O) liability insurance, which covers liability for actual or alleged errors in judgment, breaches of duty or other wrongful acts related to activities of organizations and can optionally include other liability coverages. Specialty packages include coverages for property, liability and business interruption tailored to meet the needs of specific industry classes, such as artisan contractors, dentists or smaller main street businesses. The Machinery and equipment is a specialized coverage that provides protection for loss or damage to boilers and machinery, including production and computer equipment and business interruption, due to sudden and accidental mechanical breakdown, steam explosion or artificially generated electrical current.Personal Lines Insurance SegmentThe personal lines property insurance segment writes personal lines coverage in accounts that include both auto and homeowner coverages, as well as coverages that are part of its other personal business line. The Company provides line of business data for three business lines: Personal auto, Homeowner and other personal lines. The Personal auto protects against liability to others for both bodily injury and property damage, medical payments to insureds and occupants of their vehicle, physical damage to an insured's own vehicle from collision and various other perils, and damages caused by uninsured motorists. In addition, various states require policies to provide first-party personal injury protection, referred to as no-fault coverage. Homeowner protects against losses to dwellings and contents from a range of perils, as well as liability arising out of personal activities both on and off the covered premises. The Company also offers coverage for condominium unit owners and renters. The other personal lines include insurance products it offers to individuals, such as dwelling fire, inland marine, personal umbrella liability and watercraft coverages.Excess and Surplus Lines Insurance SegmentThe excess and surplus lines insurance segment covers business risks with characteristics, such as the nature of the business or its claim history that are difficult to profitably insure in the standard commercial lines market. It provides coverages for commercial casualty and commercial property. The commercial casualty covers businesses for third-party liability from accidents occurring on their premises or arising out of their operations, including injuries sustained from products. Other coverages available include miscellaneous errors and omissions, professional liability and excess liability. Typical businesses covered include contractors, manufacturers, real estate owners and managers, retail, consultants, and bars or taverns. Policies covering liability at special events are also available. Commercial property insures buildings, inventory, equipment and business income from loss or damage due to causes, such as fire, wind, hail, water, theft and vandalism.Life Insurance SegmentThe Company's life insurance segment supports its agency-centered business model. The Company focuses on life products that feature a stream of payments. The life insurance business lines include four lines of business: term life insurance, universal life insurance, worksite products and whole life insurance. Under term life insurance policies, a death benefit is payable only if the insured dies during a specific period of time. Policy options include a return of premium provision, a benefit equal to the sum of all paid base premiums that is payable if the insured person survives to the end of the term. The policies are fully underwritten. Universal life insurance comprises long-duration life insurance policies. The worksite products include term life insurance, return of premium term life insurance, whole life insurance, universal life and disability insurance offered to employees through their employer. Premiums are collected by the employer using payroll deduction. Policies are issued using an underwriting approach and on a guaranteed issue basis. Worksite insurance products provide its property casualty agency force with cross-serving opportunities for both commercial and personal accounts.Whole life insurance policies provide life insurance for the entire lifetime of the insured. While premiums are fixed, they must be paid as scheduled. These policies provide guaranteed cash values that are available as loans collateralized by the cash surrender value. The policies are fully underwritten.Investments SegmentThe revenues of the investments segment are from net investment income and from realized investment gains, and losses from investment portfolios managed for the holding company and each of the operating subsidiaries. The cash it generates from insurance operations has been invested in two categories of investments: fixed-maturity investments and equity investments. Fixed-maturity investments include taxable and tax-exempt bonds and redeemable preferred stocks. The equity investments include common and nonredeemable preferred stocks.

Cincinnati Financial Becomes #74 Most Shorted S&P 500 Component, Replacing Quest Diagnostics
The most recent short interest data has been released for the 01/13/2017 settlement date, and we here at Dividend Channel like to sift through this fresh data and order the underlying components of the S&P 500 by "days to cover." There are a number of ways to look at short data, for example the total number of shares short; but one metric that we find particularly useful is the "days to cover" metric because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares typically traded. The number of shares short is then compared to the average daily volume, in order to calculate the total number of trading days it would take to close out all of the open short positions if every share traded represented a short position being closed.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Cincinnati Financial Corporation offers property and casualty insurance, its main business, through The Cincinnati Insurance Company, The Cincinnati Indemnity Company and The Cincinnati Casualty Company. The company has 1.01% of the domestic property and casualty insurance premiums, which ranks it as the 20th largest insurance company by market share in the U.S.[3]
The Cincinnati Insurance Company was founded in 1950 by four agents, including brothers John Jack Schiff and Robert Cleveland Schiff.[4]
The Cincinnati Life Insurance Company markets life and disability income insurance and annuities. CFC Investment Company supports the insurance subsidiaries and their independent agent representatives through commercial leasing and financing activities. CinFin Capital Management Company provides asset management services to institutions, corporations and individuals.
In 2001, SFAS 133 adjustments were included with realized capital gains or losses rather than investment income. The impact on nine-month 2001 earnings was an after-tax gain of $1.3 million. Prior period 2001 results were restated on this basis.
In 2008, Cincinnati began writing excess and surplus lines insurance under a new subsidiary called the Cincinnati Specialty Underwriters Insurance Company.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
