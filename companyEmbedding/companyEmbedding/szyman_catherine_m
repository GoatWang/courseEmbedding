  Department of Health and Human ServicesPublic Health ServiceFood and Drug Administration 10903 New Hampshire AvenueSilver Spring, MD 20993  September 19, 2013WARNING LETTER VIA UNITED PARCEL SERVICE Ms. Catherine M. SzymanSenior Vice President and PresidentMedtronic MiniMed18000 Devonshire StreetNorthridge, CA 91325-1219 DearMs. Szyman: During an inspection of your firm located in Northridge, California on February 11, 2013 through April 12, 2013, investigators from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that your firm manufactures Paradigm Insulin Infusion Pumps.  This inspection was conducted as a pre-approval inspection under PMA P120010 for the MiniMed 530G Continuous Glucose Monitoring System which uses the currently marketed Paradigm Insulin Infusion Pumps as a component of the new device. Under section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. § 321(h), these products are devices because they are intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or any function of the body. This inspection revealed that these devices are adulterated within the meaning of section 501(h) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(h), in that the methods used in, or the facilities or controls used for, their manufacture, packing, storage, or installation are not in conformity with the current good manufacturing practice requirements of the Quality System regulation found at Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 820.  We received responses from Catherine Mary Szyman, Senior Vice President and President dated May 3, 2013, June 10, 2013, and July 16, 2013, concerning our investigators’ observations noted on the Form FDA 483 (FDA 483), List of Inspectional Observations, that was issued to your firm. We address these responses below, in relation to each of the noted violations.  These violations include, but are not limited to, the following: 1.    Failure to establish and maintain procedures for implementing corrective and preventive action, as required by 21 CFR 820.100(a). For example: A. Your corrective and preventive action (CAPA) system (SOP 114-01, Product Realization) requires CAPAs to be investigated and completed in a timely manner and requires verification of effectiveness of the actions to be conducted to ensure safety and functionality of the device. You failed to verify or validate corrective actions to ensure that each action is effective and does not adversely affect the finished device and you did not identify actions needed to correct the deficiency. Specifically: Continuous Improvement Request (CIR) CIR#D08-012 (opened 12/23/2008) and CIR#G08-009 (opened 12/23/2008) were opened to address data taken from process audit results from 2006-2009 that showed that process validation procedures and policies were not followed (this appears to affect all product lines). The root cause was identified as insufficient training and lack of attention to detail. As a corrective action, training of personnel was completed (3/21/2009). There is no documentation in the record to verify or validate that training as a corrective action was effective and would prevent recurrence of your employees not following process validation procedures and policies (Master validation procedure SOP 109-12); the CAPAs were closed on 04/27/09.CIR#E-08-008 (opened 09/15/2008) was opened to address (b)(4) periodically seen in device verification testing and during the qualification tests on Paradigm Insulin Infusion Pumps which could cause (b)(4). The CAPA was closed on 7/10/09 recommending implementation of a (b)(4) test to be performed on (b)(4) on a (b)(4) basis as a periodic check to provide assurance that process stability and capability are maintained. No verification or validation documents were found in the CAPA file to document that the effectiveness of this corrective action (conducting (b)(4) tests on (b)(4)) identified in CAPA CIR#E-08-008 was assessed and that this corrective action identified was implemented. Mr. Henry Sanders, the firm’s Director of Pump Value Stream, stated that (b)(4) test was performed as required.Quality Improvement Request (QIR) QIR#08-002 (opened 04/15/2008) was opened to address failure analysis of Paradigm Insulin Infusion Pumps MMT-5xx and 7xx series which indicated that (b)(4) of returned insulin pumps for unresponsive keypads did not pass the (b)(4) test. A PMA supplement was submitted to FDA on August 18, 2010, for 5xx insulin pump devices. However, you have failed to identify and implement the action needed to correct and prevent recurrence of leakage problems to the 7xx insulin pumps which was identified in QIR#08-002. QIR#08-002 was closed on 05/17/2011.CIR#E07-006 was opened on 12/11/2007 to address problems related  to transferring design changes from the Northridge (NR) site to the sister manufacturing facility Medtronic Puerto Rico Operations Company (MPROC) and implementation of those changes by MPROC (this appears to affect all product lines). The corrective action for this deficiency included updating the design change/transfer process and training site personnel (5/28-5/29/2008) on the updated/revised process. On 6/10/2008, this CAPA (CIR #E07-006) was closed. The CAPA was closed with no evidence that effectiveness checks were completed for the corrective action identified (updating design change process and training site personnel on these updated procedures) for this CAPA to ensure that this corrective action was effective and does not adversely affect the finished product. B. You failed to identify the actions needed to correct and prevent   recurrence of the Paradigm Insulin Infusion Pumps (MMT-5XX, 7XX) device failure (thus not meeting specification (b)(4)) in the CAPAs opened to address this issue.  Specifically, as demonstrated by the multiple CAPAs opened between 2002 and 2012 (e.g., QIR#02-008, QIR#07-006, QIR#O8-002, CIR#EOS-008, CIR#E10-003, QIR#10-004, and QIR#12-007) where fluid ingress is identified as a cause of device failure, the Paradigm Insulin Infusion Products are not meeting the required design requirements of the covered devices complying with IEC60529 IPX7 fluid ingress requirements. The identification of corrections to the nonconformity were not adequate as evidenced in the CAPA investigation (QIR#08-002) which identified the (b)(4) as the root cause of the ongoing fluid ingress problem since this (b)(4) causes initiation of (b)(4), thus causing adverse effects to the finished device. As a correction, you decided not to change the (b)(4), but instead to change the (b)(4). However, CAPA investigation (documented in QIR#10-004) has identified the potential for fluid ingress to occur (b)(4). Your correction to change the (b)(4). We reviewed your firm’s responses and conclude that they are not adequate because you have not yet provided evidence of implementation for all corrections and corrective actions. From 2009 through 2010, you made changes to your CAPA processes including implementation of effectiveness checks using CAPA software (i.e., (b)(4)), revised CAPA procedures, implemented reviews of CAPA Scorecards by senior management, and hired dedicated personnel for review of pump related CAPAs. You have stated that (b)(4) CAPAs that were opened since January 1, 2010, (the date of (b)(4) implementation) and closed before April 30, 2013, were reviewed. You provided a review of these CAPAs that were opened and closed to verify that the corrective actions were determined to be effective. The CAPAs identified in 1(a) (CIR D08-012 and CIR G08-009) have been reopened and reassigned to a new CAPA (CIR E13-0004) in order to perform additional training on process validation procedures for the (b)(4) process (used in the production of Paradigm Insulin Infusion Pumps) and to verify the effectiveness of the corrective action for this CAPA. The CAPA identified in 1(b) (CIR E08-008) was reopened to document the rationale for not performing the (b)(4) test and to include a more complete analysis of the impact of not using the (b)(4) test. You have completed the CAPA and conducted verification of the effectiveness of the corrective action for this CAPA. The CAPA identified in 1(c) (QIR 08-002) documented the separation of the Paradigm Insulin Infusion Pumps 5xx and 7xx series investigations due to design differences between the two models. The CAPA addressing the Paradigm Insulin Infusion Pumps 5xx series devices is closed and a PMA supplement was approved. A separate CAPA (E-10-003) was opened to address the Paradigm Insulin Infusion Pumps 7xx series devices. This will include a design change that will be submitted to the FDA in late 2013. You state that an ongoing dialogue with the FDA regarding this design change is currently taking place to ensure that leakage problems do not recur with the Paradigm Insulin Infusion Pumps 7XX series devices. The CAPA identified in 1(d) was reassigned to a new CAPA (CIR E13-003) to investigate the Engineering Change Order (ECO) process between Medtronic Diabetes and MPROC. You have revised your Quality Improvement System , SOP 114-06, ver. L 03/18/2013, to require that the Quality Improvement Team (QIT) help ensure that all CAPAs include an effectiveness verification plan, effectiveness acceptance criteria, and evidence of effectiveness verification prior to closure. You have provided this document for review. You have trained personnel on Quality Improvement System, SOP 114-06, ver. L 03/18/2013 and have provided the training records. You have revised your Continuous Improvement Team, SOP 114-05, ver. AA 03/19/2013 to require that the Continuous Improvement Team (CIT) help ensure that all CAPAs include an effectiveness verification plan, effectiveness acceptance criteria and evidence of effectiveness verification prior to closure. It has provided this document for review. You have trained personnel on Continuous Improvement Team, SOP 114-05, ver. AA 03/19/2013 and have provided the training records. You have also deployed an (b)(4) training, (b)(4) to all personnel involved in the CAPA processes. You have trained (b)(4) and have provided the training records. You have had (b)(4) conduct classes on the (b)(4) aspects of the CAPA process and a (b)(4) as well as a (b)(4). You have provided the employee training records for these courses. However, you have not completed the employee training on process validation procedures for the (b)(4) process (used in the production of Paradigm Insulin Infusion Pumps) in CIR E13-004 (combined from CIR D08-012 and CIR G08-009) as a corrective action identified for this deficiency and have not conducted an effectiveness check to ensure that retraining employees will ensure that they perform process validation activities as required. In addition, you have not provided evidence that an effectiveness check for CAPA CIR E13-003 (opened to address CIR E07-006) was completed to ensure that the ECO process between Medtronic Diabetes and MPROC was implemented as required and will ensure that design changes are transferred as required. You submitted a design change to the FDA in February 2013 to address concerns with keypad failures due to fluid ingress. You have proposed labeling changes to clarify the IPX7 language as well as marketing and training materials and other literature. This labeling has been submitted to the FDA on June 11, 2013, as part of the interactive labeling review for PMA P120010. You have issued an Urgent Medical Safety Notification to restate the warnings related to water immersion an to notify patients of potential device failures. Although you have identified your manufacturing (b)(4) as a root cause of the leakage problem, you have not provided evidence that actions identified and needed to correct and prevent recurrence of the nonconforming product have been implemented. You have not conducted an effectiveness check for CAPA, QIR#08-002, to ensure that the labeling changes are effective. In addition, you have not provided a description and evidence of implementation of a corrective action to include a retrospective review of all CAPAs to ensure corrections and corrective actions were identified and implemented as required.  2.    Failure to review and evaluate all complaints to determine whether an investigation is necessary and to maintain a record that includes the reason no investigation was made and the name of the individual responsible for the decision not to investigate when no investigation is made, as required by 21 CFR 820.198(b). For example, you do not investigate complaints with reported high or low blood glucose level for the Paradigm Real-Time Insulin Infusion Pumps (MMT523 and MMT722) to ensure that there have not been any adverse events or hospitalization as the result of the insulin infusion pump failure and to ensure that actions needed to correct the failure are implemented. You do not document the rationale for the decision not to investigate or the individual responsible for the decision. Specifically, the following complaints documented the decision to investigate as “unknown” and did not include the rationale for the decision or the individual who made the decision: a.   SN#(b)(4) (dated (b)(4)) documented the consumer reporting the (b)(4) resulted from use of Paradigm Real-Time Insulin Infusion Pump MMT523 LNAB, manufactured on (b)(4). Your failure analysis indicated that the (b)(4). The pump had to be returned by the customer and replaced. The complaint record indicates that the complaint is not MDR reportable and was closed on (b)(4) with no further follow-up.b.   SN#(b)(4) (dated (b)(4)) documented that the consumer indicated that (b)(4) the Paradigm Real-time Insulin Infusion Pump MMT722 NALL (date of manufacture unknown). The customer stated that the (b)(4). The firm’s failure analysis indicated an (b)(4). You advised the customer to discontinue the use of the pump, go on the backup plan, and return the pump; the firm replaced the pump. The complaint record indicated that the complaint is not MDR reportable and was closed on (b)(4) with no further follow-up by the firm.c.   SN#(b)(4) (dated (b)(4)) documented that the consumer indicated (b)(4) resulted from use of the Paradigm Real-Time Insulin Infusion Pump MMT722 PNAP, manufactured (b)(4). The customer called stating that when (b)(4). Your failure analysis indicated an (b)(4). You advised the customer to treat (b)(4) by using back up plan and that the pump would be replaced. The complaint record indicates that this complaint is not MDR reportable and was closed on (b)(4) with no further follow-up by you.d.   SN#(b)(4) (dated (b)(4)) documented that the customer reported a (b)(4) when using the Paradigm Real-Time Insulin Infusion Pump MMT722 (date of manufacture unknown). The failure analysis indicated (b)(4). You advised the customer to remain on the back up plan and that the pump would be replaced. The complaint record indicates that this complaint is not MDR reportable and was closed on (b)(4) with no further follow-up action. We reviewed your firm’s responses and conclude that they are not adequate. You provided a copy of the revised procedure, Complaint/NonComplaint Customer DOP 114-619, which includes the requirement to follow-up on emails to patients in the United States who complain of high or low blood glucose. You provided employee training records on this revised procedure. You are in the process of further improving Complaint/NonComplaint Customer DOP 114-619 by expanding the complaint handling process to include additional follow-up attempts when a patient in the United States reports high or low blood glucose. You provided a copy of the revised procedure, Complaints/NonComplaint Customer DOP 114-619, which includes the development of a separate system for patients who allege high or low blood glucose that do not provide an email address to contact them via an automated phone call system. You indicated that a retrospective review of (b)(4) of complaints with a report of high or low blood glucose will be conducted. You did not provide a description and evidence of implementation of a correction to this deficiency to include conducting investigations for the above listed complaints or documenting the rationale for not conducting an investigation along with the signature of the individual responsible for the decision. You did not provide the rationale for conducting a retrospective review of complaints received for (b)(4). In addition, you have not completed your revisions to Complaint/NonComplaint Customer DOP 114-619, to include the expansion of the complaint handling process to include additional follow-up attempts when a patient in the U.S. reports high or low blood glucose. 3.    Failure to establish and maintain procedures for the identification, documentation, validation or where appropriate verification, review, and approval of design changes before their implementation, as required by 21 CFR 820.30(i). For example, you did not follow the design control procedure (SOP104-01) for documentation, validation or verification, and review of design changes before their implementation. Specifically, you did not apply the design control procedure (SOP104-01) (section 6.5.8 Design Changes/Changes After Design Transfer – which requires that changes to released products are reviewed, verified and/or validated where appropriate, and approved prior to implementation) to post production changes for the following design changes to the (b)(4) of the Paradigm Insulin Infusion Pumps (MMT-5xx and 7xx): The implementation of the (b)(4); andThe implementation of the (b)(4). QIR 10-004/ER 10-6367 documents that these two changes were implemented to the (b)(4). Your management stated that there is no record of the design review associated with these changes identified above and that analysis on impact of these design changes to the finished Paradigm Insulin Infusion Pumps have not been conducted. We reviewed your firm’s responses and conclude that they are not adequate. You provided evidence that procedures are being revised to clarify that design changes are required to be reviewed by the Quality Improvement Team and that it is documented that a design review has been performed for design changes after transfer (Quality Improvement System SOP 114-06, Continuous Improvement Team SOP 114-05, CAPA System SOP 114-01). You have provided evidence of employee training on these revised procedures. You have revised procedures to clarify that design changes are required to be reviewed by the QIT and that it is documented that a design review has been performed for design changes after transfer (Design Control SOP 104-01, ver. AK 05/15/2012, Change Control and Product QA Review Board SOP 105-05, ver. L , 04/30/2013). You also indicated that a retrospective review of (b)(4) of design changes after transfer for all of the current product families from May 1, 2012 to May 1, 2013, is being performed to confirm that design reviews have been performed and adequately documented. You did not provide the rationale for conducting a retrospective review of (b)(4) of design changes after transfer for all of the product families and have not completed the appropriate training on the revised procedures, Design Control SOP 104-01, ver. AK 05/15/2012, and Change Control and Product QA Review Board SOP 105-05, ver. L, 04/30/2013. You did not provide a description and evidence of implementation of a correction to include completing the design reviews for the implementation of the (b)(4) and a design review for the implementation of the (b)(4) on the (b)(4) for (b)(4) of the Paradigm Insulin Infusion Pumps (5xx and 7xx). In addition, you did not provide a description and evidence of implementation of a corrective action to include a retrospective review of all design changes to the Paradigm Insulin Infusion Pumps to ensure that all design changes were completed as required and not just design reviews for design changes. 4.    Failure to establish and maintain procedures to ensure that all purchased or otherwise received product and services conform to specified requirements, as required by 21 CFR 820.50. For example, you issued ECO 5-36178 to manufacturing facility MPROC with a specified release date of 5/04/2011, to change the cleaning process of the (b)(4) for the Paradigm Insulin Infusion Pumps (MMT-5XX and 7XX). ECO 5-36178 specifies a change from Rev. A to Rev. B for the (b)(4). The Paradigm Insulin Infusion Pumps (MMT-5XX and 7XX) are manufactured at the firm’s facility and MPROC. This change was not implemented by MPROC until 2013. The lot history report summary of (b)(4) indicates that MPROC continued to manufacture to Rev. A (until at least (b)(4)) after the required design change to Rev. B per ECO 5-36178. The Northridge facility continued to receive (b)(4) with the incorrect revision date for (b)(4) work orders after implementation date of (b)(4) for this design change to the (b)(4) with Rev. B of the Paradigm Insulin Infusion Pumps. Ms. Donna Twisdom, your Sr. Engineering Manager, confirmed that Northridge received (b)(4) subassembly Rev. A that should have been Rev. B. We reviewed your firm’s responses and conclude that they are not adequate.  You have updated procedures to require that there be defined timelines when changes must be implemented, specify how suppliers are notified of changes, and define mechanisms for monitoring change implementation (ECR/ECO Process SOP 105-07, Process, ECR, Turnkey Objects DOP 105-936, CCR Supplier Change Notification & Customer Change Request Procedure SOP 106-05). You have provided employee training records for these revised procedures. Work instruction DOC.0022 was updated to specify that all ECOs are recorded in a newly created logbook and tracked (b)(4) as well as having a project manager assigned for their implementation. You provided employee training records on this revised work instruction. MPROC, through its procedural revisions, will now more actively manage Engineering Change Order (ECO) implementation. You indicated that a retrospective review was conducted on all closed ECOs (issued between May 1, 2011 and May 14, 2013) and closed Customer Change Requests (CCRs) (issued between January 1, 2010 and April 30, 2013) to evaluate whether a delay in implementing a now closed ECO/CCR had an impact on product quality. A small subset of changes was identified as having a potential impact on quality. This subset was further evaluated and the associated risk assessed. Through further analysis, it was determined that any delay in implementation of the respective change did not adversely impact product quality. Employee training on the revised procedures has been completed. You have reopened CIR E07-006 by reassigning the CAPA to a new CAPA in order to investigate the ECO process between Medtronic Diabetes and MPROC. However, you have not provided evidence of implementation of a correction to this deficiency to include documenting that MPROC has implemented the changes and that the products and services received from MPROC include the changes as required to ensure that these products and services meet specified requirements. You did not provide a description and evidence of implementation of a corrective action and evidence of consideration of a systemic corrective action including a retrospective review of all changes made to products and services from MPROC and all other suppliers to ensure they were implemented as required. You did not provide a rationale for why the timeframes for the retrospective reviews of ECOs and CCRs were chosen. 5.    Failure to establish and maintain procedures for acceptance of incoming product, as required by 21 CFR 820.80(b). For example, you did not implement the Receiving Inspection Systems procedure DIM 1500 (ver. AB valid date 8/11/2011, ver. AC valid date 10/15/2011 and ver. AE valid date 6/27/2012) which require that prints and product specifications must match the revision on the Goods Receipt or Traveler. The Receiving Inspection Systems Procedure (DIM 1500) requires that the revision and all documentation associated with the same lot must match that of the Goods Receipt, that prints and product specifications must match the revision on the Goods Receipt or Traveler, and that Certificates of Conformance (CofC) of the material must include the dash numbers and revision number. Specifically: a.   Your management reported that Goods Receipt Slip dated (b)(4) ((b)(4)) represents the initial shipment of Paradigm Insulin Infusion Pumps (MMT-7xx & 5xx) (b)(4) Rev. B from component supplier MPROC. The Goods Receipt Slip states that the revision is Rev. A. However, this lot was manufactured after the ECO 36178 with valid date of (b)(4) that indicates that these parts should have been manufactured to Rev. B. b.   Paradigm Insulin Infusion Pumps (MMT-7xx & 5xx) (b)(4) drawings print specification (b)(4) Ver. E and (b)(4) Ver. E show (b)(4) Part Number Rev. B (ECO 5-36178) implemented 5/04/2011. However, The below (i-vi) incoming Goods Receipt Slips show (b)(4) Part Number Rev. A and do not match the print specifications as required by the Receiving Inspection Systems procedure DIM 1500:1.    (b)(4)2.     (b)(4)3.    (b)(4)4.    (b)(4)5.    (b)(4); and6.    (b)(4) Three of the above Goods Receipt Slips ((b)(4), (b)(4), and (b)(4)) have a different Part Revision Number than the Certification of Compliance (CofC) provided by the component supplier MPROC.  The revision number of the Goods Receipt Slips show Rev. A, but the attached corresponding CofC shows Rev. B. Your facility continued to receive (b)(4) with the incorrect revision date for (b)(4) work orders after implementation date of (b)(4) for this design change to the (b)(4) with Rev. B of the Paradigm Insulin Infusion pumps. Ms. Donna Twisdom, your Sr. Engineering Manager, confirmed that Northridge received (b)(4) subassembly Rev. A that should have been Rev. B. We reviewed your firm’s responses and conclude that they are not adequate. You have revised (and provided a copy) of the Prints/Product Specifications section of Receiving Inspection Systems Procedure DIM 500 to indicate that an NCMR shall be generated if the current revision for the part indicated in the (b)(4) database does not match the revision of the part received. You provided employee training records for this revised procedure. You performed a review of all shipments received during the (b)(4) period between (b)(4) and (b)(4) to confirm that no earlier revision parts were inappropriately accepted and used. You indicated that the review was completed and it was determined that the received parts were appropriately accepted. You provided a copy of the results of this review. You state that the Receiving Inspection System Procedure DIM1500 (ver. AB and ver. AE) that were in place at the time the cited example shipments were received specified that the correct revision of a received part is the current revision in the Medtronic Diabetes document system. However, you have not given a justification for choosing a (b)(4) retrospective review of all received shipments as opposed to a greater timeframe to confirm that no earlier revision parts were inappropriately accepted. In addition, you did not provide a description or evidence that a systemic corrective action was considered to include a retrospective review of receiving activities for other products to ensure they were received as required. 6. Failure to ensure that when results of a process cannot be fully verified by subsequent inspection and test, the process shall be validated with a high degree of assurance and approved according to established procedures, as required by 21 CFR 820.75(a). For example: a.   You did not validate the (b)(4) process used in the manufacture of the MMT-5xx and 7xx Paradigm Insulin Infusion pumps. The (b)(4) was not monitored and controlled during the (b)(4) process validation to ensure (b)(4) as required by your procedure. It was noted in characterization report ER09-5626 that (b)(4) has been misdiagnosed in the past and will result in (b)(4) later during environmental testing. This characterization report (ER09-5626) states that the (b)(4) at the (b)(4) must be measured using a (b)(4) to derive a (b)(4) and programmed into the (b)(4). The (b)(4) was not measured during OQ phase of the following validations of the new (b)(4) as required by the firm’s procedure, Process Characterization ER09-5626: ETR09-3128 Ver. A- Qual, (b)(4), 5xx valid date (b)(4)ETR09-2966 Ver. A- Qual, (b)(4), 7xx valid date (b)(4) The validation records do not provide any data that documents the (b)(4) during the validation activities as required by procedure, ER09-5626. b.   You failed to validate the (b)(4) process used to rework, repair, add components, and upgrade (b)(4) in the (b)(4) Process. Ms. Donna Twisdom, your Sr. Engineering Manager, stated that the firm did not need to validate the process, but agreed that it was a critical process. In addition, there is no documentation of monitoring and control methods and data, the date performed, the individual performing the process, and the major equipment used for validation of the (b)(4) process. The (b)(4) Process is the primary manufacturing process that supplies the (b)(4) that are a subassembly of the Paradigm Insulin Infusion Pump MMT-5xx and 7xx series and the Guardian glucose monitoring system. We reviewed your firm’s responses and conclude that they are not adequate. You have updated (and provided a copy) the Process Validation Procedure SOP109-12 Ver R, April 30, 2013, to require implementation of process monitoring, strengthen and clarify appropriate linkages to the assembly procedures, strengthen and implement the requirements for validations for rework assembly and processes, and clarify the requirements for documentation and maintenance of set-up procedures and parameters. You have provided training records to demonstrate that employees were trained on this revised procedure. You have revised (and provided a copy) the (b)(4) procedure, Preventive Maintenance, PM ID 1005: (b)(4)to require (b)(4) set up confirmation in accordance with the monitoring requirement of Process Validation Procedure SOP 109-12 and (b)(4), 5xx, 7xx ER09-5626. You have provided employee training records on this revised procedure. You have conducted an engineering study to confirm that the (b)(4) using the existing process could withstand environmental screening, such as (b)(4). You have validated the (b)(4) rework process and submitted an Operational Qualification Report (OQ), ETR 13-5543 and a Process Validation Report PVR 13-1119. You have modified Operation 30 – (b)(4) Rework/Upgrade AP0001043-030 to require that operators verify and document (b)(4) equipment settings prior to initiating (b)(4) activities. You have provided employee training records on this revised procedure. You have created a new (b)(4) Station Verification DOP 109-950 which provides the instruction on the methodology for performing the measurements. You have provided the training records for this. You have created (b)(4) Rework/Upgrade Inspection AP 0001043-035 to make the rework line consistent with the new (b)(4) assembly line in that the operators performing the (b)(4) process are independent from the operators performing the inspection. You have provided employee training records on this new document. You did not provide a description and evidence of implementation of a correction to include completing the validation of the (b)(4) process and demonstrating that the (b)(4) was monitored and controlled during the (b)(4) process validation to ensure (b)(4). In addition, you did not provide a description and evidence of implementation of all corrective actions and consideration of a systemic corrective action to include a retrospective review of all manufacturing processes to ensure they were validated as required. 7.  Failure to establish and maintain procedures for monitoring and control of process parameters for validated processes to ensure that the specified requirements continue to be met, as required by 21 CFR 820.75(b). For example, you did not follow SOP 109-12 (process validation procedure, version G-M, dated 1/19/07 to 7/7/12) which requires you to define the requirement for monitoring and control of the process input and process output based on the qualification study results, to define how the process will be controlled to assure reliable operation, and to monitor the implemented process to ensure confidence and reliability requirements are maintained in production. Specifically, Your (b)(4) process used in the (b)(4) does not define the monitoring procedure for the essential process parameters (i.e., (b)(4)) as part of process control to ensure reliability. In addition, the firm indicated that it has not been monitoring the process parameters for the (b)(4) used in the manufacture of the Paradigm Insulin Infusion Pumps since 2002. In addition, complete monitoring records for the (b)(4) and (b)(4), used in the (b)(4), a validated process, were not maintained (i.e., (b)(4)). Only (b)(4) intensity records were observed to be maintained. Your management indicated that there is no monitoring data for the (b)(4) parameters. We reviewed your firm’s responses and conclude that they are not adequate because you have not yet provided evidence of implementation for all corrections and corrective actions. You use Assembly Procedures (APs) for your manufacturing and assembly. You have revised (and provide a copy) AP 7005274-030 for the (b)(4) to require monitoring and recording of the following (b)(4). You have provided employee training records on this revised procedure. You have revised (and provided a copy) AP 7005274-046 for the (b)(4) to require the monitoring and recording of the (b)(4). You provided employee training records on this revised procedure. You have revised (and provided a copy) AP 7005274-2080 for the (b)(4). You have provided employee training records on this revised procedure. You have revised (and provided a copy) Process Validation Procedure SOP 109-12 to clearly define the requirements for monitoring essential process parameters and include documentation requirements for recording monitoring activities and maintaining monitoring records. You have provided employee training records for this revised procedure. You have revised (and provided a copy) Process Control Procedure SOP 109-01 to clearly define the requirements for monitoring essential process parameters. You have provided employee training records for this revised procedure. You have opened CAPA CIR E 13-006 to conduct a gap assessment of all production process validations for all products manufactured at the Northridge facility to ensure updated requirements for process monitoring are being met. However, you did not provide a description and evidence of implementation of a correction to this deficiency to include documenting monitoring and control records for the (b)(4) used in the (b)(4) to demonstrate that monitoring is currently being completed as required. In addition, you did not provide evidence that monitoring is being completed as required for the (b)(4) and (b)(4), used in the (b)(4) as required.   You did not indicate when the gap assessments of all production process validations for all products manufactured at the Northridge facility would be completed. 8.  Failure to review and evaluate a process and perform revalidation where appropriate when changes or process deviations occur, as required by 21 CFR 820.75(c). For example, you changed the design of the Paradigm Insulin Infusion Pumps (MMT-5xx, 7xx) under the Pump Modernization project in 2008 to include a change of the (b)(4). However, you failed to complete revalidation of the (b)(4) process for the new (b)(4) as required. You used the (b)(4) test to verify the (b)(4) for the pumps, but the (b)(4) test was not included in the process validation plan, PVP08-885, ver. A and acceptance criteria were based on (b)(4) test results. Mr. Jeff Hauber, your Vice President of Operations/General Manager of Insulin Delivery, stated that he agreed and that the firm would revalidate the revised (b)(4) process. We reviewed your firm’s responses and conclude that they are not adequate. An engineering report was generated to confirm and document the scientific rationale for the initial decision not to re-validate the (b)(4) process. Engineering testing was conducted to evaluate the (b)(4) performance of all new (b)(4). The design FMEA for the (b)(4) and the Process FMEA for the (b)(4) have been reviewed and updated to clarify the potential impact that (b)(4) performance. A complete revalidation of the current (b)(4) process for all (b)(4) will be performed. Process Validation Procedure SOP 109-12 has been revised to ensure that the process qualification or validation strategy for proposed change is based on an analysis of the potential impact to product safety and effectiveness and that adequate justifications are documented for all determinations that no, or only partial, requalification or revalidation is necessary. You have provided employee training records on this revised procedure. Change Control & Product QA Review Board Procedure SOP 105-05 has been revised to ensure that the product or process qualification or validation for a proposed change is based on an analysis of the potential impact to product safety and effectiveness. Employee training records on this revised procedure have been provided. You, under CAPA CIR E13-007, will conduct a review of the validation documentation for all other manufacturing process changes at the Northridge manufacturing facility over the past (b)(4), identify any gaps with respect to validations, and conduct any additional revalidation activities as appropriate. You have not completed the revalidation of the current (b)(4) process for all (b)(4) and did not provide a timeline for the revalidation. You have also not completed a review of all other manufacturing process changes at the Northridge manufacturing facility over the past (b)(4). You did not provide a rationale for only reviewing process changes for the past (b)(4). 9.  Failure to ensure that all inspection, measuring, and test equipment, including mechanical, automated, or electronic inspection and test equipment, is suitable for its intended purposes and is capable of producing valid results, as required by 21 CFR 820.72(a).  For example: a.   You utilized a (b)(4) test to evaluate the uniformity of the (b)(4) without any procedure throughout (b)(4) process validation testing, process characterization, and engineering testing for the (b)(4) for the Paradigm Insulin Infusion pumps (MMT-5xx, 7xx). Your management indicated that there was no procedure for the (b)(4) test. For example: 1)    During the Process Characterization ER06-4618, ver. A1 ((b)(4), 5xx, dated 9-14-2006), (b)(4) test failures resulted in a new (b)(4). There is no procedure for the (b)(4) test and, in this characterization, the measurement provided attribute data for the (b)(4) quality for the (b)(4) Process utilized to manufacture the (b)(4) for Paradigm Insulin Infusion Pumps (5xx).2)    During the Process Characterization ER06-4627, ver. A1 ((b)(4) with Modified Settings, 7xx, dated 10/10/2006), (b)(4) test failures resulted in a new (b)(4). There is no procedure for the (b)(4) test that was used during this process characterization for the (b)(4) Process utilized to manufacture the (b)(4) for Paradigm Insulin Infusion pumps (7xx).3)    During the Process Validation of (b)(4) Pumps, PVR08-885, ver. A, ((b)(4)), (b)(4) test failure in the (b)(4) for 7xx pumps resulted in a new (b)(4). There is no procedure for the (b)(4) test that was used during this process validation for the Paradigm Insulin Infusion Pumps (7xx).4)    Process Characterization E09-5626, ver. A ((b)(4) for 5xx, 7xx, dated 6/18/2009) states use of (b)(4) test at the set up phase as a supplement to (b)(4) test to verify the (b)(4) to the (b)(4) for the Paradigm Insulin Infusion Pumps (5xx & 7xx). There is no procedure for the (b)(4) test that was used during this process characterization.5)    The closing memo to CAPA CIR E08-008 dated 6/19/2009 ((b)(4)) states to implement a (b)(4) test to be performed on each (b)(4) on a (b)(4) basis as a periodic check to provide assurance that process stability and capability are maintained. There is no procedure for the (b)(4) test. We reviewed your firm’s responses and conclude that they are not adequate because you have not yet provided evidence of implementation for all corrections and corrective actions. You are updating protocols to improve the Production and Process Controls system to include the implementation of requirements to more formally document test protocols and improvements to processes used to identify, qualify and employ test measurement equipment. You completed (and provided a copy) a comparative testing of the (b)(4) test to confirm the superiority of the (b)(4) test as compared to the (b)(4) test. CAPA E08-008 has been reopened to document the rationale for not performing the (b)(4) test. You indicated that a retrospective review of (b)(4) CAPAs that were opened since January 1, 2010 (the date of (b)(4) implementation) and closed before April 30, 2013 to determine if closure was adequate was conducted. A CAPA was initiated related to the process used to identify, qualify and employ test measurement equipment throughout process validation testing, process characterization and engineering testing methods. You have updated (and provided a copy) Continuous Improvement Team SOP 114-05 to require verification of the implementation of associated corrective and preventive actions prior to closure of a CAPA file. You have provided employee training records for this revised procedure. You have updated (and provided a copy) Quality Improvement System SOP 114-06 to require verification of the implementation of associated corrective and preventive actions prior to closure of a CAPA file. You have provided employee training records on this revised procedure. You have revised (and provided a copy) the Process Validation Procedure SOP 109-12 to require, among other things, that test protocols be formally documented and performed consistently during validation/qualification. You have provided employee training records on this revised procedure. You indicated that CAPA CIR E08-008 was reopened to document the rationale for not performing the (b)(4) test. A complete analysis of the impact of not using the (b)(4) test per the engineering analysis ER13-8288 was provided. The CAPA has been closed with the inclusion of the engineering assessment. You indicated that a CAPA (CIR E13-006) related to the process used to identify, qualify and employ test measurement equipment throughout the process validation testing, process characterization and engineering testing methods was initiated. An action plan for review of test methods against industry standards and best in class testing methodologies was created and a copy of this plan was provided. However, you did not provide a description and evidence of implementation of a corrective action and consideration of a systemic corrective action to this deficiency to include a retrospective review of all inspection measuring and test equipment to ensure procedures are established as required. B.   You failed to conduct an Equipment Qualification and (b)(4) for the test fixture with its associated (b)(4) used in the manufacture of the Paradigm Insulin Infusion Pump MMT-5xx. The Master Validation Plan/Report valid date 8/10/2012 & 8/30/2012 requires Equipment Qualification and (b)(4) for (b)(4). The qualification and the (b)(4) are to qualify the (b)(4) with its associated (b)(4) and verify the capability of the measurement system associated with the installed equipment as a production tool. The (b)(4) the (b)(4) and provides a means of confirming the (b)(4) of the final pump assembly for the Paradigm Insulin Infusion Pump MMT-5xx. Mr. Franklyn Adams, Sr. Principal Quality Engineer, acknowledged that you had not conducted a (b)(4) for the (b)(4) testing equipment system currently used for testing the Paradigm Insulin Infusion Pumps MMT-5xx series. The adequacy of your firm’s response cannot be determined at this time because you have not yet provided evidence of implementation for all corrections and corrective actions.  You completed an Equipment Qualification and (b)(4) for the use of this (b)(4) with this (b)(4). The engineering report was provided. You also provided the updated Process Validation Procedure SOP 109-12 that has been changed to ensure adequate documentation of qualification and validation strategy based on an analysis of the potential impact of a change to product safety and effectiveness. You have provided employee training records for this revised procedure. You provided an updated Process Control Procedure SOP 109-01 to include additional controls to ensure that manufacturing equipment meets specified requirements and to ensure adequate documentation of qualification and validation strategy based on an analysis of the potential impact of a change to product safety and effectiveness. You have provided employee training documents for this revised procedure. You have opened CAPA E13-006 to conduct a gap assessment of all manufacturing and test equipment qualification records for existing manufacturing operations at the Northridge facility to ensure that the records are complete, accurate, and consistent with the existing protocols. You have not completed the update of drawings for (b)(4) of test equipment that do not require calibration. You have indicated this will be completed by August 19, 2013. You are working on addressing validation gaps for special processes, including formal risk assessments. You have indicated this is expected to be completed by August 19, 2013. 10. Failure to ensure that all equipment used in the manufacturing process meets specified requirements and is appropriately designed, constructed, placed and installed to facilitate maintenance, adjustment, cleaning, and use as required by 21 CFR 820.70(g). For example, a review of the current Paradigm Insulin Infusion Pumps MMT-5xx and 7xx series manufacturing operations revealed that assembly instructions and methods that define and control the manner of production were not adequate. Specifically, the (b)(4) has not been approved/qualified to manufacture the Paradigm Insulin Infusion Pumps MMT-7xx series with the (b)(4). The Paradigm Insulin Infusion Pumps 7xx series with the (b)(4) is only approved to be run on the (b)(4). However, a.   The Paradigm Insulin Infusion Pumps MMT-5xx and 7xx work instruction, AP7005274-2080 Ver. K valid dated 9/06/2012, allows the production workers to use either the (b)(4) or (b)(4) to manufacture the MMT-7xx series Paradigm infusion pumps, including the MMT-7xx series with the (b)(4). b.   The software program for the (b)(4) is available to production and allows production workers to run the Paradigm Insulin Infusion Pumps MMT-7xx series, including the MMT-7xx series with the (b)(4) on this (b)(4) although this (b)(4) is not approved/qualified to be used to manufacture the MMT-7xx series pumps with the new (b)(4). We reviewed your firm’s responses and conclude that they are not adequate. You have access protected engineering folders for equipment (b)(4) and (b)(4) to limit the access of production workers to the manufacturing folder. A table was added to AP 7005274-2080 to specify the manufacturing process programs that can be used with each specific pump model numbers and for each piece of equipment. You have provided employee training records on this revised procedure. You have completed the validation of the 7xx new manufacturing process program on the (b)(4) equipment. You have performed an engineering test to determine the potential impact of running the 7xx new program on a 7xx pump with an (b)(4) using the equipment for which it was not yet qualified. Based on the results of this testing it was determined that the (b)(4) would meet the established specification. The Identify Equipment for Non-Production Use procedure SOP 109-51 has been established which includes requirements across Northridge manufacturing operations to both physically tag and lock out equipment undergoing qualification and isolate engineering programs from manufacturing files/folders and limit access to only the appropriate personnel by further password protection. You have provided employee training records for this procedure. You indicated that a check of all manufacturing equipment on the production floor in Northridge to ensure that the equipment is fully qualified for its current use or has been appropriately tagged and locked out was conducted. You opened a CAPA CIR E13-007 to conduct a retrospective analysis of all equipment and/or program changes to the manufacturing process, over the past (b)(4), where a (b)(4) of equipment and/or software or program was added to the manufacturing line to ensure that all equipment was qualified as required. You have updated Traceability/Ident Prod SOP 108-01 to standardize the content of Assembly Procedures and travelers for all manufacturing processes at the Northridge facility. The employee training on this revised procedure is not completed. However, you did not provide a rationale for conducting the retrospective review of all equipment and/or program changes to the manufacturing process, of only the past (b)(4) to ensure equipment is qualified as required. You did not provide documentation that employee training has been completed on the revised procedure, Traceability/Ident Prod SOP 108-01. 11. Failure to document acceptance activities required by 21 CFR 820.80, as required by 21 CFR 820.80(e). For example, your management stated that records of all failing in-process test results for the Paradigm Insulin Infusion Pumps MMT-5xx and 7xx series and the Guardian glucose monitoring system are not maintained. In addition, the following Paradigm Insulin Infusion Pumps and Guardian assembly procedures (work instructions) do not require that all failed in-process test results be recorded in the device history file, to be recorded as a nonconformance, or to be recorded in any other document:            Operation 40- (b)(4), AP7005274-040 Vers. D-H valid dates 4/27/2005-12/12/2012 for the Paradigm Insulin Infusion Pumps and the Guardian Glucose Monitoring System;Operation 2055- (b)(4), AP7005274 2055 Ver. B valid date 1/14/2010 for the Paradigm Insulin Infusion Pumps;Operation 2060- (b)(4), AP7005274-2060 Vers. C-H valid dates 5/09/2008- 12/20/2012 for the Paradigm Insulin Infusion Pumps and the Guardian Glucose Monitoring System;Operation 2070- (b)(4), AP7005274-2070 Ver. F valid date 7/19/2011 for the Paradigm Insulin Infusion Pump and the Guardian Glucose Monitoring System;Operation 2100- (b)(4) AP7005274-2100 Vers. A-F valid dates 5/14/2007-12/20/2012 for the Paradigm Insulin Infusion Pumps and the Guardian Glucose Monitoring System;Operation 2170- (b)(4) AP7005274-2170 Vers. D-F valid dates 9/16/2010-4/30/2011 for the Paradigm Insulin Infusion Pumps; andOperation 2200- (b)(4) AP7005274-2200 Vers. G-K valid dates 1/14/10-1/06/2011 for the Paradigm Insulin Infusion Pumps and the Guardian Glucose Monitoring System. We reviewed your firm’s responses and conclude that they are not adequate. You have revised (and provided a copy) AP7005274-040 Operation 40 – (b)(4)to remove retesting options. You have provided employee training records for this revised procedure. You have revised (and provided a copy) AP7005274-2055 Operation 2055 – (b)(4)to remove retesting options. You have provided employee training records on this revised procedure. You have revised (and provided a copy) AP7005274-2060 Operation 2060 – (b)(4), AP7005274-2060 to remove retesting options. You have provided employee training records for this revised procedure. You have revised (and provided a copy) AP7005274-2070 Operation 2070 – (b)(4)to remove retesting options. You have provided employee training records of this revised procedure. You have revised (and provided a copy) AP7005274-2100 Operation 2100 – (b)(4)to remove retesting options. You have provided employee training records for this revised procedure. You have revised (and provided a copy) AP7005274-2170 Operation 2170 – (b)(4) AP7005274-2170 to remove rework options. You have provided employee training records for this revised procedure. You have revised (and provided a copy) AP7005274-2200 to remove retesting options. You have provided employee training records for this revised procedure. A software fix is being developed and validated for the (b)(4), which is the electronic Device History Record (DHR) system to allow for the recording of all data, which currently it is not able to do. However, you did not provide a description or evidence of implementation of a correction and corrective action to include a retrospective review of all acceptance activities for the Paradigm Insulin Infusion Pumps and the Guardian Glucose Monitoring System to ensure they were documented as required. In addition, you did not provide a description or evidence that you considered a systemic corrective action to include a retrospective review of other devices to ensure acceptance activities were documented as required. 12. Failure to establish and maintain procedures for identifying valid statistical techniques required for establishing, controlling, and verifying the acceptability of process capability and product characteristics, as required under 21 CFR 820.250(a). The trending of the data utilized by your QIT to review and monitor the effectiveness of the corrective and preventive actions is inadequate since the variable factors that might affect the true outcome of the trend were not considered and thus product characteristics were not established, controlled, and verified. Specifically, a.   According to Engineering Report (ERl0-6257, version A, dated 1/6/11/ QIR#l0-004), you calculate the (b)(4) device return rate based on the (b)(4) of field installation. However, the report does not track the (b)(4) feedback for a design/process change in the early stage of field implementation and it does not track the (b)(4) performance on an (b)(4) since the calculation method is based on the (b)(4) and not the (b)(4). The report states that calculating a return rate based on each (b)(4) of the (b)(4) is more accurate. b.   In addition, your DOP 114-858 (Failure Analysis, Paradigm, revision AA dated 7/21/12) states that the failure analysis department trends the (b)(4), along with the (b)(4). You stated that every (b)(4) during the (b)(4) the complaint and failure rate of the insulin infusion pumps (b)(4) due to (b)(4). However, in the data generated for QIT review ((b)(4)), the failure analysis trending did not factor in the (b)(4) and the (b)(4) in (b)(4) that the infusion pumps are (b)(4). You were unable to provide trending data that considers the (b)(4). We reviewed your firm’s responses and conclude that they are not adequate. You have revised procedures (Quality Improvement System SOP 114-06, Continuous Improvement Team SOP 114-05) and are now requiring trending by (b)(4), as well as utilizing a validated software program for monitoring corrective and preventive actions for all products manufactured by Medtronic Diabetes. You have provided training records on these revised procedures. You will also conduct a retrospective review of Paradigm Insulin Pump complaints, as well as all of the other product lines, received between May 1, 2012 and May 1, 2013 utilizing the new software program to ensure that (b)(4). You stated that CAPA System procedure SOP 114-01 was revised to define requirements for use of the QIT Control Chart Program. You have provided training records on this revised procedure. In addition, you stated that a CAPA has been opened to investigate the fact that there is an increase in product failures during the (b)(4). A comprehensive review of the use of statistical techniques in all functional areas to ensure that the use of statistical techniques is appropriate will be performed. You have revised Statistical Techniques procedure SOP 120-01 to subtract and add appropriate statistical programs and to ensure the use of statistical techniques is robust in all functional areas. You have provided training records on this revised procedure. However, you have not provided evidence that an investigation of all causes of failure for all of the product lines has been completed and the information appropriately trended as a correction to this deficiency. You have not provided a rationale for conducting a retrospective review of Paradigm Insulin pump for only those complaints received between May 1, 2012 and May 1, 2013. 13. Failure to make readily available for review and copying by FDA employees all records required by 21 CFR 820, including those not stored at the inspected establishment, as required by 21 CFR 820.180. For example, the firm either did not provide records requested by FDA or incorrect documents were provided during the inspection. Some of the documents include the following: a.   Records for the process validation of (b)(4) (these were not readily available);b.   Records for monitoring and the equipment calibration documents of the (b)(4) (these were provided after (b)(4));c.   Records for Design Controls for the (b)(4) design change for the Paradigm Insulin Infusion Pumps (these were provided after (b)(4) and the incorrect documents were provided); andd.   Records of CAPAs related to the (b)(4) issues during (b)(4) of inspection (these were provided the (b)(4) of the onsite inspection and the list was not complete).    We reviewed your firm’s responses and conclude that they are not adequate because you have not yet provided evidence of implementation for all corrections and corrective actions. You have updated and provided Doc Types, Formats & Numbering, Approval SOP 105-03 to better define document naming conventions. You have provided employee training records for this revised procedure. You have updated and provided the Regulatory Inspection Procedure SOP 101-02 to require training on for all potential audit/inspection participants in advance of a scheduled event. You have provided employee training records for this revised procedure. You have updated and provided Process Validation Procedure SOP 109-12 to clarify that the Master Validation Plan must be revised when process validation elements change. You have provided employee training records on this revised procedure. You state that some of the documentation that was requested was old and took some time to retrieve from archived record systems and locations. You also state that in the process of collecting and reviewing these materials, you collected additional, unrequested documentation. You did not provide a description or evidence of implementation of the corrective action to address this observation. Our inspection also revealed that your firm’s Paradigm Insulin Infusion Pumps are misbranded under section 502(t)(2) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352(t)(2), in that your firm failed or refused to furnish material or information respecting the device that is required by or under section 519 of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360i, and 21 CFR Part 803 - Medical Device Reporting.  Significant violations include, but are not limited to, the following: 1.    Failure to report to the agency no later than 30 calendar days after your firm received or otherwise became aware of information, from any source that reasonably suggests that a device that your firm markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, as required by 21 CFR 803(a)(1). For example, complaint SN (b)(4) includes information that reasonably suggests that a malfunction of your device resulted in over delivery of insulin that may have caused or contributed to a life threatening injury (i.e., diabetic coma) to the patient. You became aware of the event on November 5, 2010, and FDA received a serious injury MDR3004209178-2011-81394 on May 9, 2011, which is beyond the 30 day calendar timeframe.  2.    Failure to report to the agency no later than 30 calendar days after the day that your firm received or otherwise became aware of information, from any source, that reasonably suggests that a device that your firm markets has malfunctioned and your device or a similar device that your firm markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur, as required by 21CFR 803.50(a)(2). For example, the information in complaint SN (b)(4) states that “a pump gave boluses without input and no alarms.” No patient information was available. You were aware of information from a previous complaint (SN (b)(4)) in which a malfunction of the device resulted in over delivery of insulin that led to a patient injury. Therefore, this event meets the definition of a malfunction that would be likely to cause or contribute to a reportable serious injury, if the malfunction of a same or similar device were to recur. You became aware of the event on January 15, 2011, and the FDA received the malfunction MDR2032227-2011-00652 on March 15, 2011, which is beyond the 30 calendar day timeframe. We reviewed your firm’s responses and conclude that they are not adequate.  Your firm has provided a copy of the revised MDR procedure, “Medical Device Report (MDR) DOP114-323 (Ver. AP, May 16, 2013), however, DOP 114-323 (Ver. AP, May 16, 2013), does not meet the requirements of 21 CFR 803.17. After reviewing DOP114-323 (Ver. AP, May 16, 2013) the following issues were noted: A.   DOP114-323 (Ver. AP, May 16, 2013) does not establish internal systems that provide for timely and effective identification, communication, and evaluation of events that may be subject to MDR requirements. For example: Your firm’s procedure includes definitions from 21 CFR 803.3, but omits the definition of “reasonably known” from 21 CFR 803.50(b). The exclusion of this term from the procedure may lead your firm to make an incorrect reportability decision when evaluating a complaint that may meet the criteria for reporting under 21 CFR 803.50(a).Appendix 1 Non Reportable Complaints, lists scenarios that “provide specific guidelines regarding the types of complaints which will not require an MDR or an ASR.” However, the list includes scenarios that represent complaint situations that could under certain circumstances, require an MDR. Complaints should be individually evaluated for reportability based on the facts for each scenario. Therefore, Appendix 1 should be removed from your firm’s procedure or revised to clarify that the list of scenarios is not all-inclusive. B.   DOP114-323 (Ver. AP, May 16, 2013) does not establish internal systems that provide for a standardized review process to determine when an event meets the criteria for reporting under this part. For example: There are no instructions for conducting a complete investigation of each event and evaluating the cause of the event.The procedure does not specify who makes the decision for reporting events to FDA. c.   DOP114-323 (Ver. AP, May 16, 2013) does not establish internal systems that provide for timely transmission of complete medical device reports. Specifically, the following are not addressed: Instructions for how to complete the FDA 3500A form.     Your firm should take prompt action to correct the violations addressed in this letter.  Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in regulatory action being initiated by the FDA without further notice.  These actions include, but are not limited to, seizure, injunction, and civil money penalties.  Also, federal agencies may be advised of the issuance of Warning Letters about devices so that they may take this information into account when considering the award of contracts. Additionally, premarket approval applications for Class III devices to which the Quality System regulation violations are reasonably related will not be approved until the violations have been corrected.   Please notify this office in writing within fifteen business days from the date you receive this letter of the specific steps your firm has taken to correct the noted violations, as well as an explanation of how your firm plans to prevent these violations, or similar violations, from occurring again.  Include documentation of the corrections and/or corrective actions (including any systemic corrective actions) that your firm has taken.  If your firm’s planned corrections and/or corrective actions will occur over time, please include a timetable for implementation of those activities.  If corrections and/or corrective actions cannot be completed within fifteen business days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which these activities will be completed. Your firm’s response should be comprehensive and address all violations included in this Warning Letter. Your firm’s response should be sent to: Food and Drug Administration, Center for Devices and Radiological Health, Office of Compliance, Field Operations Branch, White Oak Building 66, Rm 2609, 10903 New Hampshire Ave., Silver Spring, MD 20993. Refer to CMS case #405884. If you have any questions about the contents of this letter, please contact: James L. Woods at 301-796-6225. Finally, you should know that this letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of the violations at your firm’s facility.  It is your firm’s responsibility to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations administered by FDA.  The specific violations noted in this letter and in the Inspectional Observations, FDA 483, issued at the close of the inspection may be symptomatic of serious problems in your firm’s manufacturing and quality management systems.  Your firm should investigate and determine the causes of the violations, and take prompt actions to correct the violations and bring the products into compliance.   Sincerely yours,/S/                                                           Alberto GutierrezDirectorOffice of In Vitro DiagnosticsAnd Radiological HealthCenter for Devices andRadiological Health
