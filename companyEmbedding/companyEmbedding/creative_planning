Leawood-based Creative Planning Inc. has been on an epic run, receiving steady accolades as one of the nation's best fee-only wealth advisory firms, but its most recent win is surrounded by a bit of industry controversy.
Creative Planning has been named as the No. 1 fee-only wealth management firm in the United States by Barron's magazine for the past two years. Recently, it earned the same honors from CNBC, also for the second year in a row.

All that national recognition, along with a solid business plan and an experienced team of advisers who establish strong relationships with clients and deliver solid results, put Creative Planning on an incredibly strong growth path. Founded in 2004 with about $30 million in assets under management, the firm has grown to about $14.5 billion.




"I think the shift in the marketplace is toward conflict-free advice, and that has really benefited firms like ours," founder Peter Mallouk said. "At the end of the day, we're excited that clients like what we do and continue to come to Creative Planning and refer others to our firm. It's being noticed on a national scale."




 


But CNBC's recent list of the nation's top wealth advisers is coming under fire by Michael Kitces, a well-known commentator and editor of the Journal of Financial Planning. Kitces published a blog questioning whether nine of the 10 firms recognized by CNBC truly have a "fee-only" structure, including Creative Planning. Kitces argued that those nine firms don't qualify under the Certified Financial Planning Board's strict definition of "fee-only" because they share in insurance commissions or are referring clients to insurance affiliates they own.
"Some of Creative Planning's personnel that are insurance agents may receive commissions for the sale of insurance products," Kitces wrote. "The receipt of insurance commissions is in addition to any advisory fees charged by Creative Planning."
Mallouk doesn't deny that statement is true. However, he said that 99 percent of the insurance business at Creative Planning is group life or term life insurance, mainly done separately for clients who own businesses and asked for help. None of that business involves the variable life insurance or variable annuities that certainly could be viewed as a conflict of interest.

"We do not have a broker-dealer affiliation, which means no one here is licensed to sell a commissionable investment or product like a variable life insurance policy or a variable annuity," Mallouk said. "That makes us a pure (registered investment adviser). We don't have a brokerage side to the business. So I think when people look at an investment manger and ask are there other ways they can get paid on the investments, the answer with Creative Planning is no."

James reports about banking, financial services and law.
