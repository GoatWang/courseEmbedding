Point 360 - Digital Restoration

















Point.360 has the largest toolkit for restoration of newly captured and archival material which results in the most effective and efficient solution to restore your picture and audio content.
Film: 
Grain/Noise Reduction: A.R.T. - Advanced Restoration Tools 
New proprietary service designed to remove undesired grain, video and camera noise from new and legacy content. It is resolution independent. Image can be restored to exemplary level for today's viewing displays. It is ideal for new content that has been captured digitally and older content for Blu-ray release. A.R.T. is a collaborative process that ensures the clients' look of preference is achieved without artifacts.
Digital Pixel Repair
A proprietary system that fixes dead pixels or other continuous artifacts from digital cameras.
Film Aberrations
4K/2K pin registered scanning by only Imagica XE Advanced Plus wetgate scanner in the country is located at Point.360. Scratches and other surface imperfections are eliminated or significantly reduced during the wetgate scan process and there is no generation loss. With this scan, digital cleanup time is drastically reduced.
Visual Improvement Processing (VIP)
The latest version of a remarkable digital process which dramatically improves video masters by removing or reducing film dirt and scratches, and reducing video noise and drop-outs. When used scene-by-scene, VIP provides low cost restoration of marginal material. May be used at the time of film-to-tape transfer, standards conversion, cloning/submastering or duplication.
Digital Restoration Services
A powerful set of tools, specifically developed to go beyond the capability of VIP Processing to remove or reduce major picture defects without introducing artifacts. This process is much faster and less expensive than hand painting for film originated defects (large dirt, vertical scratches, stains, tears, and visible splices). It can also reduce flicker and color "breathing," provide 3:2 Cadence Correction and reduce video defects such as creases, hits, and TBC linefills.
Audio

L.A.-based postproduction house Point.360 has agreed to acquire Modern VideoFilm, the troubled post house whose day-to-day operations were taken over by the giant Deloitte Corporate Restructuring Group in October.

“Modern VideoFilm has entered into a preliminary agreement to become part of Point.360,” the companies said in a statement Friday. “Once the transaction is complete, the combined company will form one of the industry’s largest independent providers of postproduction services, with an established client base comprising major studios, broadcast networks, cable outlets, streaming media companies, independent producers and others.”
Calling the takeover a “strong marriage,” Modern VideoFilm CEO Scott Avila said, “The combined entity will offer our clients a broader range of solutions.”







Avila took control of Modern VideoFilm last fall after Moshe Barkat, the company’s founder, president and CEO, was ousted by its board of directors along with his No. 2, CFO Hugh Miller. Avila is a principal of Deloitte CRG, which specializes in reorganizing troubled companies and then selling them off.
With facilities in Los Angeles and Burbank, Point.360 provides a wide range of postproduction services, including closed captioning and subtitling, editing, encoding and transcoding, mastering, restoration, scanning, vaulting and worldwide physical and digital distribution.
“In conjunction with recent improvements in our operating performance, this transaction gives us an opportunity to further enhance our product offering and financial capabilities for future opportunities,” said Point.360 Chairman and CEO Haig Bagerdjian.
Modern VideoFilm has provided postproduction and distribution services to the film and TV industry for more than 33 years, working on many high-profile film and TV shows including Avatar, Modern Family, Game Of Thrones, The Walking Dead, Sons Of Anarchy, House Of Cards, Falling Skies, How I Met Your Mother, The Grand Budapest Hotel, There Will Be Blood and Best Picture Oscar winner Slumdog Millionaire.
The companies said that under the terms of a nonbinding letter of intent, Point.360 will issue convertible preferred stock in exchange for substantially all of the assets of Modern VideoFilm. Pursuant to the nonbinding term sheet, Point.360 and Modern VideoFilm must reach mutually acceptable, definitive agreements executed by both companies. “There can be no assurance, however, that the parties will enter into definitive agreements with respect to the proposed transaction,” they said in a joint statement.

They should close their location on Hollywood Way. The Modern VideoFilm location on Empire is still fairly new.












Going Going Gone • 						on  May 27, 2015 7:57 am


Amazing either company is still standing. As studios build internal post facilities as did Universal Studios and now Paramounts rumored on lot facility, independent post is nearly a thing of the past.
Universals cost center model makes for profit post company’s too expensive for often less product. Digital Intermediate movie creation once reeled home at studios will surely as well kill off what little is left. I would sell any shares of this, Deluxe ,Technicolor  or any post related stock.

’round and ’round we go, on lot post or off lot post.  It’s an expense (an expensive one at that) to keep on lot or to pay for off lot.
