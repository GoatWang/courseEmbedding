			Equity
			: Master Limited Partnership (MLP) Funds



			About Master Limited Partnership (MLP) Funds

			MLPs are publicly traded partnerships primarily operating businesses in the natural resources and energy
			industries. MLPs own real, hard assets critical to the U.S. economy. Energy MLPs are typically formed
			by larger energy companies to re-capitalize lower growth assets. They help to finance various portions
			of the crude oil and natural gas value chains. As shown below, they typically own transportation and
			storage assets in these chains, and also production assets within the natural gas value chain.
		





			MLPs are a US-only investment, because one of their primary features is advantageous U.S. federal tax
			treatment. Typically, about 80% of their distributions are tax-deferred, though this can change when
			MLPs are included in pooled investment vehicles like closed-end funds.

			The total return of MLP investments is typically based on their distributions and on demand for energy.
			Because they are highly concentrated in the energy sector, however, they can be more negatively affected
			by a downturn in the energy sector. In addition, their tax-advantaged distributions could be negatively
			affected by changes in the U.S. tax code regarding treatment of MLPs.

			For more information, see http://naptp.org/ the National Association
			of Publicly Traded Partnerships.
		



					About Nuveen MLP Closed-End Funds
				

					Nuveen currently offers one MLP closed-end fund.

The Nuveen MLP Total Return Fund (JMF)
					seeks to achieve its objective by investing primarily in a portfolio of master limited partnerships
					(“MLPs”) in the energy sector. The Fund believes that MLPs represent a timely investment opportunity
					since MLPs typically generate a high level of tax-deferred income and offer the potential for increased
					distributions and capital appreciation over time. To implement its strategy, the Fund’s portfolio management
					team combines its top-down strategic investment style with its rigorous, bottom-up investment process.
					The Fund seeks to identify MLPs that it believes have the most attractive current yields and total return
					potential. In seeking to mitigate certain key risks of MLP investing, the Fund may use various hedging
					techniques consistent with its top-down investment style with the goal of enhancing its risk-adjusted
					total return over the longer term.
				






								Investor Profile

								Are these CEFs right for you?
The features and investment objectives of these funds may be an appropriate investment for you if
								you are seeking the potential for:

Tax-advantaged quarterly distributions; 
Capital appreciation and distribution growth over time; 
Portfolio diversification and an investment that may serve as a hedge against inflation;
An efficient, single-investment opportunity providing access to a diverse portfolio of MLPs in the energy
									sector.


								What are potential risks?
							

Tax Risks. These Funds invest primarily in MLPs that pay no separate corporate level tax because they
									qualify as partnerships under current tax law. A change in law or in the business of such MLPs that
									caused them to be treated as taxable corporations could negatively affect fund performance and/or distributions.
								
Energy Sector Risks. The Funds invest predominantely in MLPs in the energy sector. This concentration
									in the energy sector may present more risks than if the Fund invested in numerous sectors of the economy.
									A downturn in the energy sector could have a larger impact on the Fund than on a fund that does not
									concentrate in the sector.

Closed the Income Gap®
with Nuveen Closed-End Funds



Closed-End Funds Offer Attractive Income Potential
In the search for increased income opportunities, closed-end funds can be a smart choice. Designed and built for income, closed-end funds seek to provide regular, stable cash flow over time and can serve as a compelling tool for optimizing an income portfolio.
Consider closed-end funds if you’re seeking to:1


1


Enhance Income and Cash Flow
Because of their unique closed structure and ability to use leverage,2 closed-end funds offer potentially higher distributions3 than traditional income investments.4


2


Manage Interest Rate Risk 
Floating rate, shorter duration or equity closed-end funds may help reduce a portfolio’s interest rate sensitivity.


3


Protect Purchasing Power
Closed-end funds that invest in real assets and dividend-paying stocks, which typically increase their payments with rising inflation, may help buffer the effects of rising inflation.


4


Maximize After-Tax Efficiency
Nuveen offers a wide array of national, state specific and AMT-free municipal closed-end funds that may help reduce your tax liability on investment income.5


5


Improve Diversification
With strategies that provide access to specialized asset classes, including alternatives, Nuveen closed-end funds may enhance portfolio diversification.

There is no guarantee that any of the funds will achieve their stated objectives. For detailed information on the specific risks associated with each fund, please view the fund overview by clicking on the fund name above.
1 Goal classifications represent common investor concerns when evaluating portfolio needs, are provided for informational purposes only, and are not intended to be relied upon as investment advice or recommendations.
2 Leverage typically magnifies the total return of a fund’s portfolio, whether that return is positive or negative, and creates an opportunity for increased common share net income as well as higher volatility of net asset value, market price, and distributions. There is no assurance that a fund’s leveraging strategy will be successful.
3 Potential distribution sources include net investment income, realized gains and return of capital.  
4 Different types of asset investments have different types of risks, which may provide higher returns but also greater volatility. In general, equity securities tend to be more volatile that fixed income securities. The value of, and income generated by, debt securities will decrease or increase based on changes in market interest rates. As interest rates risk, bond prices fall. In general, below investment grade (high-yield) debt securities tend to be more volatile than investment grade securities. Preferred securities are subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company's capital structure, and therefore are subject to greater credit risk. The interest and principal payments of U.S. Treasury securities are guaranteed.
5 Income may be subject to state and local income taxes and the alternative minimum tax. Capital gains, if any, will be subject to capital gains tax.

Source: Morningstar as of 3/31/17.
5. 9 out of 10 fixed income funds. Ranking based on Class Z share fixed income funds with 10-year history. Rankings for Class Z share fixed income funds that rank top 50% or better within their respective Morningstar Categories over the trailing 1-, 3-, & 5-year periods are 12/18 funds, 14/15 funds, and 11/13 funds, respectively. Source: Morningstar as of 3/31/17.
6. P&I/Towers Watson Top 300 Pension Funds ranking as of 12/31/16, published 9/30/16.
7. Based on U.S. Plan Sponsor rankings in Pensions & Investments as of 12/31/16.
Morningstar rankings are based on total return, do not include the effects of sales charges, and are calculated against all funds in each fund's respective Morningstar category. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Performance by share class may vary.
Star ratings shown are for Class Z shares, which are available to individual investors through certain retirement and wrap fee programs, and to institutions at an investment minimum of $5,000,000. Performance by share class may vary. In addition to the ones shown above, other classes, which contain either a sales load or a contingent deferred sales charge, are also available. These expenses will generally lower total fund return. Please see the prospectus for additional information about fees, expenses and investor eligibility requirements.
The risks associated with investing in these funds include but are not limited to: derivative securities, which may carry market, credit, and liquidity risks; short sales, which involve costs and the risk of potentially unlimited losses; leveraging, which may magnify losses; high yield (“junk”) bonds, which are subject to greater market risks; small/mid cap stocks which may be subject to more erratic market movements than large cap stocks; foreign securities, which are subject to currency fluctuation and political uncertainty; real estate, which poses certain risks related to overall and specific economic conditions as well as risks related to individual property, credit and interest-rate fluctuations; and mortgage-backed securities, which are subject to prepayment and extension risks. Sector funds and Specialty funds may not be suitable for all investors. Such funds are non-diversified, so a loss resulting from a particular security will have greater impact on the Fund's return. Fixed income investments are subject to interest rate risk, and their value will decline as interest rates rise. The risks associated with each fund are explained more fully in each fund's respective prospectus. There is no guarantee a fund's objectives will be achieved.
Some Morningstar Ratings may not be customarily based on adjusted historical returns. If so, an investment's independent Morningstar Rating metric is compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating for certain time periods. The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.
For the overall, 3-, 5- and 10-year periods, respectively, as of 3/31/17: Prudential Balanced Fund was rated 5 stars out of 721 funds, 5 stars out of 721 funds, and 5 stars out of 616 funds, and 4 out of 424 funds, respectively; Prudential High Yield Fund was rated 5 stars out of 596 funds, 5 stars out of 596 funds, 4 stars out of 471 funds, and 5 stars out of 318 funds, respectively; Prudential Short-Term Corporate Bond Fund, Inc. was rated 5 stars out of 444 funds, 4 stars out of 444 funds, 4 stars out of 359 funds, and 5 stars out of 257 funds, respectively; Prudential Total Return Bond Fund was rated 5 stars out of 851 funds, 5 stars out of 851 funds, 5 stars out of 750 funds, and 5 stars out of 538 funds, respectively; Prudential California Municipal Income Fund was rated 5 stars out of 69 funds, 5 stars out of 69 funds, 5 stars out of 65 funds, and 5 stars out of 52 funds, respectively; Prudential National Muni Fund was rated 5 stars out of 256 funds, 5 stars out of 256 funds, 5 stars out of 224 funds, and 5 stars out of 150 funds, respectively; Prudential QMA Small-Cap Value Fund was rated 5 stars out of 353 funds, 5 stars out of 353 funds, 4 stars out of 309 funds, and 5 stars out of 199 funds, respectively; Prudential Short Duration Multi-Sector Bond Fund was rated 5 stars out of 444 funds, and 5 stars out of 444 funds, respectively.

WHEREAS, the Fund has been organized to invest substantially all of its capital into Center Coast Core MLP Fund I, LLC (the �Master Fund�);


WHEREAS, CCC acts as investment adviser to the Master Fund pursuant to an Investment Management Agreement with the Master Fund dated as of May 31, 2011 (the �Investment Management Agreement�), pursuant to which it is paid an investment management fee (the �Investment Management Fee�);


NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the Fund�s investment in the Master Fund, the Master Fund engaging CCC pursuant to the Investment Management Agreement, and other good and valuable consideration, the parties to this Agreement agree as follows:
�
1���������Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Fund�s Confidential Private Placement Memorandum as currently in effect.�����������


2.��������CCC agrees to waive the Investment Management Fee and other fees payable to it directly or indirectly by the Master Fund or the Fund, and to pay or absorb expenses of the Fund (whether borne directly by the Fund or indirectly through its interest in the Master Fund) (a �Waiver�) so that the Total Annual Expenses of the Fund (excluding taxes, interest, brokerage commissions, other transaction-related expenses, any extraordinary expenses of the Fund and any acquired fund fees and expenses) will not exceed 1.85% of the net assets of the Fund on an annualized basis (the �Expense Limitation�).
�
3.��������This Agreement will have an initial term ending one (1) year from the date of commencement of the Fund�s operations, and during such initial term neither CCC nor the Fund may terminate this Agreement.��This Agreement will automatically renew for consecutive one-year terms thereafter so long as the Fund is an investor in the Master Fund and CCC or an Affiliate thereof acts as investment manager of the Master Fund or servicing agent of the Fund.��Subject to the initial sentence of this paragraph, any party may terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days� written notice to the other party.
�
4.��������The Fund agrees to carry forward, for a period not to exceed (3) three years from the date on which a Waiver is made by CCC, all fees and expenses in excess of the Expense Limitation that have been waived, paid or absorbed by CCC, and to repay CCC such amounts, provided the Fund is able to effect such repayment and remain in compliance with the Expense Limitation.��To the extent that such repayment is due, it shall be made as promptly as possible, in conjunction with the next succeeding payment of Investment Management Fee to CCC.��To the extent that the full amount of such waived amount or expense paid cannot be repaid as provided in the previous sentence within such applicable three-year period, such repayment obligation shall be extinguished.


5.��������If this Agreement is terminated by the Fund, the Fund agrees to repay to CCC any amounts payable pursuant to paragraph 4 that have not been previously repaid and, subject to the 1940 Act, such repayment will be made to CCC not later than (3) three years from the date on which a Waiver was made by CCC (regardless of the date of termination of this Agreement), so long as the Fund is able to effect such reimbursement and remain in compliance with the Expense Limitation as if such Expense Limitation was still in effect.��If this Agreement is terminated by CCC, the Fund agrees to repay to CCC any amounts payable pursuant to paragraph 4 that have not been previously repaid and, subject to the 1940 Act, such repayment will be made to CCC not later than thirty (30) days after the termination of this Agreement, so long as the Fund is able to effect such reimbursement and remain in compliance with the Expense Limitation as

OBJECTIVE
The Fund seeks maximum total return with an emphasis on providing cash distributions to shareholders. 
STRATEGY
What are MLPs?
Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs) are publicly traded partnerships focused on energy-related activities including the exploration, marketing, transportation, processing, production, refining and/or storage of any natural resources.  They are traded on a stock exchange just like any other equity security.
Why Invest In MLP’s:

Strong historical track record


Attractive yield relative to other asset classes


Historically low correlation to other yield-oriented investments 


Have the potential to act as an inflation hedge


Favorable tax treatment


Have predominantly low volatility in cash flows


Projected growth in demand for energy infrastructure remains strong 

INVESTMENT PROCESS
The Fund's sub-advisor, Center Coast Capital Advisors, LP ("Center Coast" or the "Sub-Advisor"), seeks to identify a portfolio of high quality MLPs. In managing the Fund’s assets, Center Coast uses a disciplined investment process focused on due diligence from the perspective of an MLP owner, operator and acquirer.

First a universe of high quality MLPs (i.e., MLPs with strong risk adjusted returns and stable and growing cash distributions) is established utilizing a proprietary multifactor model, and then strategically weights those companies using financial and valuation analysis centered on quantitative factors including cash flow, yield and relative valuation to establish a valuation target.


Next evaluation of the MLPs is conducted.  Center Coast evaluates asset quality, considering factors such as contract structure, operating risk, competitive environment and growth potential. They also assess management quality, drawing on its previous experience with many of the MLPs’ management teams to evaluate their financial discipline, level of general partner support, operational expertise, strength of their business plans and ability to execute those plans. They also include in the diligence process an assessment of the trading dynamics of the securities issued by the MLPs, including liquidity, identification of fund flow from institutional investors with large holdings in the MLPs, equity overhang (i.e., the difference between funds raised and funds invested) and float (i.e., the number of a company’s shares issued and available to be traded by the general public).


Finally, Center Coast ranks, weights and invests in MLPs based on their assessment of the durability of their cash flows, relative market valuation and growth potential. 

 







 Before investing you should carefully consider the Center Coast MLP Focus Fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other information is in the prospectus and summary prospectus, a copy of which may be obtained by calling 877-766-0066. Please read the prospectus or summary prospectus carefully before investing.
RISK AND OTHER DISCLOSURES:
An investment in the Center Coast MLP Focus Fund is subject to risk, including the possible loss of principal amount invested and including, but not limited to, the following risks, which are more fully described in the prospectus:
The Fund concentrates its investments in master limited partnerships (MLPs), which involve additional risks compared to those from investments in common stock, including, but not limited to, cash flow risk, tax risk, and risks associated with limited voting rights.
Unlike most other open-end mutual funds, the Fund will be taxable as a regular corporation, or “C” corporation.  Consequently, the Fund will accrue and pay federal, state and local income taxes on its taxable income, if any, at the Fund level, which will ultimately reduce the returns that the shareholder would have otherwise received.  Additionally, on daily basis the Fund’s net asset value per share (“NAV”) will include a deferred tax expense (which reduces the Fund's NAV) or asset (which increases the Fund's NAV, unless offset by a valuation allowance). To the extend the Fund has a deferred tax asset, consideration is given as to whether or not a valuation allowance is required. The Fund’s deferred tax expense or asset is based on estimates that could vary dramatically from the Fund’s actual tax liability/benefit and, therefore, could have a material impact on the Fund’s NAV.
The Fund, unlike the MLPs in which it invests which are treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is not a pass-through entity. Consequently, the tax characterization of the distributions paid by the Fund, such as dividend income or return of capital, may differ greatly from those of its MLP investments.  An investment in the Fund does not provide the same tax benefits as a direct investment in an MLP.
The Fund currently anticipates paying monthly cash distributions to shareholders at a rate that over time is similar to the distribution rate the Fund receives from the MLPs in which it invests, without offset for the expenses of the Fund. The Fund may maintain cash reserves, borrow or sell certain investments at less desirable prices in order to pay the expenses of the Fund. Because the Fund’s distribution policy takes into consideration estimated future cash flows from its underlying holdings, and to permit the Fund to maintain a stable distribution rate, the Fund’s distributions may not represent yield or investment return on the Fund’s portfolio.  To the extent that the distributions paid exceed the distributions the Fund has received, the distributions will reduce the Fund’s net assets.   
The Fund is not required to make distributions and in the future could decide not to make such distributions or not to make distributions at a rate that over time is similar to the distribution rate it receives from the MLPs in which it invests.
It is expected that a portion of the distributions will be considered tax deferred return of capital (ROC). ROC is tax deferred and reduces the shareholder’s cost basis (until the cost basis reaches zero); and when the Fund shares are sold, if the result is a gain, it would then be taxable to the shareholder at the capital gains rate. Any portion of distributions that are not considered ROC are expected to be characterized as qualified dividends for tax purposes. Qualified dividends are taxable in the year received and do not serve to reduce the shareholder’s cost basis. The portion of the Fund’s distributions that may be classified as ROC is uncertain and can be materially impacted by events that are not subject to the control of the Fund’s advisor or sub-advisor (e.g. mergers, acquisitions, reorganizations and other capital transactions occurring at the individual MLP level, changes in the tax characterization of distributions received from the MLP investments held by the Fund, or change in tax laws). The ROC portion may also be impacted by the Fund’s strategy, which may recognize gains on its holdings. Because of these factors, the portion of the Fund’s distributions that are considered ROC may vary materially from year to year. Accordingly, there is no guarantee that future distributions will maintain the same classification for tax purposes as past distributions. 
The MLPs owned by the Fund are subject to regulatory and tax risks, including but not limited to changes in current tax law which could result in MLPs being treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes or the elimination or reduction of MLPs tax deductions, which could result in a material decrease in the Fund’s NAV and/or lower after-tax distributions to Fund shareholders. 
As a non-diversified fund, the Fund may focus its assets in the securities of fewer issuers, which exposes the Fund to greater market risk than if its assets were diversified among a greater number of issuers.
Equity securities issued by MLPs may trade less frequently than larger companies due to their smaller capitalizations, which may result in erratic price movement or difficulty in buying or selling.
A substantial portion of the MLPs within the Fund are primarily engaged in the energy sector. As a result, any negative development affecting that sector, such as regulatory, environmental, commodity pricing or extreme weather risk, will have a greater impact on the Fund than a fund that is not over-weighted in that sector.
The Fund may not be suitable for all investors. We encourage you to read the Fund’s prospectus carefully and consult with appropriate tax and financial professionals before considering an investment in the Fund.

What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

A quarter of S&P 500’s 2017 climb due to five stocks (yes, those five)
              
              Throughout 2017, there’s one acronym that investors have in particular been sinking their teeth into: FAANG.

Amazon earnings fall 77%, shares drop
              
              Amazon.com Inc.  reported much lower earnings than expected Thursday, and shares declined more than 2% in late trading. The e-commerce giant reported net income of $197 million, or 40 cents a share, on sales of $38 billion, a profit decline of 77% from the same quarter a year ago. Analysts on average expected Amazon to report earnings of $1.41 a share on sales of $37.2 billion. The company's spending cut into profit, as fulfillment costs -- the amount Amazon spends to fulfill customers' orders on its e-commerce platform -- rose about 33% from a year ago and spending on technology and content increased by about 43%. Amazon stock traded at all-time highs this week, making Amazon the fourth U.S. company with a market capitalization of $500 billion and briefly giving Chief Executive Jeff Bezos the title of richest man in the world, but shares declined about 2% in immediate after-hours action.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

			Equity
			: Master Limited Partnership (MLP) Funds



			About Master Limited Partnership (MLP) Funds

			MLPs are publicly traded partnerships primarily operating businesses in the natural resources and energy
			industries. MLPs own real, hard assets critical to the U.S. economy. Energy MLPs are typically formed
			by larger energy companies to re-capitalize lower growth assets. They help to finance various portions
			of the crude oil and natural gas value chains. As shown below, they typically own transportation and
			storage assets in these chains, and also production assets within the natural gas value chain.
		





			MLPs are a US-only investment, because one of their primary features is advantageous U.S. federal tax
			treatment. Typically, about 80% of their distributions are tax-deferred, though this can change when
			MLPs are included in pooled investment vehicles like closed-end funds.

			The total return of MLP investments is typically based on their distributions and on demand for energy.
			Because they are highly concentrated in the energy sector, however, they can be more negatively affected
			by a downturn in the energy sector. In addition, their tax-advantaged distributions could be negatively
			affected by changes in the U.S. tax code regarding treatment of MLPs.

			For more information, see http://naptp.org/ the National Association
			of Publicly Traded Partnerships.
		



					About Nuveen MLP Closed-End Funds
				

					Nuveen currently offers one MLP closed-end fund.

The Nuveen MLP Total Return Fund (JMF)
					seeks to achieve its objective by investing primarily in a portfolio of master limited partnerships
					(“MLPs”) in the energy sector. The Fund believes that MLPs represent a timely investment opportunity
					since MLPs typically generate a high level of tax-deferred income and offer the potential for increased
					distributions and capital appreciation over time. To implement its strategy, the Fund’s portfolio management
					team combines its top-down strategic investment style with its rigorous, bottom-up investment process.
					The Fund seeks to identify MLPs that it believes have the most attractive current yields and total return
					potential. In seeking to mitigate certain key risks of MLP investing, the Fund may use various hedging
					techniques consistent with its top-down investment style with the goal of enhancing its risk-adjusted
					total return over the longer term.
				






								Investor Profile

								Are these CEFs right for you?
The features and investment objectives of these funds may be an appropriate investment for you if
								you are seeking the potential for:

Tax-advantaged quarterly distributions; 
Capital appreciation and distribution growth over time; 
Portfolio diversification and an investment that may serve as a hedge against inflation;
An efficient, single-investment opportunity providing access to a diverse portfolio of MLPs in the energy
									sector.


								What are potential risks?
							

Tax Risks. These Funds invest primarily in MLPs that pay no separate corporate level tax because they
									qualify as partnerships under current tax law. A change in law or in the business of such MLPs that
									caused them to be treated as taxable corporations could negatively affect fund performance and/or distributions.
								
Energy Sector Risks. The Funds invest predominantely in MLPs in the energy sector. This concentration
									in the energy sector may present more risks than if the Fund invested in numerous sectors of the economy.
									A downturn in the energy sector could have a larger impact on the Fund than on a fund that does not
									concentrate in the sector.

Income-oriented closed-end funds make payouts largely from interest	and dividends.
Income and capital appreciation funds seek regular cash	flow made up of interest and dividends, with the remainder from capital appreciation or, if necessary, return of capital.
Capital appreciation and income closed-end funds seek cash flow mainly from capital appreciation.
Single-asset-class funds invest primarily in one asset class, which can be used as components in a well-diversified income portfolio.

Closed the Income Gap®
with Nuveen Closed-End Funds



Closed-End Funds Offer Attractive Income Potential
In the search for increased income opportunities, closed-end funds can be a smart choice. Designed and built for income, closed-end funds seek to provide regular, stable cash flow over time and can serve as a compelling tool for optimizing an income portfolio.
Consider closed-end funds if you’re seeking to:1


1


Enhance Income and Cash Flow
Because of their unique closed structure and ability to use leverage,2 closed-end funds offer potentially higher distributions3 than traditional income investments.4


2


Manage Interest Rate Risk 
Floating rate, shorter duration or equity closed-end funds may help reduce a portfolio’s interest rate sensitivity.


3


Protect Purchasing Power
Closed-end funds that invest in real assets and dividend-paying stocks, which typically increase their payments with rising inflation, may help buffer the effects of rising inflation.


4


Maximize After-Tax Efficiency
Nuveen offers a wide array of national, state specific and AMT-free municipal closed-end funds that may help reduce your tax liability on investment income.5


5


Improve Diversification
With strategies that provide access to specialized asset classes, including alternatives, Nuveen closed-end funds may enhance portfolio diversification.

There is no guarantee that any of the funds will achieve their stated objectives. For detailed information on the specific risks associated with each fund, please view the fund overview by clicking on the fund name above.
1 Goal classifications represent common investor concerns when evaluating portfolio needs, are provided for informational purposes only, and are not intended to be relied upon as investment advice or recommendations.
2 Leverage typically magnifies the total return of a fund’s portfolio, whether that return is positive or negative, and creates an opportunity for increased common share net income as well as higher volatility of net asset value, market price, and distributions. There is no assurance that a fund’s leveraging strategy will be successful.
3 Potential distribution sources include net investment income, realized gains and return of capital.  
4 Different types of asset investments have different types of risks, which may provide higher returns but also greater volatility. In general, equity securities tend to be more volatile that fixed income securities. The value of, and income generated by, debt securities will decrease or increase based on changes in market interest rates. As interest rates risk, bond prices fall. In general, below investment grade (high-yield) debt securities tend to be more volatile than investment grade securities. Preferred securities are subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company's capital structure, and therefore are subject to greater credit risk. The interest and principal payments of U.S. Treasury securities are guaranteed.
5 Income may be subject to state and local income taxes and the alternative minimum tax. Capital gains, if any, will be subject to capital gains tax.

7. Based on U.S. Plan Sponsor rankings in Pensions & Investments as of 12/31/16.
Morningstar rankings are based on total return, do not include the effects of sales charges, and are calculated against all funds in each fund's respective Morningstar category. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Performance by share class may vary.
Star ratings shown are for Class Z shares, which are available to individual investors through certain retirement and wrap fee programs, and to institutions at an investment minimum of $5,000,000. Performance by share class may vary. In addition to the ones shown above, other classes, which contain either a sales load or a contingent deferred sales charge, are also available. These expenses will generally lower total fund return. Please see the prospectus for additional information about fees, expenses and investor eligibility requirements.
The risks associated with investing in these funds include but are not limited to: derivative securities, which may carry market, credit, and liquidity risks; short sales, which involve costs and the risk of potentially unlimited losses; leveraging, which may magnify losses; high yield (“junk”) bonds, which are subject to greater market risks; small/mid cap stocks which may be subject to more erratic market movements than large cap stocks; foreign securities, which are subject to currency fluctuation and political uncertainty; real estate, which poses certain risks related to overall and specific economic conditions as well as risks related to individual property, credit and interest-rate fluctuations; and mortgage-backed securities, which are subject to prepayment and extension risks. Sector funds and Specialty funds may not be suitable for all investors. Such funds are non-diversified, so a loss resulting from a particular security will have greater impact on the Fund's return. Fixed income investments are subject to interest rate risk, and their value will decline as interest rates rise. The risks associated with each fund are explained more fully in each fund's respective prospectus. There is no guarantee a fund's objectives will be achieved.
Some Morningstar Ratings may not be customarily based on adjusted historical returns. If so, an investment's independent Morningstar Rating metric is compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating for certain time periods. The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.
For the overall, 3-, 5- and 10-year periods, respectively, as of 3/31/17: Prudential Balanced Fund was rated 5 stars out of 721 funds, 5 stars out of 721 funds, and 5 stars out of 616 funds, and 4 out of 424 funds, respectively; Prudential High Yield Fund was rated 5 stars out of 596 funds, 5 stars out of 596 funds, 4 stars out of 471 funds, and 5 stars out of 318 funds, respectively; Prudential Short-Term Corporate Bond Fund, Inc. was rated 5 stars out of 444 funds, 4 stars out of 444 funds, 4 stars out of 359 funds, and 5 stars out of 257 funds, respectively; Prudential Total Return Bond Fund was rated 5 stars out of 851 funds, 5 stars out of 851 funds, 5 stars out of 750 funds, and 5 stars out of 538 funds, respectively; Prudential California Municipal Income Fund was rated 5 stars out of 69 funds, 5 stars out of 69 funds, 5 stars out of 65 funds, and 5 stars out of 52 funds, respectively; Prudential National Muni Fund was rated 5 stars out of 256 funds, 5 stars out of 256 funds, 5 stars out of 224 funds, and 5 stars out of 150 funds, respectively; Prudential QMA Small-Cap Value Fund was rated 5 stars out of 353 funds, 5 stars out of 353 funds, 4 stars out of 309 funds, and 5 stars out of 199 funds, respectively; Prudential Short Duration Multi-Sector Bond Fund was rated 5 stars out of 444 funds, and 5 stars out of 444 funds, respectively.
