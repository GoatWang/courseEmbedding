Management Contract & Fees:

                            Per the Investment Management Agreement dated 17 July 2014 and in relation to the Ordinary Shares and Extended Life Shares, the Manager is entitled to a management fee, which shall accrue daily, and be payable monthly in arrears, at a rate of 0.125 percent per month of the Company's NAV. In addition, the Manager is entitled to a performance fee. The performance fee for Ordinary Shares, Extended Life Shares and New Global Shares will only become payable once the Company has made aggregate distributions in cash to the shareholders of the Shares equal to the aggregate gross proceeds of issuing Shares plus such amounts as will result in the shareholders having received a realised (cash-paid) IRR in respect of the Contributed Capital equal to Preferred Return, following which there will be a 100 percent catch up to the Manager until the Manager has received 20 percent of all amounts in excess of Contributed Capital distributed to the shareholders and paid to the Manager as a performance fee with, thereafter, all amounts distributed by the Company 20:80 between the Manager's performance fee and the cash distributed to shareholders.
