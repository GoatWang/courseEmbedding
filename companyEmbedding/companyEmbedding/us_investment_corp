Will you downsize, rent, or own your home?Do you expect to work part-time?Will you have the same medical insurance you had while working?

Treasury Securities
Treasury securities are debts issued by the federal government's Bureau of Fiscal Service. When you buy a treasury security, you are lending money to the federal government for a set amount of time. In return the government promises to pay you back the entire amount, also known as the face value, when the security matures.There are several types of treasury securities:Treasury Bills—Short term securities that mature between a few days and 52 weeks.Treasury Notes—Medium term securities that mature between one and 10 years.Treasury Bonds—Long term securities, with a 30 year term that pays interest every six months, until the bond matures.Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)—Securities with principle values that adjust based on inflation, but with fixed interest rates for five, 10, or 30 year maturities.Savings Bonds—Securities that offer a fixed interest rate over a fixed period of time.Floating Rate Notes (FRNs)—Securities with variable interest rates, so that as bank interest rates increase or decrease, the interest rates on the FRNs change in the same direction.You can purchase treasury securities for yourself or as gifts. You can purchase them in several ways:Banks, brokers, and other financial institutions through the Commercial Book-Entry System.Online through Treasury Direct Payroll savings plansPublic auctions

Trusts
A trust (or trust fund) is a legal entity that allows a person (the grantor, donor, or settlor) to transfer assets to another person or organization (the trustee). Once the grantor establishes the trust, the trustee controls and manages the assets for the grantor or for another beneficiary—someone who will ultimately benefit from the trust. To help you decide if a trust is right for you, first consult a licensed attorney experienced with estate planning and trust matters. Reasons to Set Up a TrustSome common reasons for setting up a trust include:Providing for minor children or family members who are inexperienced or unable to handle financial mattersArranging for management of personal assets, if you become unable to handle them yourselfAvoiding probate and immediately transferring assets to beneficiaries upon deathReducing estate taxes and providing liquid assets to help pay for themThe terms of a will are public while the terms of a trust are not, so privacy makes a trust an appealing option.Types of TrustsTrusts can be living (inter vivos) or after-death (testamentary). A living trust is one that a grantor sets up while still alive and an after-death trust is usually established by a will after one’s death. Living trusts can be irrevocable (can’t be changed) or revocable (can be changed), although revocable trusts don’t get the same tax shelter benefits as irrevocable ones do. The most common type of trust is the revocable living trust. If there’s a specific purpose in mind for the trust, dozens of different options exist (charitable trusts, bypass trusts, spendthrift trusts, and life insurance trusts). Two types of trusts can help pay for long-term care services:Charitable Remainder Trusts - This trust allows you to use your own assets to pay for long-term care services while contributing to a charity of your choice and reducing your tax burden at the same time. You can set up the trust so that you receive payments from the trust to pay for long-term care services while you are alive.Medicaid Disability Trusts - These trusts are limited to persons with disabilities who are under age 65 and qualify for public benefits. Parents, grandparents, and legal guardians often set up these trusts to benefit people with disabilities and a non-profit organization manages the assets. This is the only kind of trust that is exempt from rules regarding trusts and Medicaid eligibility.Trust Scams and FraudIf someone approaches you to set up a trust, be careful. Before signing any papers to create a living trust, will, or other kind of trust, make sure to explore all options and shop around to compare services. Some other tips to avoid trust scams and fraud include:Avoid high-pressure sales tactics and high-speed sales pitches.Stay away from salespeople who give the impression that specific organizations and recognized brands back or sell the trust.Research and get information about local probate laws from the Clerk or Register of Wills.If someone tries to sell a living trust to you, ask if they are an attorney. Some states restrict the sale of living trusts to licensed attorneys.If you buy a trust in your home or in another location that is not the seller's permanent place of business, remember you have the right to take advantage of the Cooling Off Rule and cancel the transaction within three business days.

Things to Consider Before You Invest
Do you have a financial goal in mind, such as saving for retirement, paying for college, or buying a new house? If so, then you may decide to invest your money to earn enough to fund your goals. Before you invest, make sure you have answers to all of these questions:How quickly can you get your money back? Stocks, bonds, and shares in mutual funds usually can be sold at any time, but there is no guarantee that you will get back all the money you invested. Other investments, such as limited partnerships, certificates of deposit (CDs), or IRAs, often restrict your ability to cash out your holdings.What can you expect to earn on your money? While bonds generally promise a fixed return, earnings on most other securities go up and down with market changes. Keep in mind, just because an investment has done well in the past, there is no guarantee it will do well in the future.What type of earnings can you expect? Will you get income in the form of interest, dividends, or rent? Some investments, such as stocks and real estate, have the potential for earnings and growth in value. What is the potential for earnings over time?How much risk is involved? With any investment, there is always the risk that you will not get your money back or the earnings promised. There is usually a trade-off between risk and reward--the higher the potential return, the greater the risk. While the U.S. government backs U.S. Treasury securities, it does not protect against loss on any other investments. Are your investments diversified? Some investments perform better than others in certain situations. For example, when interest rates go up, bond prices tend to go down. One industry may struggle while another prospers. Putting your money in a variety of investment options can reduce your risk. Are there any tax advantages to a particular investment? U.S. savings bonds are exempt from state and local taxes. Municipal bonds are exempt from federal income tax and, sometimes, state income tax as well. Tax-deferred investments for special goals, such as paying for college and retirement, are available that let you postpone or even avoid paying income taxes.More Information on InvestingTo learn more about investing, refer to these resources:You can find useful tips on investing at Investor.gov, a website from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).For all of your investment-related questions, contact the SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy. To get help preparing to invest, consult the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).
Back to Top


Tools to Research Investments
To help you make informed decisions when investing and avoid investment fraud, there are a variety of research tools available:Find investor news and alerts and a guide to investment products at Investor.gov, a website from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).​The SEC requires public companies to disclose financial and other information to help you make sound decisions. You can view the text of these files on EDGAR. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has up-to-date market data and information for a wide range of stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and other securities. If you are considering investing in collectible coins, refer to the U.S. Mint. Before you purchase coins or coin-related products, research the seller with a government agency, such as your state consumer protection office or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

Choose a Financial Professional
A financial professional can have multiple titles and be authorized to provide various services, including investment, financial planning, and insurance products.  When researching a financial professional, find out what the titles and licenses mean, as well as the educational, work experience, and ethical requirements. Keep in mind that a professional title is not the same as a license. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and state regulators do not grant or endorse any professional titles. When choosing a broker or investment adviser, research the person's education and professional history as well as the firm the person works for. Make sure you have answers to all of these questions:Has the person worked with others who have circumstances similar to yours? Is the person licensed in your state? Your state securities regulator lists individuals and firms that are registered in your state. Ask whether the regulatory office has any other background information. To find out how to contact your state securities regulator, consult the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA).Has the person had any run-ins with regulators or received serious complaints from investors? Contact your state securities regulator or the SEC. To review licensing, employment, and disciplinary information, use FINRA's BrokerCheck tool.How is the person paid? Is it an hourly rate, a flat fee, or a commission that depends on the investments you make? Does the person get a bonus from their firm for selling you a particular product?What are the fees for setting up and servicing your account? Resources to Help You Choose a Financial ProfessionalFor more information on choosing a financial professional, refer to these resources:The Commodity Futures Trading Commission's (CFTC's) SmartCheck allows you to check the background of financial professionals and stay informed on the latest fraud schemes. To ask a question, report information, or file a complaint, contact the CFTC.The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has information on the professional designations of financial professionals and the organizations that offer them. Both the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) and the National Futures Association can offer helpful information on saving and investing.

Pyramid Schemes
A pyramid scheme, also known as Ponzi scheme, is an illegal form of multilevel marketing. In these scams, your ability to earn profits is based on the number of new participants you recruit, instead of the amount of products or services you sell. Sometimes there actually aren't any real products that are being sold. These types of schemes are common with investment and independent direct selling opportunities.These schemes rely on the income from new participants in order to pay fake "profits" to people that have been part of the scheme for longer amounts of time. However, the scheme falls apart when there aren't enough new recruits to pay into the system, so the earlier participants no longer receive earnings.Tips to Avoid Being a VictimTake steps to protect yourself from being a victim of a pyramid scheme:Be wary of "opportunities" to invest your money in franchises or investments that require you to bring in more investors to increase your profit, or recoup your initial investment.Be wary if the company sells non-tangible products or technical services, rather than physical items. Independently verify the legitimacy of any franchise or investment with the Better Business Bureau, your state Attorney General, or any licensing agencies.Be skeptical of success stories and testimonials of fantastic earnings.File a ComplaintIf you are aware of a pyramid scheme or have been the victim of one, file a complaint with your state consumer protection office, state Attorney General, or the Better Business Bureau (BBB). If the pyramid scheme involved securities, you should also file a complaint with your state's securities administrator, or the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Q. "Why do I need rare coins in my portfolio?"
A. "The answer is diversification. The majority of your portfolio is 
in equity or paper investments, such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds and annuities. These make up the 
bulk of your assets and in most economic scenarios will provide safety and growth for your future. 
However, there are certain times when tangible or real assets are important to your portfolio. 
One of the most time-tested methods of "wealth insurance" has been rare coin investments. 
They are easy to store, easy to value, easy to transport and easy to sell. It is for this reason that 
you should have a portion of your portfolio in rare coins."
Q. "How much of my portfolio should be in rare coin investments?"

A. "Generally, 5-15% of your growth portfolio can be in 
tangibles. The typical investor usually has at least 10% of  assets in rare coins. The actual percentage 
that is suitable for you can be easily determined by you and your advisor in a review of your present 
holdings. The financial planner insures that the investment is appropriate for the client."
Q. "Is this a rare coin fund?"

A. "No. In a rare coin fund, you receive a certificate for only partial ownership of a coin 
portfolio. There are additional fees in a fund for management, legal costs, distribution and storage. A 
fund splits the profit between the general partner (the person who manages the fund) and the limited 
partner (the investor). In a fund, all control belongs to a general partner. In the USTIC program, there 
are no additional fees or splitting of profits. Full control of the portfolio is with you, the investor."
Q. "What is an investment grade rare coin?"
A. "Many coins can be considered investments for a number of reasons, however, for the 
typical non-collector investor, these general guidelines should be used:

United States coins only. 
Dated prior to 1934.
The condition or "grade"is Mint State (MS) or Proof (PF) 63 or higher (64, 65, 66 or 67). Coins graded 68 to 70 are very difficult to price due to extreme rarity and usually should be avoided.
All coins must be graded and certified by either the Professional Coin Grading Service (PCGS) or the Numismatic Guaranty Corporation (NGC).
Prices should be a function of the Certified Coin Dealer Newsletter (CCDN) and the Coin Dealer Newsletter (CDN).
The population of the coin (the number of coins that have been graded by either PCGS or NGC) is low for the series whenever possible. This is available from the current edition of the PCGS or NGC Population Reports."

Q. "What does certified mean? Is it necessary?"
A. "Certification by one of the recognized independent grading firms, such as the Professional 
Coin Grading Service (PCGS) or the Numismatic Guaranty Corporation (NGC) provides you the assurance of 
an independent 3rd party verification of the grade of the coin, insures that your coin is 
not a counterfeit and the grade assigned was issued in conformity with the industry standards of one of 
the leading grading services (not assigned by a selling firm). The holder will also provide 
for the physical protection of the coin itself. All these benefits make certification a very necessary 
part of rare coin investments."
Q. "Does the price of gold or silver have any effect on the price of rare coins?"
A. "For investment quality coins, the effect of bullion price movements is minimal, if any. 
These coins have value due to their rarity and collector demand rather than any intrinsic metal 
content. For example, in the art world, the value of a Picasso is not based on how much paint, wood 
or canvas is used to create the work. The same is true with rare coins. An investor who buys a $20 
gold piece for $25,000 is not concerned that the coin contains about an ounce of gold currently worth 
$350. In lower quality coins, those that are of poor condition and easily obtained, the price is 
determined largely by bullion price movement. In this example, a poor quality $20 gold piece that is 
sold for $420 has over 80% of its value based on bullion content."
Q. "How have rare coins done as an investment?"
A. "Like any other investment, it depends on the time frame that is examined. 
Historically, rare coins perform best when considered a long-term investment. Paper assets make up 
the majority of a client's portfolio; rare coins can potentially hedge future cyclical economic events 
that affect those assets."
Q. "How can I keep track of how my rare coin investment is performing?"
A. "U.S. Tangible will provide a written evaluation for you at no charge, at least annually on your request. In addition, if you need more frequent reviews, they can be obtained by placing a toll-free call to our offices.
In addition, if you need more frequent reviews, they can 
be provided as easy as placing a tollfree call to our offices. All the evaluations are done by 
computer and are based on the up to date values as listed on the nationwide electronic rare coin 
investment network. You will be able to find out the value of your rare coin investment with the 
same amount of effort that it takes to determine the value of your annuity."
Q. "How long should I hold an investment in rare coins?"
A. "Like any other investment, rare coins are cyclical in nature. They go up and down in 
value based on economic conditions, market supply and demand. In the past, these cycles occurred 
every four to six years, so as a rule you should plan to commit your funds for this period of time. 
However, when short term gains are realized prior to the recommended holding period, you and your 
advisor can review your portfolio and take profits where available."
Q. "Where do I store rare coins?"
A. "Rare coins are very easy to store. They can be stored in a safe deposit box at your 
bank or in a home safe. Since the coins are in sonically sealed, tamperproof plastic cases of 
uniform size, they do not require much space. In addition, you will receive a "tangibles 
binder" that contains the invoice, descriptions, histories and color digital images of all 
the rare coins in your portfolio. You may keep this binder at home to review your investment 
while keeping the actual coins secure in your bank vault or home safe."
Q. "How is my rare coin portfolio selected?"
A. "Your financial advisor, after the question of suitability of investment is answered, 
will work with you to determine your investment goals, time frame and amounts to invest. Using 
the criteria on the selection form coupled with the input from you and your advisor, a portfolio 
will be put together. The number of coins will be dependent upon the amount invested. Typically, 
for a $10,000 portfolio, there may be four to six coins included. All the portfolios assembled 
by U.S. Tangible are totally customized for each client."
Q. "How easy will it be to sell my rare coins?"
A. "Rare coins are among the most liquid and easy to sell tangible assets with many industry 
outlets available for liquidation. You may elect to sell them back through U.S. Tangible at any time. 
We will provide you a firm price based on the then prevailing market wholesale prices. This method 
takes no longer than 5 business days. An additional method of liquidation is through one of our 
affiliate's many rare coin auctions. Auctions are conducted approximately once a month at major rare 
coin shows throughout the country, where your coins are exposed to the largest numbers of interested 
buyers. Depending on which type of auction you choose, the selling process takes from one
to three months. Our auction affiliate takes control of the entire process from the time of your 
consignment to sending you your check. So, whether you choose to sell directly or at auction, selling 
is a snap."
Q. "Must I become a coin collector?"
A. "No! Investing in rare coins is entirely different than collecting. You 
don't have to be an actuary to invest in annuities, nor a stock analyst to invest in mutual 
funds. Well, you don't have to be a coin collector to invest in rare coins. U.S. Tangible makes 
the investment process easy and understandable, from the time of your purchase until you 
decide to sell. That's why you should deal with a company of long-standing reputation and integrity. 
U.S. Tangible has worked exclusively with professional financial advisors who have placed their 
investing clients in confidence with U. S. Tangible since 1978. We recognize the special requirements 
and concerns of investors and the programs are designed to make it easy for you to buy, track and sell 
your investment in coins. Importantly, we work with investors through their financial advisors
. The investment is suitable for your portfolio since you and 
your advisor decide on the priority of the investment, not the selling firm."
Q. "How can I get more information?"
A. "Check with your financial advisor. Ask if his or her broker-dealer has an agreement with 
U.S. Tangible Investment Corporation. Many of the major firms have performed a due diligence 
investigation and have approved our programs to be offered by their representatives. If you would like 
one of the top independent representatives in your area to contact you about USTIC, please call 
tollfree at 1-800-742-6000 ext 333 or email coins@ustic.com 
and you will receive a prompt reply."

Why Invest with U.S. Bank







U.S. Bank HomeInvestments and Wealth ManagementInvestment Products GlossaryInvestment Products GlossaryWe can help you understand some of today's most popular investment options.Overview
Owning a diversified mix of investments may be appropriate to help you work toward your most important long-term goals. The good news is that you have more choices than ever before to help you round out your portfolio. But that also creates challenges, especially if you have little experience managing your own investments. A good starting point is to understand basic investment options.
Investment products and financial services are provided through U.S. Bank and/or its affiliate, U.S. Bancorp Investments, Inc.. StocksShares of stock provide an investor an ownership position in a specific corporation and represent a claim on the corporation’s earnings and assets. As an equity position, investors who purchase stock in a company seek to benefit from its continued growth and ability to generate profits, just as other owners of the company would receive. Common stock typically entitles shareholders to vote in the election of a board of directors and other matters presented for voting. Preferred stock typically does not include voting rights, but has priority on claims (such as dividend payments) compared to common stock. Corporations across the world and of all different sizes offer shares of their stock on the public market, giving all individuals an opportunity to own stock in their firms. Stock prices fluctuate throughout the day as they are bought and sold on public exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange.
Equity securities are subject to stock market fluctuations that occur in response to economic and business developments.  Investments in small and mid-sized companies may be more volatile than securities issued by larger companies. Investments outside of the USA have risks such as currency fluctuations, economic or financial instability, lack of timely or reliable information or unfavorable political or legal developments.  These risks increase for investments in emerging markets.BondsA bond is an interest-bearing security issued by a government entity or corporation. The issuer is obligated to pay the bondholder a specified amount, usually at specific intervals (interest payments) and to repay the principal amount when the bond matures. Fixed income securities are normally issued in maturities ranging from 30 days to 30 years. The ratings of bonds by various rating agencies can vary based on the reliability of the issuer and the potential risk that the issuer could default on the timely payment of interest and principal. Bonds can be traded on the open market and their principal value can fluctuate in large part due to changes in the interest rate environment or in the financial stability of the issuer.
Investing in fixed income securities (debt securities) is subject to various risks, including changes in interest rates, credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications and other factors. Investment in debt securities typically decrease in value when interest rates rise. This risk is usually greater for longer term debt securities. Investments in lower rated and non rated securities present a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher rated securities.Mutual FundsA pool of money collected from shareholders that is invested in stocks, bonds, money market securities and other types of assets. Professional managers oversee a fund’s investment decision-making process and execute trades. Mutual funds allow individuals to gain access to a diversified group of assets for a relatively modest investment. Each fund has a stated investment objective that specifies how the underlying portfolio should be structured. Investors can choose from funds that are focused on owning stocks, bonds, specialty investments such as commodities, or a mix of different types of assets. Because funds are available across a broad range of asset classes, they may be an effective instrument to use in implementing an asset allocation strategy. Mutual funds are priced at the end of each trading day based on a fund’s Net Asset Value (NAV), which represents the combined worth of all underlying securities held in the portfolio.
Mutual fund investing involves risk; principal loss is possible. Investing in certain funds involves special risks, such as those related to investments in small- and mid-capitalization stocks, foreign, debt and high-yield securities, and funds that focus their investments in a particular industry. Mutual funds are sold by prospectus only.  Before investing, read the prospectus carefully to consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.  The current value of a collective investment fund share is calculated by dividing the total value of all securities in its portfolio, less any liabilities by the number of fund shares outstanding.Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)Securities that track a specific index, commodity or basket of assets. They are similar to a mutual fund, but trade like a stock on an exchange. The value of individual ETFs fluctuates in price throughout the day as it is bought and sold on the open market. Investors in ETFs can trade it as they would a stock, including the use of techniques such as short selling and margin buying. ETFs tend to have lower costs than the average mutual fund.
Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) are baskets of securities that are traded on an exchange like individual stocks at negotiated prices and are not individually redeemable. ETFs are designed to generally track a market index – broad stock or bond market, stock industry sector or international stock. Shares of ETFs may trade at a premium or a discount to the net asset value of the underlying securities.  The current value of a collective investment fund share is calculated by dividing the total value of all securities in its portfolio, less any liabilities by the number of fund shares outstanding. Because ETFs and closed-end funds trade like stocks, their shares trade at market value which price can be at a premium or discount to NAV.  Exchange-traded funds are sold by prospectus. Please consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. The prospectus, which contains this and other information, can be obtained by calling your financial advisor. Read it carefully before you invest.Unit Investment Trusts (UITs)A Unit Investment Trust (UIT) is a type of investment company that offers shares as “units” usually redeemable by the investor with the company.  A UIT does not actively trade its investment portfolio so there is usually little to no portfolio turnover.  UITs typically invest in stocks or bonds, which are selected as part of an overall investment strategy.  UITs may adopt a variety of strategies designed for income or capital appreciation.  The investment minimums are usually low, often $1,000 for nonqualified accounts ($100 for IRAs).  A UIT does not have a board of directors and does not employ an investment adviser to render advice during the life of the trust.Managed AccountsA personalized account for individual investors where a professional manager selects investments designed to work toward specific goals. The investor can count on a professional to monitor the account and make appropriate changes as necessary. Typically, a simple annual fee is charged for the account, and there are no charges for individual transactions. Managed accounts tend to have the flexibility to own a broad range of assets, including stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs and other vehicles.AnnuitiesA contract between an individual and an insurance company designed to allow for tax-deferred accumulation of investment earnings. Fixed annuities come with a rate of return that is guaranteed by the claims-paying ability of the insurance company. An annuity contract can be annuitized, providing the individual with a guarantee (from the insurance company) of a fixed or variable payment at a future date.
A deferred variable annuity is a long-term financial product designed for retirement purposes. Before investing, read the prospectus carefully to consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, expenses and other important information. Early withdrawals may be a subject to surrender charges, and if taken prior to age 59 1/2, a 10% federal income tax penalty may apply. All guarantees are back by the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company. How to Get Started

Why Invest with U.S. Bank







U.S. Bank HomeInvestments and Wealth ManagementInvestment ManagementInvestment ManagementProfessionally managed options can open the investment world to you.OverviewIs It Right for Me?How to Get StartedFAQsToday's investment markets provide more opportunity than ever before, but the seemingly endless array of investment options can overwhelm individuals trying to make informed investment decisions on their own.
Financial professionals at U.S. Bank and U.S. Bancorp Investments, Inc. offer a consultative approach to investment management. An advisor works as your partner in helping you understand the options available in today’s wide-ranging investment marketplace. Your advisor builds the investment process around you, your goals and individual circumstances that affect your approach to money management and investing.
By gaining a comprehensive understanding of you as an investor, your advisor is able to create a customized investment strategy that is consistent with your goals. The centerpiece of that plan is a personalized asset allocation strategy. You can choose from a variety of professionally managed investment programs.
Here’s an overview of each phase of the investment management cycle: See more
We start by creating your personal profile. This involves analyzing your financial needs and goals, considering your current situation and investment time frame, as well as your attitudes about investment risk.
Next, we develop your asset allocation strategy. We'll work together to develop an investment strategy, based on your profile, to allocate your assets. A well-diversified portfolio may combine different types of assets to attempt to achieve specific investment goals while potentially reducing overall portfolio risk.
Then we implement your portfolio. To set your plan in motion, we'll screen and recommend a combination of investment products based on how their performance and risk characteristics align with your circumstances and goals. You can choose from a full range of investment options, including:                

Stocks, bonds and mutual funds
Fixed- and variable-rate annuities
Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and Unit Investment Trusts (UITs)
Professionally-managed portfolios

Read about financial contributions from product partners for mutual funds, fixed annuities and variable annuities.

We manage your portfolio on an ongoing basis. Working with you, we'll continuously monitor your portfolio’s performance. Modifications, including rebalancing, can be made to the portfolio based on developments in the market.
We'll review progress regularly. You'll hear from your advisor on a regular basis throughout the year. You’ll also receive regular performance reports and information alerting you to changes in your portfolio and factors that may affect your financial goals and investment strategy.
 Like a good tax advisor or an attorney, a trusted financial professional can help you stay on track – and help simplify your life. Professionally managed investment portfolios take a disciplined approach to investing, but provide the flexibility to choose your level of involvement in the investment decision-making process.
By working with financial professionals at either U.S. Bank or U.S. Bancorp Investments, Inc., you may benefit from:

Peace of mind in knowing that your investments are being managed and monitored by an experienced professional;
Investment strategies tailored to your specific goals and circumstances;
Ongoing support and monitoring of your investment progress;
The flexibility to modify your investment strategy as your needs and goals evolve; and
More time for you to spend on other aspects of your life.
To make informed decisions about your financial future, you need to understand your options. Knowledgeable professionals at U.S. Bank and U.S. Bancorp Investments, Inc. can help simplify your financial life by creating a customized plan and monitoring its progress for you. What are the strategies for successful investing?It’s important to know who you are as an investor and what you want your portfolio to accomplish. The key steps include:

Identifying specific financial goals. These may include funding a child’s higher education, your own retirement, the purchase of a home, starting a business or other goals that are important to you.
Assessing the amount of time you have to achieve each goal. Setting time frames for each of your goals is key because it can help determine how long your money can keep working for you.
Understanding your own risk tolerance. Some investors are risk takers by nature while others are very conservative, but many fall somewhere in between. Age, personality, investment experience and financial circumstance can all affect your tolerance for risk.
Determining your asset allocation – in other words, the mix of assets you want to own across various classes of investments. Diversification may help reduce your overall risk. Your asset allocation strategy should support your goals while being consistent with your risk tolerance level.
Taking the time to review your overall portfolio performance, keeping your eye on the big picture. If your portfolio begins to drift from your asset allocation strategy, you may consider rebalancing your portfolio to maintain your long-term investment strategy.
Making adjustments to your portfolio if your needs and circumstances change.
Why do I need to diversify my portfolio?A diversified portfolio spreads investment dollars out over a variety of asset classes and/or different securities. The goal of diversification is to help protect the value of your overall portfolio against a decline of price in a single security and/or a market sector. For example, some investors own a mix of stocks and bonds, with the expectation that in times when stock markets decline, bonds will perform better, helping to minimize the volatility of the overall portfolio. The different asset classes may counterbalance one another to help reduce short-term fluctuation in the portfolio. Of course, asset allocation and diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.Why is it important to focus on asset allocation as part of the investment process?Studies show that asset allocation has the single largest impact on your account’s overall performance.  According to 1990 Nobel Prize winner Harry Markowitz’s “Modern Portfolio Theory”, almost 92% of investment returns are the result of how assets are allocated among different classes, while only 2% are due to the specific stocks and bonds you choose to buy within each asset class.  Asset allocation may have a more significant affect on performance returns than industry weighting, stock selection, market timing or any other portfolio management decision.How often should I make adjustments to my asset allocation?Your asset allocation should reflect your current investment objectives, but it is also a long-term commitment. If your objectives and investment timeframe have not changed, you may not want to make adjustments to your asset mix. This is true even if short-term developments in the market are not working to your benefit. But if things have changed, the investment mix that suited you when you began investing may not be appropriate today.  Major changes in your personal life, financial situation and time horizon can all be reasons to reconsider your asset allocation strategy.What does it mean to rebalance a portfolio and why is that important?Your asset allocation strategy is based on specific objectives for investment return consistent with your acceptable level of risk. If over time the performance of certain types of assets held in your portfolio dramatically stray from expected return levels, it’s possible that you may find that you are significantly over-invested or under-invested in specific asset classes. For example, if due to strong performance, a planned 15% weighting of international stocks in your portfolio grows to a 20% weighting, you may suddenly be taking on significantly more risk by owning more international stocks than your original allocation called for. If that occurs, you may consider rebalancing assets in your portfolio to the weighting specified in your original asset allocation strategy.Is there a cost to having my investments professionally managed?Yes. Your advisor will discuss the costs involved before you decide to become a client.What products are available within these managed accounts?Depending on your specific situation, portfolios may include all types of mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), individual stocks, bonds and other securities or other types of investments available on the open market. Part of the process of working with an investment advisor is to determine which products may fit your asset allocation strategy.

Distribution Yield
The annual yield an investor would receive if the most recent fund distribution and current fund price stayed the same going forward. It’s calculated by annualizing the most recent distribution and dividing by the fund’s net asset value (NAV) from the as-of date.

as of 27-Jul-2017



3.26%




12m Trailing Yield
The yield an investor would have received if they had held the fund over the last twelve months assuming the most recent NAV. The 12-Month yield is calculated by assuming any income distributions over the past twelve months and dividing by the sum of the most recent NAV and any capital gain distributions made over the past twelve months.

Effective Duration
Effective Duration measures the sensitivity of the price of a bond with or without embedded options to changes in interest rates, taking into account the likelihood of the bond being called, put and/or sunk prior to its final maturity date while incorporating after-tax impacts on the bond. The options-based duration model used by BlackRock employs certain assumptions and may differ from other fund complexes. Effective Duration is measured at the individual bond level, aggregated to the portfolio level, and adjusted for leverage, hedging transactions and non-bond holdings, including derivatives.

Average Yield
The discount rate that equates the present value of a bond’s cash flows with its market price (including accrued interest). The Fund Average Yield is the weighted average of the fund’s individual bond holding yields based on Net Asset Value (‘NAV’). The measure does not include fees and expenses. For callable bonds, this yield is the yield-to-worst.

Credit quality ratings on underlying securities of the fund are received from S&P, Moody’s and Fitch and converted to the equivalent S&P major rating category. This breakdown is provided by BlackRock and takes the median rating of the three agencies when all three agencies rate a security the lower of the two ratings if only two agencies rate a security and one rating if that is all that is provided. Unrated securities do not necessarily indicate low quality. Below investment-grade is represented by a rating of BB and below. Ratings and portfolio credit quality may change over time.

Price Yield Calculator

 
Price Yield Calculator

The calculator provides clients with an indication of an ETF's yield and duration for a given market price. The ACF Yield is the discount rate that equates the ETF's aggregate cash flows (i.e., the sum of the cash flows of the ETF's holdings) to a given ETF price. The cash flows are based on the yield to worst methodology in which a bond's cash flows are assumed to occur at the call date (if applicable) or maturity, whichever results in the lowest yield for that bond holding. For a given ETF price, this calculator will estimate the corresponding ACF Yield and spread to the relevant government reference security yield. Note that the ACF Yield will differ from the ETF's "Weighted Avg YTM
For more information on Aggregate Cash Flow Yield, see info here.

The Aggregate Cash Flow (“ACF”) Yield is the discount rate that equates the aggregate cash flows of the ETF&#39;s individual fund holdings (specifically the cash flows corresponding to the lower of the yield to call or yield to maturity of a given security) to a stated market price. In contrast, the weighted average yield to maturity is a market value weighted average of the yields of the ETF&#39;s individual holdings based on the prior day&#39;s net asset value. The ACF Yield allows an investor to compare the yield and spread for varying ETF market prices in order to help understand the impact of intraday market movements. The ACF of the ETF is the sum of the individual bond cash flows “to worst” (i.e. either to call or to maturity, whichever results in the lowest yield for the ETF). The ACF Yield does not make any adjustments based on the cost incurred to acquire an ETF or the impact of the ETF’s management fee.

Important Information

 

Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses which may be obtained by visiting the iShares Fund and BlackRock Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.


Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.


Fixed income risks include interest-rate and credit risk. Typically, when interest rates rise, there is a corresponding decline in bond values. Credit risk refers to the possibility that the bond issuer will not be able to make principal and interest payments.


Shares of ETFs are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 p.m. Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined for most ETFs), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times.


Index returns are for illustrative purposes only. Index performance returns do not reflect any management fees, transaction costs or expenses. Indexes are unmanaged and one cannot invest directly in an index. Past performance does not guarantee future results.


After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on the investor's tax situation and may differ from those shown. The after-tax returns shown are not relevant to investors who hold their fund shares through tax-deferred arrangements such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts.

Wholesale Annuities for Independent Agents

There is a lot of confusion among consumers over annuities, and given the complexities involved in determining whether an annuity makes sense for any given person, the confusion is perfectly understandable.  At U.S. Marketing, our associates strive to provide you the information you need to help your customers make the best decision for their unique circumstances.
Understanding Annuities
The key to helping your clients decide on whether to include an annuity in their financial plan starts with helping them understand the different types of annuities. Basically, an annuity is a lump sum of cash that’s invested in order to produce a stream of monthly income, either for a fixed period or for life. This income can start immediately (an “immediate annuity”) or it can start at some point in the future (a “deferred annuity”).
Annuities are commonly chosen by clients seeking to ensure a steady stream of income in retirement and to ensure a spouse (or other designated beneficiary) will be provided for. Most annuities include the option of a death benefit, but it’s important to be sure the terms are agreeable with your client. This is where our support staff can be of immense assistance. Simply let us know what type of annuity your client is interested in and we’ll narrow the options to those most relevant.
As with any other financial planning vehicle, annuities have their pros and cons. They are not for everyone, of course, but they can add a measure of security and peace-of-mind to many client’s portfolios.
Types of Annuities

Single Premium Immediate Annuity (SPIA)
Deferred Income Annuity (DIA)
Multi-Year Guaranteed Annuity (MYGA)
Traditional Fixed Annuity
Fixed Indexed Annuity (FIA)

U.S. Marketing Corporation offers a variety of wholesale financial services to assist your clients at all stages of their lives. Included in these services are: Wholesale Life Insurance, Long-Term Care Insurance, and Disability Insurance.

Life Insurance









Wholesale Life Insurance

Types of Life Insurance
With over 30 highly regarded insurance companies on our roster, we can find virtually any kind of life insurance your clients may be seeking:  

Term Life Insurance
Whole Life Insurance
Universal Life (UL)
Guaranteed Universal Life (GUL)
Indexed Universal Life (IUL)
Variable Universal Life (VUL)
Joint Life Insurance: First-to-Die & Second-to-Die

Besides offering these policies at wholesale rates to independent agents, we can also cut through the dense language of these policies to help you understand the differences between them so you can guide your clients to the one best suited to their needs.
As we all know, life is uncertain. One of the ways society developed to cope with the predicament of a young family left without a provider is life insurance. In the event of an untimely death, a life insurance policy can be used to cover the expenses and taxes that come with the death, and—perhaps more importantly—can also provide for the children’s education, an unpaid mortgage, and other debts.
Our producers probably help more clients with life insurance than with any other financial service we offer. For young families, in particular, life insurance is almost a necessity. Unfortunately, though, sorting through the intricacies of all the different types of life insurance policies is so tedious and confusing that many just keep putting off getting a policy. This is where you, the independent broker comes in—along with the assistance of U.S. Marketing Corp.
U.S. Marketing Corp. offers a variety of wholesale financial services to assist your clients at all stages of their lives. Included in these services are: Annuities, Long-Term Care Insurance and Disability Insurance.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
