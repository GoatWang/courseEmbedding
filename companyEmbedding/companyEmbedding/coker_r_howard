                        Whitewall tires have reached iconic status on classic vehicles of the fifties and sixties, but did you know that whitewalls were optional and sometimes not optional on cars and trucks from the twenties, thirties and forties, too? Speak to a Tire Expert to find out what tires came on your car or truck from the factory, then shop online for hundreds of whitewall tires for sale in our online store. Whitewall tires are available in the diminutive pin white 3/8" stripe all the way up to the whopping 4" plus wide whitewall tires.

                        It wasn't until the 1970s that radial tires began to takeover as the dominant tire construction type for American automobiles. Before that, the classic bias ply design was used on all cars, trucks and motorcycles from the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s. The vintage look and feel of authentic bias ply tires is available today from Coker Tire Company. Our classic bias ply tires are faithfully produced in refurbished original molds or in new molds carefully engineered from original technical drawings.

Coker Tire Company is the world's leading supplier of authentic wide whitewall tires. Coker offers many popular brands of wide whitewall tires from Firestone, BF Goodrich and others featuring authentic tread patterns and sidewall styles. Narrow Whitewall Tires As cars continued getting larger with huge displacement engines, the whitewalls on their tires began to shrink. Instead the massive whitewalls of the the 1940s and 1950s, the sidewall styling morphed into more of an accent and in some cases even a white pin stripe in the 1960s and into the 1970s. Coker Tire Company offers a huge selection of narrow whitewall tires for Cadillacs, Lincolns and many passenger cars that originally wore the narrower whitewall style. Raised White Letter Tires The broad-shouldered cars of the late 1960s and early 1970s were in an arms race. Style and horsepower were just as important as reputations on the race track. In the fierce battle for sales, the muscle cars and sports cars of the era added more and more sport into their offerings. The raised white letter bias ply tires of the time have become synonymous with the cars. Such legendary marques as the Firestone Wide Oval offered by Coker Tire Company, define one of the fastest growing segments of collector cars today. Accurately restored muscle cars have been setting records at the auction block in recent years.
