					Full Description



Glowpoint, Inc., incorporated on November 4, 1996, is a provider of video collaboration and network applications. The Company provides a range of video collaboration services, from automated to orchestrated, to address the spectrum of user experience and business applications. The Company delivers its services through a hybrid service platform or as a service layer on top of its customers' video infrastructure. It offers various services, including Managed Videoconferencing, Remote Service Management, Network Services and Professional and Other Services.Video Collaboration ServicesManaged Videoconferencing is a high-touch concierge-based offering where Glowpoint sets up and manages customer videoconferences. The Company offers managed videoconferencing both as a cloud-based service, with videoconferences hosted in the Glowpoint Cloud, and as an on-premise solution leveraging the customer's existing video infrastructure. Managed videoconferencing is available globally and works across multiple networks and video devices, including desktop and mobile devices. Its managed videoconferencing services are offered to its customers on either a usage basis or on a monthly subscription. These services include Scheduling, which allows customers to schedule their videoconference using Microsoft Outlook, Cisco TelePresence Management Suite, or through Glowpoint's CustomerPoint Web portal; Call Launching, which automatically launches at the designated time, once the videoconference is scheduled. Glowpoint will bridge the videoconference by calling the selected video endpoints at the time of the scheduled call and makes sure they are properly connected; Conference Monitoring and Support, which includes Glowpoint's systems that monitor the video meeting to make sure everything remains properly connected and operable during a conference, and Conference Reports, which allows customer administrators to generate reports through its portal to show videoconference details, statistics and success rates.JoinMyVideo is an on-demand video meeting room (VMR) service that allows users to join from Web browsers, desktops, mobile applications, and commonly used videoconferencing systems. With JoinMyVideo, users are able to manage the participants in the video meeting, allowing approximately 24 participants to join the meeting. JoinMyVideo is a cloud-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) solution, so the customer has no infrastructure to buy and maintain. JoinMyVideo is offered to its customers on a monthly subscription basis. Hybrid Videoconferencing helps enterprises migrate from managed videoconferencing to VMRs by bringing together attributes of both services. Users can schedule their VMR, add endpoints, and send invitations to participants through an online portal. At the scheduled time, the VMR is launched connecting the scheduled endpoints and allowing self-service users to join from video systems and desktop and mobile video applications.Video Meeting Suites provide remote access to videoconferencing for everyday business meetings and events, allowing its customers to conduct meetings and events in over 4,000 physical meeting suites across approximately 1,300 cities without investing in video devices or infrastructure. The Company has partnered with the owners of these videoconference centers and arranged for its customers to hold videoconferences at locations across the world based on the customers' needs. Its primary service includes the scheduling and management of an orchestrated business-class meeting for a professional meeting experience. As part of the extended offering beyond the physical office suite, it also enables participants who elect to use a mobile device to join a video conference from anywhere in the world. These services are usage-based. It also offers its customers monthly subscription rates based on a fixed number of concurrent users. Webcasting events enable its customers to stream live video feeds to viewers through their browsers and mobile devices. Enterprises often use this service on a quarterly basis for earnings calls and town hall events.Remote Service ManagementThe Company's Remote Service Management provides an overlay to enterprise information technology (IT) and channel partner support organizations, and provides around the clock support and management of customer video environments. Its services are designed to align with a recognized set of practices, Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL), to standardize processes and communicate through a consistent set of terms with its customers and partners. It allows IT service management (ITSM) provider, ServiceNow Inc., to systematically provide Remote Service Management, as well as enable Glowpoint to integrate with an enterprise's systems and workflows. It offers three tiers of Service Management options, ranging from automated monitoring to end-to-end management to complement the needs of IT support organizations, including Resolve-Total Support, Helpdesk and Proactive Monitoring.The Company's Resolve-Total Support is its management and support service and targets enterprises that want to completely offload day-to-day operations of their video environment to Glowpoint. It provides around-the-clock access to its expert staff through phone and e-mail for support inquiries. It also provides incident management, problem management, change management, site certifications and service level agreements. Helpdesk provides level one support and allows enterprise IT to scale and expand the reach of support to end users. It complements the existing staff by taking the initial service request from the end users and providing incident management. It provides around-the-clock support desk and incident management. Proactive Monitoring is a remote and automated monitoring service that detects events and alerts customers' IT when a service impacting event is discovered. The service is provided in conjunction with either Resolve or Helpdesk. It provides Event Management and Automated Video Room Sweeps.Network ServicesGlowpoint's network services provide its customers around the world with network solutions that ensure traffic of video, data and Internet. Network services are offered to its customers on a monthly subscription. The Company's network services business carries variable costs associated with the purchasing and reselling of this connectivity. It offers various networking solutions that can be tailored to each customer's needs, including Video that allows its customers to outsource the management of their video traffic and provides the customer's office locations with a dedicated video network connection to the Glowpoint Cloud for video communications; Converge, which provides customized Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) solutions for customers who require a converged network. Glowpoint fully manages and prioritizes traffic to ensure that video and other business critical applications run smoothly, and Cross Connect, which allows the customer to leverage their existing carrier for the extension of a Layer 2 private line to Glowpoint's data center.Professional and Other ServicesThe Company's professional services include onsite support, or dispatch, as well as configuration or customization of equipment or software on behalf of a customer. On a limited basis, it also resells video equipment to its customers.The Company competes with BT Conferencing, AT&T, Verizon, Citrix, Yorktel, SPS, Whitlock, BCS Global, AVI-SPL, Blue Jeans Networks, Vidyo, Zoom, Cisco, LifeSize, Microsoft, Polycom, British Telecom and Telus.
