About Zan Shengda
Chinese businessman Zan Shengda has an estimated net worth of $1.6 billion as of April 2016 according to Forbes. Due to the poor sales and revenues of  Jiangsu Zongyi which is currently listed at Shanghai Stock Exchange, Zan Shengda’s wealth has declined over the past year. In the first quarter of the year, the company’s revenue was down by 41% to $92.5 million. This led to a decline in profit by 64% to $18 million. This is primarily triggered by the plunging prices of the company’s photovoltaic products.

Jiangsu Zongyi was reported to acquire a minority stake in the biggest futures company in China, the China International Futures. He also holds investments in dairy, spirits and software.
