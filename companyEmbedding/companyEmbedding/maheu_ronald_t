March 27, 2003 04:45 PM Eastern Standard Time



				ANDOVER, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 27, 2003--  

PricewaterhouseCoopers Veteran Who Has Guided Leading Technology Companies Will Strengthen Board's Leadership and Corporate GovernanceEnterasys Networks Inc. (NYSE: ETS), a global provider of Business Driven Networks(TM) for enterprise customers, today announced the addition of Ronald T. Maheu to its board of directors. Maheu, a thirty-year veteran of PricewaterhouseCoopers, has provided strategic financial guidance to technology leaders such as Raytheon, Digital Equipment Corporation and others throughout his career."This is an important addition as we continue to enhance the caliber of professionals on the Enterasys board of directors," said William K. O'Brien, chief executive officer for Enterasys Networks. "Ron Maheu has guided an impressive list of technology leaders throughout his career, and he will add tremendous value in the area of corporate governance."Maheu has decades of experience advising global technology and manufacturing companies. From 1982 to 1998, he chaired Coopers & Lybrand's U.S. Technology Industry Program. He has also served on the PricewaterhouseCoopers' Global Board of Partners & Principals and US Board of Partners & Principals.A graduate of The College of the Holy Cross with graduate degrees from Boston University and Bentley College, Maheu is a veteran of the United States Marine Corps.About Enterasys NetworksEnterasys Networks (NYSE: ETS) is a global provider of Business-Driven Networks(TM) for enterprise customers. Enterasys' innovative network infrastructure offerings deliver the security, productivity and agility benefits required by Global 2000 organizations, coupled with the industry's strongest service and support. For more information on Enterasys and its products, including multilayer switches and routers, wireless LANs, VPN, network management, and intrusion detection systems (IDS), visit enterasys.com.This press release contains projections and other forward-looking statements regarding the future revenue, cash flows and other financial performance of the Company or other future events and circumstances, and actual results, events and circumstances could differ materially. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts or guarantees of future performance, and are based on current estimates and numerous assumptions. These estimates and assumptions reflect subjective judgments concerning future events and circumstances and may be incomplete or incorrect, and unanticipated events or circumstances may occur causing these estimates and assumptions to be wrong. Risks that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those described in the projections or forward-looking statements include business disruption and market perceptions associated with the Company's internal inquiry and the Securities and Exchange Commission's investigation relating to the Company's financial reporting, economic trends associated with the recent terrorist activities experienced in the United States and general global political and economic instability, including the effects of any hostilities involving the United States in the Middle East, and any continuation or repercussions thereof or responses thereto, as well as risks associated with competitive conditions, pricing and margin pressures as a result of product shifts and changes in market dynamics, greater use of, and expenses associated with, distributors and resellers, limited management resources and recent management turnover, the Company's acquisition strategy, extension or deterioration of prevailing economic conditions, risks related to the timing, completion and results of the investigation being conducted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, volatility in the stock markets and market valuations being placed on communications infrastructure and service companies, technological changes, intellectual property protection and related issues, dependence on suppliers and contract manufacturers, and potential volatility in operating results, among others. The Company's goal of achieving breakeven cash flow from operations by the fourth quarter of 2002 and its estimate that its existing cash balance will be sufficient to meet its on-going cash needs for the foreseeable future are based on projections of, among other things, revenues, margins, costs and expenses, any of which could be adversely affected by many of the factors described above. Adverse changes in assumptions relating to revenues, margins, costs and expenses could have the effect of delaying the Company's achievement of breakeven cash flow from operations beyond 2002, if at all. For a more detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties related to the Company's business, please refer to the most recent filings of Enterasys Networks, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including Enterasys Network's annual report on Form 10-K for the ten-month transition period ended December 29, 2001.
