History[edit]




Stephen Gordon, founder of Restoration Hardware at the original Eureka, CA headquarters in 1981.


Stephen Gordon founded Restoration Hardware in Eureka, CA in 1979 while restoring a Victorian home and finding affordable, high-quality hardware and fixtures unavailable. Mr. Gordon honed his merchandising skills for ten years expanding slowly in Northern California and Boston before raising outside capital from Cardinal Investments allowing accelerated expansion.[6] The company had 47 stores when it went public in 1998, ending the year at over 65 stores and commencing a rapid expansion to over 100 stores in 31 states reaching $369.5 million in net sales[7] by 2001.

Gary Friedman joined the company from Williams-Sonoma in 2001 as Chief Executive Officer after being passed over for the CEO position at Williams-Sonoma by Howard Lester when Restoration Hardware's sales were waning and the company was seeking additional capital. In 2005, Gordon left the company in order to take over as CEO of Robert Redford's Sundance Catalog Company.[8] In 2007, Sears Holdings Corporation announced the purchase of a 13.7% share of Restoration Hardware, prompting speculation that Sears Holdings might attempt a full takeover.[9] After the bursting of the United States housing bubble, the company was slated to close two stores in 2008 including the original store located in the heart of Old Town Eureka.,[10] and open one in Canada. In June 2008, the company completed the transaction without Sears Holding, but instead with Catterton Partners.
As of June 18, 2008, the company was no longer publicly traded.[11] That year, the company also launched its baby & child line.[12] In 2012, Restoration Hardware underwent an initial public offering trading at $24 a share at its opening.[13] Restoration Hardware Holdings, Inc.'s common stock now trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol RH.[14] Upon this move the company renamed itself RH, removing the rest of the company name's letters from its official nomenclature.[15] About 65% of the company's products come from overseas, particularly from contract manufacturers in southern China.[16] The company is also the largest importer of Belgian linen and Italian bedding in the United States.[17]
RH created a small spaces line in 2012, composed of furnishings scaled down for smaller living spaces. The 2014 Small Spaces source book depicts 18 different smaller-scale homes in the United States and Europe.[18][19] In 2013, RH also released the Objects of Curiosity source book, showing character pieces, artifacts, and unique décor.[20] The tableware line was released in 2013.[20]
In 2012, the company also encountered some accusations of copying the designs of other companies, specifically those used for the US military.[21] On March 7, 2013, Restoration Hardware opened a gallery in Boston's Back Bay in an 1864 brick and brownstone structure at 234 Berkeley Street.[22][23] In May 2013, the company announced a multichannel RH contemporary art platform when it acquired the first edition of Rain Room by Random International with exclusive showing rights in North America. RH loaned Rain Room to the Museum of Modern Art in New York for the U.S. premier or EXPO 1: New York from mid-May through July 2013.[24][25] In 2014, RH opened a 70,000 square foot store which Atlanta Magazine called RH’s “next-generation full-line design gallery”, which includes amenities like a 50-foot infinite pool.[26]
Source books[edit]
Time magazine was critical of the company for its large catalog called the "Source Book" for its length (992 pages), specifically its waste of paper.[27] The full 2014 catalogue weighed 17 lbs and had over 3000 pages. The company stated that by combining all of the different sourcebooks into one package it reduced their carbon footprint, while critics still stated that the volume of paper used for the publication's mass delivery was wasteful.[28]
Design philosophy[edit]




Restoration Hardware Gallery


As of September 2010, company representatives declared a change in focus for the company.[12] In an attempt to go further "up-market", the company has focused itself on furniture gallery offerings at higher price points to distinguish itself from competitors like Pottery Barn. Locations have begun adding the term "Gallery" to their marques to indicate the change.[29] The company designs, markets, and sells its collections through its retail stores, source books, and online. The San Francisco Chronicle has reported that, "One of the key strategies that set RH apart is its approach to inventory. While most retailers design things in-house, RH created a different model. "We have one full-time designer," [its CEO] Friedman said. "We find artists we love and 'curate' [the client].""[30] The company has partnered with artisans and designers in the production of its lines.[31] Jim Cramer of CNBC stated that source books were a tactic to move past the “four walls of the web” and to make it “exciting for people to shop again”. He also stated that RH is a market disruptor, often to the point that it “disrupts itself”.[32] In a different piece, Cramer stated that the company was reinventing the concept of the brick and mortar store, including the use of very large flagship stores in unusual locations.[33]
Executives[edit]
From 2001 until his resignation in 2012 following an independent report from Weil, Gotshal & Manges into Friedman's romantic relationship with a younger female employee, Gary Friedman was the company's chairman and co-chief executive officer with Carlos Alberini, who joined as co-CEO in 2010.[34] Following his dismissal, he continued the relationship with the woman. Friedman was reappointed as co-CEO and chairman in July 2013.[35][36][37][38] The company also announced that concurrent with Mr. Friedman’s appointment, RH acquired the exclusive right to develop Hierarchy and that the new concept would be rebranded as RH Atelier, focusing on the development of luxury apparel, accessories, footwear, and jewelry.[39] In December 2013, Carlos Alberini resigned as CEO to accept a position as CEO of Lucky Brand Jeans, upon which Friedman became the Chairman and CEO of the company.[40]

Adjusted net income was $1,794,000 or $0.05 per diluted share compared to adjusted net loss of $2,066,000 or $0.05 per diluted share a year ago. Adjusted operating income was $8,276,000 compared to $710,000 a year ago. Net cash provided by operating activities was $125,055,000 compared to Net cash used in operating activities of $90,350,000 a year ago. Capital expenditures—including construction related deposits and purchase of trademarks and domain names was $13,456,000 compared to $48,991,000 a year ago.

The company guides revenue for the second quarter to a range of $595 million to $610 million, a 9% to 12% increase over last year, adjusted net income to a range of $13 million to $15 million, which would translate to adjusted diluted earnings per share in a range of $0.38 to $0.43, assuming a weighted average diluted share count of 34.5 million.

For fiscal 2017, the company is increasing its revenue guidance to a range of $2.4 billion to $2.45 billion, reflecting a more aggressive approach to rationalizing product offer, reducing inventories, and increasing free cash flow. The company is lowering adjusted net income guidance from a range of $65 million to $80 million, to a range of $60 million to $70 million, which would translate to adjusted diluted earnings per share in a range of $1.67 to $1.94, assuming a weighted average diluted share count of 36.0 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be $120 million to $140 million.

History[edit]




Stephen Gordon, founder of Restoration Hardware at the original Eureka, CA headquarters in 1981.


Stephen Gordon founded Restoration Hardware in Eureka, CA in 1979 while restoring a Victorian home and finding affordable, high-quality hardware and fixtures unavailable. Mr. Gordon honed his merchandising skills for ten years expanding slowly in Northern California and Boston before raising outside capital from Cardinal Investments allowing accelerated expansion.[6] The company had 47 stores when it went public in 1998, ending the year at over 65 stores and commencing a rapid expansion to over 100 stores in 31 states reaching $369.5 million in net sales[7] by 2001.

Gary Friedman joined the company from Williams-Sonoma in 2001 as Chief Executive Officer after being passed over for the CEO position at Williams-Sonoma by Howard Lester when Restoration Hardware's sales were waning and the company was seeking additional capital. In 2005, Gordon left the company in order to take over as CEO of Robert Redford's Sundance Catalog Company.[8] In 2007, Sears Holdings Corporation announced the purchase of a 13.7% share of Restoration Hardware, prompting speculation that Sears Holdings might attempt a full takeover.[9] After the bursting of the United States housing bubble, the company was slated to close two stores in 2008 including the original store located in the heart of Old Town Eureka.,[10] and open one in Canada. In June 2008, the company completed the transaction without Sears Holding, but instead with Catterton Partners.
As of June 18, 2008, the company was no longer publicly traded.[11] That year, the company also launched its baby & child line.[12] In 2012, Restoration Hardware underwent an initial public offering trading at $24 a share at its opening.[13] Restoration Hardware Holdings, Inc.'s common stock now trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol RH.[14] Upon this move the company renamed itself RH, removing the rest of the company name's letters from its official nomenclature.[15] About 65% of the company's products come from overseas, particularly from contract manufacturers in southern China.[16] The company is also the largest importer of Belgian linen and Italian bedding in the United States.[17]
RH created a small spaces line in 2012, composed of furnishings scaled down for smaller living spaces. The 2014 Small Spaces source book depicts 18 different smaller-scale homes in the United States and Europe.[18][19] In 2013, RH also released the Objects of Curiosity source book, showing character pieces, artifacts, and unique décor.[20] The tableware line was released in 2013.[20]
In 2012, the company also encountered some accusations of copying the designs of other companies, specifically those used for the US military.[21] On March 7, 2013, Restoration Hardware opened a gallery in Boston's Back Bay in an 1864 brick and brownstone structure at 234 Berkeley Street.[22][23] In May 2013, the company announced a multichannel RH contemporary art platform when it acquired the first edition of Rain Room by Random International with exclusive showing rights in North America. RH loaned Rain Room to the Museum of Modern Art in New York for the U.S. premier or EXPO 1: New York from mid-May through July 2013.[24][25] In 2014, RH opened a 70,000 square foot store which Atlanta Magazine called RH’s “next-generation full-line design gallery”, which includes amenities like a 50-foot infinite pool.[26]
Source books[edit]
Time magazine was critical of the company for its large catalog called the "Source Book" for its length (992 pages), specifically its waste of paper.[27] The full 2014 catalogue weighed 17 lbs and had over 3000 pages. The company stated that by combining all of the different sourcebooks into one package it reduced their carbon footprint, while critics still stated that the volume of paper used for the publication's mass delivery was wasteful.[28]
Design philosophy[edit]




Restoration Hardware Gallery


As of September 2010, company representatives declared a change in focus for the company.[12] In an attempt to go further "up-market", the company has focused itself on furniture gallery offerings at higher price points to distinguish itself from competitors like Pottery Barn. Locations have begun adding the term "Gallery" to their marques to indicate the change.[29] The company designs, markets, and sells its collections through its retail stores, source books, and online. The San Francisco Chronicle has reported that, "One of the key strategies that set RH apart is its approach to inventory. While most retailers design things in-house, RH created a different model. "We have one full-time designer," [its CEO] Friedman said. "We find artists we love and 'curate' [the client].""[30] The company has partnered with artisans and designers in the production of its lines.[31] Jim Cramer of CNBC stated that source books were a tactic to move past the “four walls of the web” and to make it “exciting for people to shop again”. He also stated that RH is a market disruptor, often to the point that it “disrupts itself”.[32] In a different piece, Cramer stated that the company was reinventing the concept of the brick and mortar store, including the use of very large flagship stores in unusual locations.[33]
Executives[edit]
From 2001 until his resignation in 2012 following an independent report from Weil, Gotshal & Manges into Friedman's romantic relationship with a younger female employee, Gary Friedman was the company's chairman and co-chief executive officer with Carlos Alberini, who joined as co-CEO in 2010.[34] Following his dismissal, he continued the relationship with the woman. Friedman was reappointed as co-CEO and chairman in July 2013.[35][36][37][38] The company also announced that concurrent with Mr. Friedman’s appointment, RH acquired the exclusive right to develop Hierarchy and that the new concept would be rebranded as RH Atelier, focusing on the development of luxury apparel, accessories, footwear, and jewelry.[39] In December 2013, Carlos Alberini resigned as CEO to accept a position as CEO of Lucky Brand Jeans, upon which Friedman became the Chairman and CEO of the company.[40]

History[edit]




Stephen Gordon, founder of Restoration Hardware at the original Eureka, CA headquarters in 1981.


Stephen Gordon founded Restoration Hardware in Eureka, CA in 1979 while restoring a Victorian home and finding affordable, high-quality hardware and fixtures unavailable. Mr. Gordon honed his merchandising skills for ten years expanding slowly in Northern California and Boston before raising outside capital from Cardinal Investments allowing accelerated expansion.[6] The company had 47 stores when it went public in 1998, ending the year at over 65 stores and commencing a rapid expansion to over 100 stores in 31 states reaching $369.5 million in net sales[7] by 2001.

Gary Friedman joined the company from Williams-Sonoma in 2001 as Chief Executive Officer after being passed over for the CEO position at Williams-Sonoma by Howard Lester when Restoration Hardware's sales were waning and the company was seeking additional capital. In 2005, Gordon left the company in order to take over as CEO of Robert Redford's Sundance Catalog Company.[8] In 2007, Sears Holdings Corporation announced the purchase of a 13.7% share of Restoration Hardware, prompting speculation that Sears Holdings might attempt a full takeover.[9] After the bursting of the United States housing bubble, the company was slated to close two stores in 2008 including the original store located in the heart of Old Town Eureka.,[10] and open one in Canada. In June 2008, the company completed the transaction without Sears Holding, but instead with Catterton Partners.
As of June 18, 2008, the company was no longer publicly traded.[11] That year, the company also launched its baby & child line.[12] In 2012, Restoration Hardware underwent an initial public offering trading at $24 a share at its opening.[13] Restoration Hardware Holdings, Inc.'s common stock now trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol RH.[14] Upon this move the company renamed itself RH, removing the rest of the company name's letters from its official nomenclature.[15] About 65% of the company's products come from overseas, particularly from contract manufacturers in southern China.[16] The company is also the largest importer of Belgian linen and Italian bedding in the United States.[17]
RH created a small spaces line in 2012, composed of furnishings scaled down for smaller living spaces. The 2014 Small Spaces source book depicts 18 different smaller-scale homes in the United States and Europe.[18][19] In 2013, RH also released the Objects of Curiosity source book, showing character pieces, artifacts, and unique décor.[20] The tableware line was released in 2013.[20]
In 2012, the company also encountered some accusations of copying the designs of other companies, specifically those used for the US military.[21] On March 7, 2013, Restoration Hardware opened a gallery in Boston's Back Bay in an 1864 brick and brownstone structure at 234 Berkeley Street.[22][23] In May 2013, the company announced a multichannel RH contemporary art platform when it acquired the first edition of Rain Room by Random International with exclusive showing rights in North America. RH loaned Rain Room to the Museum of Modern Art in New York for the U.S. premier or EXPO 1: New York from mid-May through July 2013.[24][25] In 2014, RH opened a 70,000 square foot store which Atlanta Magazine called RH’s “next-generation full-line design gallery”, which includes amenities like a 50-foot infinite pool.[26]
Source books[edit]
Time magazine was critical of the company for its large catalog called the "Source Book" for its length (992 pages), specifically its waste of paper.[27] The full 2014 catalogue weighed 17 lbs and had over 3000 pages. The company stated that by combining all of the different sourcebooks into one package it reduced their carbon footprint, while critics still stated that the volume of paper used for the publication's mass delivery was wasteful.[28]
Design philosophy[edit]




Restoration Hardware Gallery


As of September 2010, company representatives declared a change in focus for the company.[12] In an attempt to go further "up-market", the company has focused itself on furniture gallery offerings at higher price points to distinguish itself from competitors like Pottery Barn. Locations have begun adding the term "Gallery" to their marques to indicate the change.[29] The company designs, markets, and sells its collections through its retail stores, source books, and online. The San Francisco Chronicle has reported that, "One of the key strategies that set RH apart is its approach to inventory. While most retailers design things in-house, RH created a different model. "We have one full-time designer," [its CEO] Friedman said. "We find artists we love and 'curate' [the client].""[30] The company has partnered with artisans and designers in the production of its lines.[31] Jim Cramer of CNBC stated that source books were a tactic to move past the “four walls of the web” and to make it “exciting for people to shop again”. He also stated that RH is a market disruptor, often to the point that it “disrupts itself”.[32] In a different piece, Cramer stated that the company was reinventing the concept of the brick and mortar store, including the use of very large flagship stores in unusual locations.[33]
Executives[edit]
From 2001 until his resignation in 2012 following an independent report from Weil, Gotshal & Manges into Friedman's romantic relationship with a younger female employee, Gary Friedman was the company's chairman and co-chief executive officer with Carlos Alberini, who joined as co-CEO in 2010.[34] Following his dismissal, he continued the relationship with the woman. Friedman was reappointed as co-CEO and chairman in July 2013.[35][36][37][38] The company also announced that concurrent with Mr. Friedman’s appointment, RH acquired the exclusive right to develop Hierarchy and that the new concept would be rebranded as RH Atelier, focusing on the development of luxury apparel, accessories, footwear, and jewelry.[39] In December 2013, Carlos Alberini resigned as CEO to accept a position as CEO of Lucky Brand Jeans, upon which Friedman became the Chairman and CEO of the company.[40]

"We find artists we love and 'curate' [the client].""[30] The company has partnered with artisans and designers in the production of its lines.[31] Jim Cramer of CNBC stated that source books were a tactic to move past the “four walls of the web” and to make it “exciting for people to shop again”. He also stated that RH is a market disruptor, often to the point that it “disrupts itself”.[32] In a different piece, Cramer stated that the company was reinventing the concept of the brick and mortar store, including the use of very large flagship stores in unusual locations.[33]
Executives[edit]
From 2001 until his resignation in 2012 following an independent report from Weil, Gotshal & Manges into Friedman's romantic relationship with a younger female employee, Gary Friedman was the company's chairman and co-chief executive officer with Carlos Alberini, who joined as co-CEO in 2010.[34] Following his dismissal, he continued the relationship with the woman. Friedman was reappointed as co-CEO and chairman in July 2013.[35][36][37][38] The company also announced that concurrent with Mr. Friedman’s appointment, RH acquired the exclusive right to develop Hierarchy and that the new concept would be rebranded as RH Atelier, focusing on the development of luxury apparel, accessories, footwear, and jewelry.[39] In December 2013, Carlos Alberini resigned as CEO to accept a position as CEO of Lucky Brand Jeans, upon which Friedman became the Chairman and CEO of the company.[40]

History[edit]




Stephen Gordon, founder of Restoration Hardware at the original Eureka, CA headquarters in 1981.


Stephen Gordon founded Restoration Hardware in Eureka, CA in 1979 while restoring a Victorian home and finding affordable, high-quality hardware and fixtures unavailable. Mr. Gordon honed his merchandising skills for ten years expanding slowly in Northern California and Boston before raising outside capital from Cardinal Investments allowing accelerated expansion.[6] The company had 47 stores when it went public in 1998, ending the year at over 65 stores and commencing a rapid expansion to over 100 stores in 31 states reaching $369.5 million in net sales[7] by 2001.

Gary Friedman joined the company from Williams-Sonoma in 2001 as Chief Executive Officer after being passed over for the CEO position at Williams-Sonoma by Howard Lester when Restoration Hardware's sales were waning and the company was seeking additional capital. In 2005, Gordon left the company in order to take over as CEO of Robert Redford's Sundance Catalog Company.[8] In 2007, Sears Holdings Corporation announced the purchase of a 13.7% share of Restoration Hardware, prompting speculation that Sears Holdings might attempt a full takeover.[9] After the bursting of the United States housing bubble, the company was slated to close two stores in 2008 including the original store located in the heart of Old Town Eureka.,[10] and open one in Canada. In June 2008, the company completed the transaction without Sears Holding, but instead with Catterton Partners.
As of June 18, 2008, the company was no longer publicly traded.[11] That year, the company also launched its baby & child line.[12] In 2012, Restoration Hardware underwent an initial public offering trading at $24 a share at its opening.[13] Restoration Hardware Holdings, Inc.'s common stock now trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol RH.[14] Upon this move the company renamed itself RH, removing the rest of the company name's letters from its official nomenclature.[15] About 65% of the company's products come from overseas, particularly from contract manufacturers in southern China.[16] The company is also the largest importer of Belgian linen and Italian bedding in the United States.[17]
RH created a small spaces line in 2012, composed of furnishings scaled down for smaller living spaces. The 2014 Small Spaces source book depicts 18 different smaller-scale homes in the United States and Europe.[18][19] In 2013, RH also released the Objects of Curiosity source book, showing character pieces, artifacts, and unique décor.[20] The tableware line was released in 2013.[20]
In 2012, the company also encountered some accusations of copying the designs of other companies, specifically those used for the US military.[21] On March 7, 2013, Restoration Hardware opened a gallery in Boston's Back Bay in an 1864 brick and brownstone structure at 234 Berkeley Street.[22][23] In May 2013, the company announced a multichannel RH contemporary art platform when it acquired the first edition of Rain Room by Random International with exclusive showing rights in North America. RH loaned Rain Room to the Museum of Modern Art in New York for the U.S. premier or EXPO 1: New York from mid-May through July 2013.[24][25] In 2014, RH opened a 70,000 square foot store which Atlanta Magazine called RH’s “next-generation full-line design gallery”, which includes amenities like a 50-foot infinite pool.[26]
Source books[edit]
Time magazine was critical of the company for its large catalog called the "Source Book" for its length (992 pages), specifically its waste of paper.[27] The full 2014 catalogue weighed 17 lbs and had over 3000 pages. The company stated that by combining all of the different sourcebooks into one package it reduced their carbon footprint, while critics still stated that the volume of paper used for the publication's mass delivery was wasteful.[28]
Design philosophy[edit]




Restoration Hardware Gallery


As of September 2010, company representatives declared a change in focus for the company.[12] In an attempt to go further "up-market", the company has focused itself on furniture gallery offerings at higher price points to distinguish itself from competitors like Pottery Barn. Locations have begun adding the term "Gallery" to their marques to indicate the change.[29] The company designs, markets, and sells its collections through its retail stores, source books, and online. The San Francisco Chronicle has reported that, "One of the key strategies that set RH apart is its approach to inventory. While most retailers design things in-house, RH created a different model. "We have one full-time designer," [its CEO] Friedman said. "We find artists we love and 'curate' [the client].""[30] The company has partnered with artisans and designers in the production of its lines.[31] Jim Cramer of CNBC stated that source books were a tactic to move past the “four walls of the web” and to make it “exciting for people to shop again”. He also stated that RH is a market disruptor, often to the point that it “disrupts itself”.[32] In a different piece, Cramer stated that the company was reinventing the concept of the brick and mortar store, including the use of very large flagship stores in unusual locations.[33]
Executives[edit]
From 2001 until his resignation in 2012 following an independent report from Weil, Gotshal & Manges into Friedman's romantic relationship with a younger female employee, Gary Friedman was the company's chairman and co-chief executive officer with Carlos Alberini, who joined as co-CEO in 2010.[34] Following his dismissal, he continued the relationship with the woman. Friedman was reappointed as co-CEO and chairman in July 2013.[35][36][37][38] The company also announced that concurrent with Mr. Friedman’s appointment, RH acquired the exclusive right to develop Hierarchy and that the new concept would be rebranded as RH Atelier, focusing on the development of luxury apparel, accessories, footwear, and jewelry.[39] In December 2013, Carlos Alberini resigned as CEO to accept a position as CEO of Lucky Brand Jeans, upon which Friedman became the Chairman and CEO of the company.[40]

Zacks Rank:



                                                 3-Hold     3     




Style Scores:



C Value | A Growth | A Momentum | A VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
