UnitedHealth 2Q profit surges as ACA participation shrinks

    By Associated Press
     | 
    July 19, 2017
    
UnitedHealth Group's second-quarter earnings soared as the nation's largest insurer dove deeper into government-funded health coverage like Medicare and Medicaid and continued to distance itself from the turbulent Affordable Care Act insurance exchanges.The insurer also said Tuesday that it drew $1.52 billion in operating earnings from its rapidly growing Optum business, which doesn't sell health insurance.





Private Plans
Unsure of the future, states guess their way through 2018 rate filing season

State regulators and insurers are in the homestretch of preparing rates for 2018. The federal government's month-by-month approach, however, to cost-sharing reduction payments creates a risky situation for payers, providers and consumers.





Self-Insured Plans
Judge blocks Anthem-Cigna merger 

A federal judge blocked the proposed $54 billion tie-up between national insurers Anthem and Cigna late Wednesday, saying the combination would harm competition in the national employer market.





Uninsured
Cardiac arrest incidence in Oregon dropped after Medicaid expansion
After Oregon expanded its Medicaid program in 2014, cardiac arrests significantly dropped among newly covered residents in one county, according to a new study.





Premiums & Benefits
Two health insurers expand Obamacare presence while others retreat
While some health insurers are bailing on the Affordable Care Act exchanges, other are swooping in to take the business they leave behind.





Health Insurance Exchanges
Aetna slapped with shareholder lawsuit over ACA exchange exits
Shareholders allege that national health insurer Aetna's decision to exit exchanges in 11 states in 2017 under false pretenses hurt their investment and the company's bottom line.

Patricia Hemingway Hall


PRESIDENT, CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER  HEALTH CARE SERVICE CORP.
While working for Blue Cross in Texas in the mid-'90s, Patricia Hemingway Hall would drive 60 miles from her Dallas office to meet in a motel conference room to haggle over reimbursement rates with an executive from a small rural hospital.
"Pat was tough but always willing to find common ground," says Ray Thompson, CEO of Mother Frances Hospital in Tyler, Texas, and Ms. Hemingway Hall's foe in those weeks-long talks. "She's got an uncommon empathy for the person on the other side of the table."
That trait  one she attributes to her time as an intensive care nurse in the 1970s  will prove valuable this fall, when she becomes CEO of the parent company of Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Illinois. Running the state's largest health insurance company will require negotiating delicate relationships with doctors and hospitals pushing for higher payment rates for procedures and employers seeking relief from years of escalating premiums.
Ms. Hemingway Hall, 55, also will inherit Texas-sized ambitions at the nation's fourth-largest health insurer. Under a plan forged by longtime CEO Raymond McCaskey, who plans to retire, the Chicago-based company wants to boost its membership from 12 million enrollees to 20 million by 2010.
"We've had phenomenal internal growth, but we'll also be looking at the possibility of consolidations with other Blues plans," says Ms. Hemingway Hall, tapped in November as Mr. McCaskey's successor.
While president of Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Texas from 2001 to 2006, she boosted membership by 24% and repaired its poor reputation among doctors by establishing a physician-advocacy office that sped up payments and dispatched managers to doctors' offices to resolve disputes.
Ms. Hemingway Hall also will oversee a new strategy Health Care Service Corp. announced in March emphasizing wellness rather than just treatment across its four health plans. It's now offering employers coverage that includes incentives such as giving cash or gift cards to employees who improved their health by taking steps such as quitting smoking or losing weight. These wellness plans, which aim to reduce premiums by preventing disease, are expected to become a major area of growth for insurance companies.

From her early career as an intensive care nurse to president and CEO of Health Care Service Corporation (HCSC), Patricia Hemingway Hall has been dedicated to helping people with their health care needs. With continual attention to how decisions affect nearly 14.7 million members, she now leads and guides the nation’s largest non-investor-owned health insurance company, which operates as Blue Cross and Blue Shield in Illinois, Montana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas.
HCSC — the fourth largest health insurer overall — also operates Dearborn National, TMG Health, MEDecision and Academic Health Plans. HCSC has more than 22,000 employees.
Hemingway Hall remains committed to helping ensure that all Americans have access to quality, affordable health care and to strengthening those qualities that make our system the best in the world — choice, innovation and competition. To support that commitment, she oversees a corporate strategy focused on growing the company’s employer group, government programs (Medicare and Medicaid) and individual market business, which includes participating on the new health insurance exchanges in every state where HCSC does business.
Hemingway Hall has received a number of recognitions for her leadership in the health care industry, most recently being ranked No. 4 on the Crain’s Chicago Business “20 Most Powerful Women in Chicago Business” list in 2014. Other honors include being named to Modern Healthcare magazine’s “Top 25 Women in Healthcare” biennial list in 2013, Crain’s “Power 50” list in 2012 and Modern Healthcare’s “100 Most Influential People in Healthcare” list numerous times.
Since becoming CEO in 2008, she has grown HCSC by more than 2 million members, built its technology infrastructure to an industry-leading standard, focused resources on creating an unrivaled customer service experience for members and increased the company’s investments in its local communities. One such investment is a program called “Healthy Kids, Healthy Families,” which has helped improve the health of more than 13 million children since it began in 2011.
In addition, through its Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, HCSC founded and continues to operate the often-imitated Care Van mobile health program, which provided more than 170,000 free immunizations and other health services combined to children and adults at risk in 2014.
Previously, Hemingway Hall served as president of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas and as president and chief operating officer of HCSC.
Hemingway Hall serves on the boards for the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, America’s Health Insurance Plans, Health Care Leadership Council, Manpower Group, Cardinal Health and National Institute for Health Care Management. She is also an executive advisor for the Chicago Metropolitan Planning Council and is a member of World Business Chicago, the board of the Economic Club of Chicago and Chicago Advisory Board of the Salvation Army. Hemingway Hall is immediate past chair of Chicago United. She also is a Leadership Fellow of the National Association of Corporate Directors.
Hemingway Hall once held elective office, serving two terms on the town council of Oak Point, Texas. She earned a master’s in public health, health planning and administration from the University of Michigan and a Bachelor of Science in nursing from Michigan State University.

Hemingway Hall to retire as CEO of Health Care Service Corp.

Patricia Hemingway Hall, president and CEO of Health Care Service Corp., will retire at the end of the year. She has led HCSC, the Blue Cross and Blue Shield insurer for five states, since 2008, and has been with the behemoth for 23 years.HCSC named Paula Steiner as president, effective immediately, and as the next CEO starting Jan. 1. Steiner, 58, HCSC's chief strategy officer, has been with the organization since 1997, and will be tasked with leading the insurer through an era of increased consolidation and changing business models. Hemingway Hall, 62, has been considered one of the most powerful people in the healthcare industry because of the size and influence of Chicago-based HCSC. It is the largest not-for-profit health insurer in the country, selling Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans in Illinois and Texas, as well as Montana, New Mexico and Oklahoma. Hemingway Hall, a former nurse, previously was the CEO of the Texas Blues brand.“All of us at HCSC have made history in changing America's healthcare system and improving the lives of millions,” Hemingway Hall said in a statement. “During my tenure, we have made significant investments in our future, and we remain well-positioned to continue expanding access for coverage for as many people as possible in our states.”Hemingway Hall was not available for an interview Thursday.Nationally, she has caught the attention of policymakers. The Obama administration called on Hemingway Hall and 13 other health-insurance industry heavyweights in October of 2013 to help fix the bungled rollout of the federal exchange website, HealthCare.gov.Under her leadership, HCSC was also one of the founding members of the Health Care Transformation Task Force, a private-sector coalition of providers, insurers, employers and patients that launched this year. The group's members have made a commitment to tie 75% of their business to contracts that move the healthcare system toward a model that rewards better outcomes and lower costs, and moves it away from the current system model that simply pays for every service.Similar to other Blue Cross and Blue Shield licensees across the country, HCSC predominantly provides health insurance for employers. The company offers full-risk plans, as well as administrative contracts for larger self-insured employers. Hemingway Hall led HCSC's foray into the public insurance exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act and rolled out in 2014. But the first year of the exchanges did not go well. HCSC lost $282 million overall last year largely because of its exchange membership. The company's Texas subsidiary lost almost $400 million on individual policies in 2014, while the Illinois Blues lost $280 million in the same market. Hospital and medical claims greatly outpaced premium revenue.Overall, HCSC's membership grew to about 16 million Americans during Hemingway Hall's tenure. She oversaw the acquisition of the Montana Blues plan in 2013, as well as other smaller deals. But Hemingway Hall has been criticized for her large paychecks, which have been comparable to her for-profit peers. She made $16 million in total compensation in 2012 and $11.2 million in 2013.When Steiner takes over next year, HCSC could be sitting in a commercial market dominated by three insurers. Aetna and Anthem expect to close on their acquisitions of Humana and Cigna Corp., respectively, later next year. Each company will see about $115 billion in annual revenue, trailing industry leader UnitedHealth Group, which has about $154 billion in projected revenue for the year. HCSC had $28 billion in revenue in 2014, putting it well behind the other three insurance titans. It would also be trailing Centene Corp., which will have about $37 billion in revenue if its acquisition of Health Net goes through. But not-for-profit Blue Cross and Blue Shield carriers such as HCSC still wield considerable power in their respective markets, analysts say. Their brand names attract employers and individual consumers, which makes them essential payers for hospitals, doctors and other providers.“I think for these large single-state players, it's going to take awhile before they are unseated because of how local a lot of healthcare is,” said Stuart Gunn, a managing director at financial services firm Houlihan Lokey. Gunn added that HCSC could become an “Anthem Jr.” if it picks up more state Blues plans. Anthem is the largest licensee of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association.

"From a strategic perspective, diversity among our employees and board of directors is a major priority for HCSC. To help as many people as possible find quality, affordable health care we must reach out to a more diverse population than ever before. That requires insights and strategies that can come only from a board and workforce that is equally diverse."
 
Patricia Hemingway Hall
            President and Chief Executive Officer
            Health Care Service Corporation

Patricia Hemingway Hall is president and chief executive officer of Health Care Service Corporation (HCSC), the nation’s largest non-investor-owned health insurer and fourth largest overall. HCSC operates the Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans in Illinois, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas; serves more than 13 million members; and has more than 16,000 employees. HCSC also operates Dearborn National, which includes Fort Dearborn Life Insurance Company, Fort Dearborn Life Insurance Company of New York, Colorado Bankers Life Insurance Company and Dental Network of America.
Ms. Hemingway Hall has received a number of recognitions for her leadership in the health care industry, including being named one of the “100 Most Influential People in Healthcare” in 2011 by Modern Healthcare magazine, the YWCA’s 2011 “Outstanding Leader in Business,” one of the “Seven People to Watch” in 2011 by the Chicago Tribune, one of the “Women to Watch” in 2011 by Crain’s Chicago Business and one of the “100 Most Powerful People in Healthcare.”
Ms. Hemingway Hall began her career as an ICU nurse, which significantly shaped the way she views how the health care system should work — that it should provide appropriate care in a financially sound manner that enables continued innovation and improvement. Taking the lessons learned firsthand in working with patients, she applied them in subsequent leadership roles in utilization and care management, human resources, and as chief operating officer and then president of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas, where she was responsible for sales and marketing for all customer segments, product development, medical policy, disease management, network development, acquisitions, and government and legislative relations.
HCSC has a long legacy of recognizing the value of diversity and inclusion. HCSC’s commitment is visible at every level of the business. Ms. Hemingway Hall continues to maintain an inclusive and culturally competent workforce, leverage the diverse skills and worldviews of all employees, and ensure that diversity is integrated into corporate strategies to provide affordable and accessible health care solutions. The health care industry is arguably being impacted more than other industries by demographic shifts and legislation to address the disparities in health care in ethnically diverse communities. Addressing these issues requires the engagement of a diverse group of stakeholders to be responsive to the marketplace and achieve sustainable growth.
Looking toward the future of health care, Ms. Hemingway Hall has focused the company’s efforts on leveraging technology and developing an IT infrastructure that will be able to deliver unparalleled health data for consumers, employers, and health care providers, with the goal of transparency, ease, and efficiency, so that members’ health care can be optimized and unnecessary spending minimized.
Ms. Hemingway Hall received a master’s degree in public health, health planning, and administration from the University of Michigan and a bachelor’s degree in nursing from Michigan State University.
