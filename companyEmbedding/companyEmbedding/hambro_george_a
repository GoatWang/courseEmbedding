    (Chip) A. Hambro

 

    On May 30, 2001, we entered into an employment agreement
    with Mr. George (Chip) A. Hambro, our chief
    operating officer, which was amended on February 5, 2003.
    Under the terms of his employment agreement, Mr. Hambro is
    entitled to a minimum annual base salary of $175,000 (subject to
    annual review) and is eligible to receive a bonus equal to 20%
    to 40% of his base salary based on individual and Company
    performance. Effective January 2, 2006,
    Mr. Hambros annual salary was increased to $300,000,
    and the compensation committee awarded Mr. Hambro with a
    bonus with respect to the 2006 fiscal year in the amount of
    $150,000, or 50% of his base salary. Mr. Hambro receives
    standard welfare benefits and is entitled to four weeks of
    vacation. Our employment agreement with Mr. Hambro provides
    that, in the event Mr. Hambros employment is
    terminated by us without cause or due to his disability (as
    defined in the employment agreement), Mr. Hambro will
    receive the following: (a) severance pay in the amount of
    his highest base salary for a period of 24 months following
    the termination of his employment (less any amounts earned by
    Mr. Hambro through self-employment or subsequent
    employment), (b) a lump sum payment of $300,000 and
    (c) payment of any earned and unused (and unforfeited)
    vacation. Mr. Hambro must sign a release in order to
    receive severance payments.

 

    Under the terms of his option award agreements with respect to
    his 960,300 options granted under the 2003 Plan, such options,
    to the extent unvested, will vest upon a termination by us
    without cause, a termination by Mr. Hambro for good reason
    (as defined below) or due to death or disability (as defined in
    the 2003 Plan). The term good reason for purposes of
    Mr. Hambros option award agreement means, without his
    prior written consent, (a) a material reduction in his
    duties and responsibilities in his role as an associate or
    (b) any required relocation of his office to a location
    more than 50 miles from the location on the grant date.

 

    Under the terms of the employment agreement, Mr. Hambro has
    agreed not to disclose any confidential information concerning
    our business, including without limitation our confidential
    designs and processes. In addition, Mr. Hambro has agreed
    not to compete with the Company or solicit or hire any Company
    associates during the three year period following the
    termination of his employment.

 

    Mr. Hambro has also entered into a separate CIC Agreement
    with the Company, the terms of which are described in
     Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change
    of Control  Potential Payments upon a Change of
    Control  Change in control severance agreements.
