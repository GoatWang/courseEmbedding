Assumptions

Assumptions in the calculation include:
Annual rate of return during accumulation = 7%
Annual rate of return during retirement = 4%
Annual rate of inflation during all years = 3%
Annual contributions set to 15% of salary for initial calculation, or 0 if current age is at or above retirement age
Life expectancy = 87 or current age plus 10, whichever is greater
Contributions made once per year at the end of the year
Retirement income distributions taken once per year at the beginning of the year and divided by 12 to display as monthly income
Retirement income will be $0/month if you enter a retirement age that is at or above the assumed life expectancy
The calculator provides an illustration of mathematical principles using the information that you provided along with the assumptions listed above.  Taxes, early withdrawals fees, charges, or any 
other factors not included in these assumptions are not considered.  The calculator is not intended to provide investment advice and does not predict the performance of any investment or investment 
strategy.  Results are hypothetical,  actual results will vary from the illustration.  Bear in mind, investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal.

<R>
February 25, 2002
</R>
Dear Participant:
<R>
Thank you for choosing to invest with us. As you know from the recent proxy mailed to you, American General Corporation and its subsidiaries, including The Variable Annuity Life Insurance Company ("VALIC"), the adviser to VALIC Company II, were acquired by American International Group, Inc. on August 29, 2001. This acquisition automatically terminated the investment advisory and sub-advisory agreements for the VALIC Company II Funds (the "Funds" and each a "Fund"), causing VALIC to begin a thorough review of Fund offerings and sub-advisers. Further, due to new federal laws concerning mutual fund names, VALIC reviewed each Fund's investment objective and strategy to ensure compliance with the new federal laws.
</R>

<R>
As a result of this review, VALIC recommended, and the VALIC Company II Board of Trustees approved, a portfolio sub-adviser change for the Small Cap Growth Fund, formerly known as North American - J.P. Morgan Small Cap Growth Fund.  Effective January 1, 2002, Franklin Advisers, Inc. is the new sub-adviser for the Small Cap Growth Fund.  Prior to January 1, 2002, J.P. Morgan Investment Management, Inc. was the sub-adviser for the Small Cap Growth Fund.  In addition, the Small Cap Growth Fund's investment strategy and objective have changed, as discussed in the attached Information Statement.  We are sending this Information Statement to you because our records show the Small Cap Growth Fund as one of your variable annuity investment options as of January 2, 2002.
</R>

<R>
Please feel free to call us at 1-800-448-2542 should you have any questions on the enclosed Information Statement. We thank you for your continued support and investments.
</R>
Sincerely,

/s/ Robert P. Condon
Robert P. Condon
President
VALIC Company II
Information Statement

VALIC Company II
(previously known as North American Funds Variable Product Series II)

SMALL CAP GROWTH Fund

2929 Allen Parkway
Houston, Texas 77019
<R>
Introduction
This Information Statement relates to the sub-adviser (portfolio manager) for the Small Cap Growth Fund, formerly known as North American - J.P. Morgan Small Cap Growth Fund, (the "Fund") of VALIC Company II ("VC II"). The sub-adviser from the Fund's inception on September 21, 1998 through December 31, 2001 was J.P. Morgan Investment Management, Inc. ("J.P. Morgan"). As a result of  the acquisition of American General Corporation ("American General") and its subsidiaries, including The Variable Annuity Life Insurance Company ("VALIC" or the "Adviser"), the adviser to VC II, by American International Group, Inc. ("AIG") on August 29, 2001, VALIC reviewed  the
Fund's relationship with the sub-adviser.
</R>

<R>
Based on its review, VALIC recommended to the Fund's Board of Trustees (the "Board") that Franklin Advisers, Inc. ("Franklin") should become the Fund's new sub-adviser. This sub-advisory change was approved by the Board on October 23, 2001.  The Board also approved a new Investment Sub-Advisory Agreement (the "Franklin Sub-Advisory Agreement") for the Fund, between VALIC and Franklin. The Franklin Sub-Advisory Agreement is the same in all material respects to the J.P. Morgan Investment Sub-Advisory Agreement with the former sub-adviser (the "J.P. Morgan Sub-Advisory Agreement"), dated August 29, 2001, in effect between VALIC and J.P. Morgan, except for the name of the sub-adviser, effective date and term.
</R>

<R>
The Fund has received an exemptive order from the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") which allows VALIC, subject to certain conditions, to select new sub-advisers or replace existing sub-advisers without obtaining shareholder approval of the change. The Board, including a majority of those trustees who are not parties to a sub-advisory agreement or interested persons of any such party ("Independent Trustees"), as defined by the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, (the "1940 Act"), must first approve each sub-advisory agreement. This allows VALIC to act more quickly to change sub-advisers when it determines that a change is beneficial to shareholders. Within 90 days of such a change, the Fund will provide information to shareholders about the new sub-adviser and its agreement. This information statement is being provided to you to satisfy this requirement. This statement is being mailed on or about February
25, 2002 to all participants in annuity contracts ("Contract") who chose the Fund as a variable investment option prior to January 2, 2002 (the "Record Date").
</R>

WE ARE NOT ASKING YOU FOR A PROXY AND YOU ARE REQUESTED NOT TO SEND US A�PROXY.

<R>
The Adviser and its Responsibilities
VALIC is an investment adviser registered with the SEC.  VALIC is located at 2929 Allen Parkway, Houston, Texas 77019. It is engaged in the business of rendering investment advisory and management services to various investment companies. VC II has contracted with VALIC to furnish these services to the Fund and VALIC is paid an annual management fee, based on the Fund's average daily net assets. Accordingly, VALIC provides ongoing management supervision and policy direction to the Fund.
</R>
At its own expense, VALIC may designate a sub-adviser to manage the investments of the Fund. The sub-adviser makes investment decisions for the Fund according to the Fund's investment objective and restrictions.  Subject to the oversight of VALIC, the sub-adviser evaluates pertinent economic, statistical, financial and other data in order to determine the optimal portfolio holdings to meet the Fund objectives and performance benchmark.


As the Adviser to the Fund, VALIC monitors each sub-adviser and compares Fund performance with relevant market indices and peer groups. VALIC watches for corporate actions and examines each sub-adviser's compliance with VALIC and fund policies. VALIC regularly provides written reports to the Board describing the results of its evaluation and oversight functions. In addition, VALIC looks to develop stronger relationships with fewer investment firms that can ultimately benefit all the fund shareholders through greater marketing and service support.  As a result of this extensive evaluation, VALIC recommended that the Board appoint Franklin as the new sub-adviser to the Fund.  Franklin supplied its information about its sub-advisory team and its investment philosophy to the Board for review, along with other important documentation.
<R>
The Sub-Advisory Agreements
As noted above, the J.P. Morgan and Franklin Sub-Advisory Agreements are the same in all material respects.  J.P. Morgan and Franklin are hereinafter referred to as the "Sub-Adviser".  In each agreement, the Sub-Adviser agrees to provide an investment program for the Fund and is responsible for the investment and reinvestment of the Fund's assets. The Sub-Adviser has broad latitude in selecting securities for the Fund, subject to VALIC's oversight. The Sub-Adviser may place trades through brokers of its choosing and will take into consideration the quality of the brokers' services and execution, as well as services such as research and providing equipment or paying any Fund expenses, in setting the amount of commissions paid to a broker. For these services, VALIC pays a sub-advisory fee, based on the average daily net assets of the Fund, consisting of a monthly fee computed at the annual rate of 0.60%.  The sub-advisory fee rates are the
same under both the J.P. Morgan and the Franklin Sub-Advisory Agreements.
</R>

Both Sub-Advisory Agreements provide that the Sub-Adviser shall not be subject to liability to VALIC, the Fund, or to any shareholder of the Fund for any act or omission in rendering services under the Sub-Advisory Agreement, or for any losses sustained in the purchase, holding, or sale of any portfolio security, as long as there has been no willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, or reckless disregard of the Sub-Adviser's obligations or duties. Each Sub-Advisory Agreement provides for automatic termination unless at least annually, its continuance is approved by (i) the Board or the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Fund, and (ii) the Independent Trustees. Each Sub-Advisory Agreement terminates automatically upon its assignment and is terminable at any time, without penalty, by the Board, VALIC, or the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Fund, upon 30 to 60 days written notice.
If you would like a copy of the Franklin Sub-Advisory Agreement, please write to Nori L. Gabert, Esq., Vice President and Secretary of VALIC Company II, 2929 Allen Parkway, Houston, Texas 77019.
Effective and Termination Dates: The J.P. Morgan Sub-Advisory Agreement was executed on August 29, 2001, upon the acquisition of American General by AIG. The J.P. Morgan Sub-Advisory Agreement had an initial two-year term, subject to annual review thereafter. The Franklin Sub-Advisory Agreement was unanimously approved by the Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, on October 23, 2001. The effective date was January 1, 2002, and the Agreement will be reviewed again in 2003.

Board Considerations
In connection with its review and approval of the Franklin Sub-Advisory Agreement, the Board reviewed materials furnished regarding Franklin and its sub-advisory responsibilities, including information on the investment fees and performance of the Fund and a comparative peer group. The Board also received sales and redemption data and VALIC's general economic outlook. The Board reviewed information regarding the investment processes of Franklin and considered the historical performance it achieved in connection with similar funds.  Furthermore, the Board considered the performance of the Fund, noting that for the past year it has lagged its benchmark and its peers.

�
�
<R>
The Board reviewed the duties of the Sub-Adviser, including the formulation and implementation of investment programs, the evaluation of Fund investments, and the use of soft dollars and directed brokerage (see below), and relationship management. The Board was also informed about the resources devoted to compliance management and the non-investment management services provided. The Board determined that the sub-advisory fees are fair and reasonable in light of the services to be provided and concluded that the Franklin Sub-Advisory Agreement is in the best interests of the Fund and its shareholders. In reviewing the proposed change in Sub-Adviser, the Board considered these factors, among others, as discussed below.
</R>

<R>
In connection with its approval of the Franklin Sub-Advisory Agreement, the Board considered that the recommendation did not involve any material changes in the overall form of the Sub-Advisory Agreement, and observed that the fees remained the same. As part of their deliberations, the Board took into account the following, among other factors: the nature and quality of the services provided or reasonably anticipated to be provided and the results achieved or reasonably anticipated to be achieved by Franklin; the amount and structure of investment sub-advisers' fees generally and the fees payable under the Franklin Sub-Advisory Agreement; the management, personnel and operations of Franklin; and the commitment of Franklin to the financial services industry. The Board considered that effective January 1, 2002, the investment objective of the Fund would be changed to seeking long-term capital growth from
long-term growth of capital from a portfolio of equity securities of small capitalization growth companies.  Additionally, pursuant to new federal laws concerning mutual fund names, the Fund's investment strategy changed from 65% of total assets to 80% of net assets being invested in equity securities of small capitalization companies.
</R>

The Board also considered that the terms of the Franklin Sub-Advisory Agreement are the same in all material respects as those of the J.P. Morgan Sub-Advisory Agreement. The Board, including all of the Independent Trustees, determined that the terms of the Franklin Sub-Advisory Agreement are fair and reasonable and that the approval of the Franklin Sub-Advisory Agreement is necessary and in the best interests of the Fund, on behalf of its shareholders, to ensure the continued receipt of the same quality of services as is currently provided.

Information about Franklin

<R>
Brokerage Selection Practices
VALIC has provided the following information to the Board about the Fund's brokerage selection practices, including soft dollars, directed brokerage, and transactions with affiliated brokers. These are important practices  which are subject to extensive regulation under the federal securities laws. VALIC reviewed these practices and evaluated any conflicts of interest inherent in the Sub-Adviser's policies and practices. Soft dollars: The term "soft dollars" is often used to describe that part of the basic trade commission which exceeds the lowest rate available from other broker-dealers and which is used by the adviser to obtain research and other services from broker-dealers. Soft dollars have not been used to offset expenses of the Fund. Directed brokerage: A directed brokerage agreement includes those arrangements under which products or services (other than execution of securities transactions), expense reimbursements,
or commissions are recaptured for a client from or through a broker-dealer, in exchange for directing the client's brokerage transactions to that broker-dealer. The Board has determined that a directed brokerage arrangement with State Street Brokerage, Lynch Jones and Ryan, and/or any other comparable broker-dealer is in the best interest of each Fund and its shareholders and therefore has conveyed the information to sub-advisers. The Fund may participate in directed brokerage arrangements, provided the portfolio manager can still obtain the best price and execution for trades. Directed brokerage arrangements are generally subject to a maximum of 20% of a Fund's eligible commissions. Thus, the  Fund may benefit from the products or services or recaptured commissions obtained through the directed brokerage arrangement, although there may be other transaction costs, greater spreads, or less favorable net prices on transactions. As long as the trader executing the transaction
for the  Fund indicates that this is a directed brokerage transaction, the Fund will get a percentage of commissions paid on either domestic trades or international trades credited back to the Fund. These credits are in hard dollars and could be used to offset the Fund's custody expenses or to pay other Fund expenses (excluding expenses payable to affiliates). By entering into a brokerage/service arrangement, the  Fund can reduce expenses reported to shareholders in its statement of operations, fee table and expense ratio and can increase its reported yield. Any such transactions will be disclosed in the registration statement for the Fund. Transactions with affiliated brokers:  Franklin does not typically participate in transactions with affiliated brokers.
</R>
The Fund paid brokerage commissions of $459 in brokerage commissions on transactions totaling $27,969, or 1.6% of aggregate brokerage commissions, to Archipelago Holdings, LLC, an affiliated broker of J.P. Morgan during the past fiscal year.
Other Service Agreements
VC II has service agreements with VALIC, or an affiliate, to provide accounting and administrative services to the Fund and to provide transfer agent services.  Transfer agent services also include shareholder servicing and dividend disbursements.  For the fiscal year ended August 31, 2001, the Fund paid VALIC the following amounts pursuant to such agreements:  $12,304 for accounting fees, $70,196 for administrative services fees and $250 for transfer agency fees.

North American Funds Variable Product Series II
Q&A
Q.	Why am I receiving this proxy?
A.	This proxy has been mailed to you so that you may vote on several proposals concerning your investment in the North American Funds Variable Product Series II ("NAFV II"). Although you are not directly a shareholder of any Fund in NAFV II, as an owner of a variable annuity contract or variable life policy (a "Contract") issued by Separate Account A of The Variable Annuity Life Insurance Company ("VALIC") or by other insurance company separate accounts belonging to VALIC affiliates, you have the right to instruct VALIC how to vote Fund shares that are attributable to your Contract.
Q.	What is being proposed?
A.	There are six proposals altogether, as shown in the overview below.
Quick Overview of Proposals
Proposal 1
To approve the new investment advisory agreement between the current investment adviser, The Variable Annuity Life Insurance Company ("VALIC"), and NAFV II with respect to each series of NAFV II.
Affected Funds: All
Reason for the Proposal
A new agreement is being proposed due to the acquisition of American General Corporation, VALIC's parent company, by the American International Group, Inc. ("AIG"). This is referred to in the Proxy Statement as the "Merger." The Merger was completed on August 29, 2001, and caused the old investment advisory agreement between VALIC and NAFV II to automatically expire due to the change in VALIC's ownership.
Proposal 2
To approve the new investment sub-advisory agreement between VALIC and American General Investment Management, L.P. ("AGIM") as sub-adviser.

Affected Funds: North American-AG Core Bond Fund, North American-AG High Yield Bond Fund and North American-AG Strategic Bond Fund
Reason for Proposal
The Merger brings opportunities for integration and consolidation of affiliates. It has been determined that AGIM, the current sub-adviser for the North American-AG Core Bond Fund, North American-AG High Yield Bond Fund and North American-AG Strategic Bond Fund, will consolidate operations with those of another affiliate, AIG Global Investment Corp. ("AIGGIC"), to eliminate duplication and attempt to create economies of scale within the organization. This is addressed in Proposal 4. The purpose of Proposal 2 is to ensure that these three bond funds are sub-advised during the time period from the date of the Shareholder Meeting, December 28, 2001, through the date the AIGGIC Sub-Advisory Agreement would take effect if approved by shareholders (January 1, 2002). Federal law requires that the Board of Trustees and shareholders each approve the sub-advisory agreement
because it is with an affiliated sub-adviser.
Proposal 3
To approve the new investment sub-advisory agreement between VALIC and SunAmerica Asset Management Corp. ("SAAMCo") as sub-adviser.

Affected Fund: North American-AG 2 Money Market Fund
Reason for Proposal
The Merger could result in personnel and functions being moved from one affiliate (VALIC) to another affiliate (SAAMCo). SAAMCo is a wholly-owned subsidiary of SunAmerica Inc., which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of AIG. The North American-AG 2 Money Market Fund does not currently have a sub-adviser; however, when the portfolio management personnel and functions flow to SAAMCo, a sub-advisory agreement will be necessary. Thus, you are being asked to approve an investment sub-advisory agreement for this affiliated company. VALIC does not expect any change in the nature or quality of services provided as a result of these new investment sub-advisory arrangements.
Proposal 4
To approve the new investment sub-advisory agreement between VALIC and AIGGIC as sub-adviser.
Affected Funds: North American-AG Aggressive Growth Lifestyle Fund, North American-AG Conservative Growth Lifestyle Fund, North American-AG Core Bond Fund, North American-AG High Yield Bond Fund, North American-AG Moderate Growth Lifestyle Fund, North American-AG Socially Responsible Fund and North American-AG Strategic Bond Fund
Reason for Proposal
Because of the consolidation of affiliates, discussed above in the overview for Proposal 2, several of the VALIC and AGIM personnel and functions will be moved to another affiliate, AIGGIC, to eliminate duplication and attempt to create economies of scale within the organization. AIGGIC is owned by AIG Global Investment Group, Inc., which in turn is a wholly-owned subsidiary of AIG. VALIC does not expect any change in the nature or quality of services provided as a result of these new investment sub-advisory arrangements.
Proposal 5
To approve amended fundamental investment restrictions to: (a) delete restrictions that are no longer required to be fundamental due to changes in laws or which otherwise need not be fundamental; and (b) to standardize the language of those restrictions that are still required to be fundamental.
Affected Funds: All
Reason for Proposal
Many of the current fundamental investment restrictions are more restrictive than federal law. "Fundamental" in this context means that both the Board of Trustees and the Fund shareholders must approve any changes to the restriction. VALIC has recommended to the Board that the investment restrictions of the Funds be changed to conform to, but not be more restrictive than, federal law. This would give each of the Funds more flexibility; however, these changes, if approved, are not expected to affect the way in which the Funds are managed or the securities or instruments in which the Funds invest.
Proposal 6
To elect the following as Trustees: Robert P. Condon, Dr. Judith L. Craven, William F. Devin, Dr. Timothy J. Ebner, Judge Gustavo E. Gonzales, Jr., Dr. Norman Hackerman, Peter A. Harbeck, Dr. John Wm. Lancaster, Kenneth J. Lavery, Ben H. Love, Dr. John E. Maupin, Jr., and Dr. F. Robert Paulsen.
Affected Funds: All
Reason for the Proposal
It has been several years since Board members have been voted on by shareholders. Recently, new members have been added, expanding the Board's knowledge, background, and experience. Trustees play an important role in governing NAFV II; thus, it is appropriate for you to vote on the complete slate of Trustees at this time.
Q.	Are there any other changes as a result of the Merger?
A.	Yes, we are changing the Fund names as well. The name of the registered investment company is changing from North American Funds Variable Product Series II to VALIC Company II. Here is the list of the old and new names for the individual Funds:

In addition, each affected shareholder will receive an information statement concerning these sub-adviser changes. The information statements will be mailed to shareholders during the first quarter of 2002.

To approve the Investment Sub-Advisory Agreement between VALIC and AIG Global Investment Corp. ("AIGGIC") as sub-adviser.
These four Proposals are related as a result of the acquisition of American General Corporation ("American General") by American International Group, Inc. ("AIG"), on August 29, 2001 (the "Merger"). American General shareholders received 0.5790 of a share of AIG common stock in exchange for each share of American General common stock. American General, VALIC, AGIM, SAAMCo and AIGGIC are affiliated companies as a result of the Merger. For more information about AIG, VALIC, AGIM, SAAMCo and AIGGIC, please see the "Information About . . ." sections below.

The Advisory and Sub-Advisory Agreements
VALIC is an investment adviser registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). It is engaged in the business of rendering investment advisory and management services to various investment companies. NAFV II previously contracted with VALIC (the "Previous Advisory Agreement") to furnish these services to each of the Funds and is paid an annual management fee, based on each of the Fund's average daily net assets. Accordingly, VALIC provides ongoing management supervision, policy direction and legal services to the Funds. Legal services include the preparation of registration statements, prospectuses, reports to shareholders, proxy solicitation materials, fund compliance services and recordkeeping. The Board (including all of the Trustees who are not "interested persons" of the investment company (the "Independent Trustees") within the meaning of Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the
"1940 Act")), most recently unanimously approved the continuance of the Previous Advisory Agreement on July 17, 2001 for the earlier of a one year period or through the Merger date. The initial sole shareholder of the Funds, VALIC Separate Account A, approved the Previous Advisory Agreement on August 26, 1998.

As investment adviser to NAFV II, VALIC has overall responsibility for the general management and day-to-day operations of the Funds, but may employ one or more investment sub-advisers to make the investment decisions for a Fund. VALIC previously contracted with American General Investment Management, L.P. ("AGIM"), an affiliate, to manage the Core Bond Fund, High Yield Bond Fund and Strategic Bond Fund (the "Previous Sub-Advisory Agreement"). The Board, including the Independent Trustees, most recently unanimously approved the continuance of the Previous Sub-Advisory Agreement on July 17, 2001 for the earlier of a one year period or through the Merger�date.

The consummation of the Merger constituted an assignment of the Previous Advisory and Previous Sub-Advisory Agreements under the 1940 Act. Thus, the Previous Advisory Agreement and Previous Sub-Advisory Agreement automatically terminated as of the Merger.

Affiliation with AIG's Asset Management Operations
As a result of the Merger, VALIC and AGIM have become associated with AIG's asset management operations, which offer a wide variety of investment vehicles and services, including variable annuities, mutual funds and investment asset management. Such products and services are offered to individuals and institutions both domestically and internationally. AIG's three principal asset management operations are SAAMCo's asset management operations, AIG Global Investment Group, Inc. ("Global Investment") and its subsidiaries and AIG Capital Partners, Inc. ("Cap Partners"). SAAMCo develops and sells mutual funds and variable annuities and other investment products and provides financial services. Global Investment manages third-party institutional, retail and private equity fund assets on a global basis and provides custodial services. Cap Partners
organizes and manages the invested assets of institutional investment funds and may also invest in such funds. Each of these subsidiary operations receives fees for investment products and services provided.


This association also brings opportunities for integration and consolidation of affiliates. AGIM will consolidate operations with those of another affiliate, AIGGIC, to eliminate duplication and attempt to create economies of scale within the organization. Thus, VALIC recommended that the Board approve the appointment of affiliated companies, AIGGIC and SAAMCo, as sub-advisers for the Funds listed above in Proposal 2 and 3. Both Board approval and shareholder approval are generally required whenever an investment company seeks to appoint an affiliate of the adviser as a sub-adviser.

The Interim and New Investment Advisory and Sub-Advisory Agreements

Board Considerations
At meetings of the Board held on July 16-17, 2001, the Board, including Independent Trustees, unanimously approved an interim advisory agreement (the "Interim Advisory Agreement") between NAFV II, on behalf of each Fund and VALIC, which became effective as of the Merger. The Board also approved an interim sub-advisory agreement between VALIC and AGIM for the Core Bond Fund, High Yield Bond Fund and Strategic Bond Fund (the "Interim Sub-Advisory Agreement"). The terms of the Interim Sub-Advisory Agreement are the same as those of the Previous Sub-Advisory Agreement, except for the effective date and term. The Interim Advisory Agreement and Interim Sub-Advisory Agreement (collectively, the Interim Agreements") were each approved by the Board pursuant to Rule 15a-4 under the 1940 Act, to ensure the uninterrupted receipt by the Funds of investment advisory services during the period between the Merger and the Shareholder Meeting. This Rule,
under certain circumstances, allows interim advisory and sub-advisory agreements to take effect and to remain in effect for up to 150 days, without receiving prior shareholder approval, as long as the fees payable under such agreement do not exceed the fees payable under the predecessor agreement that had been approved by the shareholders and certain other contractual provisions are included in the Interim Agreements. The Interim Agreements require all fees earned to be escrowed pending shareholder approval of the new investment advisory agreement between NAFV II and VALIC (the "New Advisory Agreement"). If a New Advisory Agreement is not approved, VALIC and AGIM will be entitled to receive from escrow the lesser of any costs incurred in performing their duties in the Interim Agreements (plus interest earned on the amount while in escrow), or the total amount in the escrow account (plus interest earned). The Interim Agreements will terminate on the earlier of
the effective date of the New Advisory or Sub-Advisory Agreements or 150 days after the Merger.

Pursuant to the terms of the Interim Advisory Agreement, VALIC is responsible for the management of the investment portfolio of each Fund. The provisions of the Interim Advisory Agreement are the same as those of the Previous Advisory Agreement, except that the provision concerning administrative services was deleted from the Interim Advisory Agreement and moved to be part of a separate Administrative Services Agreement and with respect to the effective date, the term and the escrow conditions relating to VALIC's fees, as described above. Under the 1940 Act, VALIC may continue to serve as the investment adviser for a Fund beyond an interim period of 150 days only if shareholders approve a New Advisory Agreement with VALIC. Consequently, the Board, including all Independent Trustees, unanimously approved and recommended shareholder approval of, the New Advisory Agreement. The New Advisory Agreement, if approved by shareholders, will take effect immediately
upon such approval. The terms of the New Advisory Agreement are the same in all material respects as those of the Interim Advisory Agreement, except for the effective date and the termination date.

In connection with its approval of the New Advisory Agreement, the Board considered that the Merger did not involve any changes in the overall form of the advisory contract or any of the Funds' objectives or policies and observed that the fees remained the same. As part of their deliberations, the Board took into account the following, among other factors: the nature and quality of the services provided or reasonably anticipated to be provided and the results achieved or reasonably anticipated to be achieved by VALIC; the amount and structure of investment advisers' fees generally and the fees payable under the New Advisory Agreement; the financial strength of AIG; the management, personnel and operations of AIG; the commitment of AIG to the financial services industry; and the terms of the Merger.

The Board also considered that the terms of the New Advisory Agreement are the same in all material respects as those of the Interim Advisory Agreement and that the New Advisory Agreement is essentially a continuation of the Previous Advisory Agreement, except as discussed above. The Board, including all of the Independent Trustees, determined that the terms of the New Advisory Agreement are fair and reasonable and that the approval of the New Advisory Agreement is necessary and in the best interests of NAFV II, on behalf of each Fund and its shareholders, to ensure the continued receipt of the same quality of services as is currently provided.

The Board then considered a new sub-advisory agreement for AGIM (the "New AGIM Sub-Advisory Agreement"), for the Core Bond Fund, High Yield Bond Fund and the Strategic Bond Fund, to cover the period from December 28 through December 31, 2001. The Board reviewed information regarding the AGIM investment processes and the sub-advisory fees for the Core Bond Fund, High Yield Bond Fund and the Strategic Bond Fund in connection with the New AGIM Sub-Advisory Agreement. Subsequently, the Board, including all Independent Trustees, unanimously approved and recommended shareholder approval of, the New AGIM Sub-Advisory Agreement. If approved by shareholders, the New AGIM Sub-Advisory Agreement would take effect immediately upon such approval. The terms of the New AGIM Sub-Advisory Agreement are the same in all material respects as those of the Interim Advisory Agreement, except for the effective date and
termination date.

In connection with its approval of the New AGIM Sub-Advisory Agreement, the Board considered the following, among other factors: that any internal reorganization of AGIM would not result in a change in the personnel responsible for providing services to the Core Bond Fund, High Yield Bond Fund and the Strategic Bond Fund; the nature and quality of the services provided or reasonably anticipated to be provided and the results achieved or reasonably anticipated to be achieved by AGIM; and the amount and structure of the fees payable under the New AGIM Sub-Advisory Agreement.

The Board, including all of the Independent Trustees, also considered the terms of the New AGIM Sub-Advisory Agreement and determined that the terms of the New AGIM Sub-Advisory Agreement are fair and reasonable and that the approval of the New AGIM Sub-Advisory Agreement is necessary and in the best interests of NAFV I, on behalf of the Core Bond Fund, High Yield Bond Fund and the Strategic Bond Fund and each Fund's shareholders, to ensure the continued receipt of the same quality of services as is currently provided.

At the Board meeting of October 22 and 23, 2001, the Board reviewed the recommendation from VALIC that SAAMCo be appointed as the sub-adviser for the Money Market II Fund. The Board considered a new investment sub-advisory agreement for SAAMCo (the "SAAMCo Sub-Advisory Agreement"). The terms of the SAAMCo Sub-Advisory Agreement were based on the Previous Sub-Advisory Agreement (between VALIC and AGIM), though with different entities and fees. The Board reviewed information regarding the investment processes of SAAMCo and considered the historical performance it achieved in connection with a similar fund. In connection with its approval of the SAAMCo Sub-Advisory Agreement, the Board considered, among other factors: the nature and quality of the services provided or reasonably anticipated to be provided and the results achieved or reasonably anticipated to be achieved by SAAMCo; the amount and structure of investment sub-advisory fees generally
and the sub-advisory fees payable under the SAAMCo Sub-Advisory Agreement; and the investment management experience of the personnel who would be managing the Money Market II Fund.

Considering the terms of the SAAMCo Sub-Advisory Agreement, the Board, including all of the Independent Trustees, determined that the terms of the SAAMCo Sub-Advisory Agreement are fair and reasonable and that the approval of the SAAMCo Sub-Advisory Agreement is necessary and in the best interests of NAFV II, on behalf of the Money Market II Fund and its shareholders.

The Board also considered a sub-advisory agreement for AIGGIC (the "AIGGIC Sub-Advisory Agreement") relating to VALIC's recommendation that AIGGIC be appointed as the sub-adviser for the Aggressive Growth Lifestyle Fund, Conservative Growth Lifestyle Fund, Core Bond Fund, High Yield Bond Fund, Moderate Growth Lifestyle Fund, Socially Responsible Fund and Strategic Bond Fund. Previously, these Funds did not have a sub-adviser, except for Core Bond Fund, High Yield Bond Fund and Strategic Bond Fund, which were sub-advised by AGIM. VALIC recommended that additional Funds be sub-advised by AIGGIC because internal reorganizations due to the Merger could result in personnel being moved from one affiliated company to another affiliated company; however, there would be no change in the nature or quality of services provided. The Board reviewed information regarding the AIGGIC investment processes and the sub-advisory fees for each affected Fund in connection
with the AIGGIC Sub-Advisory Agreement. Subsequently, the Board, including all Independent Trustees, unanimously approved and recommended shareholder approval of, the AIGGIC Sub-Advisory Agreement. If approved by shareholders, the AIGGIC Sub-Advisory Agreement will take effect on or about January 1, 2002. The terms of the AIGGIC Sub-Advisory Agreement are substantially similar to those of the Interim Sub-Advisory Agreement, except for the effective date and term and the addition of Funds as discussed above. The AIGGIC Sub-Advisory Agreement fees for the affected Funds are shown below in the "Information About AIGGIC" section.

In connection with its approval of the AIGGIC Sub-Advisory Agreement, the Board considered the following, among other factors: that any internal reorganizations could result in personnel being moved from one affiliated company to another affiliated company; the nature and quality of the services reasonably anticipated to be provided and the results reasonably anticipated to be achieved by AIGGIC; the amount and structure of the fees payable under the AIGGIC Sub-Advisory Agreement; and the investment management experience of the personnel who would be managing the affected Funds.

The Board, including all of the Independent Trustees, also considered the terms of the AIGGIC Sub-Advisory Agreement and determined that the terms of the AIGGIC Sub-Advisory Agreement are fair and reasonable and that the approval of the AIGGIC Sub-Advisory Agreement is necessary and in the best interests of NAFV II, on behalf of each affected Fund and its shareholders.

A description of the New Advisory Agreement, the New AGIM Sub-Advisory Agreement, the AIGGIC Sub-Advisory Agreement and the SAAMCo Sub-Advisory Agreement (collectively, the "New Agreements") and the services to be provided by each entity is set forth below. If you would like a copy of any of the New Agreements, please write to Nori L. Gabert, Esq., A36-02, American General, 2929 Allen Parkway, Houston, Texas 77019.

Section 15(f) of the 1940 Act - Board Considerations
Section 15(f) of the 1940 Act provides that an investment adviser (such as VALIC) to a registered investment company and the affiliates of such adviser, may receive any amount or benefit in connection with a sale of any interest in such investment adviser which results in an assignment of an investment advisory contract if the following two conditions are satisfied: (1) for a period of three years after such assignment, at least 75% of the board of directors/trustees of the investment company are not interested persons of the new investment adviser or its predecessor; and (2) no "unfair burden" (as defined in the 1940 Act) may be imposed on the investment company as a result of the assignment or any express or implied terms, conditions or understandings applicable thereto.
Consistent with the first condition of Section 15(f), AIG advised the Board that for a period of three years after the Merger, it will not take or recommend any action that would cause more than 25% of NAFV II Trustees to be interested persons of VALIC.
With respect to the second condition of Section 15(f), an "unfair burden" on an investment company is defined in the 1940 Act to include any arrangement during the two-year period after any such transaction occurs whereby the investment adviser or its predecessor or successor, or any interested person of such adviser, predecessor or successor, receives or is entitled to receive any compensation of two types, either directly or indirectly. The first type is compensation from any person in connection with the purchase or sale of securities or other property to, from or on behalf of the investment company, other than bona fide ordinary compensation as principal underwriter for such company. The second type is compensation from the investment company or its security holders for other than bona fide investment advisory or other services. AIG advised the Board that it will not take or recommend any action that would constitute an unfair burden on NAFV
II within the meaning of Section 15(f).
Description of the New Advisory Agreement
Under the New Advisory Agreement, VALIC will provide an investment program for each Fund and will be responsible for the investment and reinvestment of each Fund's assets, including maintaining a trading desk to place all orders for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities. Under the New Advisory Agreement, VALIC, at its own expense, will perform research, statistical analysis and continuous supervision of each Fund's investment portfolio and furnish office space, equipment and personnel for managing the day-to-day operations. Under the New Advisory Agreement, VALIC will use its best efforts to obtain any tender and exchange offer solicitation fees, other fees and similar payments available in connection with portfolio transactions. VALIC will remit promptly to a Fund any commissions, tender and exchange offer solicitation fees, other fees or similar payments received by VALIC, or any affiliated person of VALIC in connection with a Fund's
portfolio transactions, less the amount of any direct expenses incurred by VALIC or any affiliated person of VALIC in obtaining such commissions, fees or payments.

In accordance with the New Advisory Agreement, VALIC will bear the cost of the fees, salaries and other remuneration of Trustees and officers of the Fund who also serve as directors, officers or employees of VALIC.

As compensation for VALIC's services under the New Advisory Agreement, NAFV II will pay VALIC amounts as shown in the chart below. All fees are the same as in the Previous Advisory Agreement.

AGIM has broad latitude in selecting securities for these three Funds, subject to VALIC's oversight. AGIM may place trades through brokers of its choosing and will take into consideration the quality of the brokers' services and execution, as well as services such as research and providing equipment or paying any Fund expenses, in setting the amount of commissions paid to a broker. AGIM shall not be subject to liability to VALIC, these Funds, or to any shareholder
of the Funds for any act or omission in rendering services under the New AGIM Sub-Advisory Agreement, or for any losses sustained in the purchase, holding, or sale of any portfolio security, as long as there has been no willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, or reckless disregard of the AGIM's obligations or duties. The New AGIM Sub-Advisory Agreement provides for automatic termination unless at least annually, its continuance is approved by (i) the Board or the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of a Fund and (ii) the Independent Trustees. The New AGIM Sub-Advisory Agreement terminates automatically upon its assignment or the termination of the New Advisory Agreement and is terminable at any time, without penalty, by the Board, VALIC, or the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of a Fund, upon 30 to 60 days' written notice.

Under the AIGGIC Sub-Advisory Agreement, AIGGIC will provide an investment program for the Aggressive Growth Lifestyle Fund, Conservative Growth Lifestyle Fund, Core Bond Fund, High Yield Bond Fund, Moderate Growth Lifestyle Fund, Socially Responsible Fund and Strategic Bond Fund and will be responsible for the investment and reinvestment of each Fund's assets. AIGGIC has broad latitude in selecting securities for the Funds, subject to VALIC's oversight. AIGGIC may place trades through brokers of its choosing and will take into consideration the quality of the brokers' services and execution, as well as services such as research and providing equipment or paying any Fund expenses, in setting the amount of commissions paid to a broker. AIGGIC shall not be subject to liability to VALIC, the Funds, or to any shareholder of the Funds for any act or omission in rendering services under the AIGGIC Sub-Advisory Agreement, or for any losses sustained
in the purchase, holding, or sale of any portfolio security, as long as there has been no willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, or reckless disregard of AIGGIC's obligations or duties. The AIGGIC Sub-Advisory Agreement provides for automatic termination unless at least annually, its continuance is approved by (i) the Board or the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Fund and (ii) the Independent Trustees. The AIGGIC Sub-Advisory Agreement terminates automatically upon its assignment or the termination of the New Advisory Agreement and is terminable at any time, without penalty, by the Board, VALIC, or the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Funds, upon 30 to 60 days' written notice.

As compensation for AIGGIC's services under the AIGGIC Sub-Advisory Agreement, VALIC will pay AIGGIC amounts as shown in the chart below.

Required Vote
Approval of each of the New Agreements requires the affirmative vote of a "majority of the outstanding voting securities" of each Fund which, as defined in the 1940 Act, means the affirmative vote of the lesser of (i) more than 50% of the outstanding shares of the Fund or (ii) 67% or more of the shares of the Fund present at the Meeting if more than 50% of the outstanding shares of the Fund are represented at the Meeting in person or by proxy. However, the approval for New Agreements for any Fund is not dependent on the approval of the New Agreements for any other Fund. If shareholders of a Fund do not approve the New Agreements for that Fund, the Board will consider what actions to take to assure the receipt of advisory services.

The Board unanimously recommends that shareholders of each Fund vote FOR approval of each New�Agreement.

Brokerage Selection Practices - VALIC, AGIM, SAAMCo and AIGGIC
VALIC and its affiliates, AGIM, SAAMCo and AIGGIC, have provided information about each firm's brokerage selection practices, including soft dollars, directed brokerage and transactions with affiliated brokers. These are important practices to evaluate when deciding to hire or continue a contract with an adviser and are subject to extensive regulation under the federal securities laws. VALIC reviews these practices and will also evaluate any conflicts of interest inherent in the adviser's policies and practices. Soft dollars: The term "soft dollars" is often used to describe that part of the basic trade commission which exceeds the lowest rate available from other broker-dealers and which is used by the adviser to obtain research and other services from broker-dealers. Soft dollars have not been used to offset expenses of any of the Funds. Directed
brokerage: A directed brokerage agreement is another form of a soft dollar arrangement and includes those arrangements under which products or services (other than execution of securities transactions), expense reimbursements, or commissions are recaptured for a client from or through a broker-dealer, in exchange for directing the client's brokerage transactions to that broker-dealer. The Board has determined that a directed brokerage arrangement with State Street Brokerage, Lynch Jones and Ryan and/or any other comparable broker-dealer is in the best interest of each Fund and its shareholders and therefore has conveyed the information to sub-advisers. A Fund may participate in directed brokerage arrangements consistent with the requirements of best execution, subject to a limit of 20% of a Fund's eligible commissions. Thus, a Fund may benefit from the products or services or recaptured commissions obtained through the directed brokerage arrangement, although there
may be other transaction costs, greater spreads, or less favorable net prices on transactions. As long as the trader executing the transaction for a Fund indicates that this is a directed brokerage transaction, the Fund will get a percentage of commissions paid on either domestic trades or international trades credited back to the Fund. These credits are in hard dollars and could be used to offset the Fund's custody expenses or to pay other Fund expenses (excluding expenses payable to affiliates). By entering into a brokerage/service arrangement, a Fund can reduce expenses reported to shareholders in its statement of operations, fee table and expense ratio and can increase its reported yield. Any such transactions will be disclosed in the registration statement for the Funds. Transactions with affiliated brokers: VALIC and its affiliates do not typically participate in transactions with affiliated brokers. There is no affiliation between VALIC or any person affiliated
with VALIC, NAFV I or the Funds and any broker-dealer that may execute a transaction for the Funds.

Proposal 5
All Funds:
To approve amended fundamental investment restrictions to: (a) delete restrictions that are no longer required to be fundamental due to changes in laws or which otherwise need not be fundamental; and
(b) to standardize the language of those restrictions that are still required to be fundamental.
Discussion
Each Fund invests its assets in accordance with its investment objective, strategies and investment restrictions. Investment restrictions are designated as fundamental or nonfundamental. Anything designated as fundamental, such as the fundamental investment restrictions, can only be changed with approval from the Board and Fund shareholders. By contrast, anything designated as nonfundamental may be changed upon Board approval. Each Fund's investment objective and strategies and the nonfundamental investment restrictions have been designated as nonfundamental policies and therefore may be changed without shareholder approval.

Fund policies and whether they are fundamental or nonfundamental are designated as such when the Fund is created. Generally, the policies are reflective of the laws or styles of the time. Some of the Funds' fundamental investment restrictions that are not required to be fundamental under the 1940 Act were adopted in the past to reflect certain regulatory, business, or industry conditions which are no longer in effect. Further, federal and state laws governing mutual funds have been changed numerous times in the last several years. The NAFV II Prospectus and Statement of Additional Information ("SAI") now contain fundamental investment restrictions that are more restrictive than the current law. This can restrict a Fund's investments and could potentially impair its performance. No Fund intends to change its investment style or the securities or instruments in which it may invest.

As explained above, federal law, in many cases, controls what a mutual fund can purchase. Federal law also specifies which investment policies or restrictions must be fundamental. The policies that are required by law to be fundamental are those concerning fund diversification, borrowing money, the issuance of senior securities, underwriting of securities issued by other persons, the purchase and sale of real estate and commodities, the policy about making loans to other persons and the concentration of investments in a particular industry or group of industries.
Borrowing
Under the Funds' current fundamental restrictions, most of the Funds may borrow only under certain circumstances, such as for temporary or emergency purposes. The proposed restriction would permit each Fund to engage in borrowing in a manner and to the full extent permitted under the 1940 Act, any rule, regulation, or order under the 1940 Act, or any SEC staff interpretation of the 1940 Act.

The 1940 Act generally permits the Funds to borrow money under the following circumstances: (1) a Fund may borrow an amount equal to or less than 33 1/3% of its total assets (including the amount borrowed) from banks; or (2) a Fund may borrow an amount equal to or less than 5% of its total assets for temporary or emergency purposes from any person.
Commodities
A commodity is food, metal, or another physical substance that investors buy or sell, usually via futures contracts. Normally, a Fund will not purchase or sell physical commodities, but may acquire physical commodities as a result of the fund's ownership of securities or other instruments. A Fund may also choose to purchase or sell securities or other instruments backed by physical commodities, or options and futures contracts, if it is in accordance with its investment strategy and is allowed by the investment restrictions. The current fundamental investment restrictions are more restrictive than federal law. The purpose of the standardized restriction is to clarify and standardize this investment policy.

Concentration
The Funds are prohibited from concentrating investments in one industry. For most of the Funds, this means that the Fund cannot invest more than 25% of total assets in the securities of companies engaged primarily in any one industry, other than the U.S. Government, its agencies and instrumentalities. This is more restrictive than current federal law, which does not specify a percentage limitation for this restriction.


Diversification
Each Fund is required to state whether it will have a diversified portfolio or a non-diversified portfolio. All of the Funds in NAFV II are diversified. A fund that is diversified under the 1940 Act must invest in several different companies and adhere to the federal diversification rule. The diversification rule states that at least 75% of the value of total assets (the "diversified portion") must be represented by cash and cash items (including receivables), U.S. Government securities, securities of other investment companies and other securities. This is further limited in that with respect to the diversified portion of a Fund's assets, a Fund may not have an amount greater in value than 5% of the value of total assets invested in any one issuer and not more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of an issuer. Currently, for several of the Funds, the current diversification policy statement applies the 5% and 10% limitations to 100%
of the value of the total assets of each Fund, which is more restrictive than the law.

Issuance of Senior Securities
Under the 1940 Act and the Funds' fundamental restriction stated below, the Funds are restricted from issuing senior securities, with certain exceptions. A "senior security" is an obligation of a fund with respect to its earnings or assets that takes precedence over the claims of the fund's shareholders with respect to the same earnings or assets. The 1940 Act generally prohibits a fund from issuing senior securities, in order to limit the use of leverage. In general, a fund uses leverage when it enters into securities transactions without being required to make payment until a later time. Current SEC staff interpretations regarding the 1940 Act allow a fund to engage in a number of types of transactions which might otherwise be considered creating "senior securities" or "leverage," so long as the fund meets certain segregation requirements designed to protect shareholders. In order to ensure that the Funds' restrictions with
respect to issuing senior securities are consistent with the provisions of the 1940 Act, it is proposed that the restriction on issuing senior securities be revised to state that the Funds may not issue senior securities, except to the extent permitted under the 1940 Act, any rule, regulation, or order under the 1940 Act, or any SEC staff interpretation of the 1940 Act.
If the proposed change is adopted, the following activities will not be considered to be issuing senior securities with respect to the Funds: (i) collateral arrangements in connection with any type of option, future contract, forward contract, or swap; (ii) collateral arrangements in connection with initial and variation margin; or (iii) a pledge, mortgage, or hypothecation of a fund's assets to secure its borrowings.

Loans
Funds may not loan cash, generally, but may occasionally choose to lend portfolio securities or make other lending arrangements as permitted by law or exemptive relief, such as interfund lending. During the period of such a loan, the Fund typically receives the income on both the loaned securities and the loan collateral, or a flat fee, thereby increasing the portfolio yield. The primary purpose of this standardized restriction is to expand the current exceptions to the fundamental investment restriction to include lending arrangements permitted by the 1940 Act, any rule, regulation or order under the 1940 Act, or any SEC staff interpretation of the 1940 Act.

Real Estate
Funds generally do not purchase real estate due to its illiquidity, but may want to invest in a security that is backed by real estate or interests in real estate. The purpose of this proposed standardized investment restriction is to clarify what can be purchased.
Underwriting
Each Fund is currently prohibited from underwriting securities of other issuers. An underwriter brings securities to the market through a selling or distribution agreement. A selling agreement allows the underwriter to buy the securities from a company and then resell the securities to investors. It is proposed that the fundamental restriction be clarified to allow the Funds to underwrite securities to the extent that the Fund may be deemed to be an underwriter under certain federal securities laws.

The current fundamental investment restrictions for the Funds, excerpted from the SAI, are shown in Appendix 1. The standardized fundamental investment restrictions proposed for shareholder approval are shown below.

Proposed Standardized Fundamental Investment Restrictions
Borrowing
All Funds: Each Fund may borrow money in amounts up to 33 1/3% of the value of its total assets for temporary or emergency purposes, or as permitted by law. Each Fund may also borrow money for investment purposes, up to the maximum extent permissible under the 1940 Act. A Fund may also obtain such short-term credits as may be necessary for the clearance of purchases and sales of portfolio securities. In order to secure any permitted borrowings and reverse repurchase agreements under this section, a Fund may pledge, mortgage or hypothecate its assets. This policy shall not prohibit a Fund from engaging in reverse repurchase agreements, dollar rolls, or similar investment strategies described in the Prospectus and the Statement of Additional Information, as amended from time to time.

Commodities
All Funds: No Fund may purchase or sell physical commodities except that each Fund may (i) hold and sell physical commodities acquired as a result of the Fund's ownership of securities or other instruments; (ii) purchase or sell securities or other instruments backed by physical commodities; or (iii) purchase or sell commodity options and futures contracts in accordance with its nonfundamental or operating policies.
Concentration
All Funds: Each Fund may not concentrate its investments in the securities of issuers primarily engaged in any particular industry (other than securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government or its agencies or instrumentalities and repurchase agreements secured thereby), or domestic bank money market instruments.

Diversification
All Funds: Each Fund may not make any investment inconsistent with its classification as a diversified investment company under the 1940 Act.

Issuance of Senior Securities
All Funds: No Fund may issue senior securities except as permitted by the 1940 Act, any rule, regulation, or order under the 1940 Act or any SEC staff interpretation of the 1940 Act.

Lending
All Funds: No Fund may make loans, except that each Fund may, in accordance with its nonfundamental or operating policies, (i) engage in repurchase agreements; (ii) lend portfolio securities; (iii) purchase debt securities; (iv) purchase commercial paper; and (v) enter into any other lending arrangement, including interfund lending, as permitted by the 1940 Act, any rule, regulation or order under the 1940 Act, by exemptive relief, or by any SEC staff interpretation of the 1940 Act.

Real Estate
All Funds: No Fund may purchase or sell real estate except that each Fund may (i) hold and sell real estate acquired as a result of the Fund's ownership of securities or other instruments; (ii) purchase or sell securities or other instruments backed by real estate, or interests in real estate; and (iii) purchase or sell securities of entities or investment vehicles, including real estate investment trusts, that invest, deal, or otherwise engage in the business of real estate.

Underwriting
All Funds: No Fund may underwrite the securities of other issuers, except as permitted by the Board within applicable law and except to the extent that in connection with the sale or disposition of its portfolio securities, a Fund may be deemed to be an underwriter.

VALIC has recommended to the Board that the investment restrictions of the Funds be changed to conform to, but not be more restrictive than, the federal law. VALIC believes that the proposed standardization of the fundamental investment restrictions will give it the flexibility to respond to future changes in the regulatory or investment environment without incurring the costs and delay associated with a shareholder vote. Adoption of the standardized fundamental investment restrictions is not expected to affect the way in which the Funds are managed or the securities or instruments in which the Funds invest.

After careful consideration and with the advice of outside counsel, the Board has approved the standardization of the fundamental investment restrictions, subject to shareholder approval. By reducing to a minimum those policies that can be changed only with a shareholder vote, the Board believes that VALIC would be able to minimize the costs and delay associated with holding future shareholder meetings to revise fundamental policies that become outdated or inappropriate. Although the proposed changes in fundamental restrictions will allow the portfolio managers greater investment flexibility to respond to future investment opportunities, the Board does not anticipate that the changes, individually or in the aggregate, will result in a material change in the level of investment risk associated with an investment in any of the Funds.

Required Vote
Approval of the proposed standardized fundamental investment restrictions requires the affirmative vote of a "majority of the outstanding voting securities" of each Fund of NAFV II, which, as defined in the 1940 Act, means the affirmative vote of the lesser of (i) more than 50% of the outstanding shares of the Fund or (ii) 67% or more of the shares of the Fund present at the Meeting if more than 50% of the outstanding shares of the Fund are represented at the Meeting in person or by proxy. The approval of this Proposal by any Fund is not dependent or conditioned on the approval of any other Fund.

The Board unanimously recommends that shareholders of each Fund vote FOR approval of the proposed standardized fundamental investment restrictions.

Board Committees and Meetings

The Board has appointed an Audit Committee and a Nominating Committee. The Nominating Committee currently consists of the following Independent Trustees: Mr. Love (Chairman), Dr. Craven, Judge Gonzales and Dr.�Hackerman. The Audit Committee currently consists of the following Independent Trustees: Dr. Lancaster (Chairman), Dr. Hackerman, Dr. Maupin, Dr. Paulsen and Mr. Love.

Shareholders may submit written recommendations to the Board regarding nominees for Trustee, although the Board expects to be able to identify an ample number of qualified candidates. Any such recommendations will be referred to the Nominating Committee for consideration.

During the fiscal year ended August 31, 2001, the Board met four times at special and regularly scheduled meetings. During the fiscal year ended August 31, 2001, the Audit Committee met two times and the Nominating Committee met two times. During NAFV II's last fiscal year, all incumbent members of the Board attended at least 75% of the aggregate meetings of the Board and its committees on which they serve.

Audit Committee Report

The duties and responsibilities of the Audit Committee are set forth in a written charter adopted by the Board, a copy of which is attached as Appendix 2 to the Proxy Statement. The Audit Committee's Charter was renewed by the Board on April 17, 2001.

The Audit Committee also has (a) received written disclosures and the letter required by Independence Standards Board Standard No. 1 from Ernst & Young LLP ("E&Y"), NAFV II's independent auditors and (b) discussed certain matters required to be discussed by the Statements on Auditing Standards No. 61 with E&Y.

Selection of Independent Auditors. The 1940 Act requires that the independent auditors to NAFV II be selected by a majority of the Independent Trustees. One of the purposes of the Audit Committee is to recommend to the Board the selection, retention or termination of independent auditors for the Funds. At a meeting held on July 16-17, 2001, the Audit Committee recommended and the Board, including all the Independent Trustees, approved the selection of E&Y as independent auditors for NAFV II for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2002.

E&Y has no direct or material indirect financial interest in NAFV II. Representatives of E&Y will be present at the Meeting and will have the opportunity, at their discretion, to make a statement and to respond to appropriate shareholder questions.

Audit Fees. For the fiscal year ended August 31, 2001, E&Y billed NAFV II $8,760 for services rendered for the audit of the NAFV II annual financial statements.

Financial Information Systems Design and Implementation. E&Y was not engaged by NAFV II, its investment adviser, or any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the investment adviser that provides services to NAFV II, to provide financial information systems design or implementation services.

All Other Fees. The aggregate fees billed for all other services by E&Y and paid by NAFV II, the Adviser, or any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Adviser that provides services to NAFV II was $920,100, consisting of $76,425 for tax compliance services and $843,675 for audit-related services to the Adviser. Audit related services include fees relating to the audit of the Adviser, the separate entity regulatory audits of the Adviser's subsidiaries, review of SEC registration statements and issuance of a SAS 70 Report (Reports on the Processing of Transactions by Service Organizations). The Audit Committee has considered whether the provision of non-audit services provided by E&Y were compatible with maintaining the independence of E&Y and concluded they were.

Executive Compensation

Members of the Board receive an annual retainer of $20,000, $1,000 for each Board meeting attended in person and $250 for each Board meeting conducted by telephone. Audit Committee and Nominating Committee members receive an additional $250 for each committee meeting attended. Committee chairs receive an additional $250 for each committee meeting chaired. Interested Trustees (those who are affiliated with the Funds) and officers of the Funds are not compensated for their service on the Board.

Compensation of Independent Trustees
The following table sets forth information regarding compensation and benefits earned by the Trustees who are not affiliated with VALIC for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2001. Messrs. Devin and Lavery were elected to the Board on October 22, 2001 and thus are not shown in the table below. Interested Trustees (Messrs. Condon and Harbeck) are not eligible for compensation or retirement benefits from NAFV II and therefore are not shown below.

Hackerman, Lancaster, Love and Paulsen is [$________]. All current Trustees would earn ten or more years of service as of their normal retirement date. Complete years of service earned as of August 31, 2001, are as follows: Messrs. Hackerman, Lancaster, Love and Paulsen - 5 or greater; Dr. Craven and Messrs. Ebner, Gonzales and Maupin - approximately 3 years.


Effective January 1, 2001, the Board approved a Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Plan") for its Independent Trustees who are not officers, directors, or employees of VALIC or an affiliate of VALIC. The purpose of the Plan is to permit such Independent Trustees to elect to defer receipt of all or some portion of the fees payable to them for their services to NAFV II, therefore allowing postponement of taxation of income and tax-deferred growth on the earnings. Under the Plan, an Independent Trustee may make an annual election to defer all or a portion of his/her future compensation from NAFV II. NAFV II is responsible for the payment of the retirement benefits as well as all expenses of administration of the Plan. Benefits vested under the Plan are payable for a ten-year period upon retirement based upon the Trustee's years of service and compensation at the time of retirement. Estimated benefits
are shown below.

To determine the estimated benefits at retirement, first find the amount of compensation at retirement (on the left) and then follow that line to the years of service at retirement. For example, a Trustee earning $40,000 upon retirement with 8 years of service would receive an estimated benefit of $32,000 per year for a ten-year period.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
