Investor Resources
From the time Communications Systems Inc. (NASDAQ: JCS) went public in 1981, the company has regularly delivered shareholder value and quarterly dividends.  Over time, in response to market shifts and strategic course adjustments, the company has acquired other technology firms, restructured operations, and brought exciting new brands and products to market.
2016 has been another transformational year for Communications Systems and our business units, led by our Lean Six Sigma operational excellence program. Our investment in research and development continues to drive product and service innovation. As a result, the company sold more than $12 million in new products in the first half of 2016, and we substantially broadened our market reach.
Due to management’s confidence in the exciting future of CSI, and the continued funding of our growth initiatives to date, the company has been able to pay a quarterly dividend, but at a reduced level while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Our ongoing commitment to quality, innovation, and technical diversity has positioned Communications Systems, Inc. solidly in the broadband networking industry and makes the company an attractive investment in the technology space.
