WASHINGTON, Sept. 12, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Falcon Cyber Investments, LLC today welcomes the addition of the Honorable Luis A. Aguilar, former Commissioner at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), as a new partner to the firm.  








"The Falcon Cyber team is proud and humbled to welcome Luis, a recognized leader at the nexus of cybersecurity, investor protection and publicly traded companies," said Rick Berry, partner at Falcon Cyber.  "Luis' wealth of experience in law, the financial markets, investment banking and his most recent role at the Securities and Exchange Commission will help sharpen our focus on creating value for our investors and the investee companies.  The cybersecurity market is unique, and our team is exceptionally positioned to help foster the innovative cybersecurity products and services to protect our most sensitive information." 
"Cybersecurity is a major threat across all industries," said Luis Aguilar.  "I spent a lot of time in my last two years at the Securities and Exchange Commission on this issue, and worked closely with Chair Mary Jo White in putting together the first cybersecurity roundtable in 2014.  I understand firsthand the threats we face, and since leaving the SEC, I've been searching for the right platform to continue contributing to the cybersecurity field and work against the harm cyberattacks can cause.  After careful consideration of the capabilities, opportunities and market reach of Falcon Cyber – I'm extremely excited to join the team." 
Commissioner Aguilar is a member of the Board of Directors of Envestnet, Inc., a NYSE-traded company that is a leading provider of unified wealth management technology and services to investment advisors. 
His previous experience includes serving as the general counsel, head of compliance, executive vice president, and corporate secretary of Invesco, with responsibility for all legal and compliance matters regarding Invesco Institutional. He was also Invesco's Managing Director for Latin America in the 1990's, and president of one of Invesco's broker-dealers.  His professional career also includes tenure as a partner in various prominent national law firms.
Falcon Cyber was formed, from day one, to focus on the unique cybersecurity market by investing in companies that bring exciting new technologies and services to the marketplace.  The addition of Luis Aguilar's expertise allows Falcon to continue to affiliate with the best and brightest in the cybersecurity ecosystem. 
Falcon Cyber Investments is a multistage equity vehicle exclusively focused on Cybersecurity Investments – we partner with our portfolio companies to help them accelerate their success as they seize market opportunities to reduce the cyberattack surface for corporations, governments, and individuals around the globe.
