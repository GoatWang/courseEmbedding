NeoSystems and CardConnect Launch Government Credit Card Program

Service
Allows Government Contractors to Accept Payments Faster  
Tysons Corner,
Virginia/October 10, 2013 – NeoSystems Corp., a provider of financial
management and other strategic back office services for government contractors,
today announced it has partnered with CardConnect, a technology company providing
enterprise-level payment acceptance solutions, to launch GovCardConnect. This Software-as-a-Service
(SaaS) offering enables organizations to directly accept credit and charge card
payments from the federal government.  
Contractors
who use GovCardConnect will be able to improve their bottom lines and operate
more efficiently. GovCardConnect comes fully integrated with Deltek Costpoint, the industry
leading accounting software solution for government contractors. The service
allows contractors  to transmit Level 3 Processing
data – the very specific line-item details contractors must provide to be
eligible for the lowest credit card transaction fees. These lower rates can
yield savings of 25 to 50 percent.  In
addition, rates as low as 1.0-1.5% are expected to soon
be achievable on large transactions. 
To
date, the federal government has already issued approximately 3.5 million
credit cards – generally referred to as “purchase cards” – to authorized government
purchasers under the General Services Administration’s SmartPay Program. These
cards help increase the transparency and accountability of government purchases
across multiple agencies, and as such, the government is planning to expand the
use of purchase cards even further. 
Michael
Tinsley, Chief Executive Officer for NeoSystems, said, “All government
contractors, whether they offer products, services or both, can benefit from
accepting purchase card payments from the government. In addition to
cost-reduction, the benefits include improved cash flow and increased sales. We
look forward to working with our current and future clients to help them
capitalize on this significant opportunity.”  
GovCardConnect
meets the government’s data security standards as well as the compliance
requirements under the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS).
In addition, GovCardConnect operates as a central payment portal for government
contractors, integrating transactions, deposits, receipts and other financial
information into Deltek Costpoint. 
“Through
the collaboration of our payments knowledge and NeoSystems’ industry expertise,
we were able to develop a solution tailored to the unique needs of government
contractors,” said Jeff Shanahan, President of CardConnect. “GovCardConnect
helps contractors decrease costs and increase revenue, all while meeting the
government’s stringent accounting and auditing standards.” 
GovCardConnect
is offered to all users of Deltek Costpoint and is available through NeoSystems
Corp. today.

Forward-Looking Statements


      This press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the 
      meaning of the "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities 
      Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements may be 
      identified by the use of words such as "anticipate", "believe", 
      "expect", "estimate", "plan", "outlook", and "project" and other similar 
      expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are 
      not statements of historical matters. Such forward-looking statements 
      include statements concerning the timing of the merger; the business 
      plans, objectives, expectations and intentions of the public company 
      once the transaction is complete, and CardConnect’s estimated and future 
      results of operations, business strategies, competitive position, 
      industry environment and potential growth opportunities. These 
      statements are based on FNTC’s or CardConnect’s management’s current 
      expectations and beliefs, as well as a number of assumptions concerning 
      future events.
    

      Such forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, 
      uncertainties, assumptions and other important factors, many of which 
      are outside FNTC’s or CardConnect’s control that could cause actual 
      results to differ materially from the results discussed in the 
      forward-looking statements. These risks, uncertainties, assumptions and 
      other important factors include, but are not limited to, (1) the 
      occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give 
      rise to the termination of the merger agreement; (2) the inability to 
      complete the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement due to 
      the failure to obtain approval of the stockholders of FNTC or other 
      conditions to closing in the merger agreement; (3) the ability of the 
      public entity to meet NASDAQ’s listing standards following the merger; 
      (4) the risk that the proposed transaction disrupts current plans and 
      operations of CardConnect as a result of the announcement and 
      consummation of the transactions described herein; (5) the ability to 
      recognize the anticipated benefits of the proposed business combination, 
      which may be affected by, among other things, competition, the ability 
      of the combined company to grow and manage growth profitably, maintain 
      relationships with suppliers and retain its management and key 
      employees; (6) costs related to the proposed business combination; (7) 
      changes in applicable laws or regulations; and (8) the possibility that 
      CardConnect may be adversely affected by other economic, business, 
      and/or competitive factors. Additional factors that could cause actual 
      results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in 
      forward-looking statements can be found in FNTC’s most recent annual 
      report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 
      10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, which are available, free of

      In connection with the proposed merger, FNTC intends to file with 
      the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) a preliminary proxy

      persons are advised to read, when available, FNTC’s preliminary proxy 
      statement/prospectus, the amendments thereto, and definitive proxy 
      statement/prospectus, as these materials will contain important

      definitive proxy statement/prospectus will be mailed to stockholders 
      of FNTC as of a record date to be established for voting on the merger 
      and related transactions. Stockholders will also be able to obtain 
      copies of the proxy statement/prospectus and other documents filed with 
      the SEC that will be incorporated by reference in the proxy 
      statement/prospectus, without charge, once available, at 
      the SEC's Internet site at http://www.sec.gov, 
      or by directing a request to: FinTech Acquisition Corp., 712 Fifth
