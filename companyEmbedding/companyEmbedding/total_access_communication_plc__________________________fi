					Programmed with

					Software you'll enjoy using :)




					Graphically program in Flow Charts and/or Ladder Logic to rapidly create custom applications. 

					We simplified the instruction set.  Our function set is comprehensive, easy to use and powerful.

					No hunting for features.  vBuilder’s layout keeps the tools and information you need in plain view.

					Warnings and Errors are presented in real time so there are no surprises at build.

					Tag based PLCs are easier to use than address based ones, but typically cost hundreds of dollars.

					Our entire line, starting at $49, is Tag based.

					Innovative Features

					We’ve developed some great features to help you get things done quicker and more reliably.

					Subroutines:

					Break projects up into manageable chunks, and allow program reuse.

					Objects:

					Isolate data and create logic components to greatly improve development efficiency,

					maintainability and reliability.

					Linked Subroutines:

					Specify that multiple subroutines should use the same Objects.  Maybe you’ve

					got an initialization routine you’d like in one subroutine, and a process you want in another.  

					They can share an object, so you don’t have to pass data between the two.




					View your data and create operator controls with

					Awesome, Free HMI




					We’re serious about delivering the easiest to use, most productive PLC software.

					We could go on about our features, but seeing is believing, so Check out our vBuilder page,

vFactory page or Download vBuilder and vFactory. They're

					FREE




					Meet Branch








					Expansion has a vLink input port instead of USB. 

					Expansions are otherwise physically identical to Branch Main. 

					Your Sensors and Actuators are Branched Out, 

					Your PLC Should Branch With Them! 







					Branch's unique structure beats backplane and brick systems 

					at getting IO where it’s need, helping you run shorter wires and keep an organized system 




					Smarter IO

					Expansion units have full PLC processing power and memory.




					vBuilder’s power shines with Branch 

					Put subroutines inside of IO units to focus processing where it’s most needed. 

					Debug your entire Branch system as a unit.  No need to debug one processor at a time. 

					Lets you view real-time data for your entire system. 













					PLC programming should be fun! 

					We’ve got engaging tutorials to get you up to speed on our PLCs, and more are on the way. 

					Whether you’re new to PLCs, or just new to us, we want your learning experience to be enjoyable. 

					The tutorials aren’t boring or difficult to follow, we promise. 

					FREE Connector Tool 

					For a limited time only, we’re giving away a FREE connector tool with every Order!




					Every order over $48 ships FREE 

					100% of our PLCs qualify for Free US standard shipping.
					We also ship to Canada and Mexico for $19.95.

					100% Satisfaction Guarantee 

					Shop with confidence, knowing that you are free to return any product for a full 30 days after

					Terminal Boards




					Ace PLCs come with small, high quality spring-cage capture connectors.
					They’re made for 20-26 AWG wire.

					These connectors along with built in protected inputs and transistor outputs work great 
					for many cases, but sometime you need something more.  We’ve got you covered.




					Larger Screw-Type

					Relay

					Opto-Coupled

					Using a Cable we’ll provide you, wire these Terminal boards to Ace or Branch’s IO ports.
					All Terminal Boards have a built in mount for 15mm DIN Rail or #8 Bolts.
					All Terminal Boards connect to IO with screw-type terminals (30-16 AWG stranded or solid wire.)

					Data Sheets:

					Power




					All Ace and Branch PLCs come with a 2 position connector to attach
					to a 5 volt power supply.  Connects to 26-20 gauge wire.

					Data Sheets







  5V and 12V Wall Plugs






  Regulator
 
If you don’t have a power supply, we offer one. It’ll power 1 PLC or Powered Terminal Board. 
				Wall Plug - 5 volt,  2 Amp (for 1 PLC or powered terminator board)			

$9.00 








Add



If you’ve got a 12-24 volt supply and want to power up to 6 PLCs or Powered Terminal Boards, we’ve got a Regulator for that. It connects to a 15mm DIN rail or #8 bolts.  
				Regulator - 8 to 28 volts in, six 5-volt supplies out			

$19.00 








Add



 We’ve also offer a 12 volt supply to use our Regulator 
				Wall Plug - 12 volt (an option to power Regulator)			

$15.00

					Programming cable




					All Ace and Branch PLCs use a standard USB to Mini-USB cable 
					for programming (like the one in the picture to the left).
					If you’ve already got one, great, it’ll work fine.
					Be careful, this isn't the USB to Micro-USB that comes with many cell phones.
					If not, be sure to add one to your cart.

					DIN Rail Mount

					All Ace and Branch PLCs come standard with a super-strong, 2-sided adhesive strip.
					It bonds well with painted metals, plastics and glass. 
					This stuff is used to attach Sky-Scraper windows to their frames.  We've been impressed with it's strength.




					Adhesive

					(Underside of Ace and Branch PLCs)

					But, what if I want to attach it to a DIN rail, screws, or bolts? You’re in Luck!  

					We’ve got a great add-on that helps you attach your PLC to a 35mm Din rail, or #8 screws or bolts.  




					vMount  

					same thing, just upside down  

					it's got these 2 hooks  

					Ace or Branch underside  

					notice these slots 

					Ace and Branch have four of the slots shown in the image above, to the right. (two aren’t visible). 
					Twist vMount onto your Ace or Branch to attach.  Pick which of the 4 orientations works best for your project.  




					Once attached to your Ace or Branch, rest the topside on your DIN rail. 
					Then press the bottom side down.  It'll snap in place, providing a secure mount.  

					If you'd prefer to mount using #8 screws or bolts, just place you holes 1" apart.

					Simulators



					Simulate Inputs to aid development!

 

					2 Reasons to Use Simulators

					1) Work on software before connecting to your Sensors and Actuators.

					Don’t have all your sensors and actuators yet?

					Can’t afford to take system offline for long?

					Prove it works before connecting to the real thing.

					Want to connect sensors and actuators one piece at a time?

					With the External Port option, connect as many Digital IO sensors and actuators as you’d like
					and simulate all the rest.  
					Switches let you select pin-by-pin which Analog Inputs you want to simulate using knobs
					and which you want to use real signals from input ports.

					2) Learn to use PLCs.

					They’re a great training tool.  All IO can be simulated.

					Compatible with most Embedded PLC we sell

					With a Simulator, an Embedded Branch Main and Embedded Expansions,
					you can simulate an entire Branch System.

					Simulators can be set up to work with 5volt and 10volt analog ranges.

					Knobs simulate Analog Inputs
					(port f is optional)

 

					Switches simulate Digital Inputs

 

					LEDs display Digital Output state

 

					Jumper sets whether GND to +5V 
					or AV- to AV+ is used for Analog Inputs

 

					Analog Input Port Connector (optional)

 

					Switches let you pin-by-pin to use 
					Knob or signal from Analog 
					Input Port (optional)

 

					Digital Input Port Connector (optional)
					decide pin-by-pin to use Switch or wire 
					plugged into this port for Digital Input

 

					Digital Output Port Connector (optional)
					connect outputs to real hardware


 

 

					Our Embedded PLCs use 0.1” spaced headers 
					that extend from the underside of the PLCs. 
					They’re designed to mate with these Simulators,
					as well as your custom hardware

					Simulator Compatible PLCs
 

					Embedded PLCs are identical to their non-embedded version, 
					except that they connect to hardware using 0.1” spaced headers 
					instead of pluggable terminals.
