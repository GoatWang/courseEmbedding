                                Report abuseTranscript of Dove "Choose Beautiful" Campaign AnalysisDove: "choose beautiful"Agency: ogilvy & MatherBy: Courtney Helland, caroline caress, sarah d'amico, maggie gelon & Sydney maretteOn April 7th, 2015, Ogilvy and Mather released Dove's newest campaign "Choose Beautiful," which was accompanied by a new spot, social experiment and social media campaign, which is all ongoing.ObjectivesAccording to Dove's Senior Global Director Victoria Sjardin, "Dove wanted to inspire women to seize the opportunity to choose what makes us feel beautiful everyday -- because when we do, it unlocks confidence and happiness."Dove's vision through this campaign is to encourage women's positive relationships with themselves and the way they appear on the outside, which impacts each women's realization of their own goals.This vision encourages using Dove products indirectly, and rather through the experience the company creates for each consumer.Target Audience AnalysisThe target audience for this campaign is women worldwide. The primary demographic is limited to exclusively women.This includes all ages, races, sexual orientations and socioeconomic standings. In regards to psychographics, Dove has participated in many research studies to discover how women perceive themselves in the context of beauty."How many women told us they felt anxious about the way they look?"USA: 61%China: 86%India: 56%UK: 96%Brazil: 72%This study also demonstrated that a high percentage of women found qualities of other women beautiful, but didn’t see it in themselves. Target Audience Analysis Continued...In our opinion, the campaign concept demonstrates an adequate understanding of Dove's target audience through their tailored research.We also believe the campaign succeeds in emotionally connecting with the audience. By identifying common feelings of vulnerability and low self-esteem through research, the company was then able to transform that data into an emotional message.Visuals that include women of all body types, race and age have helped to foster the idea of beauty in all forms. Social experiments involved in their advertising such as choosing to walk through a door labeled “Average” or “Beautiful” also specifically invokes an emotional decision, and challenge the participants and viewers to reevaluate their emotions and perceptions. Brand Identity & DevelopmentDove conducted the study previously discussed, which asked women from different countries about beauty. Results showed a high percentage of women found qualities of other women beautiful, but didn’t see it in themselves.Based on those findings, the "big idea" developed.Dove used this opportunity to further develop the brand with another mission (we’re women, we’re powerful, choose beautiful)Products development continued, creating body wash, shampoo, etc. The "Big Idea"Dove challenges the idea that women don’t have to wait for a magazine, trend or person to tell them they’re beautiful.Goal of the campaign is empowerment and that women need to start deciding for themselves that they are beautifulThe ultimate goal wasn’t only to create a product brand, but to insight action.Company Executivess stated it wasn’t about a product based affair, it was about creating change for the next generation.In 2004, Dove created a fund, which partnered with Girl Scouts, Boys and Girls clubs and Girls Inc., which is still in affect and continues to enhance their brand's values today. This campaign was also not regarding Dove's products, but instead their corporate responsibility.InvolvementDove products are advertised as a high affective involvement product. Affective involvement requires the expending of emotional energy and evoking of deep feelings about a decision or product. There is low to moderate cognitive involvement based on the purchasing of Dove products.The creative concept of the campaign reflects this affective involvement by invoking pathos in statements such as “Choose Beautiful” and challenging women to define themselves as “beautiful” or “average”.Call to ActionThe call to action is prominent in the tagline “Choose Beautiful." The simple, imperative wording challenges women to evaluate the way in which they perceive themselves, and then to intentionally choose to value themselves as beautiful. Direct Response Campaign?“Choose Beauty” is not a direct response campaign. Rather than inciting consumers to purchase the product directly from the advertiser, the advertisement promotes a change of perspective. With that in mind, the brand name, Dove, is clearly featured so consumers are reminded of the brand values and personality.Effectiveness FeedbackCreative Concept for a Low  Cognitive Involvement ProductCampaign ImprovementsThe best way to determine the effectiveness of this campaign is evaluate the discussion around it. Dove’s “Choose Beauty” campaign has definitely sparked some conversation. The Huffington post stated, “the results are a powerful commentary on how many women perceive their own beauty."Others have a different point of view such as Jean Killbourne, creator of Killing Us Softly: Advertising’s Image of Woman, who said, “it puts it all on women: We should just shape up and increase our self-esteem, as if it were that easy”. Many people have mixed feelings about the Choose Beauty Campaign, but it continues to be popular and Dove continues to keep producing ads. Campaign EthicsDove took the initiative to let women know that it’s okay to be confident and feel beautiful in their own skin. By focusing the efforts to better the lives of consumers, Dove has created a very socially and ethically responsible campaign. Even if the intentions of the campaign was positive, there was still some negative backlash:Agency Spy calls the campaign "unnatural and [it] doesn't have the same convincing narrative arc that many of the brand's more successful initiatives do."Tech Times believes that women "don't necessarily have to feel beautiful to have high self-esteem."Tech Times also points out that "to make matters worse for the women who walked through the Average door, Dove confronted them about their choice on the camera, suggesting that walking through the Average door automatically meant the women had low self esteem."We would not limit the campaign to targeting only women. The message of loving the skin you are in can apply to both genders. Giving the rising statistics of men unsatisfied with their body image, a co-ed campaign may do surprisingly well. We would also not limit the vernacular of the campaign to physical beauty. For instance, limiting the choices in the commercial to “beautiful” or “average” is reinforcing categories that Dove is trying to break. Emphasizing people are much more than the exterior would be more inclusive.Critics knock the campaign for being patronizing. Collecting feedback through surveys and focus groups to improve upon tone may be useful.Ogilvy & Mather took Dove's low cognitive involvement product, and through this campaign focused on turning it into a lifestyle product and brand.They didn't focus on the selling the specific product, but instead on the lifestyle and persona the brand it trying to support, which is of high self-esteem and feeling comfortable in one's own skin.This created an emotional connection to the product and brand through the soft music chosen and inspirational words from the subjects in the video and real-life responses on social media outlets.Dove and Ogilvy & Mather HistoryOgilvy & Mather began Dove's "Real Beauty" campaign back in 2004.Its mission was to "to make women feel comfortable in the skin they are in, to create a world where beauty is a source of confidence and not anxiety."Since then, they have continued the campaign through many other tactics, including various videos.One video example is "Dove Real Beauty Sketches.""Choose Beautiful" is the newest campaign Ogilvy & Mather has produced for Dove, which has also created a social media movement with the hashtag #ChooseBeautiful.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/26/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.
