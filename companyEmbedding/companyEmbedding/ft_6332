Aquatic Communities and Selected Water Chemistry in St. Vrain Creek near the City of Longmont, Colorado, Wastewater-Treatment Plant, 2005 and 2006. Data Series 253. U.S. Geological Survey. 31 p. In 2005, the U.S. Geological Survey and the City of Longmont, Colo., began a study to document chemical characteristics of St. Vrain Creek that had previously been unavailable either due to high cost of analysis or lack of analytical capability. Stream samples were collected at seven sites on St. Vrain Creek during the spring of 2005 and 2006 for analysis of wastewater compounds. A Lagrangian-sampling design was followed during each sampling event, and time-of-travel studies were conducted just prior to each sampling event to determine appropriate sampling times for the synoptic. In addition, semipermeable membrane devices, passive samplers that concentrate hydrophobic organic chemicals, were installed at six sites during the spring of 2005 and 2006 for approximately 4 weeks. After retrieval, contaminant residues concentrated in the semipermeable membrane devices were recovered and used in a toxicity assay that provided a screen for aryl hydrocarbon receptor type compounds, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, dioxins, and furans...

Parkland Fuel CorpParkland Fuel Corporation Announces July 2017 DividendTwitterFacebookLinkedInGooglePlusRedditPinterestUrlJul 12 2017 22:19 BSTSource: Business Wire

CALGARY, Alberta--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jul. 12, 2017--
      Parkland Fuel Corporation (“Parkland”) (TSX:PKI), Canada's largest and
      one of North America's fastest growing independent marketers of fuel and
      petroleum products, today announced that a dividend of $0.0962 per share
      will be paid on August 15, 2017 to shareholders of record on July 21,
      2017. The dividend will be an 'eligible dividend' for Canadian income
      tax purposes. The ex-dividend date is July 19, 2017.
    

      Shareholders who wish to enroll for the first time in the enhanced
      Dividend Reinvestment Plan must do so prior to the July 19, 2017
      ex-dividend date if they wish to participate in the Plan for this
      month’s dividend.
    

      Brokerage entitlement and corporate actions departments are encouraged
      to ensure that they have properly elected with Clearing and Depository
      Services Inc. (“CDS”) those shares that should participate in each
      component of the Plan no later than July 20, 2017, the business day
      prior to the record date.
    

ENHANCED DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN


      In addition to the option of receiving a monthly cash dividend of
      $0.0962 per share, the enhanced Dividend Reinvestment Plan allows
      shareholders to repurchase shares with their dividend at a 5% discount
      to the volume weighted average price as defined by the Plan.
    

      Those shareholders who do not elect to participate in the enhanced
      Dividend Reinvestment Plan will still receive their regular monthly
      dividend of $0.0962 per share.
    

ENROLLING


      Shareholders who own their shares through a brokerage and who wish to
      participate in either component of the Plan should call their broker and
      instruct them to enroll their shares in one of the two options.
    

      Shareholders who hold certificates in their own name (registered
      shareholders) who wish to enroll can find out more from Computershare by
      calling 1-800-564-6253. Copies of the Plan, a series of questions and
      answers and the enrollment form are also available on Parkland's website
      at http://bit.ly/PKIdividend.
