												How to Season Your Pans
											


About
Transcript
Embed




											Today we're going to show you how to season cooking pans. Pan seasoning is essential to any food service operation, as it keeps your pans from rusting and your food from sticking to the pans. Seasoning cooking pans saves you time and money. We'll show you how to season five different types of cooking pans in this video. A cast iron skillet, a carbon steel fry pan, a carbon steel wok, a tin-plated pan, and a hard coat aluminum pan.

We make a lot of pizzas in our children's cooking school for birthday parties and other events. At first, pizzas were sticking to the pans but after several uses, they are well seasoned and pizzas never stick. Great product for the money!

Perfect size for the pizzas we make. Makes a great surface to slice the pizza and serve. I like its simplicity and unlike our nonstick pizza pan, I can slice directly on it since there isn't a nonstick coating. Great price and gets the job done.
