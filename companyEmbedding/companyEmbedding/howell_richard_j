Recognition 


Rising Star, Thomson Reuters, 2014-2017










Biography
Richard A. Howell is a commercial trial lawyer. Richard represents businesses in a variety of industries in complex disputes that require a skilled and creative presence in the courtroom.
Richard has served as the lead trial attorney for oil & gas industry clients, national and regional banks, and other businesses in many trials, as well as many other cases that were resolved before trial.  Richard has obtained judgments and arbitration awards in excess of $1.25 million and $3.5 million when representing plaintiffs, and he has obtained dismissals of lawsuits and total defense jury verdicts and judgments for defendants.  Richard has also represented many clients (including two pipeline operators, a national bank, a private equity company, a chemical plant, and a food distributor) in “emergency” actions to enjoin or avoid injunctions of business activities and actions to obtain receiverships over property.  Additionally, during the last five years, Richard has assisted colleagues in five jury trials and a bench trial.

In 2014, 2015, and 2016, Richard was recognized by Thomson Reuters as a “Rising Star” for his work on behalf of clients in business litigation.
Richard was born and raised in Houston, Texas. He attended the University of Texas at Austin, where he was the founding community service director of the Kappa Sigma fraternity. While in college, he interned for the policy offices of the Texas Governor and Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives, and he also served as an intern at the White House with the President’s Deputy Senior Advisor. After graduating and working in Ohio on a presidential campaign, Richard moved to Washington, D.C., where he worked for NASA’s General Counsel, Brig. Gen. Michael Wholley. Richard returned to Texas to attend Baylor Law School, where he was active in advocacy programs and served as the Articles Editor for the Baylor Law Review.
Richard enjoys helping clients obtain an efficient and successful result before trial whenever possible. When a pre-trial solution is not possible, Richard is well-prepared to stand up for his clients in trials and hearings in federal and state court. And at 6 feet 8 inches tall, he is noticed when he stands up!


Practice Experience
Oil & Gas and Chemical Industry

Laredo Energy v. Howard Energy, 2016.  Richard assisted Amy Baird in representing Howard Energy, a pipeline and processing plant operator, in state court and a related arbitration concerning two gas gathering agreements and a gas processing agreement.  We secured the dismissal of Laredo Energy’s state court lawsuit, and Howard Energy favorably resolved the dispute after the arbitrator granted partial summary judgment for Howard Energy.


MEMC Pasadena, Inc. v. Albemarle Corp., 2016.  Richard and Richard Griffin represented a Houston-area chemical plant in a breach of contract and declaratory judgment action.  We obtained temporary restraining order from state court, which was later confirmed by a federal court, to prevent the defendant from shutting off utilities during the pendency of the dispute in order to prevent injury to people, property, and the environment.  The dispute was subsequently resolved.


Explorer Pipeline Company v. Peltier, 2014. Richard secured a temporary restraining order and temporary injunction for Explorer against a landowner who blocked access to Explorer’s easement.


Matias v. TMK IPSCO, 2013. After a worker was killed in an oilfield accident, his family sued various companies associated with the well, including tubing manufacturer IPSCO. A tubing distributor asserted a cross-claim against IPSCO for indemnity based on the Texas “innocent seller” statute. Through discovery and metallurgical testing, Jackson Walker proved that IPSCO’s tubing was not defective. Richard assisted with discovery and with drafting the summary judgment motion against the plaintiffs and the motion to dismiss the distributor’s cross-claim. Jackson Walker obtained a total victory for IPSCO when the court dismissed the plaintiffs’ and the distributor’s claims against IPSCO.


Southern Chemical Corp. v. Celanese Ltd., 2012. This five-week jury trial concerned a 10-year methanol supply contract. Jackson Walker represented the defendant, Celanese, Ltd., the purchaser of the methanol. The plaintiff claimed in excess of $1 billion for fraud and a lesser amount for breach of contract. The jury found for Celanese and awarded Celanese nearly $600,000 for SCC’s bad faith. Richard assisted lead counsel during trial, deposed and successfully moved to exclude one of the plaintiff’s expert witnesses, and led the pre-trial and trial briefing related to Celanese’s counterclaim.


LDH Energy Mont Belvieu, L.P. v. BASF FINA Petrochemicals, L.P., 2012. Richard assisted in defending a chemical plant operated by BASF FINA Petrochemicals, L.P. against breach of contract and indemnity claims brought by a product storage terminal operator. Richard drafted a motion for summary judgment that, after it was filed, prompted the plaintiff to dismiss all of its claims against Jackson Walker’s client.

Commercial Disputes

AT&T Mobility, LLC v. AIC Management Co., 2016.  Richard represented AT&T as lead counsel at trial in a dispute concerning the ownership of a cell tower site and lease payments.  At trial, the Court granted AT&T’s motion to declare that AIC’s deed was legally invalid.  The Court also rendered judgment that AT&T did not breach any agreement with AIC and that AIC would recover no damages from AT&T.


Vallourec USA Corp. v. A.M. Castle & Co., 2016.  Richard and Jeff Burbach represented Vallourec USA in a lawsuit to recover more than $7 million for industrial pipe.  The case was resolved before trial.


New Process Steel v. Kollaja, 2014. Jackson Walker client New Process Steel prevailed in a jury trial on theft and breach of fiduciary duty claims against Jimmy C. Kollaja, New Process Steel’s former Senior Vice President of Finance. Richard wrote and helped argue New Process Steel’s pre-trial motions, motion for directed verdict, and post-trial motions. The court granted New Process Steel’s post-trial motion to disregard any damage award in favor of Kollaja, thereby providing a near-total victory for New Process Steel.


Gold Star Ventures, Inc. v. Schroeder, 2012. Jackson Walker represented Gold Star Ventures against a company whose actions threatened the existence of Gold Star’s  business. Richard represented Gold Star at numerous discovery hearings needed to secure key documents and testimony from the defendant before the matter was favorably resolved.


Texas Screw Products v. Medders, 2009. Richard assisted lead counsel in representing a manufacturer against a high-level employee who took company trade secrets and started a competing business. Within days after the theft was first discovered, Jackson Walker filed a claim, sought and obtained expedited document and computer hard drive production, conducted a deposition of the defendant, and favorably resolved the dispute.

Banking Industry

CPIF Lending, LLC v. KCC International, LLC, 2016.  Richard represented CPIF Lending as lead counsel in a suit concerning a hotel in Harris County, Texas.  Richard secured a receivership over the hotel and worked with other Jackson Walker attorneys to sell the property in order to pay the debt owed to CPIF.  In addition, Richard obtained summary judgment against a second lien holder who attempted to invalidate CPIF’s prime lien.


IberiaBank v. Cleveland Imaging, 2014. After a hospital and its guarantors defaulted on their obligations to Iberia, Richard secured the pre-judgment appointment of a receiver over the hospital.  During the receivership, the hospital was sold to pay the debt owed to Iberia Bank.


Texas Capital Bank, N.A. v. Saberioon, 2013. Richard obtained a judgment in excess of $3.5 million against a debtor and led post-judgment discovery to secure payment of the debt.


Shi v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. 2013. A plaintiff sued on an allegedly stolen check that was deposited at Chase Bank. Richard quickly deposed the plaintiff and moved for summary judgment based on her admissions. The court granted summary judgment against the plaintiff just eight months after the bank answered the lawsuit.


Alonso v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., 2013. Richard served as lead trial counsel for Chase Bank. He removed the action filed in state court, successfully defended against remand, and secured summary judgment for the bank within six months after lawsuit was filed.


Compass Bank v. Sunbelt Multimedia Co., 2012. Richard assisted lead counsel in representing Compass Bank against a media group that operated a television station in South Texas. Richard drafted the briefing related to the bank’s claims and its request that a federal district judge appoint a pre-judgment receiver to operate the highly-indebted station until it could be sold.  The court granted the bank’s request, and the station was subsequently sold in order to pay the debt owed to Compass Bank.


Brenda Johnson v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., 2011. Richard served as lead trial counsel, defending Chase Bank against breach of contract, UCC, and deceptive trade practice act claims related to a cashier’s check. The jury found for Chase Bank, and the judgment ordered the plaintiff to pay Chase Bank’s attorneys’ fees.


Nationstar Mortgage, LLC v. Capital One, N.A., 2010 (trial) and 2011 (appeal). Richard served as lead trial and appellate counsel, defending Capital One against a UCC conversion claim brought by a mortgage company. Although the trial court granted judgment for the plaintiff, the Fourteenth Court of Appeals of Texas unanimously reversed that judgment and rendered judgment for Capital One, on the basis that the mortgage company failed to prove that it obtained a valid assignment of the check at issue and had standing to bring its claim. 2011 WL 3332145 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.]  2011, no pet.).


Wood v. Chase BankCard Services, LLC, 2009. Richard served as lead trial counsel on behalf of Chase in two separate jury trials where the plaintiff alleged violations of federal and state laws. In both trials, the jury found in favor of Chase.

Health Care and Erisa

CHRISTUS v. [Confidential], 2014. Richard served as lead counsel for a CHRISTUS hospital in an arbitration hearing involving two contracts. After a four-day arbitration involving seven witnesses and more than 100 exhibits, the arbitrator awarded the CHRISTUS hospital more than $1.25 million (~90% of the amount claimed).


UnitedHealth Group Cases, 2008-2013. Richard helped defend UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries against multiple prompt payment arbitrations and multiple bid protest actions.


Martinez v. Texas HealthSpring, LLC, 2013. Richard wrote a summary judgment motion on behalf of a Medicare Advantage entity seeking dismissal of the plaintiff’s claims due to his failure to exhaust his administrative remedies prior to filing suit in Texas district court. The court granted summary judgment for Jackson Walker’s client and dismissed all of the plaintiff’s claims.


Chapman v. Supplemental Benefit Retirement Plan of LIN Television Corp., 2012. Richard assisted in obtaining summary judgment in favor of the defendant in an ERISA case brought by a former executive. 861 F.Supp.2d 41 (D.R.I. 2012).

Education and career[edit]
Born in New York City, New York, Holwell received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Villanova University in 1967 and a Juris Doctor from Columbia University School of Law in 1970. He graduated from Cambridge University School of Criminology in 1971.[1] He was in private practice of law in New York City, from 1971 to 2003, becoming a partner at White & Case LLP. There, his practice concentrated on securities, antitrust, bankruptcy and financial-market matters, as well as civil and criminal investigations before the Securities and Exchange Commission, Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission.[2] Holwell also represented former New York governor George Pataki in a case that upheld the governor's authority to remove a district attorney who opposed the death penalty.[3]
Federal judicial service[edit]
On August 1, 2002, Holwell was nominated by President George W. Bush to a seat on the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, vacated by Barrington Daniels Parker Jr.. The initial nomination having not succeeded, Holwell was renominated for the position on January 7, 2003 and was confirmed by the United States Senate on September 17, 2003, after the White House and New York senator Charles Schumer resolved a long-running feud over the selection process for New York judges.[4] Holwell received his commission on September 22, 2003. On February 7, 2012, Holwell resigned from the bench to found Holwell Shuster & Goldberg LLP, a boutique commercial litigation firm, with two former Kasowitz Benson Torres & Friedman LLP partners.[5][6]
Noteworthy cases[edit]

In August 2008, Holwell granted habeas corpus relief to a prisoner with a history of mental illness who had served nine years in prison for stealing eight dollars. Holwell ruled that a New York state court violated the prisoner's due process rights when it refused to allow him to contest a social worker's conclusion that he was competent to stand trial.[7]
In April 2008, Holwell ruled that New York City could lawfully require fast food restaurants to post calorie information on their menus.[8]
In March 2007, Holwell issued an opinion on the res judicata effects of U.S. class action judgments in jurisdictions outside the U.S., ruling that certain European plaintiffs could join a shareholder lawsuit against Vivendi that asserted claims under U.S. law.[9]
In January 2004, Holwell ordered the federal Bureau of Prisons to reconsider a policy that precluded a prisoner from being assigned to a halfway house until 90% of his sentence was served.[10]
