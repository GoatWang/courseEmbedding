To see this page as it is meant to appear please use a Javascript enabled browser.    BOC Can't say enough good stuff about Rettinger Fireplace! Really happy we chose them for our new fireplace. The showroom is so nice and they had so many burning displays to choose from. My husband and I will recommend them to all our friends and family!    Lisa B. Joe was out here today, and he installed the log. He is a great guy and did a perfect job! I have to say that it looks really beautiful, and we couldn't be happier:-) Thanks so much for all of your help Angie. Best, Lisa    Sheila M. I wanted to thank you for helping repair the fireplace screen. I am thrilled the spray coating of black worked to remove the white film. Your service has been tremendous and I can see why you are so highly rated. I appreciate all you did.    Myrna Rodriguez We love our fireplace. Alexis gave us fantastic advice and guided every step of the transaction. Every aspect from purchase to installation was a pleasure. The fireplace improved the family room aesthetically, and it is so cozy that we actually wanted a colder winter so we could use it more. Can’t wait till next winter!     prevnext
