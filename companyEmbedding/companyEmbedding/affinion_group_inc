Affinion Group, Inc. Key Developments

Affinion Group Holdings, Inc. and Affinion Group, Inc. Enter into New Senior Secured Credit Facility
May 12 17
On May 10, 2017, Affinion Group entered into a new senior secured credit facility (the New Credit Facility) among Affinion Holdings, Affinion Group, as borrower, the lenders party thereto from time to time, HPS Investment Partners, LLC, as administrative agent and collateral agent for the lenders, and HPS Investment Partners, LLC, as lead arranger, syndication agent, documentation agent and bookrunner. Affinion Group used the proceeds of the New Credit Facility to refinance its existing credit facility (the “Credit Agreement Refinancing”), redeem all of the outstanding 7.5% Cash/PIK Senior Notes due 2018 of Affinion International Holdings Limited (the “International Notes”) and discharge the indenture governing the International Notes (the “International Note Redemption”), pay costs and expenses in connection with the New Credit Facility, the Credit Agreement Refinancing, International Note Redemption and the Exchange Offers and for other general corporate purposes. The New Credit Facility matures on May 10, 2022 and consists of a $110 million revolving credit facility, which will reduce to $80 million on May 10, 2018, and a $1.34 billion term loan facility. The term loan facility provides for quarterly amortization payments totaling for the first 2 years following the closing date, 1% per annum, for the third year following the closing date, 2.5% per annum and for each year thereafter 5% per annum, in each case, payable quarterly, with the balance payable upon the final maturity date. The amounts of the quarterly amortization payments will be reduced by certain prepayments. In addition, the New Credit Facility requires Affinion Group to prepay outstanding term loans with: 100% of the net cash proceeds of asset sales and dispositions in excess of an amount per transaction and in the aggregate per year, subject, in certain cases, to the ability to reinvest such net cash proceeds; provided that the net cash proceeds of certain asset sales and dispositions will be required to prepay outstanding term loans without reinvestment rights and subject to a make-whole premium on or prior to the first anniversary of the closing date, and a prepayment premium at a price reflected as a percentage of the principal amount of (x) 103% after the first anniversary but on or prior to the second anniversary of the closing date, 101% after the second anniversary but on or prior to the third anniversary of the closing date and (z) 100% thereafter; 100% of the net cash proceeds from any insurance or condemnation event, subject to customary reinvestment provisions; 100% of the net cash proceeds from extraordinary and non-recurring cash receipts in excess of an amount per receipt; 50% of Affinion Group’s excess cash flow beginning with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017 (reducing to 25% if Affinion Group’s senior secured leverage ratio is less than or equal to 3.5:1.0 and to 0% if Affinion Group’s senior secured leverage ratio is less than or equal to 2.5:1.0); and 100% of the net cash proceeds received from issuances of debt, subject to certain exclusions including certain debt permitted to be incurred under the New Credit Facility.

                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.

Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy

                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        Affinion Group, Inc. has received 3.76 out of 5 stars based on 17 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

Affinion Group is a private company based in Stamford, Connecticut that provides customer engagement and loyalty programs. Affinion designs, markets, and services programs that deal with customer relationships for other businesses. The company claims to reach 250 million consumers in 20 countries. In 2016, Affinion Group was cited by Forbes as number 321 on its list of largest private companies.[2]
In 2016, Affinion reported a worldwide workforce of approximately 3,000. As of March, 2015, the company had not reported a profit since 2004.[3] According to its Bloomberg Business profile at the end of 2014, Affinion had about 5,500 marketing partners, 59 million subscribers in membership and insurance services, and 62 million customers for loyalty programs and credit or debit card enhancement services.[4]
Affinion markets accidental death and dismemberment policies to banks, to be provided to consumers as 'customer appreciation'.[5]
Complaints, Court Cases, Convictions, and Settlements for Fraudulent Practices[edit]
Affinion has paid millions of dollars in civil claims and state attorney general claims, in 47 states, for unfair and deceptive trade practices, and faces multiple class-action lawsuits.[6][7] See also U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts case number: 1:14-cv-10283. For example, Afinion settled a case with the State of New York for consumer fraud, as a result of which a fund is maintained to fully reimburse people whose money was stolen by Affinion's fraudulent practices.[8]
On March 7, 2005, the company made a Settlement Agreement with the Office of the Attorney General of Florida. Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act, Chapter 501, Part II, Florida Statutes.[9]
In July, 2005, the Attorney's General of Connecticut, California, and Maine brought a lawsuit against TLG/Affinion for allegedly deceiving consumers into enrolling in its clubs.[10] [11]
In December, 2006 Trilegiant settled allegations of deceptive selling practices for failing to inform customers of auto-renewal on their membership products.[12]
In 2013, Affinion settled allegations with 47 states that its companies misled consumers regarding membership in discount clubs. A $19 million fund was instituted to refund customers who had been subject to unauthorized charges.[13]
Affinion acted as a third-party vendor for US Bank, which in 2014 was fined $9 million and compelled to pay $47 million in restitution, to resolve allegations that it had charged consumers for services that had not been provided. A spokesman for the bank said "We will be compensating customers who did not receive full services from Affinion, and providing our apology." According to an Affinion spokesman, some consumers were mistakenly billed for services, even though they had not provided the necessary authenticating information. In 2012, Capital One Financial was also fined over add-on products provided by Affinion.[14]
In July 2015, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced that Affinion had billed customers for services that had not actually been provided, claiming that the company owed consumers $6.8 million in refunds, and would have to pay civil penalties amounting to $1.9 million.[15]
