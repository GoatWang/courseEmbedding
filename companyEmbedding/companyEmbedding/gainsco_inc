GAINSCO (OTC Pink: GANS) is a Dallas, Texas-based holding company established in 1978 in Fort Worth, Texas by Joseph Macchia, who resigned from the enterprise in 1998 to pursue other interests.
GAINSCO’s insurance operation was originally chartered as an underwriter of Commercial risks; operations that were discontinued and placed in a run-off in 2002. The Company marketed its commercial insurance through managing general agents, using “GAINSCO” and the block super-scribed letters “GA” as its primary logo identifiers. These were derived from the abbreviated version of the name of the Company’s its primary insurance subsidiary at that time, General Agents Insurance Company of America, Inc. This commercial insurance company was sold in 2007.
An acquisition in the late 1990s of a Florida-based managing general agency and claims operation specializing in the non-standard personal automobile business established the cornerstone for GAINSCO’s insurance marketing focus today. The Company completed a capital restructuring in 2005 which set the base for developing its business model. It consolidated its headquarters in Dallas, Texas in 2005.
The Company, through its insurance brand, GAINSCO Auto Insurance®, specializes in minimum-limits personal auto coverage and actively distributes its nonstandard personal auto products through independent retail agents in Southwest and Sunbelt states. Its insurance company subsidiary (domiciled in Texas) is MGA Insurance Company, Inc., and sponsors the No. 99 Red Dragon™ McLaren 650s GT3 GAINSCO/Bob Stallings™ racecar.[1][2] In addition, the Company owns and operates a franchised Hyundai automobile dealership in Dallas, Texas.[3]
Beginning in 2005, a newly created GAINSCO logo mark incorporated a rising arrow in its name to inspire a progressively upward company. It was at this time that GAINSCO’s logo mark was first placed on a racecar owned by our Chairman of the Board, Robert Stallings. Registered marks include GAINSCO Auto Insurance®[4] and Are You Driven®.[5]
The Company’s insurance business has grown from a gross premiums written level of $112 million in 2005 to $227 million in 2015. Total shareholders’ equity (on a GAAP basis) increased from $57 million to $96 million over the same period. In addition, during this time period the A.M. Best rating of the insurance subsidiary has increased three times moving from a “Vulnerable” financial strength rating of “B-” to the current “Secure” financial strength rating of “B++” with a stable outlook. The entry into the automobile dealership business in late 2013 provided another avenue for expansion opportunities.
The Company in early 2011 approved the voluntary suspension of its duty to file reports with the SEC and the voluntary deregistration of its common stock. The Company was eligible to suspend its reporting obligations and deregister its common stock because there were fewer than 300 holders of record of the Company’s common stock. This decision resulted in expense savings and reduced reporting burdens.
The GAINSCO leadership team is deep in industry talent and expertise. Robert Stallings, GAINSCO’s Chairman, has a successful track record of building and managing financial services companies and is actively involved in the strategic leadership and organizational management. Glenn Anderson, CEO and President, has enjoyed significant success over his thirty-year career in the insurance industry. A former Executive Vice President and Divisional President with USF&G, Mr. Anderson joined GAINSCO in 1998.[6] The Company’s Board of Directors and named Executive Officers own a significant majority of the outstanding common stock.
GAINSCO’s insurance operations consist of about 400 employees with about 250 employees in its Dallas home office. A separate Miami office has approximately 80 employees; the balance of the employee population is field based across the multiple states of operation.
The automobile dealership operation, located in South Dallas, has approximately 45 employees.[citation needed]

Composite Score:





                        GAINSCO, INC. has received 2.79 out of 5 stars based on 2 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of B.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

GAINSCO, INC., is a Dallas, Texas-based holding company that through its insurance brand, GAINSCO Auto Insurance, distributes nonstandard personal automobile insurance products through independent retail agents in Florida, South Carolina, Texas, Arizona, Nevada and New Mexico, and through an independent managing general agency in California.  
Guidewire ClaimCenter® was deployed as GAINSCO's new end-to-end claims handling system for all auto claims. ClaimCenter is now in production use by the company’s 175 claims staff who are distributed across three regional claims centers.  Guidewire ClaimCenter was selected in large part due to the system’s scalability, breadth and depth of functionality, and its modern Java EE architecture.  Designed and developed as a web-based system, ClaimCenter fit well with GAINSCO’s corporate technology strategy.






We found Guidewire ClaimCenter to be significantly ahead of other systems on the market. Our Guidewire implementation project was the smoothest we have ever experienced – and it came in both on time and on budget.Phil West, CIO, GAINSCOGuidewire ClaimCenter provides the capability for our claims adjusters to work more effectively. ClaimCenter uses business rules to allow us to automate workflows and tasks in order to enhance our ability to leverage best practices across our organization. Additionally, real-time management information affords the opportunity to identify and address handling and process issues before impacting service or financial outcomes.Greg Castleman, Senior Vice President, Claims, GAINSCO
