 It is now 1962, and the Nonnatus House team is as committed to caring for the people of Poplar as always. However, the social revolution in the outside world is mirrored by change and challenge much closer to home. As they strive to help mothers and families cope with the demands of childbearing, disability, disease and social prejudice, our beloved medics must fight battles of their own.

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsbut the remainder of the series (6) is excellent.BySusan Lamphereon June 14, 2017Format: Amazon Video|Verified PurchaseMost series don't manage to maintain a high standard of story line, performance and script. Often the characters mysteriously change personality with different script writers. However, in this series we see development and evolution, as opposed to radical change as the years pass by. The Christmas Special was a little disappointing, but the remainder of the series (6) is excellent.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsNice Historical FictionByKarenon May 25, 2017Format: Amazon Video|Verified PurchaseI watched the first 5 seasons on Netflix and jumped over to Amazon for season 6. It is a wonderful show - I love historical fiction; love the characters even when they seem to disappear without a trace or when a nun makes a statement that isn't really following the Catholic faith. Overall great series. I'm glad that there will be a season 7!Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsBEST SHOW EVER IN TELEVISION!!!!!!!!!!Bycheryl crichfield.on June 25, 2017Format: Amazon Video|Verified PurchaseThe overall best show ever put on television.  Educational without being boring, heartfelt without sappyness. The death of the beloved Sister was handled with such tenderness it was hard to believe it was TELEVISION.  A show for the entire family that educates,loves, and makes you examine your soul and where it stands.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsBest show on tv, bar none!ByJ.
