Mohawk Industries, Inc.
Conflict Minerals
“Conflict Minerals” refers to gold, columbite-tantalite (coltan), cassiterite, wolframite, and their respective derivatives, which are limited to tantalum, tin and tungsten.  In July 2010, the United States passed legislation requiring all U.S. public companies to disclose the chain of custody of conflict minerals mined in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries, where revenues may directly or indirectly finance armed groups engaged in civil war resulting in serious social and environmental abuses.
Conflict minerals constitute a very small part of the Company’s supply chain needs.  Nevertheless, the Company is committed to sourcing such minerals responsibly.  To the extent conflict minerals are used in any of our products, we have confirmed with our suppliers that none of such minerals are sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo or an adjoining country.

Care & Maintenance Tips






Vacuum Regularly
Vacuum your carpets once a week for a long-lasting, like-new appearance.





Remove Stains
Dab a coffee spill with white vinegar, then with diluted detergent (1/4 tsp. per qt. of water) to remove the stain.





Clip Sprouts
If carpeting looks uneven, use scissors to clip sprouts or snags. Don't pull themâ€”you could damage the carpet.






Carpet Care







Why Carpet?

        Carpeting adds warmth and comfort to your home by increasing the sound absorption and insulation, ensuring your floor is warm in winter and cool in summer. Mohawk carpet can be easily installed over many kinds of surfaces, even hiding irregularities in your subflooring. A carpeted floor is a beautiful, functional, and economical flooring option for families with kids and pets.
    

        More than anything, carpet manufacturers like Mohawk have your specific lifestyle in mind. That's why we innovated the softest, most family-friendly and pet-friendly carpets ever. Our carpet stands up to high-traffic wear and resists life's spills and stains like never before. With so many colors and textures to choose from, there's no reason to put off buying new carpet. With Mohawk, you're sure to find carpeting that suits both your lifestyle and your budget.

Hardwood Performance Factors






Construction
Where will your new flooring go? Solid hardwood flooring should only be installed on grade and above, while engineered hardwood works on any level.





Species
Wood species vary in hardness and light sensitivity, so keep foot traffic, furniture, and light exposure in mind when choosing a species.





Class
Going for a natural look, or want something more uniform? A higher hardwood class will have fewer natural variations, knots, and mineral marks.






Learn About Hardwood





Care & Maintenance
Keep your wood floors in top condition.





Care & Maintenance Tips






Sweep Regularly
Vacuum or sweep with a soft-bristle broom to prevent buildup that can scratch wood surfaces.





Reduce Fading
Use protective window coverings and move rugs and furniture periodically to help flooring age evenly.





Prevent Damage
Attach felt pads under furniture legs and remove rough or spike-heeled shoes before walking across the floor.

More About Hardwood

        Hardwood flooring is the traditional hallmark for taste, style, and performance. Prized for its natural beauty and lasting durability, hardwood in the home makes a rich visual statement but keeps cleanup a breeze. That's why hardwood floors are the perfect combination of strength and style for homes with both children and pets. Today's wide variety of colors, textures, species, and styles make it easy to find the perfect choice for your home.
    






ENGINEERED HARDWOOD FLOORING


                Made from real hardwood, the cross-ply construction of Mohawk’s engineered wood flooring resists expansion and contraction from humidity changes. Engineered hardwood floors can be installed below, on or above grade.
            






SOLID WOOD FLOORING


                Each plank is a solid piece of wood from the finest domestic and exotic hardwoods. Hardwood floors are best installed on or above grade.

Choosing Your Tile Floors






Ceramic vs. Porcelain
While ceramic tile offers a wide selection of colors, textures, and styles, porcelain tile is more durable, water resistant, and works for covered exteriors.





Size & Pattern
Smaller tiles can help a room feel less constricted, while larger tile brings order to open spaces. Likewise, patterns are best used in proportion to the space.





Form & Function
Ideal for kitchens and bathrooms, tile resists scratches, moisture, bacteria, and odors. Plus, it’s a beautiful design choice for countertops, backsplashes, mosaics, and wall tiles.






Learn About Tile





Care & Maintenance
How to take care of your tile flooring.





Care & Maintenance Tips






Mop Regularly
After sweeping or vacuuming, damp mop tile with water only. Glazed, unglazed, stone, glass, and soft clay tiles require different cleaning agents.





Floor Mats
Cover entrances with floor mats to prevent corrosives from being tracked in. Mats over frequent standing areas (like a kitchen sink) can help reduce tile wear. 





Protective Pads
Attach felt or protective pads to furniture legs, to reduce scratching and pressure. Add them to outdoor metal furniture, which can cause rust and staining.






More Tile Care







Tile for Walls & Flooring

        With a wide selection of colors, textures, and sizes in rustic, refined, and casual looks, tile has unlimited applications in a stylish home: tile flooring, backsplashes, countertops, mosaics, and wall tiles. The benefits of ceramic tile flooring include its exquisite and sophisticated look, extreme durability, great versatility, easy maintenance, and safety.
    

        Porcelain is one of the hardest-working tile choices out there. Its dense material is highly water resistant and withstands exposure to freezing and thawing. Ideal for kitchens and bathrooms, tile resists scratches, moisture, bacteria, and odors. With the right care and maintenance routine, your tile floors, walls, and countertops will look great and last for many years to come.

History[edit]
William Shuttleworth and his four sons arrived in the United States in 1875 and set up a carpet mill in the Hudson Valley upon arrival. After William Shuttleworth died, the four sons moved to Amsterdam, New York in 1878 and took over an empty factory there.[5] The company incorporated as the Shuttleworth Brothers Company in 1902.[6]
The company adopted the name Mohawk Carpet Mills (or Mohawk Mills, for short) in 1920, when it merged with McCleary, Wallin and Crouse, another mill in Amsterdam.[7] It became the country's sole weaver to offer an entire line of domestic carpets, also creating the industry's first textured design and sculptured weave.[6]
In 1956, Mohawk Carpet Mills merged with Alexander Smith, Inc. to become Mohasco Corporation, a company large enough to appear on the first Fortune 500 rankings. Mohasco faced competition from new tufted carpet operations in Georgia, which used synthetic fibers such as nylon and polyester rather than the traditional wool used in woven carpets. To compete in a changing industry, Mohasco gradually moved manufacturing south into the Carolinas and eventually Georgia. In 1963, the company turned some of its attention to furniture manufacturing.
Carpet manufacturing at the Amsterdam site ended by 1968 and the last corporate offices left by 1987.[5] In 1988, Mohasco was purchased by MHS Holdings in a leveraged buyout, and the company's carpet business was spun off from Mohasco to form Mohawk Industries.[7][2]
In 1992, Mohawk went public with its shared traded first on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "NMS" and currently on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "MHK."[8] Mohasco's remaining assets were sold to other investors, and the company was later dissolved. Through 2016, Mohawk Industries has acquired 34 companies into its conglomerate, and now operates manufacturing facilities in 15 countries—the U.S., Mexico, Brazil, Ireland, the U.K., Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Spain, Italy, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Russia and Malaysia.[6] The company's present Chairman and CEO is Jeffrey Lorberbaum.
Mohawks brands include American Olean, Bigelow, Columbia Wood Flooring, Daltile, Durkan, IVC, Karastan, Kerama Marazzi, Lees, Marazzi, Moduleo, Mohawk, Mohawk Home, Pergo, Quick-Step and Unilin.[9]
Mohawk Industries, Inc. v. Carpenter[edit]
In 2009, it was involved in the Supreme Court case Mohawk Industries, Inc. v. Carpenter. The court found against Mohawk Industries, in a 9-0 decision.[10]

History[edit]
William Shuttleworth and his four sons arrived in the United States in 1875 and set up a carpet mill in the Hudson Valley upon arrival. After William Shuttleworth died, the four sons moved to Amsterdam, New York in 1878 and took over an empty factory there.[5] The company incorporated as the Shuttleworth Brothers Company in 1902.[6]
The company adopted the name Mohawk Carpet Mills (or Mohawk Mills, for short) in 1920, when it merged with McCleary, Wallin and Crouse, another mill in Amsterdam.[7] It became the country's sole weaver to offer an entire line of domestic carpets, also creating the industry's first textured design and sculptured weave.[6]
In 1956, Mohawk Carpet Mills merged with Alexander Smith, Inc. to become Mohasco Corporation, a company large enough to appear on the first Fortune 500 rankings. Mohasco faced competition from new tufted carpet operations in Georgia, which used synthetic fibers such as nylon and polyester rather than the traditional wool used in woven carpets. To compete in a changing industry, Mohasco gradually moved manufacturing south into the Carolinas and eventually Georgia. In 1963, the company turned some of its attention to furniture manufacturing.
Carpet manufacturing at the Amsterdam site ended by 1968 and the last corporate offices left by 1987.[5] In 1988, Mohasco was purchased by MHS Holdings in a leveraged buyout, and the company's carpet business was spun off from Mohasco to form Mohawk Industries.[7][2]
In 1992, Mohawk went public with its shared traded first on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "NMS" and currently on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "MHK."[8] Mohasco's remaining assets were sold to other investors, and the company was later dissolved. Through 2016, Mohawk Industries has acquired 34 companies into its conglomerate, and now operates manufacturing facilities in 15 countries—the U.S., Mexico, Brazil, Ireland, the U.K., Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Spain, Italy, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Russia and Malaysia.[6] The company's present Chairman and CEO is Jeffrey Lorberbaum.
Mohawks brands include American Olean, Bigelow, Columbia Wood Flooring, Daltile, Durkan, IVC, Karastan, Kerama Marazzi, Lees, Marazzi, Moduleo, Mohawk, Mohawk Home, Pergo, Quick-Step and Unilin.[9]
Mohawk Industries, Inc. v. Carpenter[edit]
In 2009, it was involved in the Supreme Court case Mohawk Industries, Inc. v. Carpenter. The court found against Mohawk Industries, in a 9-0 decision.[10]
