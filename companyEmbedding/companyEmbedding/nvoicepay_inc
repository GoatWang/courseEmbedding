Comments:  ACG Texas initiated our first payment run with NVP on 2/7/14.   Since that time, I worked with NVP to successfully implement this payment solution process with the other three companies under the Summit Restaurant Group umbrella.
We find the system very user-friendly for our companies and our vendors.  Maneuvering through the screens is very easy and required very little training.  We use some of the reports while researching vendor statements and find it has streamlined that previously arduous task.  
The ACH and CC Payment process have reduced the number of requests to void and reissue checks due to nonreceipt which, in turn, has reduced bank fees. 
Obviously, we have enjoyed reduced costs when compared to paying vendors with a check - check stock, envelopes, postage fees and administrative staff labor and have found the rebate program to be very lucrative.  
The Customer Service Staff is typically extremely courteous and helpful.  They understand the sense of urgency to resolve any challenges we have encountered.  
I would like to see the site speed increased moving through screens or searching for vendor data.  Additionally, I would like to see the parameters that I set up remain in place when I hit the Back button.  Other than these issues, we find the process and people at NVoicePay truly walk the talk.

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.
