	VICON REPORTS FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE SECOND QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2017









	HAUPPAUGE, N.Y


	. -


	 May 15, 2017 -


	Vicon Industries, Inc. (NYSE MKT: VII), a global producer of end-to-end security solutions, today announced its financial results for its second fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2017.









	Vicon’s CEO John Badke said, "The Company’s results for the quarter reflect an expected reduction in revenues, driven primarily by decreased sales of our legacy product offerings. However, we were pleased to launch our new Valerus video management system (VMS) platform in the quarter, which has received very positive feedback from the market. Significant enhancements to this platform, as well as to the Company’s camera line, were featured at the security industry’s largest annual trade show in early April and will be available for release by the end of June 2017. We believe that Valerus is the next generation enterprise level VMS platform that embodies the ease of use, openness and flexibility the market will come to demand from their overly complicated legacy systems. We have also ramped up our sales and marketing activities in anticipation of increasing market demand for our new solutions."









	In April 2017, the Company entered into an amended Credit Agreement with its current lender, which essentially freed up $2 million of availability under its $6 million credit line that was previously subject to a borrowing base formula, extended the facility maturity date to April 2019 and relaxed its minimum tangible net worth financial covenant. The Company expects to continue to draw on this facility to finance its near term working capital needs and is considering additional financing options.









	Second Quarter Fiscal 2017 Financial Results









	Revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 decreased 25% to $6.0 million as compared to $8.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. The $2.0 million decrease in the current quarter included a $1.6 million, or 26%, decrease in sales in the Americas market and a $380,000, or 22%, decrease in EMEA market sales.  Revenues weakened across all market segments due principally to a continuing reliance on legacy product offerings and the continuing market effects of previously reported camera line issues. Order intake for the current quarter decreased $518,000 to $6.8 million as compared to $7.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2016.









	Gross profit margins were 37.4% for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 as compared to 33.0% for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Prior year quarter margins were negatively impacted by recognition of $150,000 (1.9%) of additional inventory provisions relating to the rework and transition of the Company's IQinVision camera line to a new contract manufacturing partner. Operating expenses for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 decreased $7.0 million to $4.1 million compared with $11.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. In the prior year quarter, the Company charged off its entire $6.0 million goodwill carrying value originating from the August 2014 IQinVision business combination. Excluding the effects of the prior year quarter goodwill write-off, operating expenses decreased $975,000 in the current quarter due to ongoing selling, general and administrative cost reduction initiatives.









	Net loss for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 was $1.9 million, or $.20 per basic and diluted share, as compared to a net loss of $7.7 million, or $.82 per basic and diluted share, in the second quarter of fiscal 2016.
