Nine Months Ended June 30, June 30, 2016 2015 Change Cash used in operating activities $ (25,134 ) $ (47,332 ) $ 22,198 Cash provided by financing activities - 72,200 (72,200 ) Cash and cash equivalents end of period $ 2,141 $ 28,793 $ (26,652 )  As of June 30, 2016, we had cash or cash equivalents of $2,141.  Net cash used in operating activities was $25,134 for the nine months ended June 30, 2016 and net cash used in operating activities was $47,332 for the nine months ended June 30, 2015. During the nine month ended June 30, 2016 we incurred a net loss of $37,301, which was primarily the cause of the increase in our net cash used in operating activities.  From inception (September 24, 2014) through June 30, 2016, we did not use any cash for investing activities.  Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended June 30, 2016 was $0, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $72,200 for the nine months ended June 30, 2015. During the nine months ended June 30, 2015, we received $72,200 from the issuance of 15,720,000 shares of common stock to a founder and unaffiliated investors.  There is limited historical financial information about us on which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are a development stage company and have not yet commenced business operations or generated any revenues. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources, possible delays in our branding efforts, and possible cost overruns due to the price and cost increases in supplies and services.  If we do not raise or generate revenues sufficient to cover professional fees, estimated to be $25,000 for the next 12 months, we would not be able to remain reporting with the SEC, and therefore we would not be able to obtain an OTC Markets quotation, nor would we be able to maintain our listing, if accepted on the OTCQB.  While the officers and directors have generally indicated a willingness to provide services and financial contributions if necessary, there are presently no agreements, arrangements, commitments, or specific understandings, either verbally or in writing, between the officers and directors and Killer Waves. During the next year of operations, our officers and directors will also provide their labor at no charge.  Table of Contents  If we are unable to meet our needs for cash from either our revenues or possible alternative sources, then we may be unable to continue, develop, or expand our operations.  We have no plans to undertake any product research and development during the next twelve months. There are also no plans or expectations to acquire or sell any plant or plant equipment in the next year of operations.  Going Concern  We have a history of operating losses, as we have focused our efforts on raising capital and building our services. The report of our independent auditors issued on our financial statements as of and for the year ended September 30, 2015, expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our obtaining additional adequate capital to fund additional operating losses until we become profitable. If we are unable to obtain adequate capital, we could be forced to cease operations.  Critical Accounting Policy and Estimates  We prepare our financial statements in conformity with GAAP, which requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions and apply judgments. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be important at the time the financial statements are prepared and actual results could differ from our estimates and such differences could be material. We have identified below the critical accounting policies which are assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain and that are of critical importance in the presentation of our condensed financial statements. Due to the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain, materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. On a regular basis, we review our critical accounting policies and how they are applied in the preparation our condensed financial statements.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.

	Item 20.




	Indemnification of Directors and Officers.






	Group 1 Automotive, Inc.





	Delaware




	Section 145(a) of
	the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the DGCL), which Group 1 Automotive, Inc. is subject to, provides that a corporation may indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any
	threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the fact that the person is or was a director, officer,
	employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including
	attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed
	to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the persons conduct was unlawful. Section 145(b) of the DGCL provides that a
	corporation may indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that
	the person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
	enterprise against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably
	believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation
	unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person
	is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper. To the extent that a present or former director or officer of a corporation has been successful on the merits or
	otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in subsections (a) and (b) of Section 145 of the DGCL, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against expenses
	(including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith.


	Any indemnification under
	subsections (a) and (b) of Section 145 of the DGCL (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the present or former director,
	officer, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because the person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in subsections (a) and (b) of Section 145. Such determination shall be made, with respect to a person
	who is a director or officer at the time of such determination, (1) by a majority vote of the directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum, or (2) by a committee of such directors
	designated by majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum, or (3) if there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (4) by the stockholders. Expenses
	(including attorneys fees) incurred by an officer or director in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding may be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit
	or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation as authorized in this section.
	Such expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by former directors and officers or other employees and agents may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the corporation deems appropriate. The indemnification and


	 


	II-1





	advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, Section 145 shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses
	may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in such persons official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office.


	Section 145 of the DGCL also empowers a corporation to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director,
	officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability
	asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such persons status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability under
	Section 145.


	Article Six, Part II, of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that directors, officers, employees and
	agents shall be indemnified to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL. Section 6.1 of Group 1 Realty, Inc.s Bylaws provides that directors, officers, employees and agents shall be indemnified to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL.


	We entered into an indemnification agreement with each of our directors and certain of our executive officers. The indemnification
	agreements provide that we indemnify each of our directors and certain of our executive officers to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL. This means, among other things, that we must indemnify the indemnitee against expenses (including
	attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement that are actually and reasonably incurred in an action, suit or proceeding by reason of the fact that the person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of Group 1 or is
	or was serving at the request of Group 1 as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or other entity if the indemnitee acted in good faith and, in the case of conduct in his or her official capacity, in a manner he or she
	reasonably believed to be in the best interests of Group 1 and, in all other cases, not opposed to the best interests of Group 1. Also, the indemnification agreements require that we advance expenses in defending such an action provided that the
	indemnitee undertakes to repay the amounts if the person ultimately is determined not to be entitled to indemnification.


	In general, the
	disinterested directors on the board of directors or a committee of the board of directors designated by majority vote of the board of directors have the authority to determine an indemnitees right to indemnification. However, such
	determination may also be made by (i) if there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, independent legal counsel in a written opinion or (ii) the stockholders.


	All agreements and obligations of Group 1 contained in the indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our executive officers
	(i) continue during the period the indemnitee is a director or officer of Group 1 (or is or was serving at our request as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, limited liability
	company or other enterprise) and (ii) continue thereafter so long as the indemnitee is subject to any possible proceeding for which the indemnitee is entitled to indemnification (notwithstanding the fact that the indemnitee has ceased to serve
	Group 1).


	We carry directors and officers liability coverages designed to insure our officers and directors and those of our subsidiaries
	against certain liabilities incurred by them in the performance of their duties, and also providing for reimbursement in certain cases to us and our subsidiaries for sums paid to directors and officers as indemnification for similar liability.


	Additionally, Section 18-108 of the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act provides that, subject to such standards and restrictions, if any,
	as are set forth in its limited liability company agreement, a limited liability company may, and shall have the power to, indemnify and hold harmless any member or manager or other person from and against any and all claims and demands whatsoever.
	The limited liability company agreement of each Delaware limited liability company that is a registrant hereunder provides generally for the indemnification of the members of each respective limited liability company.


	 


	II-2





	The general effect of the foregoing is to provide indemnification to officers and directors for
	liabilities that may arise by reason of their status as officers or directors, other than liabilities arising from willful or intentional misconduct, acts or omissions not in good faith, unlawful distributions of corporate assets or transactions
	from which the officer or director derived an improper personal benefit.




	Texas




	Pursuant to Section 1.106 of the Texas Business Organizations Code (the TBOC), the indemnification provisions set forth in the
	TBOC are applicable to most entities established in the state of Texas, including corporations, limited liability companies and limited partnerships.


	Pursuant to Section 8.051 of the TBOC, an enterprise must indemnify a governing person, former governing person or delegate against
	reasonable expenses actually incurred by the person in connection with a proceeding in which the person was a respondent because the person is or was a governing person if the person is wholly successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the defense
	of the proceeding. Pursuant to Sections 8.101 and 8.102 of the TBOC, any governing person, former governing person or delegate of a Texas enterprise may be indemnified against judgments and reasonable expenses actually incurred by the person in
	connection with a proceeding, in which such person was a respondent if it is determined, in accordance with Section 8.103 of the TBOC, that: (i) the person acted in good faith, (ii) reasonably believed (a) in the case of conduct
	in the persons official capacity, that the persons conduct was in the enterprises best interests or (b) in any other case, that the persons conduct was not opposed to the enterprises best interests, (iii) in
	the case of a criminal proceeding, such person did not have a reasonable cause to believe that the persons conduct was unlawful and (iv) that the indemnification should be paid. Indemnification of a person who is found to be liable to the
	enterprise is limited to reasonable expenses actually incurred by the person in connection with the proceeding and does not include judgments, penalties or fines, except for certain circumstances where indemnification cannot be given at all.
	Pursuant to Section 8.105 of the TBOC, an enterprise may indemnify an officer, employee or agent to the same extent that indemnification is required under the TBOC for a governing person or as provided in the enterprises governing
	documents, general or specific action of the enterprises governing authority, contract or by other means.


	The limited partnership
	agreement of each Texas limited partnership that is a registrant hereunder (the Texas LP Registrants) provides that the Texas LP Registrant, its receiver, or its trustee, shall indemnify, hold harmless, and pay all judgments and claims
	against its general partner relating to any liability or damage incurred or suffered by its general partner by reason of any act preformed or omitted to be performed by its general partner or its agents or employees in connection with such Texas LP
	Registrants business, including reasonable attorneys fees incurred by its general partner in connection with the defense of any claim or action based on any such act or omission, except to the extent indemnification is prohibited by law.
	Such liability or damage caused by its general partners acts or omissions in connection with such Texas LP Registrants business includes but is not limited to all liabilities under federal and state securities laws and any
	attorneys fees incurred by its general partner in connection with the defense of any action based on such acts or omissions, which attorneys fees may be paid as incurred. Any indemnification required to be made by a Texas LP Registrant
	will be made promptly following the fixing of any loss, liability or damage incurred or suffered. If, at any time, a Texas LP Registrant has insufficient funds to provide such indemnification, it will provide such indemnification if and as the Texas
	LP Registrant generates sufficient funds, and prior to any distribution to its partners.


	The general effect of the foregoing is to
	provide indemnification to officers and directors for liabilities that may arise by reason of their status as officers or directors, other than liabilities arising from willful or intentional misconduct, acts or omissions not in good faith, unlawful
	distributions of corporate assets or transactions from which the officer or director derived an improper personal benefit.


	Under the
	provisions of Chapter 8 of the TBOC, and the bylaws of each Texas corporation that is a registrant hereunder (the Texas Incorporated Registrants), a Texas Incorporated Registrant may indemnify its


	 


	II-3





	directors, officers, employees and agents and purchase and maintain liability insurance for those persons. Chapter 8 of the TBOC provides that any director or officer of a Texas corporation
	may be indemnified against judgments, penalties, fines, settlements and reasonable expenses actually incurred by him in connection with or in defending any action, suit or proceeding in which he is a party by reason of his position. With respect to
	any proceeding arising from actions taken in his official capacity as a director or officer, he may be indemnified so long as it shall be determined that he conducted himself in good faith and that he reasonably believed that such conduct was in the
	corporations best interests. In cases not concerning conduct in his official capacity as a director or officer, a director may be indemnified as long as he reasonably believed that his conduct was not opposed to the corporations best
	interests. In the case of any criminal proceeding, a director or officer may be indemnified if he had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. If a director or officer is wholly successful, on the merits or otherwise, in connection
	with such a proceeding, such indemnification is mandatory.


	The articles of incorporation of each Texas Incorporated Registrant provide
	for indemnification of its directors to the full extent permitted by applicable law. The bylaws provide, in general, that it will indemnify its directors under the circumstances permitted under the TBOC. If Texas law is amended to authorize the
	further elimination or limitation of directors liability, then the liability of our directors will automatically be limited to the fullest extent provided by law.




	California




	Section 317 of
	the California General Corporation Law (CAGCL) authorizes a court to award, or a corporation to grant, indemnity to officers, directors and other agents for reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the defense or settlement of an
	action by or in the right of the corporation or in a proceeding by reason of the fact that the person is or was an officer, director, or agent of the corporation. Indemnity is available where the person party to a proceeding or action acted in good
	faith and in a manner reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the corporation and its shareholders and, with respect to criminal actions, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. To the extent a corporations
	officer, director or agent is successful on the merits in the defense of any proceeding or any claim, issue or related matter, that person shall be indemnified against expenses actually and reasonably incurred. Under Section 317 of the CAGCL,
	expenses incurred in defending any proceeding may be advanced by the corporation prior to the final disposition of the proceeding upon receipt of any undertaking by or on behalf of the officer, director, employee or agent to repay that amount if it
	is ultimately determined that the person is not entitled to be indemnified. Indemnifications are to be made by a majority vote of a quorum of disinterested directors, or by approval of members not including those persons to be indemnified, or by the
	court in which such proceeding is or was pending upon application made by either the corporation, the agent, the attorney, or other person rendering services in connection with the defense. The indemnification provided by Section 317 is not
	exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification may be entitled.




	Kansas




	The Kansas Revised Limited Liability Company Act, K.S.A. 17-7662 et seq., as amended, provides in K.S.A. 17-7670(a) that subject to such
	standards and restrictions, if any, as are set forth in its operating agreement, a limited liability company may, and shall have the power to, indemnify and hold harmless any member or manager or other person from and against any and all claims and
	demands whatsoever. Further, K.S.A. 17-7670(b) provides that to the extent that a present or former member, manager, officer, employee or agent of a limited liability company has been successful on the merits or otherwise as a plaintiff in an action
	to determine that the plaintiff is a member of a limited liability company or in defense of any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that such
	person is or was a member, manager, officer, employee or agent of the limited liability company, or is or was serving at the request of the limited liability company as a member, manager, director, officer, employee or agent of another limited
	liability company, corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such member, manager, officer, employee or agent shall be


	 


	II-4





	indemnified by the limited liability company against expenses actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith, including attorney fees.


	The Amended and Restated Operating Agreements of Baron Development Company, LLC and Baron Leasehold, LLC provide that each company may
	indemnify any person who was or is a party defendant or is threatened to be made a party defendant to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative (other than an action by
	or in the right of the Company) by reason of the fact that he is or was a member of the company, manager, officer, employee or agent of the company, or is or was serving at the request of the Company, against expenses (including attorneys
	fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if the member of the company determines that the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person
	reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of the company, and with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit, or proceeding
	by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not in itself create a presumption that the person did or did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in the best
	interest of the company, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful. Each company shall fund its indemnification described above in such manner and to such extent as the
	member of the company may deem proper.




	Maryland




	The Amended and Restated Operating Agreement (the Operating Agreement) of the Maryland limited liability company that is a
	guarantor (the Maryland Guarantor) provides that to the full extent permitted by S.C. Code Ann. § 33-44-303, all members are released from liability for damages and other monetary relief on account of any act, omission, or conduct
	in the members managerial capacity. Under the Operating Agreement, the Maryland Guarantor may indemnify any person who was or is a party defendant or is threatened to be made a party defendant to any threatened, pending or completed action,
	suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Maryland Guarantor) by reason of the fact that he is or was a member of the Maryland Guarantor, manager, officer, employee
	or agent of the Maryland Guarantor, or is or was serving at the request of the Maryland Guarantor, against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in
	connection with such action, suit or proceeding if the member determines that he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of the Maryland Guarantor, and with respect to any criminal
	action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, does not in itself
	create a presumption that the person did or did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in the best interest of the Maryland Guarantor, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to
	believe that his conduct was unlawful.




	Nevada




	The Nevada Revised Statutes permits the indemnification of directors, employees, officers and agents of Nevada corporations. The applicable
	Bylaws for each of the registrants incorporated in Nevada (the Nevada Corporate Guarantors) provide that we will indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of the State of Nevada.


	Subsection 7 of Section 78.138 of the Nevada Revised Statutes provides that, subject to certain very limited statutory exceptions, a
	director or officer is not individually liable to the corporation or its shareholders or creditors for any damages as a result of any act or failure to act in his or her capacity as a director or officer, unless it is proven that the act or failure
	to act constituted a breach of his or her fiduciary duties as a director or officer and such breach of those duties involved intentional misconduct, fraud or a knowing violation of law. The


	 


	II-5





	statutory standard of liability established by Section 78.138 controls unless a provision in the corporations articles of incorporation provides for greater individual liability.


	Subsection 1 of Section 78.7502 of the Nevada Revised Statutes empowers a corporation to indemnify any person who was or is a party or is
	threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the fact that he or
	she is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise
	(any such person, a Covered Person), against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the Covered Person in connection with such action, suit or
	proceeding if the Covered Person is not liable pursuant to Section 78.138 of the Nevada Revised Statutes or the Covered Person acted in good faith and in a manner the Covered Person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
	interests of the corporation and, with respect to any criminal action or proceedings, had no reasonable cause to believe the Covered Persons conduct was unlawful.


	Subsection 2 of Section 78.7502 of the Nevada Revised Statutes empowers a corporation to indemnify any Covered Person who was or is a
	party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person acted in the capacity of a Covered
	Person against expenses, including amounts paid in settlement and attorneys fees actually and reasonably incurred by the Covered Person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit, if the Covered Person is not liable
	pursuant to Section 78.138 of the Nevada Revised Statutes or the Covered Person acted in good faith and in a manner the Covered Person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation. However, no
	indemnification may be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which the Covered Person shall have been adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction (after exhaustion of all appeals) to be liable to the corporation or for amounts paid
	in settlement to the corporation unless and only to the extent that the court in which such action or suit was brought or other court of competent jurisdiction determines upon application that in view of all the circumstances the Covered Person is
	fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses as the court deems proper.


	Section 78.7502 of the Nevada Revised
	Statutes further provides that to the extent a Covered Person has been successful on the merits or otherwise in the defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Subsection 1 or 2, as described above, or in the defense of any claim, issue
	or matter therein, the corporation shall indemnify the Covered Person against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by the Covered Person in connection with the defense.


	Subsection 1 of Section 78.751 of the Nevada Revised Statutes provides that any discretionary indemnification pursuant to
	Section 78.7502 of the Nevada Revised Statutes, unless ordered by a court or advanced pursuant to Subsection 2 of Section 78.751, may be made by a corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that
	indemnification of the Covered Person is proper in the circumstances. Such determination must be made (a) by the shareholders, (b) by the board of directors of the corporation by majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were
	not parties to the action, suit or proceeding, (c) if a majority vote of a quorum of such non-party directors so orders, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (d) by independent legal counsel in a written opinion if a
	quorum of such non-party directors cannot be obtained.


	Subsection 2 of Section 78.751 of the Nevada Revised Statutes provides that a
	corporations articles of incorporation or bylaws or an agreement made by the corporation may require the corporation to pay as incurred and in advance of the final disposition of a criminal or civil action, suit or proceeding, the expenses of
	officers and directors in defending such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt by the corporation of an undertaking by or on behalf of the officer or director to repay the amount if it is ultimately determined by a court of competent jurisdiction
	that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation. Subsection 2 of Section 78.751


	 


	II-6





	further provides that its provisions do not affect any rights to advancement of expenses to which corporate personnel other than officers and directors may be entitled under contract or otherwise
	by law.


	Subsection 3 of Section 78.751 of the Nevada Revised Statutes provides that indemnification pursuant to Section 78.7502
	of the Nevada Revised Statutes and advancement of expenses authorized in or ordered by a court pursuant to Section 78.751 does not exclude any other rights to which the Covered Person may be entitled under the articles of incorporation or any
	bylaw, agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, for either an action in his or her official capacity or in another capacity while holding his or her office. However, indemnification, unless ordered by a court pursuant
	to Section 78.7502 or for the advancement of expenses under Subsection 2 of Section 78.751 of the Nevada Revised Statutes, may not be made to or on behalf of any director or officer of the corporation if a final adjudication establishes
	that his or her acts or omissions involved intentional misconduct, fraud or a knowing violation of the law and were material to the cause of action. Additionally, the scope of such indemnification and advancement of expenses shall continue for a
	Covered Person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators.


	Section 78.752 of the Nevada Revised Statutes empowers a corporation to purchase and maintain insurance or make other financial
	arrangements on behalf of a Covered Person for any liability asserted against such person and liabilities and expenses incurred by such person in his or her capacity as a Covered Person or arising out of such persons status as a Covered Person
	whether or not the corporation has the authority to indemnify such person against such liability and expenses.


	The bylaws of each of the
	Nevada Corporate Guarantors provides that the corporation shall indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by Nevada law, any person who is or was or has agreed to become a director or officer of the such Nevada Corporate Guarantor or is or was
	serving or has agreed to serve at the request of the Nevada Corporate Guarantor as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to
	employee benefit plans. The bylaws of each of the Nevada Corporate Guarantors further provide for advancement of expenses as permitted under Nevada law.


	Under Sections 86.411 through 86.451 of Nevada Revised Statutes, a limited liability company may indemnify any person who was or is a party or
	is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he is or was a manager, member, employee or agent of the
	limited liability company, or is or was serving at the request of the company as a manager, member, employee or agent of another limited liability company, corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses,
	including attorneys fees, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the action, suit or proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in
	or not opposed to the best interests of the company, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order,
	settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, does not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
	interests of the limited liability company, and that, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, he had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.


	To the extent that a manager, member, employee or agent of a limited liability company has been successful on the merits or otherwise in
	defense of any action, suit or proceeding or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, the company shall indemnify him or her against expenses, including attorneys fees, actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the
	defense.


	If unsuccessful in defense of a third-party civil suit or a criminal suit, or if such a suit is settled, an indemnitee may be
	indemnified under Nevada law against both (i) expenses, including attorneys fees, and (ii) judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner he or she


	 


	II-7





	reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the limited liability company, and, with respect to any criminal action, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her
	conduct was unlawful. If unsuccessful in defense of a suit brought by or in the right of the limited liability company, where the suit is settled, an indemnitee may be indemnified under Nevada law only against expenses (including attorneys
	fees) actually and reasonably incurred in the defense or settlement of the suit if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the limited liability company except
	that if the indemnitee is adjudged to be liable for a breach of fiduciary duty or misconduct, fraud, or a knowing violation of law in the performance of his or her duty to the limited liability company, he or she cannot be made whole even for
	expenses unless a court determines that he or she is fully and reasonably entitled to indemnification for such expenses.


	Also under
	Nevada law, if provided in the articles of organization, operating agreement or separate agreement, expenses incurred by a manager or member of the limited liability company in defending a civil or criminal action, suit, or proceeding may be paid by
	the limited liability company in advance of the final disposition of the suit, action, or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the manager or member to repay such amount if it is ultimately determined that he or she is not
	entitled to be indemnified by the limited liability company. The limited liability company may also advance expenses incurred by other personnel of the limited liability company upon such terms and conditions, if any, that may be provided under any
	contract or otherwise by law. The articles of organization and operating agreement of each of the limited liability company registrants formed in Nevada (the Nevada LLC Guarantors) do not contain any provisions relative to the
	advancement of expenses.


	The operating agreements for each of the Nevada LLC Guarantors provides for the indemnification of the member,
	managers officers, employee and agents of the Nevada LLC Guarantor to the fullest extent permitted by the Nevada Limited Liability Company Act as determined by the Member.


	Indemnification or advancement of expenses authorized in or ordered by a court pursuant to applicable Nevada law does not exclude any other
	rights to which a person seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under the articles of organization or any operating agreement, vote of members or disinterested managers, if any, or otherwise, for an action in the
	persons official capacity or an action in another capacity while holding office, except that indemnification, unless ordered by a court pursuant to applicable Nevada law or for the advancement of expenses made pursuant to applicable Nevada law
	may not be made to or on behalf of any member or manager if a final adjudication establishes that the members or the managers acts or omissions involved intentional misconduct, fraud or a knowing violation of the law and was material to
	the cause of action. Right to indemnification or advancement of expenses authorized in or ordered by a court pursuant to applicable Nevada law continues for a person who has ceased to be a member, manager, employee or agent and inures to the benefit
	of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person


	The foregoing statutes do not affect a directors, officers,
	managers or members responsibilities under any other law, such as the federal securities laws.


	Insofar as indemnification for
	liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling our company pursuant to the foregoing provisions, we have been informed that in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against
	public policy as expressed in the act and is therefore unenforceable.




	Oklahoma




	Section 1031 of the Oklahoma General Corporation Act authorizes the indemnification of directors and officers under certain circumstances.
	The Oklahoma General Corporation Act provides for indemnification of a corporations officers and directors against (a) expenses, including attorneys fees, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably
	incurred by such person in connection with any action, suit or


	 


	II-8





	proceeding brought by reason of such person being or having been a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or of any other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
	enterprise at the request of the corporation, other than an action by or in the right of corporation. To be entitled to indemnification, the individual must have acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to
	the best interest of the corporation, and with respect to any criminal action, the person seeking indemnification had no reasonable cause to believe that the conduct was unlawful and (b) expenses, including attorneys fees, actually and
	reasonably incurred by the person in connection with the defense or settlement of an action or suit by or in the right of the corporation brought by reason of the person seeking indemnification being or having been a director, officer, employee or
	agent of the corporation, or any other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise at the request of the corporation, provided the actions were in good faith and were reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
	interests of the corporation, except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which the person shall have been adjudged liable to the corporation, unless and only to the extent that the court in which such
	action or suit was decided has determined that the person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the court deems proper.




	South Carolina




	Ivory Auto
	Properties of South Carolina, LLC is organized under the laws of the State of South Carolina.


	Under Section 33-44-403 of the South
	Carolina Limited Liability Company Act, a limited liability company shall reimburse a member or manager for payments made and indemnify a member or manager for liabilities incurred by the member or manager in the ordinary course of the business of
	the company or for the preservation of its business or property.


	The Amended and Restated Operating Agreement of Ivory Auto Properties of
	South Carolina, LLC provides that the company may indemnify any person who was or is a defendant or is threated to be made a defendant to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding (other than an action by or in right of the
	company) by reason of the fact that he is or was a member, manager, officer, employee or agent of the company, or is or was serving at request of the company, against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in
	settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if the member of the company determines that such person acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the
	best interest of the company, and with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any such action, suit or proceeding shall not in itself create a presumption that
	such person did or did not act in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in the best interest of the company, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful. The
	company shall fund such indemnification obligations in such a manner and to such extent as the member of the company may from time to time deem proper.

	Undertakings.





	Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities
	Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrants, we have been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy and is, therefore,
	unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of a registrant in the successful defense of
	any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, such registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been


	 


	II-10





	settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and
	will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.


	Each registrant hereby undertakes:


	To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement:


	 




	 


	(a)


	to include any prospectus required by section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933;




	 




	 


	(b)


	to reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a
	fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total Dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was
	registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price
	represent no more than 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the Calculation of Registration Fee table in the effective registration statement; and




	 




	 


	(c)


	to include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement.




	That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment
	shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.


	To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the
	termination of the offering.


	That, for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser, if such
	registrant is subject to Rule 430C, each prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of a registration statement relating to an offering, other than registration statements relying on Rule 430B or other than prospectuses filed in reliance on
	Rule 430A, shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness. Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the
	registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to
	such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date of first use.


	That, for the purpose of determining liability of such registrant under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial
	distribution of the securities, in a primary offering of securities of such registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold
	to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser:


	 




	 


	(a)


	any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrants relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424;




	 




	 


	(b)


	any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of such registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned registrants;




	 


	II-11







	 


	(c)


	the portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned registrants or their securities provided by or on behalf of such registrant; and




	 




	 


	(d)


	any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by such registrant to the purchaser.




	That, for purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each filing of a registrants annual report pursuant to
	section 13(a) or section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (and, where applicable, each filing of an employee benefit plans annual report pursuant to section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that is incorporated by
	reference in the registration statement shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.


	To deliver or cause to be delivered with the prospectus, to each person to whom the prospectus is sent or given, the latest annual report
	to security holders that is incorporated by reference in the prospectus and furnished pursuant to and meeting the requirements of Rule 14a-3 or Rule 14c-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; and, where interim financial information required
	to be presented by Article 3 of Regulation S-X are not set forth in the prospectus, to deliver, or cause to be delivered to each person to whom the prospectus is sent or given, the latest quarterly report that is specifically incorporated by
	reference in the prospectus to provide such interim financial information.


	To respond to requests for information that is incorporated by
	reference into the prospectus pursuant to Items 4, 10(b), 11, or 13 of this Form, within one business day of receipt of such request, and to send the incorporated documents by first class mail or other equally prompt means. This includes information
	contained in documents filed subsequent to the effective date of the registration statement through the date of responding to the request.


	To supply by means of a post-effective amendment all information concerning a transaction, and the company being acquired involved therein,
	that was not the subject of and included in the registration statement when it became effective.

	Ladies and Gentlemen:






	We have acted as special Nevada counsel to the Nevada corporations identified on Exhibit 1 attached hereto (the 


	Corporate Covered
	Guarantors


	) and the Nevada limited liability companies identified on Exhibit 2 attached hereto (the 


	LLC Covered Guarantors


	 and collectively with the Corporate Covered Guarantors, the 


	Covered
	Guarantors


	) each being an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Group 1 Automotive, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the 


	Company


	), with respect to the filing of the Registration Statement on Form S-4 Registration
	No. 333-200465 (as amended the 


	Registration Statement


	) by the Company, the Covered Guarantors and the other subsidiary guarantors of the Company (the 


	Other Guarantors


	) with the Securities and
	Exchange Commission (the 


	Commission


	) in connection with the registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the 


	Securities Act


	), of (i) the offer and exchange (the
	


	Exchange Offer


	) by the Company of $550,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 5.000% Senior Notes due 2022 (the 


	Old Notes


	), for a new series of notes in like principal amount and bearing
	substantially identical terms (the 


	New Notes


	) and (ii) guarantees of the New Notes pursuant to Article X of the Indenture (as defined below) issued by the Covered Guarantors and Other Guarantors (the
	


	Guarantees


	).










	The Old Notes were issued, and the New Notes will be issued, under an Indenture, dated
	as of June 2, 2014, by and among the Company, the Covered Guarantors and the Other Guarantors, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (as it may be amended from time to time, the 


	Indenture


	). The
	Exchange Offer will be conducted on such terms and conditions as are set forth in the prospectus contained in the Registration Statement to which this opinion letter is an exhibit.






	We have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of (i) the Registration Statement, (ii) the Indenture,
	(iii) the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, as amended and restated to date, as the case may be, of each of the Corporate Covered Guarantors, (iv) the Articles of Organization and Operating Agreements, as amended and restated to date,

	Board of Directors of the Corporate Covered Guarantors and of the Member of each of the LLC Covered Guarantors relating to the issuance of the Old Notes, the Exchange Offer, Registration
	Statement and related matters, (vi) Certificates of Existence for each of the Covered Guarantors dated May 13, 2015, issued by the Secretary of State of Nevada confirming the existence and good standing in the State of Nevada of each of
	the Covered Guarantors and (vii) such other certificates, public filings, statutes and other instruments and documents as we considered appropriate for purposes of the opinions expressed below. In connection with the opinions expressed below,
	we have assumed that the Registration Statement, and any amendments thereto (including post-effective amendments), will have become effective and the New Notes and related guarantees will be issued and sold in compliance with applicable federal and

	Based upon the foregoing and subject to the assumptions, exceptions, qualifications and limitations set forth herein, we are of the opinion that:


	1. Each of the Corporate Covered Guarantors is a corporation validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Nevada and has all requisite
	corporate power necessary to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Indenture, including its guarantee of the New Notes.


	2. Each of the
	LLC Covered Guarantors is a limited liability company validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Nevada and has all requisite limited liability company power necessary to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under
	the Indenture, including its guarantee of the New Notes.


	3. Each of the Covered Guarantors execution, delivery and performance of the Indenture,
	including its guarantee of the New Notes, has been duly authorized by all necessary company action by the respective Covered Guarantor.


	The foregoing
	opinions are limited to the matters expressly set forth herein and no opinion may be implied or inferred beyond the matters expressly stated. We disclaim any obligation to update this letter for events occurring after the date of this letter, or as
	a result of knowledge acquired by us after that date, including changes in any of the statutory or decisional law after the date of this letter. We are members of the bar of the State of Nevada. We express no opinion as to the effect and application
	of any United States federal law, rule or regulation or any securities or blue sky laws of any state, including the State of Nevada. We are not opining on, and assume no responsibility as to, the applicability to or the effect on any of the matters
	covered herein of the laws of any other jurisdiction, other than the laws of Nevada as presently in effect. We exclude from the laws of the State of Nevada covered by this opinion any municipal or local ordinances and regulations.

We are registering a total of 3,720,000 shares of our common stock for sale by
selling shareholders. No shares are being registered for sale by the Company.
The Company will not receive funds from the sale of shares being offered by
selling shareholders.


Barrier to entry in the industry is extremely high.  There are three competitors
located in Hawai’i that provide the same services we propose to provide. Wet‘n
Wild, a well-known waterpark center, is located on the island of Oahu and has
been established on the island since 1999. Two hotels (Grand Wailea Hotel on
Maui and Hilton Waikoloa Village on the Big Island) offer similar water park
features such as water slides, free-form pools and lazy rivers. In addition to
well-known, established competitors, the high cost of building and operating
amusement parks, including utilities, employee pay and benefits, taxes,
insurance, marketing expenses, administrative expenses, food, beverage, clothing
for sale and ongoing maintenance is also a high barrier to entry in this
industry.


Company Description
Killer Waves Hawaii intends to build a family waterpark in a state-of-the-art
designed aquatic center in several locations throughout the Hawaiian Islands,
with a vision to expand to other U.S. prime visitor destinations. Appealing to
both local families and visitors alike, Killer Waves Hawaii will


 provide people
with a park that includes water rides, pools, including a wave-machine surf
pool, a lazy river, zipline, retail store, bar and restaurant.

The Company hopes to be able to deliver some of the longest and most exciting
rides in the industry. We will create  a sustainable and green design (following
LEED guidelines), using solar power wherever possible; utilizing natural water
supplies and the unique topography and native plants of the Hawaiian Islands to
create a one-of-a-kind water park. During the holiday season from November 1 to
January 31, the waterpark will also feature a winter-themed area to focus on the
holiday celebrations.

1. Main Entry Lobby

2. Retail Shop

3. Food & Beverage Outlets: fast food outlet, beverage and ice cream kiosks,  
   restaurant and lounge 

4. Event space for rent

2. Climbing Walls

3. Climbing Nets

Killer Waves Hawai’i will generate revenues from a park entry fee estimated to
be $39 per child and $59 per adult, as well as retail sales of branded logo,
food and beverage sales, and hosted events for paying customers. Prices to rent
space for events (e.g., birthday parties, anniversaries, receptions) will be
$100 per hour. We are a development stage company and have not yet commenced
business operations or generated any revenues.
