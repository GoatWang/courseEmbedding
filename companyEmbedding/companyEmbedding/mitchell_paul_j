Hair Styling Tools for Gorgeous Hair
Dry, straighten, curl, comb and brush – these are some of the daily styling actions we subject our hair to. To make sure you hair looks its best, you need top-of-the-line hair styling tools. JCPenney has exactly what you need to achieve the perfect look.

Get sleek and smooth hair with ceramic  and ion flat irons. Take your hair from damp to straight in a flash with a Chi damp to dry flat iron. Speaking of dry hair, take a look at our collection of hair dryers. From wall mounted, to handheld to hooded, we have a diverse assortment of hair dryers to meet your needs. Curly girls will absolutely love a handheld dryer with a diffuser attachment. Ready to give your hair some much needed TLC with a deep conditioning or protein treatment? Add a hooded dryer to your styling tool arsenal.  The hooded dryer will allow your treatments to better penetrate the hair shaft. Get gorgeous bouncy curls with a new curling iron or a set of hot rollers. Shop round brushes, paddle brush, hot air brushes and much more. We have all the hair styling tools you need to look your best by the brands you love, including Conair, John Frieda & FHI Heat!

Our Values
For us, producing the highest quality professional hair care available is simply not enough. John Paul Mitchell Systems is (and always will be) dedicated to making our world a more beautiful place.

A commitment to caring for people and the planet is a driving force in everything we do.

No Animal Testing
Never Have. Never Will.
In 1980, we became the first professional beauty company to publicly stand up against animal testing. Now, nearly 35 years later, that pledge to our furry friends remains a driving force in all that we do.







Caring For Our Planet
Live Beautifully
Whether we're planting trees, protecting animals or preserving our natural resources, John Paul Mitchell Systems is (and always has been) dedicated to making our world a more beautiful place.











Product Control
The Real Deal on Diversion
Diversion occurs when professional salon products are sold by unauthorized retailers. Oftentimes these products are old, stolen, counterfeit or tampered with. That's why you should only purchase John Paul Mitchell Systems products within the professional beauty salon industry.







Research & Development
Our product development process begins in our state-of-the-art Product Innovation Center (PIC), in Santa Clarita, California. It's here where our products are researched, formulated and tested (on humans!). From concept to completion, our talented teams work hand-in-hand to perfect every formula and bring our newest innovations to life.







The Awapuhi Farm
Green from the get-go. In 1983, our co-founders established a self-sustaining, solar-powered Awapuhi farm in Hawaii—all of the Awapuhi used in our products is still harvested there today.

Exclusive KerActive protein “hugs” the hair to help repair damage.



Conditioners and safflower oleosomes deliver rich plant oils to replenish lost moisture and nutrients.



KerActive penetrates the hair shaft to help rebuild, while safflower oleosomes deliver moisture and seal the cuticle.



The result is stronger, healthier hair with long-lasting hydration and shine.










Humble Beginnings
In 1980, two friends were inspired to create a company that would offer luxurious hair care at an affordable price. With just $700, John Paul DeJoria and Paul Mitchell launched a revolutionary hair care system featuring three products. More than 35 years later, Paul Mitchell® offers more than 75 products that are available around the world.

The fresh and cool clean feeling it leaves you with is absolutly amazing.  Written by Ben W on December 05, 2016   Was this review helpful?  Yes / No    Be the first to provide feedback on this review.       Paul Mitchell hair gel has a nice fragrence plus it is not heavy feeling on my hair and keeps my hair in place for hours Written by stevek7 on August 21, 2016   Was this review helpful?  Yes / No    Be the first to provide feedback on this review.       I love this product. I've been using Paul Mitchell Sculpting Foam for years and I have no intention of using anything else. It makes my hair full without stiffness. Written by Ellen on June 24, 2014   Was this review helpful?  Yes / No    Be the first to provide feedback on this review.       I ordered the Platinum shampoo, the purple one!! hehe It is awesome! It helps my blond hair not to get orange... it's super affordable and really works. The delivery was on time and it arrived perfectly. Written by Fabiola Conti on April 08, 2014   Was this review helpful?  Yes / No    Be the first to provide feedback on this review.       Ordered the Fast Drying Sculpting Spray - a product that works great on my fine hair to help set soft curls without weighing down my hair. Had a hard time locating the product for a reasonable price in the larger size. FragranceNet not only carries the product, but also sells it for a very competitive price!

    Paul Mitchell                           (Designer)   


 








	    					Born Cyril Thomas Mitchell in 1936 to a hairdresser, Cyril followed his mother’s footsteps and enrolled in London’s Morris School of Hairdressing in 1952.  By 1954, at age 18, he had won many British and international hairdressing competitions and joined the Park Lane salon where his boss nicknamed him Paul. In 1960, Paul’s joined Vidal Sassoon and his career launched full throttle.    In 1971, he met John Paul DeJoria and shortly thereafter opened his salon on Manhattan’s Madison Avenue. It is here where the Paul Mitchell Cutting Club is born.   After selling his Salon in 1976 and moving to Hawaii he teamed up with Dejoria and for just $700 they started his revolutionary hair care system.Today, the Paul Mitchell line encompasses over 100 products including shampoos, conditioners, styling products and flat irons.   From their very own Awapuhi Farm to Tea Tree extracts, men’s products and products formulated for pets, Paul Mitchell offers something for all hair types and styles.

Our Values
For us, producing the highest quality professional hair care available is simply not enough. John Paul Mitchell Systems is (and always will be) dedicated to making our world a more beautiful place. We were the first professional beauty company to stand up against animal testing and our charitable efforts continue to set the standard for giving in our industry. A commitment to caring for people and the planet is a driving force in everything we do.

No Animal Testing
Never Have. Never Will.
In 1980, we became the first professional beauty company to publicly stand up against animal testing. Now, nearly 35 years later, that pledge to our furry friends remains a driving force in all that we do.







Caring For Our Planet
Live Beautifully
Whether we're planting trees, protecting animals or preserving our natural resources, John Paul Mitchell Systems is (and always has been) dedicated to making our world a more beautiful place.











Product Control
The Real Deal on Diversion
Diversion occurs when professional salon products are sold by unauthorized retailers. Oftentimes these products are old, stolen, counterfeit or tampered with. That's why you should only purchase John Paul Mitchell Systems products within the professional beauty salon industry.







Research & Development
Our product development process begins in our state-of-the-art Product Innovation Center (PIC), in Santa Clarita, California. It's here where our products are researched, formulated and tested (on humans!). From concept to completion, our talented teams work hand-in-hand to perfect every formula and bring our newest innovations to life.







The Awapuhi Farm
Green from the get-go. In 1983, our co-founders established a self-sustaining, solar-powered Awapuhi farm in Hawaii—all of the Awapuhi used in our products is still harvested there today.

Speaking of dry hair, take a look at our collection of hair dryers. From wall mounted, to handheld to hooded, we have a diverse assortment of hair dryers to meet your needs.
