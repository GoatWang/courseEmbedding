LED Mini Lights
LED Christmas lights are the top choice for decorating indoor and outdoor spaces this holiday season. With colors ranging from warm white, orange, green, and many more, you can choose string lights in your favorite color or to match your holiday theme. Our deluxe warm white light strings are a very warm, almost champagne, color. Please note that our purple lights tend to appear closer to red than blue on the purple scale. Multi-colored lights are also available if you can't decide which color you'd prefer. Most string lights are available in three different wire colors: green, white, and brown.


Brighter than traditional incandescent stringers, LEDs come in several shapes to match your style or replicate tradition stringers.

Wide Angle – These lights are 5 millimeters wide and are often called "wide angle” mini lights. The normal rounded tip has been drilled in to create a concave shape which allows the light to be dispersed in a 180-degree beam angle.

Shimmering Spot – As the original LED mini light design, this shape focuses the light straight out of the rounded tip while also releasing some light in a 180-degree angle. This shape and its concentrated light also helps create a unique "twinkling” effect when the lights sway gently and are viewed from afar. The effect is compared to dozens of tiny flashlights, blinking on and off.

Traditional Shape – Traditional shaped LEDs bring you the energy savings of LED while maintain the classic look of incandescent mini lights.

Faceted Traditional – Faceted means the colored cap is cut in a prismatic or crystal-like pattern. The faceted cap simply softens the light. You get less sharpness but maintain the rich color which LEDs provide.


All of our LED string light are single piece molded construction, meaning the bulbs cannot be replaced. This protects from water invading the sockets, making them safe for outdoor use.


From 17 to 25.5 feet in length, these LED string lights have either 50 or 70 bulbs per string. Using 3.5 to 4.8 watts, Christmas string lights are an easy way to add color and shine to the interior or exterior of your residential or commercial space. Decorate your tree with LED Christmas light strings from 1000Bulbs.com to make your holiday season sparkle.

This particular film, the 1080 series, isn't intended to be used for cut graphics, where the film goes through a plotter-like device that uses a knife to cut out shapes for letters and designs. Because of the thicker vinyl needed for the texture to appear lifelike, it's meant for covering areas.This film is easy to apply because of 3M Controltac technology. It's important to be able to remove and reapply the film as you stretch it over the body of the vehicle to get it straight and wrinkle-free. Conventional pressure-sensitive adhesives won't let you do that. 3M coats the adhesive layer with, I kid you not, millions of microscopic glass beads.Another bane of graphics installer is air bubbles. Installers (read: You) have to resort to pricking holes in the film to let the air out or have a car or truck that looks like it has blisters from a horrific sunburn. 3M has another solution for that: they call it Comply. When the adhesive is coated onto the film, hundreds of microscopic channels are left in the adhesive. As you squeegee the film down into its final position, air can escape along these channels to the outer edge of the film, even if it's several feet away. Result: No bubbles, and the channels are too small to detect after the squeegee finishes it's work.3M ReviewsAverage rating:	   4.8 - 16 reviews  /  Read All 3M Reviews5 of 5Better Than Expected3M® - HeadLight Lens Restoration SystemI used this on 2006 Volvo XC90 headlights that obviously were never maintain or protected. I first used the Megiuar's headlight restorer. It helped but the 3M Restoration System got the job done. For as much work as my lights needed, they aren't 100% perfect again, but that's most likely because I left the headlights on the vehicle while I cleaned them. I recommend removing the headlights completely from the vehicle to use this product. I think my lights would come out better had I taken them out.CPosted by Craig (Laporte, IN) / April 18, 20172006 Volvo XC90Was this review helpful for you?

It's easy to use and contains everything you need, minus the power tools, of course. I'm concerned, however, how long this will last. Everything I read talks about these products not lasting because there's no proper sealant to prevent the headlight from re-oxidizing. I'm going to have to research this. Still, this doesn't detract from the product review.JPosted by Jason (Carlisle, PA) / March 1, 2017Was this review helpful for you?

YesThis review was helpful for 0 user!5 of 5Better Than ExpectedI've got this for my black car, and it makes the interior burning hot. I used the 3M wrap to wrap my roof, and I'm very pleased with the results. Using a blow dryer, the wrap covered the whole roof without any air pockets or wrinkles, and it looks exactly like my acrylic roof.JPosted by Joe (East Peoria, IL) / September 4, 2013Was this review helpful for you?

        Bright Consistent Light
The only thing missing from these lights is the ability to dim or twinkle. The lenses give off a consistent bright light from any angle. The cool white color is perfect for simulating a star field.

        LED string lights
They have excellent brightness and seem to be very durable. As far as the value is concerned, I want to see how long they will last until I give the excellent endorsement.

Quality. Trust.The best companies put a lot of effort into building and maintaining their brand image. They're attentive to customers' wants and needs, stay current with the latest technology, and of course offer the best products backed up with industry leading customer service and warranties. When you shop for brand names you can buy with the confidence that comes from knowing that you're getting a product with a proven reputation for quality, reliability and performance. We're consumers just like you and brand names are just as important to us. That's why we carry only the top brands in the automotive aftermarket. Check out the extensive list of brands we offer and you'll see names that you know and trust, because we wouldn't sell you anything we wouldn't put on our own vehicles.Our wide range of brands means you'll always be able to get exactly what you need no matter what you're doing to your vehicle or what you're driving. Want a spoiler for your Civic? Choose from 7 different brands, each offering a selection of styles and materials. Need brakes for your Chevy pickup? There are 14 brands to choose from at prices and friction compounds to suit your wallet and driving style. How about a performance exhaust system for your Mustang? We offer 8 different brands so you can get the performance and sound you want in your choice of material and price. These are just a few examples of the tremendous variety you'll find on our digital shelves. When you shop here you'll never have to settle for a color or style you don't really want because "that's all they had".Some retailers buy end lots, closeouts, and fakes and pose as approved dealers, only to leave you in the lurch when there's a problem. You'll never be in that predicament with us because we are authorized dealers for most of the brands we sell and we have ongoing business relationships with those companies. This benefits you because when you shop with us you can be assured that you're getting the genuine article, not some cheap knock-off, and you'll have all the support the company offers including a valid warranty in the unlikely event you have a problem with your purchase. Our status as authorized dealer also allows us to offer sales and promotions sanctioned by the manufacturer, including discounted prices, manufacturers' rebates, and product giveaways.Featured VideosForgiato Difalco Grille01Curt02Kenwood Car Entertainment Systems03Rigid Industries Tortured04Backrack05We don't just sell auto parts and accessories, we're enthusiasts like you and we use the products we carry on our own vehicles. Our staff's automotive interests are as varied as our brands, and they're into everything including lifted 4-wheelers, tuner cars, muscle cars, drag racing, and autocross. We install the brand name products we sell and test them on our own cars and trucks. The employee parking area looks like a product testing lab with plenty of wheel and tire combos, body kits, spoilers, and custom grilles, slammed sports models and sky high 4-wheelers. Under those hoods there's cold air intakes, turbochargers, and performance tunes, and when they're fired up you'll hear the throaty rumble from free-flowing exhaust systems. If we find that a product doesn't measure up to our standards, we won't sell it. When you buy from us you get the best purchasing experience possible because of the familiarity and experience we have with our brands.
