Depending on the number of cameras available and level of security desired, FaceMatch® uses advanced facial recognition algorithms to allow the user access to their device, data, or door.
The technology can be hosted on the device or configured to access cloud computing for remote authentication via NXT-ID’s BioCloud® Authentication and Identity Management Services. The technology will also soon be available as an “app” on the iPhone and Android platforms.

Announces Product Features for Next Generation Electronic Wallet, "The Wocket(TM)"MarketwiredDecember 3, 2013ReblogShareTweetShareSHELTON, CT--(Marketwired - Dec 3, 2013) - NXT-ID, Inc., (  OTCQB :  NXTD ) a biometrics company focused on the growing mobile commerce market, today announced features of its next generation wallet, The Wocket™, scheduled for launch for the first quarter of 2014.The Wocket™ is designed to replace all the cards in your wallet with a single, secure smart card. The Wocket™ works anywhere that credit cards are accepted and can only be used with your biometric or touch screen authentication.The world of wallets is about to change with new and exciting technologies making payments easier than ever. However, most credit card holders are understandably reluctant to use their smartphone for transactions -- this is due to a variety of reasons including:Limited battery life Dependency on wireless network coverage Well publicized security threatsRather than depending on a smartphone for transactions, NXT-ID has developed a truly next generation electronic wallet.This unique technology takes a very different approach: Instead of replacing the wallet, NXT-ID is improving it. The Company's innovative Wocket™ replaces all the cards in your wallet with one single re-programmable card that supports most payment methods currently available at a Point-of-Sale (POS) at retailers around the world (magnetic stripe, NFC and barcode)... all within a secure biometric vault.Access your Wocket™ with security on the touch screen or through voice authentication biometrics and select which card you wish to use; now use that card to substitute any card in your wallet. What's more, no personal information is retained on the magnetic stripe so the risk of fraud is greatly reduced.Now you can bring the wallet you know and love into the future with the Wocket™ and have advanced secure electronic wallet technology from NXT-ID.Availability:NXT-ID will be launching the Wocket in the first quarter of 2014.Product Features and Benefits Card reader plugs in directly to Wocket Card information is erased after every transaction Does not require phone Number of cards- Approximately 100 cards, records, coupons, etc. Authentication - Multi-factor (user configurable) Dynamic Pairing of voice and word User Interface: Display and or Voice Payment methods: Dynamic Mag Stripe, QR Code Battery: Replaceable CR batteries in the Wocket. Life: Unlimited with in-wallet charging of dynamic card.

					Full Description



Nxt-ID, Inc., incorporated on February 8, 2012, is a technology company. The Company is focused on products, solutions and services for security on mobile devices. The Company's core technologies consist of those that support digital payments, biometric identification, encryption, sensors and miniaturization. The Company has three lines of business: mobile commerce (m-commerce), primarily through the application of secure digital payment technologies; biometric access control applications, and Department of Defense contracting. The Company intends to use its core biometric facial and voice recognition algorithms to develop security applications (both cloud based and locally hosted) that can be used for companies (for industrial uses, such as enterprise computer networks), as well as individuals (for consumer uses, such as smart phones, tablets or personal computers), law enforcement, the defense industry, and the United States Department of Defense.WocketThe Company offers Wocket, a physical electronic smart wallet that is intended to hold information from credit cards, debit cards, loyalty cards, identification cards and various magnetic stripe cards to allow the owner of the card to configure a single, dynamic, electronic card to replicate any of the copied cards. As designed, users will scan in each card, slide through each of the scanned soft-cards via a touch screen display and select the card the user wishes to program. The system consists of approximately two devices, such as an electronic smart wallet, wocket, and a dynamic smart card. The electronic smart wallet is secured by an alpha numeric personal identification number (PIN) and will also have a range of accessories that allow the user to carry a driver's license and cash in the same device.World Ventures SmartCardThe Company has an agreement with WorldVentures Holdings, LLC. (WVH), an international travel company, which will purchase an exclusive smartcard from the Company for distribution to its membership. The smartcard will be customized for WVH with various other technologies and wireless features, such as the ability to integrate with WVH's DreamTrips App to wirelessly check in and earn loyalty points towards free DreamTrips vacations at select restaurants.Nxt-ID SmartCardThe Company is engaged in the development of a standalone smartcard (the NXT Smartcard) with the ability to make payments by dynamic magnetic stripe or through interacting with a terminal through electromagnetic compatibility (EMC), near field communications (NFC) or barcode functionality.Wi-MagThe Company's antenna and payment technology is the Wi-Mag technology. The technology can be embedded in a mobile device to make wireless payments at various point-of-sale (POS) terminals, which do not require NFC or EMV.MobileBio VoiceMatchVoicematch is a method of recognizing both speakers and specific words providing multi-factor recognition. Voicematch runs on mobile platforms, such as Android and iPhone operating system (iOS), as well as laptops and desktops. Voicematch is an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) product for smartphone manufacturers.
