INVESTOR RELATIONS
CORPORATE PROFILE
CurAegis Technologies, Inc. was incorporated as a New York business corporation on September 25, 1996. The Company develops and markets advanced technologies in the areas of wellness, safety and power.  Currently, we are focusing on the commercialization strategies in the following technologies:
 



 
(i)
the CURA system which includes the myCadian™ watch which measures degradation of alertness and sleep attributes and the Z-Coach e-learning education and training tool and



 




 
(ii)
the Aegis hydraulic pump 



 
The myCadian™ watch consists of hardware and software that measures multiple metrics in order to establish that a person's ability to perform a task or job appears to be degrading. The Aegis hydraulic pump is designed with an innovative hydraulic design that delivers greater efficiencies and is smaller than currently offered products.  The Company has not had any significant revenue-producing operations.
 
CURA Division: the myCadian ™ watch, the CURA™ System, and Z-Coach™ e-learning
The Company’s CURA division is developing a proprietary technology and suite of products designed to (i) measure the decrease in a person’s alertness and (ii) to train individuals on how to improve alertness levels. The CURA™ system and the myCadian™ watch enable the user and third parties to anticipate and avert undesired or disastrous situations caused by the degradation of alertness. With the information provided from the CURA™ software analytics employees can work with Z-Coach, our proprietary sleep training and education solution to correct sleep issues and improve overall wellness.   
 
The myCadian™ watch is a wearable device developed using physiological monitoring hardware and our proprietary CURA™ (Circadian User Risk Assessment) software and detects a degradation of alertness in a user and reveals sleep and fatigue problems. The myCadian™ watch will contain an emergency notification function through the use of a panic button or in sensing a lack of motion which would generate a third party panic notification. The CURA™ system will include:
 



 
●
a proprietary tool that combines signal processing and pattern recognition to guide users and third parties about the alertness of the wearer,



 




 
●
a risk assessment that identifies the degradation of alertness potentially affecting the wearer’s ability perform tasks,



 




 
●
a comprehensive assessment for wellness, alertness and sleep,



 




 
●
real-time reporting that distills complex data into actionable information on mobile and desktop platforms,



 




 
●
predictive reporting for a user to take action when alertness begins to wane-before fatigue becomes dangerous,



 




 
●
flexible settings to provide employers a customized CURA tool within existing safety definitions and to create protocols for a unique environment,



 




 
●
pricing that makes it affordable across a broad based workforce.



 
 
The Z-Coach e-learning tool was created by highly respected fatigue management scientists and was acquired by the Company in September 2015. The first of six Z-Coach e-learning modules, Z-Coach Aviation, has been designed for aviation professionals, from flight and ground crews, to scheduling, dispatch, administration and management. Z-Coach learning topics include: Risks and Costs of Fatigue, Fundamentals of Sleep, Fatigue Mitigation and Countermeasures. Z-Coach participants gain an awareness of the dangers inherent in the lack of sleep and learn to utilize lifestyle tools to make changes to improve their health, mood, productivity and safety. CurAegis Technologies plans to release five additional industry-specific versions of Z-Coach in conjunction with the launch of the CURA™ system and the myCadian™ watch. 
 
Aegis Division: Hydraulic Pump –  
The development of our hydraulic pump has taken on added significance in light of recent U.S. government emissions regulations for off road diesel engines. These regulations will require diesel engines to pollute less. To help achieve these new standards, companies are attempting to run diesel engines, and thus their hydraulic pumps, at lower rotational speeds. This requires larger displacement hydraulic pumps to be installed to compensate for the decrease in rotational speed. Among other advantages, the unique technology of our hydraulic pump allows a larger displacement pump to fit into the same or smaller footprint than that of existing pumps. This enables manufacturers to keep the current equipment layout without the need for expensive modifications to accommodate larger hydraulic pumps.
 
Our goal with the hydraulic pump technology is to give the marketplace a revolutionary new concept in hydraulic pumps and motors that will be:
 



 
●
smaller and lighter than conventional pumps and motors,



 




 
●
more efficient,



 




 
●
as reliable,



 




 
●
price competitive, and



 




 
●
unique in its ability to scale larger, allowing more powerful pumps and motors.



 
We are now ready to approach corporate industry leaders in the hydraulic pump market to propose a prototype for a specific application. In connection with this, we are hiring an experienced industry advisor for market introductions, discussions and presentations of this unique technology.
 
We will continue to design modifications to enhance the overall pump technology. We have filed for patent protection for our novel non-rotating group pump concept, and we are also working on additional patents as a result of engineering breakthroughs in our design process. Although there is still much to be done, we continue to be extremely encouraged by our testing.

TORVEC, INC. ANNOUNCES NEW PRODUCT ACQUISITION, ADVISORY BOARD AND NAME CHANGE


        9/17/2015
    

ROCHESTER, N.Y., September 17, 2015, (NEWSWIRE) -- Richard A. Kaplan, Chief Executive Officer of Torvec, Inc. (OTCQB – TOVC), Richard A. Kaplan, CEO of Torvec, Inc. announces a name change for the company. He states, “We have split the company into two divisions. The CURA Division will oversee our Fatigue Management Consulting business, and the Aegis Division will oversee our Power and Hydraulic business.” Cura is the name of a divine figure who personifies care and concern. It also is an acronym for Circadian User Risk Assessment.  Aegis means doing something under a powerful, knowledgeable and benevolent source. The new name of the company will be CurAegis™ Technologies Inc. This will be used as a DBA until the next shareholders meeting when we will officially change the name. Mr. Kaplan states: “We feel these changes more accurately reflect the vision and direction of the company and will create better transparency and understanding to our shareholders and our customers.” You can see the new versions of the logo on our website, Torvec.com.
We are very excited about the tremendous potential of our CURA division. Sleep and Fatigue Management is an industry in its infancy and we feel we can be in the forefront.
The unchecked Degradation of an individual’s Alertness is a growing concern and the consequences in some areas are approaching epidemic proportions. As an example, it is estimated that 250,000 drivers per day fall asleep at the wheel. Serious and fatal truck, bus, train and automobile accidents are occurring at an alarming rate. Many injuries and accidents in manufacturing plants are fatigue related. The purpose of monitoring alertness is to prevent these and other emergency situations from happening rather than dealing with them after the fact. For instance waking someone up after they have fallen asleep at the wheel is too late.
Our goal is to develop a robust offering of products and programs that evaluate, monitor and help alleviate sleep and fatigue problems and the disastrous outcomes they can create. Up until now we know of no comprehensive programs that effectively and efficiently deal with these issues.
Sleep is at the core of wellness and alertness. Problems with sleep and rest manifest themselves in individuals by compromising the immune system, creating stress on the body, and, in turn, affects their quality of life as well as longevity. For businesses and other organizations they manifest themselves in lower productivity, higher absenteeism, more mistakes and accidents and lower moral.
The MyCadian™ Watch is a wearable device consisting of the latest physiological monitoring hardware. Along with the proprietary CURA™ software, it is intended to identify a Degradation of Alertness in a user and help remedy the problem. This is especially important when an individual’s alertness is essential in properly performing tasks and fulfilling responsibilities. The MyCadianTM Watch may also assist the user in remaining alert by periodically providing a stimulus. This can create real, positive and powerful changes in many areas.
In the Fatigue Management Consulting industry one of the biggest challenges for consultants is assessing the problems and needs of large employee populations. With our system employees can wear the watch for a prescribed period of time in which it learns their personal rhythms, sleep habits, and other pertinent information. We can then correlate this information into a CURATM Wellness Index for the organization. This will give the company an overview of their employee population and how serious a problem they may have. We then start educating and training individuals with sleep and/or alertness problems and have a significant affect on their quality of life, health care costs, longevity and attitude. All this can be achieved while maintaining an individual’s confidentiality
The MyCadian™ Watch and CURA™ Systems have the following UNIQUE advantages of:

A unique combination of biological and motion measurements that communicates information relating to sleep and alertness with minimal distraction or disruption to normal activities.
A numerical and color coded risk-assessment analysis that is easy to understand and react to.
CURA™ is an easy to use software package that distils complex data into simple, actionable information. CURA™ is designed to work on both mobile and desktop platforms.
Provides the added benefit of potentially helping a user to stay alert.
Versatile and flexible settings to allow users to customize the parameters of the device in order to work with and/or establish safety and information system.
Ability to communicate with other devices such as telematics systems, cell phones, etc. to notify other parties of a pending or existing emergency situations.
CURA™ software can be purchased as an application (App) when devices such as smart phones, smart watches etc. are manufactured with all the necessary hardware.
Being relatively inexpensive creates real and measurable value propositions.

As an additional benefit the Mycadian™ Watch has many of the same features and dashboards as other wearable fitness watches. 
As another major initiative the corporation has closed on the purchase of certain assets of Alertness Solutions Inc. of Menlo Park, California. The assets consist of the Z-Coach tool; a robust web based training and educational software for the Fatigue Management Consulting Industry. The Z-Coach tool will integrate with, augment and enhance our Real Time Alertness Monitoring and Emergency Systems and other new technologies in our suite of products. 
The Z-Coach technology was originally designed, developed and enhanced by some of the world’s most respected fatigue management scientists and experts. Mr. Kaplan stated that Ms. Leigh White, president of Alertness Solutions, will be joining Torvec as Executive Vice President of the Fatigue Management Consulting Division.
We are also working on some other exciting technologies that we hope to add to our suite of Fatigue Management products in the near future.
To aid in these incredibly important endeavors we have put together an advisory board of some of the worlds most respected scientists and experts.
They are:
Dr. Kenneth Wright Jr. of the University of Colorado at Boulder
Dr. Richard J. Hanowski of Virginia Tech
Dr. Jonathan A. Marcus of the University of Rochester
Dr. Laura K. Barger of Harvard University
Dr. Melissa Mallis- Scientist, expert and researcher in Fatigue Risk Management Systems
Their Bio’s can be seen on Torvec’s website or clicking the links above.
We feel we now have both an internal and external team that will allow us to reach our goals.
Our MyCadian™ Watch and CURA™ Software programming is on schedule. We should have prototypes in the last quarter of 2015. We will be starting our clinical analyses in October which also will be completed in the last quarter.
  Using the abilities of our systems some of our potential markets are:

Truck drivers
Retail-General public drivers
Airline Pilots
Train Engineers
School and over the road bus drivers
Corporations-to improve productivity, lower absenteeism, have less mistakes and accidents
Hospital Personnel
Security guards
Municipalities-for Police, Fireman, DPW Workers, etc.
Military/Government- such as Air Traffic Controllers, Guards, etc.
Security systems for store clerks, children, or emergency notifications
Campers, Hunters and Hikers
Surveillance Agents
Students
People in meetings
People with health problems
People monitoring critical processes i.e. nuclear facilities, infrastructure, etc.

Hydraulic Pump 
We are presently making adjustments to our new valve technology. Each change has shown improvement. We are focusing on performing at the maximum required operating conditions for the pump. We are confident that our targeted performance metrics can be achieved. Our goal is to create the most efficient pump on the market in a smaller, lighter and more economical package.
We have concepts for the variable displacement pump ready but at this time are focusing our efforts on the valve, which will be used in both pumps.  We plan on testing portions of the variable displacement design with our current hardware.  This will save us time and effort in the development of the variable displacement design.
We are making progress and are confident we will meet our goals.  We are using advanced engineering tools and reference materials to assist us in our development.  While developing new technologies, issues come up that are difficult to predict and unfortunately can affect our timelines.   We are currently 30-60 days behind schedule.  We are working hard to get the best product to Milwaukee School of Engineering for third party testing as quickly as possible.
Lastly we will be redesigning our website which should also be completed in the last quarter of 2015.

These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those described in such statements. Such risks and uncertainties include those described from time to time in Torvec's SEC reports, including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.

CurAegis Technologies, Inc. Issues CEO Product Update




















November 14, 2016 16:17 ET

 | Source: CurAegis Technologies, Inc.






ROCHESTER, N.Y., Nov.  14, 2016  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- On November 14, 2016, Richard A. Kaplan, the chief executive officer of CurAegis Technologies, Inc., provided the following update of the Company’s accomplishments and business priorities as presented below. Dear Shareholders, This is a very interesting time for CurAegis which complicates the writing of this report. I have to balance the excitement that we feel and the successes that we have had with the cautious guidance that things don’t always turn out the way one thinks they will. That being said, I will do my best to communicate where we are at this time. Aegis Pump & Motor: As you know, our tests at MSOE (Milwaukee School of Engineering) went well. We have subsequently setup meetings with prospective users. One of the largest potential customers has asked us to produce a production prototype motor for them. They have given us their specifications and we are preparing to deliver it in July of 2017. There are 3 objectives that we want to achieve: higher efficiency, lower cost and a smaller, lighter package. The potential customer has given us their desired parameters and priorities of each and we are confident we can meet them. We are also hiring an industry consultant who will be taking us into other very large potential customers in the next few months. Again, I want to express caution in that any new technology has risks. CURA System: We have completed our validation studies at the University of Colorado at Boulder and the University of Rochester Medical Center. To say they were great may be an understatement. We can now state that we can predict a person’s fatigue level, at close to laboratory accuracy, in real-time. To our knowledge, we are the only technology in the world that can do this. Both our management and our Scientific Advisory Board are excited with the results. We will be releasing and distributing white papers and peer reviews over the next few months. These are to be used in peer reviewed publications, journals, magazines, professional conferences and sales initiatives. We will publish them on our website when they are ready. This should open up many doors and create even more excitement for us in all of our 9 verticals: Trucking and Heavy EquipmentBusingAviationMedical (hospitals, nursing homes, homecare companies)Municipal (Counties and States for police, fire, EMT, 911 operators, plow drivers, etc.)Federal (military, air traffic control, etc.)General CorporateSports Science (college and professional)Students We have hired four sales Vice Presidents in Trucking, Busing, Aviation and Municipalities over the last five months. They have already amassed a large volume of sales opportunities. I will caution that these are not sales or commitments, but organizations that have expressed interest. Now that we will have validations and production level myCadian® watches, we hope to convert these into sales. We are also in discussions with government agencies, insurance companies and potential partners both nationally and internationally. As of today, we are in the final phases of our internal trials and anticipate the kick-off of our eight beta trials starting in December. We expect these trials to show: User acceptance – The user understands the benefits, learns from and enjoys the experience.Ease of implementation – Our client companies do not have to do any “heavy lifting” to start distributing and benefiting from the technology.Efficacy of the technology – that the client companies should benefit from higher productivity, lower absenteeism, fewer mistakes and accidents and have a happier, healthier employee population. If all goes well, we should launch in January or February and start shipping in the second quarter of 2017. As always, we are grateful for your patience and understanding through the years and hope we will justify both.

CurAegis Technologies, Inc. Issues CEO Product Update






GlobeNewswire



Nov 14, 2016 4:18 PM EST













 




























































 ROCHESTER, N.Y., Nov. 14, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- On November 14, 2016, Richard A. Kaplan, the chief executive officer of CurAegis Technologies, Inc., provided the following update of the Company's accomplishments and business priorities as presented below. Dear Shareholders, This is a very interesting time for CurAegis which complicates the writing of this report. I have to balance the excitement that we feel and the successes that we have had with the cautious guidance that things don't always turn out the way one thinks they will. That being said, I will do my best to communicate where we are at this time.  Aegis Pump & Motor: As you know, our tests at MSOE (Milwaukee School of Engineering) went well. We have subsequently setup meetings with prospective users. One of the largest potential customers has asked us to produce a production prototype motor for them. They have given us their specifications and we are preparing to deliver it in July of 2017. There are 3 objectives that we want to achieve: higher efficiency, lower cost and a smaller, lighter package. The potential customer has given us their desired parameters and priorities of each and we are confident we can meet them. We are also hiring an industry consultant who will be taking us into other very large potential customers in the next few months. Again, I want to express caution in that any new technology has risks.  CURA System: We have completed our validation studies at the University of Colorado at Boulder and the University of Rochester Medical Center. To say they were great may be an understatement. We can now state that we can predict a person's fatigue level, at close to laboratory accuracy, in real-time. To our knowledge, we are the only technology in the world that can do this.
