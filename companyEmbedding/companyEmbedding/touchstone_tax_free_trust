	TOUCHSTONE TAX-FREE TRUST





	 





	Touchstone Tax-Free Money Market Fund





	 





	Supplement to the Prospectus, Summary Prospectus, and






	Statement of Additional Information dated October 30, 2014,

	as supplemented November 21, 2014 and December 22, 2014





	 




	At a meeting of the Board of Trustees of Touchstone Tax-Free Trust (the Board) held on February 12, 2015, the Board rescinded the plan to close and liquidate Touchstone Tax-Free Money Market Fund (the Fund).  In addition, the Board approved an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the Agreement) between the Fund and General Municipal Money Market Fund, a comparable money market fund advised by The Dreyfus Corporation (Dreyfus) pursuant to which the Fund would be reorganized on a tax-free basis with and into General Municipal Money Market Fund.




	 




	Specifically, pursuant to the Agreement, Touchstone Tax-Free Money Market Fund will be reorganized into General Municipal Money Market Fund, advised by Dreyfus, and Class A and Class S shareholders of Touchstone Tax-Free Money Market Fund will become shareholders of Class A shares of General Municipal Money Market Fund (the Reorganization).




	 




	A special meeting of shareholders of Touchstone Tax-Free Money Market Fund is expected to be held on or about May 8, 2015 and approval of the Agreement will be voted on at that time.  A joint proxy statement/prospectus containing more information regarding the Reorganization will be provided in advance of the meeting to shareholders of record of Touchstone Tax-Free Money Market Fund as of March 10, 2015.  If the Agreement is approved at the special meeting and certain conditions required are satisfied, the Reorganization is expected to take place on or about June 5, 2015.




	 




	The Fund will remain closed to new investors.  The Funds checkwriting feature is being maintained for shareholders currently using that service, but, in light of the proposed Reorganization, new checkbooks will not be issued.  Any checks written against the Funds shares will be honored until the close of the Reorganization on or about June 5, 2015 to the extent there are sufficient assets to clear those checkwriting drafts.  Please note that General Municipal Money Market Fund has a checkwriting feature that may be utilized post-Reorganization, pending shareholder approval of the Reorganization.




	 




	Transactions from automatic investment plans or systematic withdrawal plans will continue to occur until the close of the Reorganization on or about June 5, 2015.  Subsequent to the Reorganization, automatic investment plan and systematic withdrawal plan transactions will continue in General Municipal Money Market Fund unless the shareholder instructs otherwise.




	 




	This supplement is not a solicitation of any proxy.




	 




	Please contact your financial advisor or Touchstone at 800.543.0407 if you have any questions.

Home › Our Company › About Us
Access to Experience
Touchstone Investments helps investors achieve their financial goals by providing access to a distinctive selection of institutional asset managers who are known and respected for proficiency in their specific area of expertise. Learn more.
Recognizing that mastery of all investment disciplines is beyond the scope of any one firm, the use of sub-advisors allows Touchstone to offer an array of strategically focused funds across styles and asset classes. Touchstone's fund lineup includes U.S. equity, international/global equity, U.S. fixed income, diversified income, multi-asset and alternative investment funds.
Touchstone's investment professionals are responsible for the selection, monitoring and replacement of each sub-advisor, subject to the approval of Touchstone Funds' Board of Trustees. Our professionals use a due diligence process commensurate with the standards and guidelines typically used by sophisticated institutional investors and are responsible for the oversight of each sub-advisor including the adherence to each fund's stated investment objective, style integrity, return objective and risk parameters. Touchstone believes that this comprehensive approach to selecting and monitoring of our sub-advisors helps to maximize fund performance over the long-term.
 
Sub-Advisor Selection and Monitoring
Touchstone follows a diligent process when conducting a search for a new sub-advisor. Intensive evaluation leads to a selection of a sub-advisor only if the firm has demonstrated proficiency in its area of declared expertise over a sustained period of time. Specific selection criteria are developed based on the product objective and both qualitative and quantitative evaluations are performed.
We oversee each fund and each manager relative to expectations that were established during the selection process. A formal quantitative analysis is completed quarterly and a qualitative review is performed at least annually in which we reassess the sub-advisor's investment capabilities and supporting infrastructure.
Touchstone Funds have been created to meet defined investment goals and risk-return objectives. Our rigorous sub-advisor selection process and robust oversight approach are designed to ensure that we deliver on our commitment of providing access to institutional asset managers with the goal of achieving favorable long term results.

What is Distinctively Active?
                            
                            At Touchstone Investments, we recognize that not all mutual fund companies are created equal. Our commitment to being Distinctively Active means the employment of a fully integrated and rigorous process for identifying and partnering with asset managers who sub-advise our mutual funds and advocating a robust approach to portfolio construction that either uses active strategies as a standalone or serves as a complement to passive strategies.  That is the power of Distinctively Active.

 Federated Investors’ Ohio Municipal Cash Trust to Acquire $91 Million in Assets from Touchstone 
         










    










 






 











 









Federated Investors' Ohio Municipal Cash Trust to Acquire $91 Million in Assets from Touchstone Ohio Tax-Free Money Market Fund

		  Transition expected to be completed in Q2 2015
		

Mar 20, 2015, 08:30 ET
		  		  							
						 from   Federated Investors, Inc. 











 
















































 

 




















 


PITTSBURGH, March 20, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Federated Investors, Inc. (NYSE:   FII), one of the nation's largest investment managers, and Touchstone Advisors, Inc., have reached a definitive agreement regarding the acquisition by Federated of certain assets relating to Touchstone's management of the Touchstone Ohio Tax-Free Money Market Fund, a series of Touchstone Tax-Free Trust. In connection with the acquisition, approximately $91 million in tax-free money market assets will be reorganized from the Touchstone Ohio Tax-Free Money Market Fund into Federated Ohio Municipal Cash Trust, a portfolio with a similar investment objective.
Established in 1990, Federated Ohio Municipal Cash Trust has approximately $391 million in net assets and is a portfolio of the Federated Money Market Obligations Trust, which has approximately $184 billion in aggregate net assets. With approximately $19 billion in tax-free, state-specific money market assets under management, Federated offers more tax-free state money market products than any other investment manager.
"Federated's experience in handling these types of transactions and our commitment to providing a variety of liquidity-management solutions for our clients provide an ideal opportunity for the shareholders of the Touchstone fund to transition to Federated," said Joe Machi, director of alliances at Federated. "As a leading provider of cash management services, Federated regularly works with organizations of many types and sizes as they evaluate their liquidity-management needs, and we continue to seek opportunities for mutually beneficial transactions."
"In light of the changing regulatory landscape with respect to money market funds, we sought a party that had a commitment to the money market fund business. Federated offers shareholders of the Touchstone Ohio Tax-Free Money Market Fund the opportunity to continue their investments in a larger fund with comparable investment objectives, investment strategies, tax benefits, expenses and performance," said Steve Graziano, president of Touchstone Investments.
The reorganization is expected to be tax-free and is anticipated to be completed in the second quarter of 2015. Closing of the transaction is subject to shareholder approval and certain other contingencies.
