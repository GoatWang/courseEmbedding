Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/22/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Dr. Hadley Phillips is a well-known Board Certified Ophthalmologist whose credentials include a residency at Detroit Osteopathic Hospital Consortium with training at Manhattan Eye and Ear Hospital and New York Eye and Ear infirmary. After Supplemental studies at several large cataract facilities throughout the country, Dr. Phillips established himself as one of the premier Cataract Specialists in the New York area.

Dr. Phillips had the foresight to bring some of the most modern technological advances to our region and helped to develop some of the major aspects in the modern cataract surgery procedure. As a pioneer in small-incision cataract surgery, he routinely began performing his stitch-less cataract procedure in 1989 allowing patients to resume their normal activities almost immediately.
He founded and developed several local eye facilities, including the Phillips Eye Specialists, Hudson Eye Specialists, and River Drive Surgery and Laser Center, which today are staffed by over 40 physicians and 120 employees and specialize in state of the art New Jersey cataract surgery. If you want to learn more about cataract surgery in New Jersey and why the physicians at Phillips Eye Center are experts in their field plese visit our surgeon bio pages and our cataract surgery page.
Dr. Phillips is a strong believer of in-depth personal consultations for every patient, and is committed to providing each patient with the best individualized treatment.
