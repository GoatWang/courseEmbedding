David Glenn - Relentless
 



	Published Monday 23rd September 2013








David Glenn - Relentless 
STYLE: Rock
RATING           
OUR PRODUCT CODE: 143359-20983
LABEL: Evident Music 
FORMAT: CD Album
ITEMS: 1
This product is currently not available from Cross Rhythms DirectReviewed by A T BradfordThis Virginia-based worship artist offers some of the most musically and lyrically apposite contemporary Christian music that I have heard in quite a while. The opener "Great King" fuses a robust drum percussion combination with Glenn's consistently biblical lyrics, "We Are One (Stand United)" features artful chorus harmonies and an emphatic delivery that would be even better if produced without the singer's breath sounds. "You Reign" is a straight from the heart worship statement again underscored by emphatic drum-work and a great melodic range to boot. The title track (also performed as an acoustic piece and as strings only) is another example of masterful truth, punctuated by sparkling keys. David sings, "You are with me, you are for me/You never let go, so I never walk alone. . . relentless." Glenn himself says of the album, "People sing worship songs at church and they also sing the same songs as they listen to the radio, so I really try to appeal to those audiences." And he succeeds.
