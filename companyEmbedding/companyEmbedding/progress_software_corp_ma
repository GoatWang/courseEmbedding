About Progress



Data is exploding. Digital devices are proliferating. Interfaces are taking new forms. Everything must be connected. Developers need to deliver more sophisticated apps, faster than ever before. This is where Progress shines.




Progress has always delivered the platform and tools that organizations need to develop and deploy mission-critical business applications.  As the types of devices and types of interfaces on which applications run proliferate, the number of systems that need to be connected rises, and the amount of data that needs to be harnessed continues to skyrocket, organizations are looking for a modern platform that will enable them to quickly and easily develop and deliver tomorrow’s applications.

Progress offers the best platform for building and deploying tomorrow’s applications quickly and easily.  Progress offers flexible frontend tooling for delivering an engaging and multi-channel UX, a modern, reliable, scalable and secure backend to build and run microservices, and leading data connectivity capabilities for harnessing data from business systems and any other data source, whether on premise or in the cloud. 
Progress customers span the globe and include thousands of ISVs that build their business application offerings on Progress, and tens of thousands of organizations using Progress to build their own mission-critical applications.

Announcing the Downloadable Progress Knowledge Base (ProKB)!


                What is ProKB?
                ----------------------------
                ProKB is a Windows-based, OpenEdge application that allows you to browse a snapshot of the Progress Knowledge Base offline. 
                It can be freely downloaded and installed on your computer. 
                It includes an OpenEdge run-time only license, full GUI functionality and a local database containing the entire knowledge base as it was on the date it was downloaded. 
                This is a standalone application and does not require that you have any other Progress products or licenses installed.
                Unlike a prior version which contained only OpenEdge knowledge articles, the new version contains articles for all Progress product lines.
                ProKB is updated daily with the latest knowledge base articles and can be downloaded here.

History[edit]
Progress Software was co-founded by several MIT graduates, including Joseph W. Alsop, in 1981.[9] Initially called Data Language Corporation (DLC), the company changed its name in 1987 to match that of its flagship product, Progress.
In October 2002, Progress Software acquired Boston based eXcelon Corporation (NASDAQ: EXLN, formerly Object Design, NASDAQ: ODIS) for approximately US$24 Million. eXcelon created an XML IDE, Stylus Studio, which is now marketed by Progress Software.
In December 2003, Progress Software acquired DataDirect Technologies Ltd. for $88 million.[10] In 2005, Progress acquired Apama and entered the Complex Event Processing Space.
In January 2006, Progress Software acquired Mountain View-based Actional Corporation, which itself was the merger between Actional Corporation and WestBridge Technologies (an XML Security company). Actional focuses on providing enterprise-class SOA Management, Security, and run-time Governance solutions that cross vendor and protocol boundaries, based upon open standards.[11]
In March 2006, Progress Software acquired Neon Systems (NASDAQ: NEON), which offers a set of capabilities for companies seeking to modernize existing 3270 applications.[12][13] In 2010, Progress Software acquired the Santa Clara-based Savvion Inc., a provider of Business Process Management technology. Later that year, Progress announced the introduction of its Responsive Process Management (RPM) suite, including its Progress Control Tower.
In April 2011, Progress Software sold their SWIFT integration product "ADS" (formally Iona's "Artix Data Services") to C24 Technologies Ltd (UK). The product was re-branded to its former name "Integration Objects".
In April 2012, Progress announced strategy shift to become a much more narrowly focused, specialist vendor, looking to sell or decommission most of their existing products.[14][15]
In June 2013, Progress Software acquired Rollbase Inc., a platform as a service (PaaS) for rapid development of cloud business applications.[16] Rollbase was recognized by Gartner as a "2013 Cool Vendor in PaaS".[17]
In June 2013, Software AG acquired Apama activities from Progress Software.
In June 2014, Progress Software announced that it had acquired Cincinnati-based Modulus, a company providing a Node.js and MongoDB cloud platform.[18]
In December 2014, Progress Software completed the acquisition of Telerik, a leading provider of application development tools.[19][20]
Product[edit]
The Progress portfolio includes solutions for enterprise integration, data interoperability and application development, including Software as a Service (SaaS) enablement and delivery.
During the early-2000s, SonicMQ became a popular message broker made by Progress Software. It implements the Java Message Service 1.1 API. Gilliland's notion was that the term 'Bus,' being the fast communication layer in computer hardware architecture was analogous with the SonicXQ capabilities; further he felt the term more marketable generally. Gilliland reviewed his idea with Sonic marketing director Danny Goodall, they concluded 'Enterprise' over 'Application' and Goodall shared the thinking with US management. The idea was taken up by Greg O'Connor, Bill Cullen and Gordon Van Huizen of the Progress Sonic team, and subsequently adopted by IT analyst firm Gartner to become an industry accepted term.
In June 2008, Progress Software acquired Xcalia, a data integration company, and Mindreef, which developed SOAPscope products. In September 2008, Progress acquired IONA Technologies. IONA brought three product lines into the fold: FUSE (open source SOA), Artix (commercially licensed SOA), and Orbix (CORBA infrastructure).
In June 2012, the company sold its subsidiary FuseSource, which was spun out from Progress in October 2010, to Red Hat.[21] In October 2012, Progress Software sold the brands Sonic, Savvion, Actional and DataXtend (DXSI) to Trilogy which created the company Aurea Software.[22] The company also announced that Jay Bhatt planned to step down from the positions and as a director, effective December 7.
In May, 2016, Progress Software re-branded as "Progress" to emphasize its increased focus on delivering cloud-based software.[23]

Progress Software was co-founded by several MIT graduates, including Joseph W. Alsop, in 1981.[9] Initially called Data Language Corporation (DLC), the company changed its name in 1987 to match that of its flagship product, Progress.
In October 2002, Progress Software acquired Boston based eXcelon Corporation (NASDAQ: EXLN, formerly Object Design, NASDAQ: ODIS) for approximately US$24 Million. eXcelon created an XML IDE, Stylus Studio, which is now marketed by Progress Software.
In December 2003, Progress Software acquired DataDirect Technologies Ltd. for $88 million.[10] In 2005, Progress acquired Apama and entered the Complex Event Processing Space.
In January 2006, Progress Software acquired Mountain View-based Actional Corporation, which itself was the merger between Actional Corporation and WestBridge Technologies (an XML Security company). Actional focuses on providing enterprise-class SOA Management, Security, and run-time Governance solutions that cross vendor and protocol boundaries, based upon open standards.[11]
In March 2006, Progress Software acquired Neon Systems (NASDAQ: NEON), which offers a set of capabilities for companies seeking to modernize existing 3270 applications.[12][13] In 2010, Progress Software acquired the Santa Clara-based Savvion Inc., a provider of Business Process Management technology. Later that year, Progress announced the introduction of its Responsive Process Management (RPM) suite, including its Progress Control Tower.
In April 2011, Progress Software sold their SWIFT integration product "ADS" (formally Iona's "Artix Data Services") to C24 Technologies Ltd (UK). The product was re-branded to its former name "Integration Objects".
In April 2012, Progress announced strategy shift to become a much more narrowly focused, specialist vendor, looking to sell or decommission most of their existing products.[14][15]
In June 2013, Progress Software acquired Rollbase Inc., a platform as a service (PaaS) for rapid development of cloud business applications.[16] Rollbase was recognized by Gartner as a "2013 Cool Vendor in PaaS".[17]
In June 2013, Software AG acquired Apama activities from Progress Software.
In June 2014, Progress Software announced that it had acquired Cincinnati-based Modulus, a company providing a Node.js and MongoDB cloud platform.[18]
In December 2014, Progress Software completed the acquisition of Telerik, a leading provider of application development tools.[19][20]
Product[edit]
The Progress portfolio includes solutions for enterprise integration, data interoperability and application development, including Software as a Service (SaaS) enablement and delivery.
During the early-2000s, SonicMQ became a popular message broker made by Progress Software. It implements the Java Message Service 1.1 API. Gilliland's notion was that the term 'Bus,' being the fast communication layer in computer hardware architecture was analogous with the SonicXQ capabilities; further he felt the term more marketable generally. Gilliland reviewed his idea with Sonic marketing director Danny Goodall, they concluded 'Enterprise' over 'Application' and Goodall shared the thinking with US management. The idea was taken up by Greg O'Connor, Bill Cullen and Gordon Van Huizen of the Progress Sonic team, and subsequently adopted by IT analyst firm Gartner to become an industry accepted term.
In June 2008, Progress Software acquired Xcalia, a data integration company, and Mindreef, which developed SOAPscope products. In September 2008, Progress acquired IONA Technologies. IONA brought three product lines into the fold: FUSE (open source SOA), Artix (commercially licensed SOA), and Orbix (CORBA infrastructure).
In June 2012, the company sold its subsidiary FuseSource, which was spun out from Progress in October 2010, to Red Hat.[21] In October 2012, Progress Software sold the brands Sonic, Savvion, Actional and DataXtend (DXSI) to Trilogy which created the company Aurea Software.[22] The company also announced that Jay Bhatt planned to step down from the positions and as a director, effective December 7.
In May, 2016, Progress Software re-branded as "Progress" to emphasize its increased focus on delivering cloud-based software.[23]

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Forward-Looking Statements  Certain statements below about anticipated results and our products and markets are forward-looking statements that are based on our current plans and assumptions. Important information about the bases for these plans and assumptions and factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements is contained below and in Item 1A. "Risk Factors" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Use of Constant Currency  Revenue from our international operations has historically represented more than half of our total revenue. As a result, our revenue results have been impacted, and we expect will continue to be impacted, by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For example, if the local currencies of our foreign subsidiaries weaken, our consolidated results stated in U.S. dollars are negatively impacted.  As exchange rates are an important factor in understanding period to period comparisons, we believe the presentation of revenue growth rates on a constant currency basis enhances the understanding of our revenue results and evaluation of our performance in comparison to prior periods. The constant currency information presented is calculated by translating current period results using prior period weighted average foreign currency exchange rates. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).  Overview  We are a global software company that simplifies the development, deployment and management of business applications on premise or in the cloud, on any platform or device, to any data source, with enhanced performance, minimal IT complexity and low total cost of ownership. Our comprehensive portfolio of products provides leading solutions for rapid application development, broad data integration and efficient data analysis. Our solutions are used across a variety of industries.  At the beginning of fiscal year 2015, we acquired Telerik AD, a leading provider of application development tools. Telerik enables its 1.7 million strong developer community to create compelling user experiences across cloud, web, mobile and  desktop applications. Through this acquisition, we provide comprehensive cloud and on-premise platform offerings that enable developers to rapidly create applications, driven by data for any web, desktop or mobile platform.  The revenue of Telerik is being recognized ratably over the maintenance period, which is generally one year, as vendor specific objective evidence (or VSOE) of fair value cannot be established for such maintenance. As a result of acquisition accounting, the acquired deferred revenue balance was significantly reduced to reflect its fair value as of the acquisition date. However, we are still incurring the associated costs to fulfill the acquired deferred revenue, which are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations. As a result, our expenses as a percentage of total revenue are higher than we expect they will be in future periods once this acquired deferred revenue balance is recognized.  Effective September 1, 2014, we began operating as three distinct segments:  In fiscal year 2015, we repurchased and retired 1.3 million shares for $32.9 million under our fiscal year 2014 share repurchase authorization, leaving $14.5 million remaining under the authorization. In September 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a new $100.0 million share repurchase program, which increased the total authorization to $114.5 million. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased will be determined by management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors, and the Board of Directors may choose to suspend, expand or discontinue the repurchase program at any time.  We derive a significant portion of our revenue from international operations, which are primarily conducted in foreign currencies. As a result, changes in the value of these foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar have significantly impacted our results of operations and may impact our future results of operations. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014, the value of the U.S. dollar strengthened in comparison to certain foreign currencies, including in Europe, Brazil and Australia, and continued to strengthen during the first half of 2015. Since approximately 35% of our revenue is denominated in foreign currency, our revenue results have been negatively impacted, and we expect will continue to be impacted, by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.  We have evaluated, and expect to continue to evaluate, possible acquisitions and other strategic transactions designed to expand our business and/or add complementary products and technologies to our existing product sets. As a result, our expected uses of cash could change, our cash position could be reduced and we may incur additional debt obligations to the extent we complete additional acquisitions.  We believe that existing cash balances, together with funds generated from operations and amounts available under our credit facility will be sufficient to finance our operations and meet our foreseeable cash requirements through at least the next twelve months.  Results of Operations  Fiscal Year 2015 Compared to Fiscal Year 2014 Revenue Fiscal Year Ended Percentage Change Constant (In thousands) November 30, 2015 November 30, 2014 As Reported Currency Revenue $ 377,554 $ 332,533 14 % 21 %  Total revenue increased $45.0 million, or 14%, in fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014. Revenue would have increased by 21% if exchange rates had been constant in fiscal year 2015 as compared to exchange rates in fiscal year 2014. The increase in revenue in fiscal year 2015 was a result of an increase in both license and maintenance and services revenue, primarily due to the impact of our acquisitions of Telerik in December 2014 and BravePoint during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2014. Changes in prices from fiscal year 2014 to fiscal year 2015 did not have a significant impact on our revenue.  License Revenue Fiscal Year Ended Percentage Change Constant (In thousands) November 30, 2015 November 30, 2014 As Reported Currency License $ 130,250 $ 117,801 11 % 18 % As a percentage of total revenue 34 % 35 %  Software license revenue increased $12.4 million, or 11%, in fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014. Software license revenue would have increased by 18% if exchange rates had been constant in fiscal year 2015 as compared to exchange rates in effect in fiscal year 2014. The increase in license revenue was primarily in the North America and Asia Pacific regions as a result of incremental license revenue from the acquisition of Telerik. In addition to the incremental license revenue from Telerik, both OpenEdge and the Data Connectivity and Integration business segment showed strong growth in fiscal year 2015 on a constant currency basis, both to partners, as well as to direct end users.  Maintenance and Services Revenue Fiscal Year Ended Percentage Change Constant (In thousands) November 30, 2015 November 30, 2014 As Reported Currency Maintenance $ 217,718 $ 202,496 8 % 15 % As a percentage of total revenue 58 % 61 % Professional services $ 29,586 $ 12,236 142 % 146 % As a percentage of total revenue 8 % 4 % Total maintenance and services revenue $ 247,304 $ 214,732 15 % 23 % As a percentage of total revenue 66 % 65 %  Maintenance and services revenue increased $32.6 million in fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014. Maintenance revenue increased 8% and professional services revenue increased 142% compared to the prior year. The increase in maintenance revenue was primarily in the North America region, due in large part to the incremental revenue associated with the Telerik acquisition, as well as our strong OpenEdge maintenance renewal rate of over 90%. The increase in professional services revenue was primarily due to the impact of the BravePoint acquisition.  Revenue by Region Fiscal Year Ended Percentage Change Constant (In thousands) November 30, 2015 November 30, 2014 As Reported Currency North America $ 207,566 $ 150,716 38 % 38 % As a percentage of total revenue 55 % 45 % EMEA $ 124,171 $ 131,335 (5 )% 7 % As a percentage of total revenue 33 % 40 % Latin America $ 17,594 $ 24,917 (29 )% (8 )% As a percentage of total revenue 5 % 7 % Asia Pacific $ 28,223 $ 25,565 10 % 22 % As a percentage of total revenue 7 % 8 %  Total revenue generated in North America increased $56.9 million, and total revenue generated outside North America decreased $11.8 million, in fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014. The increase in North America was primarily due to the impact of the Telerik and BravePoint acquisitions. In addition to the incremental revenue from Telerik and BravePoint, the increase in North America was due to strong OpenEdge license sales both to our partners and direct end users, growth in Data Connectivity and Integration license sales to our OEM channel, and strong maintenance renewals.  The decreases in EMEA and Latin America of 5% and 29%, respectively, were primarily due to the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. If exchange rates had been constant in fiscal year 2015 as compared to exchange rates in effect in fiscal year 2014, revenue generated in EMEA would have increased 7% year over year, while revenue generated in Latin America would have decreased by 8%. The 10% increase in Asia Pacific was primarily due to the impact of the Telerik acquisition and revenue generated in the Asia Pacific region would have increased by 22% if exchange rates had been constant in fiscal year 2015 as compared to exchange rates in effect in fiscal year 2014.  Total revenue generated in markets outside North America represented 45% of total revenue in fiscal year 2015 compared to 55% of total revenue in fiscal year 2014. Total revenue generated in markets outside North America would have represented 48% of total revenue if exchange rates had been constant in fiscal year 2015 as compared to the exchange rates in effect in fiscal year 2014.  Revenue by Segment Fiscal Year Ended (In thousands) November 30, 2015 November 30, 2014 Percentage Change OpenEdge segment $ 295,934 $ 296,721 - % Data Connectivity and Integration segment 37,926 34,772 9 % Application Development and Deployment segment 43,694 1,040 4,101 % Total revenue $ 377,554 $ 332,533 14 %  Revenue in the OpenEdge segment decreased $0.8 million in fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014, due to a decrease in maintenance revenue primarily in the EMEA region as a result of the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar, partially offset by incremental services revenues as a result of the BravePoint acquisition. Revenue in the OpenEdge segment would have increased by 8% if exchange rates had been constant in fiscal year 2015 as compared to exchange rates in effect in fiscal year 2014. Data Connectivity and Integration revenue increased $3.2 million, or 9%, in fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014. Application Development revenue increased $42.7 million year over year as a result of the impact of the Telerik acquisition.  Cost of Software Licenses Fiscal Year Ended Percentage (In thousands) November 30, 2015 November 30, 2014 Change Cost of software licenses $ 5,979 $ 6,396 (7 )% As a percentage of software license revenue 5 % 5 % As a percentage of total revenue 2 % 2 %  Cost of software licenses consists primarily of costs of royalties, electronic software distribution costs, duplication and packaging. Cost of software licenses decreased $0.4 million, or 7%, in fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014, and remained flat as a percentage of software license revenue. Cost of software licenses as a percentage of software license revenue varies from period to period depending upon the relative product mix.  Cost of Maintenance and Services Fiscal Year Ended Percentage (In thousands) November 30, 2015 November 30, 2014 Change Cost of maintenance and services $ 40,933 $ 24,864 65 % As a percentage of maintenance and services revenue 17 % 12 % As a percentage of total revenue 11 % 7 %  Cost of maintenance and services consists primarily of costs of providing customer support, consulting and education. Cost of maintenance and services increased $16.1 million, or 65%, in fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014, and increased as a percentage of maintenance and services revenue from 12% to 17%. The increase in cost of maintenance and services is primarily due to the impact of the Telerik and BravePoint acquisitions. With respect to the acquisition of Telerik, as a result of acquisition accounting, the acquired deferred revenue balance was significantly reduced to reflect its fair value as of the acquisition date. However, we are still incurring the associated costs to fulfill the acquired deferred revenue, which primarily relate to cost of maintenance and services. As a result, our expenses as a percentage of total revenue are higher than we expect they will be in future periods once this acquired deferred revenue balance is recognized.  Amortization of Acquired Intangibles Fiscal Year Ended Percentage (In thousands) November 30, 2015 November 30, 2014 Change Amortization of acquired intangibles $ 16,830 $ 2,999 461 % As a percentage of total revenue 4 % 1 %  Amortization of acquired intangibles included in costs of revenue primarily represents the amortization of the value assigned to technology-related intangible assets obtained in business combinations. Amortization of acquired intangibles increased $13.8 million, or 461%, in fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014. The increase was due to amortization of intangible assets acquired in connection with the Modulus, BravePoint and Telerik acquisitions, partially offset by decreases due to the completion of amortization of certain intangible assets acquired in prior years.  Gross Profit Fiscal Year Ended Percentage (In thousands) November 30, 2015 November 30, 2014 Change Gross profit $ 313,812 $ 298,274 5 % As a percentage of total revenue 83 % 90 %  Our gross profit increased $15.5 million, or 5%, in fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014, and our gross profit as a percentage of total revenue decreased from 90% to 83% year over year. The increase is primarily due to an increase in revenue as described above, partially offset by the increase of cost of maintenance and services, mainly due to the impact of the BravePoint acquisition, and the increase of amortization of acquired intangible assets. In addition, as a result of acquisition accounting, the deferred revenue balance acquired from Telerik was significantly reduced to reflect its fair value as of the acquisition date. However, we are still incurring the associated costs to fulfill the acquired deferred revenue, which are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations. As a result, our expenses as a percentage of total revenue are higher than we expect they will be in future periods once this acquired deferred revenue balance is recognized.  Sales and Marketing Fiscal Year Ended Percentage (In thousands) November 30, 2015 November 30, 2014 Change Sales and marketing $ 124,867 $ 101,496 23 % As a percentage of total revenue 33 % 31 %  Sales and marketing expenses increased $23.4 million, or 23%, in fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014, and increased as a percentage of total revenue from 31% to 33%. The increase in sales expenses was primarily due to higher compensation-related costs in the sales function as a result of headcount increases primarily due to the impact of the Telerik and BravePoint acquisitions, as well as higher commissions expense due to the higher level of license revenue compared to fiscal year 2014. Marketing expenses were higher primarily due to the impact of the Telerik acquisition.  Product Development Fiscal Year Ended Percentage (In thousands) November 30, 2015 November 30, 2014 Change Product development costs $ 88,250 $ 63,099 40 % Capitalized product development costs (1,326 ) (4,134 ) (68 )% Total product development expense $ 86,924 $ 58,965 47 % As a percentage of total revenue 23 % 18 %  Product development expenses increased $28.0 million, or 47%, in fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014, and increased as a percentage of revenue from 18% to 23%. The increase was primarily due to higher compensation-related costs in the product development function as a result of headcount increases due to the impact of the Telerik acquisition. Capitalized product development costs decreased by 68% as compared to the prior fiscal year as a result of our decision to replace our internally developed cloud-based mobile application development technology with technology acquired as part of Telerik.  General and Administrative Fiscal Year Ended Percentage (In thousands) November 30, 2015 November 30, 2014 Change General and administrative $ 57,294 $ 48,292 19 % As a percentage of total revenue 15 % 15 %  General and administrative expenses include the costs of our finance, human resources, legal, information systems and administrative departments. General and administrative expenses increased $9.0 million, or 19%, in fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014, and remained flat as a percentage of revenue. The increase was primarily due to higher compensation-related costs in the general and administrative function as a result of headcount increases due to the impact of the Telerik and BravePoint acquisitions.  Amortization of Acquired Intangibles Fiscal Year Ended Percentage (In thousands) November 30, 2015 November 30, 2014 Change Amortization of acquired intangibles $ 12,745 $ 653 1,852 % As a percentage of total revenue 3 % - %  Amortization of acquired intangibles included in operating expenses primarily represents the amortization of value assigned to intangible assets obtained in business combinations other than assets identified as purchased technology. Amortization of acquired intangibles increased $12.1 million in fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014. The increase was due to amortization of intangible assets acquired with the Modulus, BravePoint and Telerik acquisitions, partially offset by decreases due to the completion of amortization of certain intangible assets acquired in prior years.  Restructuring Expenses Fiscal Year Ended Percentage (In thousands) November 30, 2015 November 30, 2014 Change Restructuring expenses $ 12,989 $ 2,266 473 % As a percentage of total revenue 3 % 1 %  We incurred restructuring expenses of $13.0 million in fiscal year 2015 as compared to $2.3 million in fiscal year 2014. Restructuring expenses recorded in fiscal year 2015 relate to the restructuring activities occurring in fiscal years 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional details, including types of expenses incurred and the timing of future expenses and cash payments. See also the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Acquisition-Related Expenses Fiscal Year Ended Percentage (In thousands) November 30, 2015 November 30, 2014 Change Acquisition-related expenses $ 4,239 $ 5,862 (28 )% As a percentage of total revenue 1 % 2 %  Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and include those costs incurred as a result of a business combination. These costs consist of professional service fees, including third-party legal and valuation-related fees, as well as retention fees, and earn-out payments treated as compensation expense. Acquisition-related expenses decreased in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 due to the completion of earn-out provisions related to the Rollbase acquisition as of the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2015, as well as the reversal of contingent consideration provisions related to the Modulus acquisition, which was credited to the consolidated statement of operations during fiscal year 2015. The decrease was partially offset by retention bonus costs incurred in fiscal year 2015 related to the BravePoint and Telerik acquisitions. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.  Income from Operations Fiscal Year Ended Percentage (In thousands) November 30, 2015 November 30, 2014 Change Income from operations $ 14,754 $ 80,740 (82 )% As a percentage of total revenue 4 % 24 %  Income from operations decreased $66.0 million, or 82%, in fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014. As discussed above, the decrease was primarily the result of higher expenses resulting from acquisitions, partially offset by higher revenue during fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014. With respect to the acquisition of Telerik, as a result of acquisition accounting, the acquired deferred revenue balance was significantly reduced to reflect its . . .
