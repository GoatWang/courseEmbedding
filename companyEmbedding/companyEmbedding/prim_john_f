Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Jack Henry & Associates First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Kevin Williams. Sir you may begin.
Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
Thank you. Good morning and thanks for joining us for the Jack Henry & Associates first quarter fiscal 2016 earnings call. I'm Kevin Williams, CFO; and on the call with me today is Jack Prim, our CEO.
The agenda for the call this morning is Jack will start with some his thoughts about the business and the performance of the quarter, then I will provide some additional comments regarding the press release and the earnings we put out yesterday after the market closed, and then as normal we will open the lines up for Q&A.
I need to remind you that remarks or responses to questions concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends or results constitute forward-looking statements or deal with expectations about the future. Like any statement about the future, these are subject to a number of factors which can cause actual results or events to differ materially from those which we anticipate due to a number of risk and uncertainties, and the company undertakes no obligations to update or revise these statements. For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release and the sections in our 10-K entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jack.
John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Kevin. Good morning and welcome to our first quarter earnings call for fiscal year 2016. We are pleased to again be able to report a solid performance for the quarter. Revenue growth was strong at 7% although direct year-over-year comparisons to specific revenue components, especially license fees, are less meaningful due to the prior-period restatements and new revenue recognition procedures. Perhaps the most noteworthy takeaway regarding revenue is that license fees now have a minimal impact on our revenue, making up less than 1% of the total in the last quarter, while our largest revenue category, support and services, represented 96%, and recurring revenue represented 83% of the total.
Outsourcing and payments again showed strong growth as did in-house maintenance based primarily on new credit union core system implementations even with the continued movement of existing in-house customers to outsourcing. We held our annual banking and credit union user conferences in the quarter and had record combined attendance with over 2,200 bank and credit union executives in attendance, including representatives from 30 prospective core customers.
Customers were excited to see the progress on our various core product enhancement initiatives and the influence of the recently acquired Banno team on our mobile and electronic delivery channel solutions. They were also appreciative that the new TILA-RESPA regulatory changes related to mortgage loan disclosures were delivered on time for all JHA systems for the required October implementation date.

This was a massive development and deployment initiative that had to be delivered on a very short timeline. Our sales team finished the quarter right at 100% of sales plans. Pipelines look solid and combined with the user sentiment at the conferences we look forward to continued progress.
With that I'll turn it over to Kevin for a closer look at the numbers.
Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
Thanks, Jack. As Jack mentioned with the change in revenue recognition our license revenue as reported is now clearly immaterial as it represents less than 1% of our revenue. Remember that the vast majority of what used to be considered license revenue is now included in the bundled services, which is included in the support and services line of revenue.
Support and services line of revenue continues to drive our total revenue growth as it increased to $307.7 million, which is a 7% increase over the same quarter a year ago of $288.2 million, and again represented, 96% of our total revenue in both years. Support and services breakdown for the quarter compared to the prior year – implementation services of $17.1 million compared to $18.6 million was a decrease of 8% for the quarter compared to a year ago. Our electronic payments was $126.5 million compared to $119.4 million, which is an increase of 6% for the quarter.
OutLink which is our – OutLink data services was $70.7 million compared to $63.1 million or a 12% increase for the quarter, pretty much in line with what we did last fiscal year. Our in-house maintenance was $84.3 million versus $80 million, or an increase of 5%, and bundled services was up slightly to $9.1 million versus $7.2 million last year. Our hardware decreased 4% for the quarter to $12.3 million from $12.8 million last year.
Our consolidated gross margins improved to 43% for the quarter compared to 42% in last year's fiscal year. License margins were 89% for the quarter. Support and service margins were steady at 43% compared to prior year quarter and our hardware margins improved slightly to 29%, from 26% a year ago due to sales mix.
Our total operating expenses increased 4% for the quarter compared to a year ago and our operating margin for the quarter increased slightly to 25% compared to 24% a year ago. The effective tax rate for the quarter increased to 36.1% from 35.5% the first quarter year-ago, which this increase primarily was due to an increase in effective state rate for the quarter compared to a year ago.
Net income was up 11% to $1.4 million, which led to EPS of $0.64 per share, which was up 14% over last year's EPS of $0.56.
EBITDA for the year to date increased to $111.9 million compared to $101.1 million last year, or an 11% increase, right in line with net income growth. Depreciation and amortization expense of $31.2 million with $13 million in depreciation and $18.2 million in amortization compared to $29.5 million last year. Included in total amortization is the amortization of intangibles from acquisitions which is down slightly to $4.8 million compared to $5.4 million a year ago. Operating cash flows were up $33.5 million to 36% – or a 36% increase to $126.7 million for the year to date, primarily due to the timing of collections of our annual maintenance billings.
We continue to invest in our company both through CapEx and cap software on new and existing products and we continue to return to our shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. Our return on equity for the trailing 12 months is right at 23% return. We also purchased just over 1 million shares for the treasury in the first quarter.
As far as guidance, our guidance has not changed from that that we gave at the beginning of the year on the last call. Revenue is still projected to grow in the upper mid-single-digits for the year. But remember to consider the impact of the revenue and margins for the quarter is due to the change in the revenue recognition and the impact of bundling services, which drove the compound revenue during the year, impacting the total revenue and margins in each of the quarters.

We continue to anticipate a slight leverage on operating margin for the year. However, remember the projected effective tax rate for FY 2016 is 36%, up from 33% last year, since we still can assume that the R&E credit will be reinstated or repeated. This increase in tax rate will be mostly offset by any positive impact on stock purchase during the year.
Obviously if the R&E credit is repeated then we will revise our guidance accordingly. Also I would like to remind you for the second fiscal quarter that we end now, last year had a one time-gain on sales from assets that came from the Goldleaf acquisition. Combine that with the effective tax rate in our second quarter last year was 32%, compared to the expected 36% for this year, and adjusting for just those tow items an apples-to-apples basis, we would have reported $0.60 EPS last year against the current consensus estimate of $0.68 this year, which is probably a little aggressive.
Also considering we had a couple of pennies' positive EPS impact in the first quarter this year that we anticipated to happen in the second quarter from term fees which are total term fees for the quarter was $7 million this quarter compared to 5 million last year.
That concludes our opening comments. We are now ready to take questions. Juliana, will you please open the call lines up for questions?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Glenn Greene from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.
Glenn E. Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Hi, thanks. Good morning, guys. Could you just sort of help delineate the very, very strong growth and margins on the credit union business and were the term fees part of that? And conversely the banking business looked a little bit soft, and then I had a couple of follow-ups.
John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, Glenn, I think primarily the credit union numbers are just a result of we had some – several, very strong sales years. I think in the fiscal year we implemented six credit unions there were $1 billion and assets so we continue to have good momentum. I think the credit union progress was one of the reasons that you saw our software maintenance numbers grow even though again we continue to see a steady progression of existing in-house customers moving to outsourcing. So I think it's just basic fundamental business on the credit union side that's continued to grow. Do you have anything you'd add to that?
Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
Yes, other thing I would add, Glenn, is part of it is impacted a little bit by the bundling of services which just comes down to kind of the timing of delivery of the last products that we have talked about in the last couple of calls. So it had a nice impact on that which the opposite happened to the banking. The bundling services for banking was down about $2.5 million and the bundling for services for credit unions is up is a little, $4 million.
But even if you back that out our credit union revenue growth was still a little over 15%, but still extremely solid growth on a year-over-year basis.
Glenn E. Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
And if you think about it for the year, sort of talk about the revenue growth of the upper mid single digits, how would you sort of so we know the deal with accounting for the bundling services, on a full year basis how would you think about the growth for credit union versus banking?
Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
I think credit union is going to outpace banking by little bit but the timing of billing sources is just hard to predict, Glenn. It is what it is, just comes down to when that last product is delivered and it's tough to anticipate what impact that's going to be. I stand behind the guidance of our revenue in the mid – upper mid single digits, and credit unions is going to outpace banking just a little bit.

Glenn E. Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Okay, then...
John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I wouldn't think that certainly, Glenn, that it would be at a 15% in apples-to-apples growth rate rest of the world.
Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
No, absolutely no.
Glenn E. Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Okay and then the bigger picture question, maybe just broadly the spending trend you are seeing, the booking trend you had in the quarter and pipeline going forward and one of your peers talked about somewhat slowdown in discretionary spending maybe from bigger banks but have you seen anything like that?
John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
We have not, Glenn. Again, as I mentioned the sales team were right at 100% and they just finished their fifth consecutive year of all three brands making – obtaining 100% of their assigned quota and this is usually a pretty challenging quarter, as first quarter of our fiscal year. So there is a certain amount of rushing to close everything if you can in the fourth quarter but – so to come up with 100% performance in Q1 is certainly I think a good sign.
I think the other thing is that the pipelines were up not only compared to where they were a year ago, they were also up compared to where we were at the start of the fourth quarter. So to be up after again that big push in Q4 is a little unusual, and it won't – again it went up a tremendous amount but I would have been happy with flat. So I think generally the fundamentals look pretty solid at this point.
Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
The other thing to remember, Glenn, is Jack mentioned the two user education conference we just had for JHA Banking and Symitar. We had record attendance at the Symitar meeting. We had close to record attendance on the banking side, it was the highest in years, actually the highest I believe since the recession. And the number of prospects that we had at both the user meetings was close to record.
So that is always a good indication when people are willing to send their people to an education conference to get more exposure to our product, that's always a good thing for us to come out of there, and also to have a large number of prospects attend both of those.
Glenn E. Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
And then just a final one and I'll jump back in the queue, but do you guys have any impact from any big bank M&A that's been announced? I mean there has been a couple of notable ones, but I don't know if you were on either side of those equations?
John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
No, nothing new, Glenn. The ones that I've seen in the last several months are – I mean certainly we have some banks that are involved with M&A but we talked about Susquehanna, we talked about CIT (14:04) a year or so ago. But certainly...
Glenn E. Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
So nothing like First Niagara, KeyBank, any of those kind of things?
John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
No, none of those are impactable to us.
Glenn E. Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Okay, great. Thanks guys.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tim Willi from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Timothy Wayne Willi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi, thanks, good morning. I apologize, since I'm talking here a bit late. So if I ask something that was covered just tell me to take it offline. But could you talk a bit about just sort of again the whole network hosting solution that you guys have rolled out? And I know you've just got a handful of customer there. But any color around interest levels or anything along that nature and then also just I know it's a multi-year type of outlook, but maybe you could just talk a bit about the scalability of that, if momentum builds and it takes off?

Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
Yeah Tim, we are continuing to see strong interest there, number of implementations are growing. It's going to be a compounding effect before that comes in meaningful revenue line item, but we are seeing good growth. I would tell you that thus far year to date, in terms of the number of units, number of institutions that we had expected from (15:28) behind what we thought we would be but actually the size some of the institutions has been larger than we expected it would be. So if you look at the sales margin dollars that we expected to book, we are actually ahead of where we expected to be even though the number of actual units, number of actual financial institutions is less than we thought that it might be at this point. But we see very good interest. There was a lot of discussion around those topics at the user conference. The emphasis on regulatory agencies, on cyber security is continuing to ramp up and that's, again, we think going to be a tailwind for this type of service.
So again probably a little – a year or two away from this becoming a noteworthy line item in terms of how it shows up in the financials but we're very pleased with where it is at this point.
Timothy Wayne Willi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Great. And then just on capital, and again, if you hit on this in Glenn's questions I missed it, I apologize. But just any thoughts around how the M&A environment looks like? I mean it looks like in the tech world lots of – it seems like people are trying to scramble for exits of sales, there's maybe talk of the cost of capital going up and the valuations in the marketplace obviously continuing to expand. Have you seen any change around books coming across your desks and/or seller valuations continuing to stretch out, are they starting to flatten out in terms of what they are looking for versus a year ago?
John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
We have not seen any change in expectations of what properties should sell for, Tim. I think deal flow books coming across our desk, nothing noteworthy to mention there. We don't take the approach of let's just bolt on revenue and buy something just because it's available for sale et cetera. If it's a good strategic fit, if it fits with our sales distribution channel, if it's a product that that is something our customers need and we can leverage it through those channels, then certainly we would give it a look. But most of what we are seeing continues not to meet those guidelines and frankly the few that we have seen in recent history that did fall into those guidelines, the other challenge there was the expectation around selling price. And I don't know that has moderated yet.
Timothy Wayne Willi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then...
Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
Having said that, Tim, we have an untapped credit facility that we would love to find the right acquisition. So we will continue to look for them.
Timothy Wayne Willi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Yes, no, obviously you guys have a great balance sheet versus the industry, which is not in bad shape, but you obviously are about as pristine as it gets right now. Just a last one and I'll hop off. In the payment business and sort of tying into EMV and I guess more broadly security, I mean we do hear a lot around the payments companies finding some uptick in not just EMV revenue which might be sort of transitory but also just enhanced security around their payment business, their payment cards et cetera.
Are you seeing any of that? Is that something that's picked up or do you think that could pick up in that payment business? I don't know if it would be in that line item or a different line item, but just any thoughts there? Thanks.

John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Tim, the EMV numbers – there is – first of all we are not in the card production business. So there is no card production or no meaningful card production revenue. I mean, we work with outside card manufacturers and while there may be a little bit of a market there, it's not a meaningful number, so from the EMV card production, nothing there. There may be some very slight upticks in some of the processing fees around EMV. But again I don't think that it would be noteworthy.
Security – for your basic payment processing businesses, I think it's difficult to get paid more for security. I mean I think the kind of security product that we get potentially paid additional for would be like a hosted network services or some of the monitoring intrusion prevention services that we offer to our customers.
Our customers had always expected that their payments are processed securely. And that I don't think they are willing to pay us anything else, for something they already expect to be included. If anything, I would tell you that we continue to invest significant amounts of money in and around the security area to make sure in fact that we do deliver on that expectation that our customers have.
So other than the security-related products and services that we've offered for some time, I don't know that I see a lot of upside in terms of existing businesses based on security considerations.
Timothy Wayne Willi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Great, thanks very much. That's all I had.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta from Northcoast Research. Your line is now open.
Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC
Hi, Good morning Kevin and Jack. Hey, Kevin, as you – as I listen in your comments and you talk about the second quarter and based on you saying maybe a couple of pennies pulled into the first quarter, would you expect year-over-year growth or is that going to be difficult considering the tough comparisons you have and kind of what happened in the first quarter?
Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
I think it's going to be tough to have much, if any, growth, Kartik. I think if I was going to guide you to something I'd probably guide you to basically flat with last year. And then like I said all along, with the billing service, everything, our year is going to be more backend-loaded than you all are historically used to. So we are anticipating a very sizable fourth quarter. So second quarter is not going to be much, if any, growth. Obviously if Congress puts the R&E credit in before December 31 then all bets are off because then that changes the effective tax rate considerably and then obviously we would have growth but that's about the only way I can see that happening.
Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC
And Kevin, as you look at kind of where the balance sheet is and the amount of free cash you were going to generate this year and where the stock price is, do you, will you remain aggressive in buying back shares or is this a point in time where you are more comfortable kind of building cash on the balance sheet and waiting for an opportunity either for an acquisition, or if something happens in the marketplace, taking advantage of buying back stock at that point in time?
Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
Well, Kartik, I don't know about being aggressive. We've said for the last couple of quarters that we plan to be more systematic in just buying shares back rather than trying to chase the price. So, I anticipate that we will continue to be in the market. Obviously, we have a board meeting next week and that will be one of the topics we discuss. But I don't see any need and I don't think the board, based on previous conversations, sees a need for us to build cash on the balance sheet. We've got basically a $600 million revolver that's untapped and with our balance sheet and cash flow if we find an acquisition that's bigger than that we can get financing pretty quickly to satisfy that but I don't really see any need to keep a whole bunch of cash on the balance sheet.

John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, it's like we're going to work really hard not to create buying opportunities.
Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC
And then, Jack, just one last question here. You talked about the pipeline being really strong and the success you've had on the credit union side, are you seeing – if you look at the pipeline and kind of spending trends, any changes and how banks or credit unions are spending? Are you seeing more growth in one area or another?
John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
That's a good question, Kartik. Our sales have been pretty solid across board, there is not any one area, on previous earnings calls and I'd say essentially the same thing today, that I would call out as being an exceptional area. Again, we are continuing to see growth and momentum in some of the new services like the hosted network services. Some of the core activity is probably a little slower than what we like to see right now but that's in terms of in the quarter itself but it was offset by sales of other products and I don't necessarily think that observations on a particular quarter represent a trend at this point.
So it's been more of kind of across the board or a number of different areas that nothing I would call out as being particularly unique or different. There is a lot of interest in some of our electronic delivery initiatives and the internet banking and mobile and tablet functionality that we are bringing to market, a lot interest in seeing what we are doing there. But that – again nothing I would point to as being a substantially bigger contributor.
Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
The one thing I would add that, Kartik, is our trend of existing in-house customers moving to outsource continues at a very nice pace. I think we had 11 in the first quarter that made that move, so that trend continues very nicely for us.
Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC
All right. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
Thanks, Kartik.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Koning from Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.
David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Yeah, hey guys. Nice job again. Yeah, and I guess I'm just wondering if we look back for the last probably 20, 30 years, there has been kind of always a little bit of fear that when the M&A environment kind of picks up for banks that it will hurt your spending. And the last couple of years now you and, Fiserv is like you too, have pretty high term fees but yet growth is pretty much as good as ever. And I mean is this just kind of the thesis again playing out that it really does – consolidation, it just doesn't matter that much. Maybe you can just comment on that a little bit.
John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Well, Dave, it is certainly a factor that we have all dealt with for the last 20 or 30 years and managed, as you indicated, to continue to find ways to grow the business, additional products and services and kind of rounding out our offering. That is certainly our expectation. It does seem – and I haven't done the math to actually check this but it sort of feels like some of the industry consolidation has picked up a little bit here in the last six months or so, but again when you look at it on a full-year basis will that amount to a 5% shrinkage instead of 4% shrinkage? Maybe. But again I think it's just there are opportunities there, we continue to find them, and take advantage of those and we think we can continue to grow in the current environment.
Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
Yeah, and Dave as the slides in our investor presentation has shown for many years, the vast majority of the consolidation is happening at the low level, the lower tier of asset-size bank and credit unions which is not really our playground anyway.

David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Okay.
Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
And actually – our target market has actually been pretty stable if not actually growing in some of the larger segments.
David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Yeah. Okay. That's good and then the in-house maintenance revenue stream you mentioned there, I mean that growth I think was 5%, the strongest in several quarters now. Is that sustainable or was there anything in there that was a little bit one-off or is there just a new core replacement cycle with some of the credit unions that just allows that to stay high for a while?
Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
Well, I would tell you, Dave, that the majority of that increase in our sales came from the credit union side and that is just because we continue to install a lot of in-house credit unions on that side of the business.
John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, as I mentioned, David, last year we converted six credit unions that were over $1 billion in assets and so that was throughout the year, so you were only seeing partial maintenance from those folks throughout the year. So this was – would be the first quarter that would have reflected all six of those for that full period and then again that's just the six that were over $1 billion. We had 31 credit union sales last year and I think some of those are probably being implemented this year. But anyway, it has just has been a solid contributor and I don't think there are any unusual one-times in there that led to that.
David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Okay. That's good. And I guess just the last thing, the payment segment has been growing kind of high-single digits for a while, I think it was 6% this quarter. I mean, it's pretty much nothing, I mean it hasn't changed much. It decelerated just a touch but you are not seeing change really there either, right?
John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
No, it's – there certainly, there has been, we've talked about this on previous calls, there has been price compression, continues to be price compression particularly on renewals. It's a competitive business and lots of people trying to break into that area so – but no, beyond just kind of normal competitive activities that we've seen for a while, nothing particularly new.
David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Okay. Great, thank you.
John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Dave.
Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
Thank you.
Operator
And we have the question from the line of David Togut from Evercore. Your line is now open.
Rayna Kumar - Evercore Group LLC
Good morning, this is Rayna Kumar for David Togut. Can you go into more detail as to why you anticipate flattish EPS growth for the second quarter? Is it just a tough tax rate comparison or is there more to it? Thank you.
Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
Well, there's two things. Like I said in the opening comments, Rayna, one, in the second quarter last year we had a one-time gain from sale of some products that came through the Goldleaf acquisition, the Tellerware (30:06) product which I think that gain was about $5 million in the quarter and then also the effective tax rate last year was 32% versus 36% this year. So those combined makes for a pretty tough comparable and a hurdle to get over just to be flat with last year.
Rayna Kumar - Evercore Group LLC
Got it, that's really helpful. And can you provide us an update on your estimate for FY 2016 capitalized software and internally software and maybe just go over what your largest investments are this year?
John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer

Well, so the areas that we are investing in and Kevin can probably give you better insight on the actual numbers but the areas that we are investing in, continue investing in are a number of product – architecture refreshments on the credit union side which we've talked about before. We've had a number of improvements that we made on the banking side. The larger types of investments in terms of the percentage of those dollars are going more towards payments-related products and mobile and electronic delivery solutions that we offer. Kevin, I don't know if you've got guidance on...
Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
Yeah, right, I mean, the internal software – I mean obviously we've got a lot of progress going there. As Jack mentioned a lot of that is security-related and other things we just have to continue to invest in our infrastructure. And that's probably going to end up being $12 million to $14 million for the year. For computer software developed, which all of the areas that Jack just mentioned, payments of mobile and everything else with a lot of these products that are going to be driving future revenue, as my quote says, certainly in the earnings release, the vast majority of our investment is on these additional products, the new products and services there are going to be rolled out in the future but that's probably going to be somewhere in the $90 million to $95 million for the total year for cap software.
Rayna Kumar - Evercore Group LLC
Got it. Okay. You mentioned pricing compression in your electronic payments business. Should we think of mid-single digit growth as the new normalized revenue growth for that business?
John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Right, that's probably the right way to think about it.
Rayna Kumar - Evercore Group LLC
Got it. Could you talk about head-to-head win rates for Symitar versus Fiserv DNA in the quarter?
John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I don't have that against that specific product. We continue to gain market share from a variety of competitive products. Our win rates are very solid. A lot of times when a financial institution, bank or credit union, goes through an evaluation process they may end up making the decision to stay with their current provider, usually after receiving a deep discount to do so. But I would tell you that our win rates remain very strong among those financial institutions who go through an evaluation and do decide to make a change from their current vendor and that's going to be anywhere from 50% to 60% plus win rate among those who will actually go through with a change from their current provider.
In terms of breaking it down among which of the 15 different core solutions we see on the credit union side versus – or for that matter the number that we see on the banking side, I don't really track them product versus product.
Rayna Kumar - Evercore Group LLC
Got it. Could you call out the term fees in the second quarter of 2015 and your expectation for the second quarter of 2016?
Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
Rayna, honestly I don't have that on – with me right now.
Rayna Kumar - Evercore Group LLC
Okay.
Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
I don't have the company's last year second quarter.
Rayna Kumar - Evercore Group LLC
Okay. And just one final question, if you can just give us the end-of-period share count?
Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
80.7 million roughly, 80.5 million.
Rayna Kumar - Evercore Group LLC
Thank you very much.

Prim, the Chairman and CEO of Jack Henry & Associates, Inc. (JKHY), Interviews with The Wall Street TranscriptWall Street TranscriptJune 10, 2014ReblogShareTweetShare67 WALL STREET, New York - June 10, 2014 - The Wall Street Transcript has just published its Business and Application Software Report offering a timely review of the sector to serious investors and industry executives. This special feature contains expert industry commentary through in-depth interviews with public company CEOs and Equity Analysts. The full issue is available by calling (212) 952-7433 or via The Wall Street Transcript Online.Topics covered: Cloud Computing Secular Trends - Application Software Consolidation Activity - Cloud Computing and SaaS Trends - Larger IT Systems Upgrades - B2B Recovery - Paradigm Shifts in Software - Software-Defined Data Centers - Business Services Capex SpendingCompanies include: Jack Henry & Associates Inc. (JKHY) and many more.In the following excerpt from the Business and Application Software Report, the Chairman and CEO of Jack Henry & Associates, Inc. (JKHY) discusses company strategy and the outlook for this vital industry:TWST: Over the next 12 to 24 months, what's your agenda for the company?Mr. Prim: We've got a pretty clear and narrowly focused strategy, and it is to continue to execute well in our traditional business, and provide those integrated accounting systems for banks and credit unions - which continues to be the heart of our business - and surround those applications with various complementary products that are needed.For example, I might sell the accounting system to a bank to handle their deposit and loan, general ledger customer accounting, but they also need other products like an Internet banking system or a mobile banking system or a check-image-processing system. We have all those complementary products as well. Primarily, the strategy is to sell those integrated accounting systems surrounded with as many of the complementary products as we can.Another part of our business, the ProfitStars division, is where we sell solutions to address a specific need, like a document imaging system or a remote check deposit system that customers can use with whatever accounting system they have. It does not have to be a Jack Henry accounting system for them to use those products. Even in that area, we have some products that we sell to the 30 or 40 largest financial institutions to whom we don't normally sell our accounting systems. We continue to focus in those areas, looking to grow the business. We're in a very competitive marketplace and a pretty mature industry, so every deal is hard-fought, and we win our share, but it's always competitive.TWST: I'm interested in how the product mix might be changing in the near future with some of the changes in technology. For example, you mentioned Internet banking and mobile, and there is, of course, cloud-based systems, and Big Data has become a hot area. Do you see shifts in what your customers are asking for?For more of this interview and many others visit the Wall Street Transcript - a unique service for investors and industry researchers - providing fresh commentary and insight through verbatim interviews with CEOs, portfolio managers and research analysts.

In their 25 yrs in office Democrats had a total of three executive branch officials indicted with one conviction and one prison sentence. That's one whole executive branch official convicted of a crime in two and a half decades of Democrat leadership. In the 28 yrs that Republicans have held office over the last 53 yrs they have had a total of (a drum roll would be more than appropriate), 120 criminal indictments of executive branch officials. 89 criminal convictions and 34 prison sentences handed down." -- Google.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Jack Henry & Associates Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Kevin Williams, Chief Financial Officer. Sir, you may begin.
Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
Thanks, Chelsea. Good morning. Thank you for joining us today for the Jack Henry & Associates second quarter fiscal 2016 earnings call. I'm Kevin Williams, CFO. On the call with me today is Jack Prim, CEO. Also in the room with us is Dave Foss, President.
The agenda for the call this morning is Jack will start with some of his thoughts about the business and on the performance of the quarter, then he will give it back to me, I'll provide some additional thoughts and comments regarding the press release that we put out yesterday after market close, and then we'll open the lines up for some Q&A.
I need to remind you that remarks or responses to questions concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends or results constitute forward-looking statements or deal with expectations about the future.
Like any statement about the future, these are subject to a number of factors which can cause actual results or events to differ materially from those which we anticipate, due to a number of risks and uncertainties, and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release and the sections in our 10-K entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jack.
John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Kevin. Good morning. We are pleased to report another strong operating quarter with record revenue and operating income. Outsourcing and payments again showed solid growth as did in-house maintenance based primarily on new credit union core system implementations. This is in spite of the continued movement of existing in-house customers to outsourcing with 12 current in-house bank and credit union customers signing to make that transition during the quarter.
Despite the recent noise level in the stock market, in our view, business fundamentals remain strong and our clients continue to invest in solutions that can help them drive revenue, reduce costs and improve security. We had solid sales performances with all three brands finishing ahead of plan year-to-date, and sales pipelines remain strong.
Last month, we announced a CEO transition that will take place July 1, at the start of our fiscal year, when Dave Foss will assume that role. This is a planned transition that the board and I have been working towards for several years. Dave will bring to the position over 30 years of financial industry experience, including his 17 years of experience at Jack Henry. During his career, Dave has had experience in literally every aspect of the financial institution core processing industry as well as the experience of having built our successful ProfitStars non-core processing business. He is well positioned to take JHA to the next level.

I will remain Chairman of the board residing in Monett and working full-time in that role. I'll keep our Enterprise Risk Management group as a reporting entity to ensure that our company maintains its strong focus on and that the board has good visibility to our risk management activities in this critical area. It has been an honor to serve as the CEO of this company for the last 12 years, and I am excited to watch the continued success of Jack Henry & Associates under Dave's leadership.
With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin for a closer look at the numbers.
Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
Thanks, Jack.
During the quarter, our license revenue represented less than 1% of our total revenue. The vast majority of our license revenue is now included with bundled services and included in the support and services line of revenue. Our support and services line of revenue continues to drive our total revenue growth and it increased to $320.2 million, which is an 8% increase over the same quarter a year ago and represented 96% of total revenue.
To break down our support and services for the quarter: implementation services of $15.9 million versus $19.4 million, which decreased 18% which is primarily due to just timing of the efforts and also because of the bundling; electronic payments of $130.5 million versus $121.5 million was up 7%; OutLink at $72.1 million was up 7%; in-house maintenance at $83.4 million was up 5%; and bundled services was $18.4 million, up 97% for the quarter. Reminder that bundled services contained license, implementation services, and maintenance revenue related to these multi-element contracts.
Related to this revenue, I'd point out that our deferred revenue on the balance sheet increased $27.1 million or 7% compared to last year's quarter. Hardware decreased 14% for the quarter to $12 million from $13.9 million last year. Consolidated gross margins improved 43% for the quarter, compared to 42% last year's second quarter; support and service margins were steady at 43% and hardware margins improved 34% from 31%.
Our operating expenses increased 12% for the quarter, compared to the year ago, which is primarily to the gain in the year ago quarter in our G&A for the sale of the TeleWeb products that were part of the AudioTel acquisition we did several years ago. Our operating margins for the quarter decreased slightly, also due to this gain last year. That's 25% compared to 26% a year ago.
The effective tax rate for the quarter decreased a little to 30.0% from 32.1% the second quarter a year ago, primarily due to the reinstatement of research and experimentation credit in the fourth quarter or second – March (6:13) second fiscal quarter.
Net income was up 10% to $59.3 million from $53.9 million, which led to EPS of $0.74 per share which was up 13% over last year. EBITDA for the year-to-date increased to $228.5 million compared to $210.8 million last year or an 8% increase. Depreciation and amortization expense was $63 million, with $26 million in depreciation and $37 million amortization compared to $59.4 million last year. Included in the total amortization is the amortization of intangibles from acquisitions which was down slightly to $9.5 million compared to $10.5 million last year, as some of those acquired intangibles have now fully amortized.
Operating cash flows were up $20.1 million or 16% to $147 million for the year-to-date. We continue to invest in our company through CapEx for computer equipment, facilities and airplanes, which we took possession of our last two airplanes during the fourth quarter, so our fleet is now fully upgraded, which is a two-year process. And we continue to invest in development and new and existing products, to help continue our revenue growth in the future. We also continue to return investment to our shareholders through dividends of $40 million and stock buybacks of $155 million year-to-date. Our return on equity for the trailing 12 months is 24.2% and our total shareholder return on stock price appreciation and dividends for the trailing 12 months ended December 31 was just over 27%. We purchased 1.1 million shares during the quarter and 2.1 million shares year-to-date.

For guidance for the remainder of the year, our revenue is still projected to grow in the upper mid single digits for the year, similar to the first half. To assist you with your modeling, the projected effective tax rate for Q3 FY 2016 will be about 33.5%, down slightly from 33.8% last year, so not a huge difference and the difference is primarily due to the full year of the R&D credit this year compared to only six months spread over last year. The tax rate in Q4 is expected to be 34%, giving a full-year effective tax rate of about 33.5%. For EPS guidance for the third fiscal quarter, we are projecting our de-conversion fees or early termination fees to be down significantly from last year's third quarter, with an estimated reduction in these termination fees of a little over $6 million in the third quarter or about $0.05 EPS impact.
Therefore, based on this, it appears the current consensus estimate is $0.68 for Q3. It's probably a little aggressive, probably by a couple of pennies. So, we're probably going to be coming around the $0.66 for the third quarter because of this decrease in termination fees and also because we had a couple million this quarter over what we had last year. The fourth quarter consensus estimate out there at this time of $0.80 appears to be in the ballpark and pretty reasonable.
That concludes our opening comments. And with that, we are now ready to take questions. Chelsea, will you please open the call lines up for questions?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Certainly. And our first question comes from the line of Peter Heckmann with Avondale. Your line is now open.
Peter J. Heckmann - Avondale Partners LLC
Good morning everyone.
John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Hi, Pete.
Peter J. Heckmann - Avondale Partners LLC
Kevin, just a few housekeeping things. So, term fees in the fiscal second quarter, how did those compare year-over-year?
Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
The term fees were up $2.8 million compared to the second quarter last year fee.
Peter J. Heckmann - Avondale Partners LLC
You said up $2.8 million.
Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
Yes.
Peter J. Heckmann - Avondale Partners LLC
Okay. And then I know the acquired revenue was small, but about how much to the base did that contribute in the quarter?
Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
Less than $1 million.
Peter J. Heckmann - Avondale Partners LLC
Okay.
Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
So, our organic revenue growth was still 7%.
Peter J. Heckmann - Avondale Partners LLC
Got it. Got it. Okay. And then just last question and maybe just a little bit of background. For the second quarter in a row we're seeing the credit union segment continue to really outperform nicely with very, very strong growth but being offset somewhat by a slowdown in the bank side. Can you talk about some of the gives and takes that account for that dynamic?
John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yes, Pete, this is Jack. There were a couple of things. There were a number of larger credit union implementations go-lives that certainly helped and most of those being from an in-house standpoint. The revenue impact, of course, under the new revenue recognition guidelines that we're operating under, so a lot of that's going to show up in the bundled area. But basically, there were a larger number of larger go-lives on the credit union side than what we had on the bank side. The bank side also was somewhat impacted by one of our larger customers being lost in an acquisition. And so there was some revenue impact in the opposite direction on the banking side from that as well.
Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
Yes, the other thing, Pete, I'd say is we continue to see really strong growth in both outsourcing and payments on the credit union side.

Peter J. Heckmann - Avondale Partners LLC
Great. That's helpful. Thanks.
Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
Yep.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Your line is now open.
Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC
Hey, morning. Jack, can you just talk about maybe the bank spending environment right now, if you're seeing any changes either up or down?
John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yes. Kartik, it's pretty steady. Different banks are going to be investing in different things, some are doing projects in and around the mobile or online banking implementation or a refreshment. Core systems, there certainly continues to be a movement in that area, somewhat less aggressively on the banking side than on the credit union side and possibly a little less than what we've seen in some previous years. But spending in and around security and related products. So there is no one product I would point to that people are rushing to adopt and it's going to vary from institution to institution as to what their focus area is.
Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC
And there is not a lot of talk about mobile obviously. Have you seen any pricing pressure on that or does your model allow you to take advantage of greater clicks that banks are seeing because of use of mobile.
John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
We haven't really seen any recent pressure. I would tell you that probably 18 months ago we were seeing a fair amount of pressure on some of them, particularly on some of the mobile offerings as some low-cost options became available out in the market. I think we've adjusted accordingly. We have an opportunity to provide for the very price-conscious that want a pretty fully-featured system, but they are more price sensitive. We've got a solid offering there with a low price point on it. For somebody that wants a little more sophisticated mobile offering, we have that option as well, and that's going to be priced a little bit higher. But, as I've said, I think 18 months ago we were seeing more pricing pressure than what we're seeing today.
Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC
And then, Kevin, just tax rate going forward, is 34% or 33.5%, a reasonable tax rate to look at going forward because of the R&D tax credit?
Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
Well, Kartik, like I said in my opening comments, 33.5% is the right rate to use for the third quarter. Fourth quarter it's going to be about 34%, but for FY 2017, it's probably going to be somewhere between 35% and 35.5%, now that they have made the R&D credit permanent.
Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC
Perfect. Thanks. I appreciate it.
Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
Thanks, Kartik.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.
Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Thank you. Good morning, guys.
Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
Hi, Glenn.
Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
The first one, just going back on the credit union versus the bank growth, a couple things. So we've had a couple quarters now of credit union growth in sort of this 20% range and I guess there is a few conversions. It's been a nice pipeline of conversions that have been happening. Any reason to think where you don't continue at this sort of like 20% plus growth for another couple of quarters? And then on the bank side, if you could directionally quantify how much of a drag there was from that bank loss, so that we can kind of have a better idea for sort of core growth ex that bank loss?

Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
Well, Glenn, from the credit union side, yes, I think we should continue to see very good growth for the next couple of quarters. Obviously, when we get in next fiscal year, we're going to start hitting some tougher comps. So I think we're going to continue to see very strong growth in the credit union side at least this fiscal year.
On the bank side I'm not sure if I have the numbers right in front of me that tell you what the drag was, but it was obviously a couple of percentage points of revenue in the quarter for not just the one bank but for – there was two or three of them that got acquired or due to repricing that had an impact on payments primarily but it also impacted maintenance and other things.
Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Do you mean two points drag to the banking business or the overall total revenue?
Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
Banking.
Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
And just to be clear on the – you sort of gave the 3Q and the 4Q EPS expectations, including what we've got year-to-date; you're kind of suggesting mid-$2.80s for the year, just to be clear?
Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
Yes, I think that's where we're going to wind-up, Glenn. I mean we're $1.38 year-to-date. I think third quarter is going to be in the $0.66-ish each range and right now I'm pretty comfortable with that consensus estimate of $0.80 out there in the fourth quarter. I think that gets you to about $2.84 or something like that.
Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
And the outsourcing, if I heard it right, it sounded like it decelerated to 7%. Is that for the same reasons that some of those – the bank losses or pricing or...?
Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
No, actually, Glenn, the outsourcing – if you net out the deconversion fees on outsourcing, it was actually more like a 12% growth year-over-year. So it's pretty much in line with where it has been. The real pressure came in the payments line. If you net out the deconversion fees on the payments line, the payments was only about 4% growth. If you net that out, that's where the real tough grow-over is from the drag from some of the repricing and loss of customers.
Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
And then the share buyback, you've been pretty consistent I guess at 1 million shares or so a quarter. Any reason to think you'd change that or perhaps get more aggressive?
Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
I don't know that we'll get any more aggressive at this point, Glenn, and obviously that's driven by the board, and we have our quarterly board meeting next week. So that will be a discussion at the board meeting just like it is every quarter and we'll decide where we go. But you're right, I mean, we said going into this year that we were going to be a little more aggressive. We bought 2.2 million shares year-to-date, which is about the guidance I gave at the front that we were going to buy for the year. So will we buy some more? Probably, but I don't know that we'll keep the same pace that we have in the first half.
Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Okay, great. Thanks a lot.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brett Huff with Stephens, Inc. Your line is now open.
Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.
Good morning, Jack, Kevin and hello, Dave.
John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Good morning.
Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.
Quick question on the pipeline, Jack, you talked a little bit about that. As you look forward, and this is kind of I guess tied to a sub question of long-term growth outlook, you guys have been kind of peer leading among your peers for a while on growth, and Kevin you just commented at least for this year that the credit union pipeline looks really good. Can you give us a sense of what are the components of the pipeline that you guys look at most earnestly and how does that translate into how you think about long-term growth I guess combined bank and credit union business over the next few years?

John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Brett, I tend to focus more on the total backlog. At this point with license fees representing zero percent of our total revenue, support and services being 96%, hardware on a steady decline, so I tend to just focus more on total backlog, which by and large anymore is almost support and services. But yes, so on the heels of a strong sales quarter, as I mentioned all three brands were over 100%, I think the lowest performance was 105% or 106% from one of the three brands. In spite of that pipelines remained flattish even with closing that volume of business. So I'm not sure if I actually got to the point that you were looking to get to. Kevin, if you would add anything to that.
Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
Yeah, the other thing I'd add Brett is, one of the things that we obviously continue to focus on is the in to out movement because obviously that's a very good thing for our business long term and currently we're right at the 50% of our existing core customer base that are now outsourced. So we still got a long road ahead of us to continue those conversions.
Through the first half, we're right on track to do basically what we did in the previous year. So, I think we did 23% in the first half, we did 46% last year. So, we're right on track to continue that same path, so that's something that I really watch. And then also we continue to look at the payments business and the opportunities we have there, not only just in bill pay, but also in passport and PPS and all of the different payments groups, remote deposit cash where we still got a pretty good runway there. So, those are the sort of things that I kind of look at to look at the future because obviously, as Jack said, those are big drivers, those are all important services and that's what's going to drive us going forward.
Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Any update on the – I can't remember the name of the product, but where you're helping folks outsource more of their – even their front office IT systems.
Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
Hosted Network Services.
Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.
Yeah, thank you. Any update on that. And you didn't mention that as one of kind of the major growers, but is that still something that could be a part of that growth system?
Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
I would tell you it's growing nicely Brett. I mean, as we've said originally, this is one that's going to be slow growing things because it's a complicated sale, it's a big decision for an FI to make to give us all of their servers, but it is growing, it's actually ahead of plan and growing very nicely. And is it contributing? Yes. Is it a huge contributor at this point? No. But it's like I said ahead of track.
Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.
Okay.
John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I will just add to that, Brett, we're continuing to have increased go-lives, very good success from the institutions that have implemented it. So the reference base is building out there as to the advantage of this approach, and the average contract values that we're seeing continue to increase. So, a lot of good trends happening there. It's just, again, the percentage growth is very solid, but in terms of being to a point where it makes a meaningful impact from a revenue standpoint, not really there yet. But again, with the security environment and the talent acquisition and retention environment, particularly for technically oriented talent that we're all seeing right now, again, we believe that this is a very solid solution that's going to be a nice long-term contributor.
Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.
And then last question, just thinking about margins over the medium term as well, you guys have had good margin performance and nice gross margins this quarter. You guys already have very high margins, kind of where do we go from here and where do the levers, if there are any, that we should be paying attention to?

Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
Well, Brett, I mean, can some (23:31) opportunity for additional expansion come (23:34). I mean it's going to come from the continued growth in our outsourcing and payments groups, I mean that's going to be the drivers because those are the highest margin business. And we'll continue to leverage the existing infrastructure. But having said that, as Jack pointed out, security and compliance and other things are big issues. So, I don't know if there's going to be the same margin expansion that we've seen in the past, but I think there's still some opportunity. And I think going forward that we'll continue to see some opportunity for operating margin expansion on the G&A line and possibly selling and marketing. It won't come from the R&D line because we have to continue to reinvest in our product as we continue to grow and move upstream into the larger FIs.
Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.
Great. That's what I needed. Thanks, guys.
Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Dave Koning with Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.
David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Yeah, hey, guys, nice job.
Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
Thanks, Dave.
David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Yeah, I guess just a couple really, the termination fees I know you said would be down year-over-year in Q3, which makes sense. Is that mostly in payments or in outsourcing or a mix?
Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
It's a mix; it's across the board, Dave.
David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Okay. I just wanted to make sure we...
Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
Last year in the third quarter, we had right at $9.5 million in termination fees and this year we think that's going to be about – under $3 million.
David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Okay. But if we just take a few out year-over-year from each like if it's down 6 (25:10).
Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
Yeah.
David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Okay, Okay. And then the other one, hardware, you maybe mentioned this a little earlier too, but hardware was down 14% year-over-year, I know it's immaterial now. Is it like accelerating its declines or should we just expect kind of 5% to 10% declines for a long time?
Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
I think you can just expect that, Dave. I mean the deal with hardware is, it's hard for us to predict because that's driven by IBM and other hardware providers. And when they come out with new upgrades and what they're going to force the customers to have, and as we continue to move customers from ins to outs, they're not going to be buying hardware upgrades. So it's just going to be a continual decrease in hardware.
Now, the hardware margins should stay really solid, because the non-hardware parts of that hardware line of revenue, which is our higher margin business, like our jhaDirect and the (26:12) different things, that's going to continue to become a larger percentage of that line, which will help maintain the margins in the hardware line of revenue.
David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Okay. Good. And then, lastly just, like do the small banks ever ask you about blockchain? I mean, quite honestly, I don't really even understand it very much at all, but is this more of a bigger bank thing that that they're looking at it, or do the small banks every once in a while kind of ask you about it, or I mean is it just a non-issue?
John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer

That's a great question, Dave, and I would say that today small banks are not really asking about it. I fully expect that they will be, simply because there is so much noise in the media about it. We've got a number of folks that are looking at it, and looking at potential applications, which sounds like that's what the whole world is doing right now, is trying to figure out where, if anywhere, the blockchain technology might fit. Its first line of thought tends to be in and around the payments area, because of its original affiliation with Bitcoin. It's possible -certainly some types of payments, they talk about an average potential transaction time, settlement time of around seven minutes. Well, you know, that's pretty quick.
If you're talking about something like a cross-border money transfer or a business-to-business payment relative to payment options that are out there today relative to an ATM transaction, relative to a debit card transaction at Target, seven minutes is probably going to be a little long for that to be the best application. And then there is the whole potential other areas of non-payment oriented transactions like land deed transactions, smart contracts and other things. So, there is an awful lot of people trying to figure out where if anywhere this might fit and I would include us in that category at this point. But we're not getting, frankly, questions from any of our customers at this point. But I fully expect that given how much discussion continues to take place around the technology, that that will change and they will want to know more about what it means once they come to understand it a little bit better.
David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Yeah, okay. Well, that's great. Thank you.
John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Dave.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.
Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Thanks. Just a couple follow-ups and that was probably one of the best blockchain answers I have heard in a while. Jack you sort of alluded to that each of your segments was sort of I think trending ahead of quota year-to-date in terms of sales and bookings, could you sort of directionally kind of give us some sense what your sales growth looks like year-to-date across the segments?
John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I don't know that I know it on a year-to-date basis, I think there is three brands and I think I have said the lowest was about 105% of quota, one was 120% of quota. And I think the third one was somewhere in between those two, 115%-ish. So, it was a strong sales quota. Now I will tell you that first quarter, two of them were at plan, one was well behind, the overall average was right about 100%. So, we're right around 100% for the first quarter, strong fiscal second quarter and expectation would be 4% to 5% year-over-year.
Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
Yeah. The numbers Jack has given you Glenn are percentage of quota and I'd tell you that quota for all three brands went up. So, it's a kind of – I don't know that any of us in this room actually calculate that, but I would guesstimate that it's probably 4%, 5% growth over last year in total bookings.
Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Year-to-date. Okay.
John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah.
Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
And then Kevin, this is a question for you on your favorite topic, the bundled services, but the question really is when does the bundled service accounting turn to a revenue and profit tailwind, meaning I was under the impression that this was sort of a neutral impact and perhaps fiscal 2017, you actually get a benefit from the accounting as you recognize some of that deferred revenue faster than you refill the deferred revenue funnel?

Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
Well, one of the things I will tell you Glenn and I made sure to point that out in my opening comments. Our deferred revenue went up 7% this year over last year, which is kind of unusual. And my point there is because of the new referrals, we are actually continuing to defer faster than we are recognizing revenues actually through the bundling. So, we are continuing to defer a lot of revenue, could there be some tailwinds come out of that in 2017 as we do some things? Yeah. And I will tell you Glenn with the new referrals coming out and they keep changing the date, it's either 2018 or 2019 now. We are going to have to do some things to try to ramp-up those contracts, get the revenue out and the timing of that – some of that is not up to us, some of that is up to the customers when they'll actually either accept the products or whatever. So could there be some tailwinds in 2017? Yeah, but right now we're still deferring faster than we're recognizing.
Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Okay. Great. Thanks.
Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
Yep.

Thank you. And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Kevin Williams for closing remarks.

This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

You can categorize and save all your highlights in Notebook and even turn them into flashcards with the click of a button; go to Notebook and click on the Flashcards button to create flashcards from your highlights. We store all your highlights at kindle.amazon.com so you can reference them even after you return the eTextbook.














Studying for exams? Notebook for eTextbooks displays all of your notes, colored highlights, saved images and bookmarks in one place. With Notebook you can mark and filter your most important concepts to study when it's test time–you can even export them to email and Evernote on Fire tablets.

On iOS and Android devices, tap the top or bottom of the screen from within the eTextbook to bring up the controls to access Notebook.

Kindle's Whispersync technology also synchronizes the furthest page you read, your bookmarks, and annotations across your devices so you can pick up where you left off.

With the swipe of a finger, quickly and efficiently navigate through pages and chapters of eTextbooks. Swift navigation is available on Android and iOS tablets.

On iPads, you have the option of swiping through all the pages from a grid like the one shown above.
