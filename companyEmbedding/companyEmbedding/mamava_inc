About Mamava
Mamava’s freestanding suites provide a clean, comfortable, secure place for women who need to use a breast pump or want to nurse in private. They feature seating, a fold-down table, and a power supply to comfortably use a breast pump, as well as space for bags or a stroller. A digital tablet planned for inside the unit will stream beautiful content relevant to moms.
In addition to providing a much-needed amenity the lactation suite offers an ideal medium for sponsors to connect to a highly targeted, highly engaged, captive, and grateful audience via branding/messaging inside and outside the unit, and digital content via tablets inside the unit. Mamava suites are made in the U.S.A.
Mamava joined the B Corp community to collaborate with like-minded companies, as well as to communicate our intent of creating and inspiring positive change on our planet.
The Change We Seek®
Mamava is dedicated to transforming the culture of breastfeeding, making it more optimistic, realistic, accommodating, and inviting to all mamas. We believe that breastfeeding is a personal choice, that there are as many philosophies and styles of breastfeeding as there are breastfeeding women, and that women who choose to breastfeed should be able to do so whenever, wherever they and their babies feel most comfortable.
We believe that all mamas deserve a safe, clean, and comfortable place to use a breast pump or breastfeed - anywhere, anytime.

Breast Pumping,
                                        
                                            Breastfeeding,

Breastfeeding moms on the go have a tough time finding clean and private accommodations to plug in and pump milk. I experienced this first hand when I was a breastfeeding mother away from my baby. As if carrying a heavy bag with pump and supplies as I walked miles around the tradeshow wasn't difficult enough, often my only option for a private space to pump was the restroom –no place to be making food for a new born.

Mamava on the road

Brittany Nunnink










Traveling for spring break this month? We are! Today, our sales manager, Janet Stambolian, is heading south to attend the Women in Aviation conference (WAI) in Nashville, Tennessee. There she will tote along our adorable mini-Mamava model to showcase our original Mamava, along with our inflatable suite, which shall soon be available for rent and pop-up events.
 
WAI is a conference to celebrate women in aviation and to provide these women a space to connect, engage and inspire one another. As an organization, Women in Aviation International works to facilitate networking, education, mentoring and scholarship opportunities for women (and men) who aspire to have careers in the aviation and aerospace industries.
 
The focus of the organization and conference is spot on with our mission of having Mamava suites (or similar alternatives) in every airport. Airports are sometimes the largest employers statewide (ex. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International), and also host millions of passengers – for hours at a time – everyday. Whether you’re an employee or traveler, you’re subject to the busy airport bustle, and as a nursing mama chances are you’re going to have to pump during your time at the airport. And when that time comes, every mama deserves a peaceful place in which to pump or breastfeed.
 
The interest is there, as is the feedback. Moms on-the-go tweet and Facebook their kudos to Mamava every day, state governments are beginning to take action (California and Illinois both have passed bills stating that their larger airports must include lactation spaces - CA by 2016, and IL by 2017), and US Representative Tammy Duckworth is working to pass her bill, The Friendly Airports for Mothers (FAM) Act, which mandates that lactation rooms be in every large airport nationally.
 
And so here we come, WAI, with your solution!
 
As of today - we have 24 Mamava suites dispersed among 12 airports nationally. Our hope is that soon after this conference we’ll have exciting updates about all the connections Janet’s made (she’s a talker), and all the new airports who have plans for our suites.
In closing, enjoy this note that was found in our Mamava suite at Newark Liberty International Airport that shows the gratitude that extends not just to us, but to other moms as well:
