History[edit]
Park Electrochemical Corp was founded in 1954.[citation needed]
In 1957 Park developed epoxy-glass copper-clad laminates for use in making printed circuit boards.[citation needed]
During the 1960s and 70s, the company invented a multilayer laminate printed circuit materials system. It also opened two more Nelco materials subsidiaries.[citation needed]
During the 1980s and 90s, the company extended its product lines to vacuum lamination, multilayer facility and RF/Microwave. It also enlarged its product markets, established subsidiaries in many countries, such as FiberCote Industries, Inc. and Park Advanced Composite Materials, Inc.[citation needed]
From 2000 to today, Park has completed a series of acquisitions and expansions all around the world and entered the aerospace market. It sold its Nelco Technology Inc. and acquired Nova Composites, Inc. In 2003, Park and Snecma Propulsion Systems signed an agreement to let Park market SPS’s Raycarb C2 carbonized rayon fabric to manufacturers of rocket motors.[4]
Products[edit]
There are four main product lines in Park Electrochemical corporation, namely Advanced Composite Materials (for aircraft structures, interiors and radomes. broadgoods, tapes), Nelco Digital Electronic Materials (for multilayer designs), Nelco RF/Microwave Materials, and Advanced Composite Parts (Lightweight assemblies for aerospace applications.). The Company’s products include high-speed, low-loss, engineered formulations, high-temperature modified epoxies, phenolics, polyimides, polyphenylene ethers Signal Integrity (SI) products.[5]
Research & Development[edit]
Aug 12, 2013,Park Electrochemical Corp introduced its new NL9000 RF/Microwave electronics materials products with a dissipation factor (“Df”) of 0.0017 at 10 GHz using stripline testing methodology and a 0.5dB/cm attenuation loss at 77 GHz for microstrip automotive radar applications. The new series meets UL 94V-0 and IPC-4103 specifications and are RoHS compliant.[6]
July 22, 2013, After its successful applications of SIGMA STRUT,Park introduced ALPHA STRUT, new proprietary composite strut design for aircraft and other aerospace applications. These two technologies improve weight savings and load carrying reliability.[7]
In May, 2013, the company's Simga Strut was selected by Northrop Grumman for use on the James Webb Space Telescope(JWST).[8]
February, 2013, Isola USA Corp and Park Electrochemical Corp agreed to settle the patents dispute about Styrene Maleic Anhydride (SMA) in laminates. Both companies agreed on the dismissal of the patent infringement lawsuit that Isola USA filed against Park in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona on June 26, 2012, and agreed to refrain from challenging the validity or enforceability of any of Isola’s SMA patents.[9]

  Park Electrochemical Corp. (NYSE:PKE) announced the introduction of Meteorwave 3000 and Meteorwave 4000, the newest members of the Meteorwave product family and the newest additions to Park's line of Very Low Loss and Ultra Low Loss electronic materials. Meteorwave 3000 and Meteorwave 4000 are available globally in both prepreg and laminate forms.  Meteorwave 3000 and Meteorwave 4000 offer very advanced electrical performance and very high reliability. Meteorwave 3000 has a dissipation factor (Df) of 0.0048 at 10 GHz and 50% resin content (RC) using Open Resonator testing methodology.

Ltd. at +65-686-17117.  Certain portions of this press release may be deemed to constitute forward looking statements that are subject to various factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from Park's expectations. Such factors include, but are not limited to, general conditions in the electronics and aerospace industries, Park's competitive position, the status of Park's relationships with its customers, economic conditions in international markets, the cost and availability of raw materials, transportation and utilities, and the various factors set forth in Item 1A "Risk Factors" and under the caption "Factors That May Affect Future Results" after Item 7 of Park's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 2, 2014.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

History[edit]
Park Electrochemical Corp was founded in 1954.[citation needed]
In 1957 Park developed epoxy-glass copper-clad laminates for use in making printed circuit boards.[citation needed]
During the 1960s and 70s, the company invented a multilayer laminate printed circuit materials system. It also opened two more Nelco materials subsidiaries.[citation needed]
During the 1980s and 90s, the company extended its product lines to vacuum lamination, multilayer facility and RF/Microwave. It also enlarged its product markets, established subsidiaries in many countries, such as FiberCote Industries, Inc. and Park Advanced Composite Materials, Inc.[citation needed]
From 2000 to today, Park has completed a series of acquisitions and expansions all around the world and entered the aerospace market. It sold its Nelco Technology Inc. and acquired Nova Composites, Inc. In 2003, Park and Snecma Propulsion Systems signed an agreement to let Park market SPS’s Raycarb C2 carbonized rayon fabric to manufacturers of rocket motors.[4]
Products[edit]
There are four main product lines in Park Electrochemical corporation, namely Advanced Composite Materials (for aircraft structures, interiors and radomes. broadgoods, tapes), Nelco Digital Electronic Materials (for multilayer designs), Nelco RF/Microwave Materials, and Advanced Composite Parts (Lightweight assemblies for aerospace applications.). The Company’s products include high-speed, low-loss, engineered formulations, high-temperature modified epoxies, phenolics, polyimides, polyphenylene ethers Signal Integrity (SI) products.[5]
Research & Development[edit]
Aug 12, 2013,Park Electrochemical Corp introduced its new NL9000 RF/Microwave electronics materials products with a dissipation factor (“Df”) of 0.0017 at 10 GHz using stripline testing methodology and a 0.5dB/cm attenuation loss at 77 GHz for microstrip automotive radar applications. The new series meets UL 94V-0 and IPC-4103 specifications and are RoHS compliant.[6]
July 22, 2013, After its successful applications of SIGMA STRUT,Park introduced ALPHA STRUT, new proprietary composite strut design for aircraft and other aerospace applications. These two technologies improve weight savings and load carrying reliability.[7]
In May, 2013, the company's Simga Strut was selected by Northrop Grumman for use on the James Webb Space Telescope(JWST).[8]
February, 2013, Isola USA Corp and Park Electrochemical Corp agreed to settle the patents dispute about Styrene Maleic Anhydride (SMA) in laminates. Both companies agreed on the dismissal of the patent infringement lawsuit that Isola USA filed against Park in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona on June 26, 2012, and agreed to refrain from challenging the validity or enforceability of any of Isola’s SMA patents.[9]

History[edit]
Park Electrochemical Corp was founded in 1954.[citation needed]
In 1957 Park developed epoxy-glass copper-clad laminates for use in making printed circuit boards.[citation needed]
During the 1960s and 70s, the company invented a multilayer laminate printed circuit materials system. It also opened two more Nelco materials subsidiaries.[citation needed]
During the 1980s and 90s, the company extended its product lines to vacuum lamination, multilayer facility and RF/Microwave. It also enlarged its product markets, established subsidiaries in many countries, such as FiberCote Industries, Inc. and Park Advanced Composite Materials, Inc.[citation needed]
From 2000 to today, Park has completed a series of acquisitions and expansions all around the world and entered the aerospace market. It sold its Nelco Technology Inc. and acquired Nova Composites, Inc. In 2003, Park and Snecma Propulsion Systems signed an agreement to let Park market SPS’s Raycarb C2 carbonized rayon fabric to manufacturers of rocket motors.[4]
Products[edit]
There are four main product lines in Park Electrochemical corporation, namely Advanced Composite Materials (for aircraft structures, interiors and radomes. broadgoods, tapes), Nelco Digital Electronic Materials (for multilayer designs), Nelco RF/Microwave Materials, and Advanced Composite Parts (Lightweight assemblies for aerospace applications.). The Company’s products include high-speed, low-loss, engineered formulations, high-temperature modified epoxies, phenolics, polyimides, polyphenylene ethers Signal Integrity (SI) products.[5]
Research & Development[edit]
Aug 12, 2013,Park Electrochemical Corp introduced its new NL9000 RF/Microwave electronics materials products with a dissipation factor (“Df”) of 0.0017 at 10 GHz using stripline testing methodology and a 0.5dB/cm attenuation loss at 77 GHz for microstrip automotive radar applications. The new series meets UL 94V-0 and IPC-4103 specifications and are RoHS compliant.[6]
July 22, 2013, After its successful applications of SIGMA STRUT,Park introduced ALPHA STRUT, new proprietary composite strut design for aircraft and other aerospace applications. These two technologies improve weight savings and load carrying reliability.[7]
In May, 2013, the company's Simga Strut was selected by Northrop Grumman for use on the James Webb Space Telescope(JWST).[8]
February, 2013, Isola USA Corp and Park Electrochemical Corp agreed to settle the patents dispute about Styrene Maleic Anhydride (SMA) in laminates. Both companies agreed on the dismissal of the patent infringement lawsuit that Isola USA filed against Park in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona on June 26, 2012, and agreed to refrain from challenging the validity or enforceability of any of Isola’s SMA patents.[9]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:
