Biography[edit]
A 1972 alumnus of The Bronx High School of Science,[4] Viniar graduated from Union College, New York in 1976, where he majored in economics.[5] He then attended Harvard Business School, earning an MBA in 1980.[1]
After receiving the MBA, Viniar joined Goldman Sachs where he has remained since. He became a partner in 1992, a managing director in 1996 and executive vice president and chief financial officer in 1999.[1] He has been the head of Operations, Technology, Finance and Services Division since December 2002.
Viniar headed the Finance Division and co-head of Credit Risk Management and Advisory and Firmwide Risk from December 2001 to December 2002. He co-headed Operations, Finance and Resources from March 1999 to December 2001. He was CFO of the Goldman Sachs Group, L.P. from March 1999 to May 1999. From July 1998 until March 1999, he was Deputy Chief Financial Officer and from 1994 until July 1998, he was head of Finance, with responsibility for Controllers and Treasury. From 1992-94, he was head of Treasury and prior to that was in the Structured Finance Department of Investment Banking.[6]
In September 2012 Viniar announced that he would be retiring from Goldman Sachs in January 2013.[7] On January 31, 2013 he retired from his positions as CFO and Executive Vice President and took on the role of director at Goldman Sachs.
On October 30, 2013 Viniar became a director on the board of Square, Inc., the mobile payments firm run by Jack Dorsey.[8]
"25 standard deviations" quote[edit]
On 13 August 2007, The Financial Times reported Viniar's explanation of why two large hedge funds managed by Goldman Sachs had both lost over a quarter of their value in a week, requiring the injection of $3 billion to support them.[9] Viniar ascribed the events to a series of exceptional events: “We were seeing things that were 25 standard deviation moves, several days in a row”.[10] This has since been used to illustrate the problems of inappropriate mathematical models in finance, especially those based on the assumption of Normality.[11][12]
Senate Testimony[edit]
Viniar testified in front of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations on Tuesday, April 27, 2010 regarding the role of investment banks in the financial crisis that began in 2007 and, specifically, the role of Goldman Sachs in that crisis.[13]
Affiliations[edit]
David Viniar serves on the Board of Trustees of Union College and is a member of the Board of Trustees of both Children's Aid and Family Services and the Financial Accounting Foundation.[14]
Family[edit]
David Viniar is married and has four children.

SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) — You don’t often get conference calls when a chief financial officer announces he’s stepping down. You don’t unless your CFO is a three-decade veteran and works for Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

                                         life as a public company was, in many ways, the face and voice of the investment bank. He endured through multiple CEOs including Henry Paulson. Read full story on Viniar’s exit.

David Viniar,

Viniar presented Goldman’s financial results to the investment community on conference calls each quarter. He distinguished himself by not distinguishing himself: he was conservative, relatively uncontroversial.  In 2010 he testified before a Senate subcommittee with perhaps the biggest binder of financial data in history. He was a frustrating witness. Goldman usually does transitions well. Most of the backstabbing and internal power plays are kept from the public. Viniar’s successor is Harvey M. Schwartz, another uncontroversial guy. Read WSJ DealJournal’s blog discussion of the Viniar-Schwartz conference call.







From an investors standpoint, it’s always nice to see continuity. But in this case, maybe a shake-up would have been better news. After all, Goldman’s recent profits have declined to $4.4 billion last year from $8.4 billion in 2010 and $13 billion in 2009. The stock price has fallen at a similar rate, from $200 in 2008, to $119 at the close Tuesday. It’s a disappointing state of affairs that we’ll never really know how much Viniar was responsible for. Asked what the biggest risk the firm faces Viniar said “liquidity, liquidity, liquidity’ — a Wall Street CFO’s stock answer if there was one. Good luck David Viniar. We hardly knew you, which is probably why you survived so long.  — David Weidner.

It looks like Goldman's troubles are getting in the way of the planned retirement of CFO David Viniar - seen here before testifying to Congress in April.
AP



Goldman Sachs’ superstar CFO David Viniar has been quietly considering making an exit from the firm where he’s spent his entire career, sources tell The Post. 
  Viniar, a three-decade Goldman veteran, considered one of the brightest financial minds on Wall Street, told a handful of close associates as recently as last year about his desire to retire — but then quickly put those plans on the back burner when Wall Street’s most profitable firm ran into turbulence. 
  The rough-going includes a civil fraud suit filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission over marketing of mortgage-related securities, a federal criminal probe on the same matter, and a civil suit brought by a hedge fund that bought a Goldman CDO. 
  At the same time, Goldman’s once-vaunted reputation is being pilloried in public. 
  A Goldman spokesman said that Viniar “has no plans to retire anytime soon.” 
  Still, sources familiar with the matter say Viniar’s earlier plan would have had him stepping down to pursue other interests as early as this year. 
  But those plans changed as it could be seen by the outside world that one of the firm’s top officers was abandoning ship. 
  “David is very much a team player and he’ll do whatever the firm asks of him,” said one source. Added a second source: “He’s so loyal he’s only going to do anything when the timing is appropriate.” 
  Among partners and clients of the firm, the Bronx-born Viniar, who turns 55 years old next month, is considered a rock star, lauded as much for his ease at explaining complex transactions as for his unpretentious, disarming manner. 
  Viniar joined the firm back in 1980 as an investment banker after graduating from Harvard Business School and has been the lead finance officer at the firm since 1999 — just before the closely held private partnership launched a public offering of stock. 
  On the Union College basketball team, the lanky 6-foot-1-inch Viniar, dubbed “Bones,” was a benchwarmer, but within the halls of Goldman, Viniar is viewed as one of the most valuable players, credited with pushing the firm to take short bets against housing as the mortgage market was upending its rivals. 
  “Under [Viniar] the [CFO] job became a whole lot bigger, said one former Goldman source. “He is a critical thinker who helped determine things like how much capital the firm set aside for certain lines of business.” 
  In fact, one source said Viniar’s various duties may be taken over by multiple Goldman staffers, when he decides to step down. 
 Goldman slid $3.03, or 2.21 percent to $133.77, a 52-week low yesterday.

Former Goldman Sachs exec David Viniar joins Square board - latimes

YOU ARE HERE: LAT Home→Collections→BusinessFormer Goldman Sachs exec David Viniar joins Square boardThe move by mobile payment start-up Square is widely seen as a step toward an IPO.October 30, 2013|By Jessica Guynn


SAN FRANCISCO — Even as Twitter prepares for a hotly anticipated initial public offering, its co-founder Jack Dorsey already is about to debut a second act.His start-up Square, one of the fastest-growing young companies by revenue and one of the most buzzed about in high-tech, has taken what is widely seen as a step toward its own IPO.On Wednesday, the mobile payment service announced that former Goldman Sachs Chief Financial Officer David Viniar would join its board.The addition of Viniar lends Square instant credibility on Wall Street. At the time he retired from Goldman Sachs last January, Viniar was one of the highest-profile and best-compensated executives in the financial industry.Goldman Sachs is also the lead bank for the Twitter IPO. Square CFO Sarah Friar, a former finance executive at Salesforce.com who also spent 10 years at Goldman Sachs, introduced Viniar to Square, a Square spokesman said."The growing scope of Square's business and long-term vision is inspiring," Viniar, who met with the board Wednesday, said in an emailed statement. "I'm honored to join Square's Board at such an important time in the company's growth."Asked in September when Square would go public, Dorsey told Bloomberg TV: "Eventually we'll get there. Right now we're building the practice within the company and building the discipline. I think Square is ahead of a lot of companies in that regard because I think we're building a financial company."Viniar replaces Starbucks Chairman, President and Chief Executive Howard Schultz, who joined the board in August 2012. A Starbucks spokesman said Schultz's intent was to serve on the Square board for about one year."Jack has assembled a strong and forward-thinking leadership team at Square," Schultz said in an emailed statement. "I am proud of what our companies have accomplished together this past year and I'm excited about the opportunities for Starbucks and Square to continue to innovate together."Rick Oglesby, a senior analyst with market research firm Aite Group, said having Schultz on the board was crucial to Square's prospects."He's Square's largest customer at this point and having your largest customer on the board is very important," Oglesby said.As Square begins to reach out to consumers, Starbucks is serving as a key strategic partner, he said.Starbucks invested $25 million in Square as part of a round of financing in August 2012 that valued Square at $3.25 billion. In addition, Square struck a deal with Starbucks to process all credit and debit card transactions at Starbucks stores in the U.S. and to accept payments from Square's mobile Wallet app.Square Wallet, which the company rolled out in 2011 to make it easier for consumers to buy things with their smartphones, has not yet been aggressively marketed to consumers."Schultz is a key decision maker on when that's going to happen," Oglesby said.Dorsey hatched Square in his San Francisco loft apartment in 2010 after stepping down as chief executive of Twitter.He teamed with Square's co-founder, Jim McKelvey, a glassblower who had designed a $2,500 bathroom faucet but didn't make a sale because he couldn't process a credit card, in 2009.Their idea: to make it possible for anyone to accept plastic, even small merchants for whom credit cards were too expensive or complicated. They created a credit card reader that attaches to a smartphone and swipes cards for a 2.75% transaction fee, most of which Square turns over to credit card companies.Square also offers merchants the option of paying $275 a month for an unlimited number of transactions, up to $250,000 a year.Square says it is processing credit-card transactions at a rate of $15 billion a year — not including the Starbucks deal.Square has caught on with small merchants, but it's trying to cast a broader net. Square recently launched Square Cash in the U.S., which lets people send money via email.It has hefty competition from technology giants, financial institutions, telecommunications companies and national retailers."The way I look at Square is that they have an ultimate goal of creating an Amazon-like company that works outside the confines of e-commerce and in the world of physical retail," Oglesby said. "Physical retail is 20 times the size of e-commerce, so there is huge market potential there."Viniar joined Goldman Sachs in 1980 after graduating from Harvard Business School. He became CFO in 1999, the year Goldman went public, and also oversaw operations, technology and finance.He played a key role in helping the company through the global financial crisis and through the settlement of charges by securities regulators that it misled investors in its sale of mortgage securities. In 2010, Viniar had to testify before Congress about the firm's conduct.jessica.guynn@latimes.com

Biography[edit]
A 1972 alumnus of The Bronx High School of Science,[4] Viniar graduated from Union College, New York in 1976, where he majored in economics.[5] He then attended Harvard Business School, earning an MBA in 1980.[1]
After receiving the MBA, Viniar joined Goldman Sachs where he has remained since. He became a partner in 1992, a managing director in 1996 and executive vice president and chief financial officer in 1999.[1] He has been the head of Operations, Technology, Finance and Services Division since December 2002.
Viniar headed the Finance Division and co-head of Credit Risk Management and Advisory and Firmwide Risk from December 2001 to December 2002. He co-headed Operations, Finance and Resources from March 1999 to December 2001. He was CFO of the Goldman Sachs Group, L.P. from March 1999 to May 1999. From July 1998 until March 1999, he was Deputy Chief Financial Officer and from 1994 until July 1998, he was head of Finance, with responsibility for Controllers and Treasury. From 1992-94, he was head of Treasury and prior to that was in the Structured Finance Department of Investment Banking.[6]
In September 2012 Viniar announced that he would be retiring from Goldman Sachs in January 2013.[7] On January 31, 2013 he retired from his positions as CFO and Executive Vice President and took on the role of director at Goldman Sachs.
On October 30, 2013 Viniar became a director on the board of Square, Inc., the mobile payments firm run by Jack Dorsey.[8]
"25 standard deviations" quote[edit]
On 13 August 2007, The Financial Times reported Viniar's explanation of why two large hedge funds managed by Goldman Sachs had both lost over a quarter of their value in a week, requiring the injection of $3 billion to support them.[9] Viniar ascribed the events to a series of exceptional events: “We were seeing things that were 25 standard deviation moves, several days in a row”.[10] This has since been used to illustrate the problems of inappropriate mathematical models in finance, especially those based on the assumption of Normality.[11][12]
Senate Testimony[edit]
Viniar testified in front of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations on Tuesday, April 27, 2010 regarding the role of investment banks in the financial crisis that began in 2007 and, specifically, the role of Goldman Sachs in that crisis.[13]

Goldman CFO David Viniar put a simple spin on a murky episode in the financial crisis: How the firm managed to be paid in full by collapsing AIG.
AP



It was designed to be a scolding of Goldman Sachs’ brass in search of assigning blame for the mortgage crisis — but it ended up revealing how little Congress understands about the gold-plated firm’s business. 
  Some of Goldman’s best and brightest minds yesterday faced a withering verbal assault from lawmakers who often betrayed their lack of understanding of Goldman’s role in many of the transactions now drawing fire. 
  At one point, Michigan Sen. Carl Levin, chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Permanent Investigations, accused Goldman of being “rife with conflicts of interest,” and declared the firm wasn’t worthy of trust. 
  Many of the issues that were sticking points for members of the panel, appeared to be rooted in different interpretations of Goldman’s role as a so-called “market maker,” or an entity that links buyers and sellers.

  While the senators repeatedly argued that Goldman created securities solely for the purpose of betting against them, Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein and others fended off those charges by trying to explain that investors, all of whom are savvy enough to understand the bank’s role, weren’t interested in whether Goldman was betting for or against a security it created. 
  “You keep using the word betting ‘against,'” Blankfein exclaimed at one point to Levin. “We are principals.” 
  “The nature of the principal business and market making is that we are the other side of what our client wants to do,” he said. “And in the context of market making, that is not a conflict. I don’t think our clients care or should care [if Goldman is taking a short position],” he added. 
  “I don’t view it as [a conflict of interest],” CFO David Viniar told Sen. Ted Kaufman in explaining Goldman’s dual role. 
  Earlier in the day, several members of the subcommittee tussled with former mortgage-trading desk boss Dan Sparks, who argued Goldman was under no obligation to disclose its position with a security it was selling because that position might change day to day. 
  “Should you have told that client you were going short, if you were?” Levin demanded of Sparks. 
  “Currently, that is not an obligation,” Sparks said. “I think it would create a number of issues because those positions change a lot [and] you don’t know what those positions are [at any given moment].” 
  But the misunderstandings didn’t stop there. At one point, a number of senators declared that Goldman had a fiduciary responsibility to be completely transparent about its activities with each security, even though that responsibility doesn’t exist with market makers. 
  In another instance, some lawmakers attempted to equate a futures contract to speculate on the price of corn with a structured-mortgage product like a collateralized debt obligation. 
  “It’s complicated,” Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein said at one point during his testimony. 
  “Well, a lot of these things are fairly complicated, Mr. Blankfein,” Sen. John McCain fired back. 
  That exchange typified the more than nearly 11 hours of testimony that started out with current and former members of Goldman’s mortgage-trading desk and wrapped up with Blankfein. 
  Among the highlights was testimony from Fabrice Tourre, a Goldman exec who was named in a civil fraud suit against Goldman by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has accused the bank of misleading investors about the involvement of billionaire hedge funder John Paulson in a CDO called Abacus. 
  On Saturday, Goldman released a series e-mails from Tourre’s work account. The messages spoke about his take on the collateralized debt obligation (CDO) market that it is “a little like Frankenstein turning against his own inventor.” 
  In earlier testimony yesterday, Tourre told the Senate subcommittee that the e-mails “reflect badly on the firm and on myself and I wish I hadn’t sent these.” mark.decambre@nypost.com

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
