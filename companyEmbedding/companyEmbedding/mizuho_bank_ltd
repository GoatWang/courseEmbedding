Equipment
PJP-10UR：About 260 units
Period
Oct. 2011 to Mar. 2013
Configuration
The units were installed in about 260 sales offices and at consultation desks in 11 locations, which were connected by the Remote Teller System jointly developed with GLORY LTD. to integrate the home-loan processing and consultation operations into our network. The voice portion of this system used Yamaha's PJP-10UR Conference Speakerphone.

Mizuho Bank's Remote Teller System Concept
Sales partner's voice


Integrating teleconferencing systems used for home-loan processing and consultations into networks.
PJP-10UR achieved clear, effective, distraction-free teleconferencing
Background to the adoption of PJP models

Using teleconferencing to improve convenience for clients and to streamline operations.

Expert loan officers give highly personalized service.
Improved productivity through increased efficiency in loan operations.

Mizuho Bank established Loan Consultation Squares (LCSs) exclusively to process transactions and provide consultation. LCSs are also open weekday evenings and weekends for customers inquiring about or applying for home loans, to increase convenience for customers and to centralize loan operations that had been conducted at each branch. This was intended to increase the efficiency of bank services. As part of the project to establish the LCS, we developed the Remote Teller System teleconferencing system jointly with GLORY LTD. This system now connects 260 branches with 11 LCS locations and has become an indispensable tool for loan operations. Our objective was to create a seamless communications environment that would provide the same level of service that customers would receive if they were dealing directly with local bank staff. The most important component in such as system is therefore the speakerphone, and in this case the Yamaha PJP-10UR was used.

Results of the adoption of PJP models


Both customers and bank staff applaud the system, usability and convenience have been improved, the system has been expanded to include more locations, and new applications are being developed.

Indispensable for loan processing and consultation.
	The expansion of available locations.
New applications are being developed that utilize unique system characteristics.

The Remote Teller System, which uses the PJP-10UR, is an effective solution for both improving customer convenience and making bank operations more efficient, and has been well received by both customers and bank staff alike. We plan to continually upgrade the system to further improve usability and increase the number of LCSs to relieve LCS congestion (LCS busy state). Because the system has general applications and is not customized for one specific use, we will explore the possibilities of expanding the system for other types of consultations and work to develop new applications. 










More than 260 branches use PJP-10UR on teleconferencing connections to allow natural conversations that are almost like being at a branch in person. This has increased convenience for customers, and boosted the efficiency of bank operations.

The customer's voice

PJP-10UR has become an indispensable tool at Mizuho Bank.
Both customers and bank staff alike are overjoyed.

Mizuho Financial Group, Inc.
Operations Planning Division, Senior Manager
Yusuke Hamano

When developing the Remote Teller System, we thought it important to have the best audio and video quality so that customers feel very comfortable and natural when using it. We devoted a great deal of time to selecting the speakerphone with the highest audio quality, and we examined and compared many different models. We finally decided on the Yamaha PJP-10UR. The PJP-10UR is free from echo and feedback, and we are very satisfied with it. Although some of us were initially unsure whether the PJP-10UR would be satisfactory for processing and consultations via video conferencing, the amazing audio quality makes it very effective.



Mizuho Financial Group, Inc.
Operations Planning Division, Manager
Naohiko Manno

We were very focused on the usability of the Remote Teller System, as well as the picture quality and sound quality, and we plan to upgrade it on an ongoing basis to further improve convenience and usability. The system configuration itself is rather simple, which makes it very versatile, so we think there will be many new applications for it in the future beyond loan operations, such as branch training and information sharing, or any two-way communication application.



Mizuho Bank's Remote Teller System Concept







The branch systems consist of a large touch-panel display, high-quality speakerphone (PJP-10UR), high-resolution web camera, standing scanner, and color printer. The LCS adds a touch pen and a headset to this configuration
In addition to high-quality audio and video providing smooth two-way communication, pamphlets and applications can be scanned and displayed on screen, while the touch pen can be used as a pointer. Both sides can print out documents, which enables customers to bring documents home and allows the LCS to print and save signed documents.


Sales partner's voice

We value Yamaha's PJP-10UR
for its stable, high-quality audio

GLORY LTD.
Financial Sales Division, Financial Sales Group
Sales Group 1,　Assistant Manager
Katsuhiro Amatsu

When developing the Remote Teller System with Mizuho, we were particularly conscious of system reliability and stability. Mizuho's primary requirement was that customers and bank staff be able to hold comfortable, natural conversations, and we put all our efforts into seeing how stably we could achieve this. The Yamaha PJP-10UR was the perfect device for this objective. Yamaha's acoustic technology made this goal a daily reality, and I really value this product.

Its headquarters office building is located in the Otemachi district of Chiyoda, Tokyo.
Mizuho Bank has over 505 branches and offices in Japan and in thirty-six other countries and regions, and is the only bank to have branches in every prefecture in Japan.
The name “Mizuho” is an archaic Japanese term meaning “golden ears of rice,” and was used in the classical text Nihon Shoki to describe Japan.

History[edit]
Announced in 1999, Mizuho Financial Group was established on April 1, 2002 by the merger of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Fuji Bank and the Industrial Bank of Japan. All three predecessors were major financial institutions in their own right and had served as cornerstones of major zaibatsu (prewar era) and keiretsu (postwar era). In April 2002, Mizuho Corporate Bank and Mizuho Bank were established as two core banking subsidiaries of Mizuho Financial Group through a split and merger process reorganizing the three legacy banks. It was the first financial holding company structure created among major Japanese banks. Mizuho Corporate Bank focused on large corporations, financial institutions and public sector entities in Japan and overseas. Mizuho Bank focused on individuals and small and medium-sized companies in Japan.
Mizuho Corporate Bank engaged in steady expansion overseas, opening twenty overseas offices between 2005 and 2010,[1] particularly in China, as well as in the Americas, Europe and Middle East. In 2006, Mizuho Corporate Bank became the first Japanese bank to obtain financial holding company status in the U.S.,[2] and Mizuho Financial Group listed its ADRs on the New York Stock Exchange.[3]
The two banks were initially consolidated under a holding company, Mizuho Holdings. On October 1, 2005 they were transferred to a new holding vehicle, Mizuho Financial Group. On July 1, 2013, a merger between the former Mizuho Bank and the former Mizuho Corporate Bank took place, and the institution was named Mizuho Bank.[4]
Services[edit]

Cash cards for use in Japan only.

Website.

All services, including Internet Banking and the main website are in Japanese only. Some branches hire English-speaking employees. All services except for international cash cards, credit cards and international money transfers are limited within the territory of Japan.
Restrictions on foreign nationals apply, particularly loans are available only for Japanese nationals and permanent residents of Japan holding permanent employment.[citation needed]
Botched trading scandal of 2005[edit]
On Thursday, December 8, 2005, shares of recruitment firm J-com debuted at 610,000 Japanese Yen (¥) ($5,041) on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (the TSE). An inexperienced trader at Mizuho, intending to sell one share at ¥610,000, instead sent an order at 9:27 am to the TSE to sell 610,000 shares of J-com at ¥1 each, essentially attempting to sell $3.075 billion worth of stock for only $5,041. In addition, the size of Mizuho's sell order was 41 times the total number of J-com shares.[5]

Mizuho Bank Ginza branch


Mizuho Bank, Ltd. (株式会社みずほ銀行, Kabushiki-gaisha Mizuho Ginkō) is the integrated retail and corporate banking unit of Mizuho Financial Group (TYO:8411; NYSE:MFG), one of the largest financial services companies in Japan, with total assets of approximately $1.64 trillion in 2014. Mizuho is one of the three so-called Japanese "megabanks" (along with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group). Mizuho Bank provides financial products and services to a wide range of clients, including individuals, small and medium-sized enterprises, large corporations, financial institutions and public sector entities. Its headquarters office building is located in the Otemachi district of Chiyoda, Tokyo.
Mizuho Bank has over 505 branches and offices in Japan and in thirty-six other countries and regions, and is the only bank to have branches in every prefecture in Japan.
The name “Mizuho” is an archaic Japanese term meaning “golden ears of rice,” and was used in the classical text Nihon Shoki to describe Japan.

History[edit]
Announced in 1999, Mizuho Financial Group was established on April 1, 2002 by the merger of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Fuji Bank and the Industrial Bank of Japan. All three predecessors were major financial institutions in their own right and had served as cornerstones of major zaibatsu (prewar era) and keiretsu (postwar era). In April 2002, Mizuho Corporate Bank and Mizuho Bank were established as two core banking subsidiaries of Mizuho Financial Group through a split and merger process reorganizing the three legacy banks. It was the first financial holding company structure created among major Japanese banks. Mizuho Corporate Bank focused on large corporations, financial institutions and public sector entities in Japan and overseas. Mizuho Bank focused on individuals and small and medium-sized companies in Japan.
Mizuho Corporate Bank engaged in steady expansion overseas, opening twenty overseas offices between 2005 and 2010,[1] particularly in China, as well as in the Americas, Europe and Middle East. In 2006, Mizuho Corporate Bank became the first Japanese bank to obtain financial holding company status in the U.S.,[2] and Mizuho Financial Group listed its ADRs on the New York Stock Exchange.[3]
The two banks were initially consolidated under a holding company, Mizuho Holdings. On October 1, 2005 they were transferred to a new holding vehicle, Mizuho Financial Group. On July 1, 2013, a merger between the former Mizuho Bank and the former Mizuho Corporate Bank took place, and the institution was named Mizuho Bank.[4]
Services[edit]

Current accounts.
Cash cards for use in Japan only.
International cash cards.
International money transfers.
Credit cards.
Saving accounts.
Loans.
Internet Banking.
Website.

All services, including Internet Banking and the main website are in Japanese only. Some branches hire English-speaking employees. All services except for international cash cards, credit cards and international money transfers are limited within the territory of Japan.
Restrictions on foreign nationals apply, particularly loans are available only for Japanese nationals and permanent residents of Japan holding permanent employment.[citation needed]
Botched trading scandal of 2005[edit]
On Thursday, December 8, 2005, shares of recruitment firm J-com debuted at 610,000 Japanese Yen (¥) ($5,041) on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (the TSE). An inexperienced trader at Mizuho, intending to sell one share at ¥610,000, instead sent an order at 9:27 am to the TSE to sell 610,000 shares of J-com at ¥1 each, essentially attempting to sell $3.075 billion worth of stock for only $5,041. In addition, the size of Mizuho's sell order was 41 times the total number of J-com shares.[5]

Who We Are







Mizuho Americas is the financial institution that combines seemingly disparate things—Japanese culture and American talent, considered risk mitigation and a creative approach, local market knowledge and global reach—to act faster, see further and adapt better in every decision, every day.

News + Events
 

Our parent company—Mizuho Financial Group—came together in late 2002, merging three of the largest banks in Japan. With our backing as a financial powerhouse in Asia and our growing presence across the Americas, we’re able to meet local market needs with a combination of truly customized care and $1.8 trillion in assets (as of March 31, 2016).
Today, as part of one of the largest financial institutions in the world, Mizuho Americas leans on that Japanese heritage and diligence that saw us through the past years of financial turmoil. We honor our namesake “Mizuho” meaning “golden ears of rice”—a poetic term for Japan itself—and at the same time, embrace our local markets’ taste for success and a flair for innovation. The result is a hybrid style of thinking and execution, that’s entirely our own. 








Stability and that extra edge
Our long-standing client relationships are our greatest point of pride. We offer strategic solutions and consulting for the increasingly sophisticated and technological needs of our large client base—primarily corporations, financial institutions, pensions, hedge funds and public sector entities.
Our services dive deep into industry and client needs. They’re guided by a mix of careful decision-making and creative approaches to the complexity of our clients’ financial goals and the countries where they do business.
There’s no product assembly line here. We help clients find different angles on issues and opportunities so we can pull in the right pieces for a perfect hybrid solution.
