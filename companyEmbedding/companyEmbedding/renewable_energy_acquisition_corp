XZERES Acquires Southwest Windpower’s Skystream Product Line
Acquisition Includes Next-Generation Skystream Designs,  IP Portfolio and Manufacturing Assets 
WILSONVILLE,  ORE., July 9, 2013 ─ XZERES  Corp. (PINKSHEETS: XPWR), designer, manufacturer and marketer of small (2.5 – 10kW) wind  powered, distributed energy turbines and other renewable energy products, has acquired  the assets of Southwest Windpower. The acquisition complements and solidifies  XZERES’ global offering of small wind turbines with best in class, advanced  engineering designed to address the growing distributed power marketplace. 

The assets include Southwest  Windpower’s award-winning Skystream product  line and next-generation Skystream product designs, related IP portfolio, manufacturing  assets, and inventory.


Southwest Windpower is widely known in the wind  power industry for its leading-edge design, performance, manufacturing and global  distribution of small wind systems. Since Southwest Windpower introduced the Skystream  product line in 2008, more than 8,000 units have been installed worldwide,  making Skystream the world’s highest volume small wind turbine to date. 


Skystream addresses residential and rural markets,  including off-grid applications such as remote cell phone towers and remote  micro-grid applications. Skystream has been trademarked and certified in key global  markets, with a strong installation presence in the U.S., Europe and Southeast  Asia. It is the first turbine to be certified with the UL (Underwriters Laboratories)  6142 Standard for Small Turbines, which indicates the product complies with  safety standards required by certain states.


The manufacturing  assets acquired by XZERES include tooling and fixtures, production line and  testing equipment. The IP portfolio includes five issued patents, plus five patents  pending in the U.S. and internationally, including those covering the  next-generation design of a larger Skystream wind turbine. While XZERES will  not be extending warranty coverage to existing Skystream customers, the company  plans to provide support and maintenance services along with preferred customer  upgrade options. 


  “Southwest Windpower had been a dominant industry  leader for sub-five kilowatt turbines, particularly with its iconic Skystream  brand,” said Frank Greco, CEO of XZERES. “The acquisition of these assets and  supporting IP perfectly complements our existing world-class 10kW system, as we  continue to build XZERES into a global renewable energy company.”


“Southwest Windpower’s significant investment of  years and dollars perfecting Skystream and certifying the product in major  global markets provides for an acquisition that places XZERES well ahead in  terms of what we can now offer our expanding customer base,” continued Greco. “We  have a high appreciation for the loyal Skystream customers who have made  Skystream the world’s most popular small wind turbine. So, we’re pleased to be  able to finally provide them long-overdue support and maintenance services, as  well as special upgrade options.”


  Transaction funding  support was provided by Renewable Power Resources. According to Greco: “Our ability to capitalize  on this opportunity further demonstrates the significant commitment of our financing  partner, Renewable Power Resources. Their dedication and vision toward building  XZERES into a major global renewable energy company is impressive and a  significant benefit to all stakeholders.”



About  Southwest Windpower
  Southwest Windpower had been designing and distributing small wind turbines  since 1987, and is a recognized global leader in the design, manufacturing and  distribution of small wind systems. A pioneer in wind power technology, the  company built and shipped more than 180,000 wind turbines to more than 120  countries worldwide, making it once the largest manufacturer of small wind  turbines in the United States.

  About XZERES Corp.
  XZERES Corp. is a  renewable energy and clean energy technology company that designs, develops,  manufactures and markets distributed generation wind power systems as well as  power management and power efficiency solutions for the commercial, light  industrial and residential markets. The company’s grid-connected and off-grid  wind turbine systems, which consist of its 2.5kW and 10kW devices and related  equipment, are utilized for electrical power generation for applications and  markets including residential, micro-grid based rural and island  electrification, agricultural, small business and rural electric utility  systems, as well as other private, corporate infrastructure and government  applications. 

The company’s wind  power systems are focused on distributed energy, where a specific machine's  energy output is largely or entirely used on-site where the equipment is  installed, as well as grid-connected applications. While many of its customers  take advantage of local net-metering rules within the United States and Feed-In  Tariffs (to sell power back to the grid) that are available in Europe and internationally,  the company’s wind power systems are not dependent on transmission needs to  carry the energy produced to another location and are therefore well suited for  remote electrification, available with or without a battery-coupled solution. XZERES  power management and power efficiency solutions are deployed primarily for  commercial and light industrial applications, and secondarily for residential usage and target both  urban and rural customers.

            Renewable Energy Group Completes Syntroleum Acquisition
        












(?)



















 | Jun 03, 2014
            

        

(AMES, IA) June 3, 2014— Renewable Energy Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: REGI) announced today that its wholly-owned subsidiary, REG Synthetic Fuels, LLC, has closed its acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Syntroleum Corporation.
Syntroleum advised REG earlier Tuesday that a majority of its shareholders had voted to approve the asset sale to REG. Shortly after the Syntroleum stockholders’ meeting, officials from the two companies completed the transaction, which included the issuance of 3,493,613 shares of REG common stock to Syntroleum.
The assets acquired from Syntroleum include a 50% ownership interest in Dynamic Fuels, LLC, which owns a 75 million gallon per year nameplate capacity renewable diesel biorefinery located in Geismar, Louisiana.  REG has a separate pending agreement with Tyson Foods, Inc. to acquire the remaining interests in Dynamic Fuels. 
Most of the employees at Syntroleum’s Tulsa headquarters will join REG as part of the newly formed REG Synthetic Fuels.
 “We are very pleased to bring new advanced biofuel technologies into the REG portfolio of products that will expand our biomass-based diesel business and launch us into new customer segments,” said Daniel J. Oh, Renewable Energy Group, Inc. President and Chief Executive Officer.  “We welcome the newest members of our team in Tulsa to REG Synthetic Fuels.”
Syntroleum pioneered renewable diesel fuel and Fischer-Tropsch gas-to-liquids technologies and built a large IP portfolio, including 186 patents issued or pending, which REG will now own.  Headquartered in Ames, Iowa, REG owns and operates nine active biorefineries in five states and distributes biodiesel through a national network of distribution terminals.
 
About Renewable Energy Group
Renewable Energy Group, Inc. is a leading North American advanced biofuels producer with a nationwide distribution and logistics system. Utilizing an integrated value chain model, Renewable Energy Group is focused on converting natural fats, oils and greases into advanced biofuels and on converting diverse feedstocks into renewable chemicals. With nine biorefineries across the country, REG is a proven biodiesel partner in the distillate marketplace.
 
For more than a decade, REG has been a reliable supplier of advanced biofuels which meets or exceeds ASTM quality specifications. REG sells REG-9000™ biodiesel to distributors so Americans can have cleaner burning fuels that help diversify the energy complex and increase energy security. REG-9000™ biodiesel is distributed in most states in the U.S.  REG also markets ultra-low sulfur diesel and heating oil in the northeastern US.

Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
This press release contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 as amended, including statements regarding the expansion of REG’s business and IP portfolio as potential benefits of the transaction. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections that are subject to change, and actual results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include, but are not limited to: REG’s ability to successfully integrate Syntroleum’s assets and employees into REG’s existing business: whether Dynamic Fuels will be able to produce renewable diesel profitably, if at all; REG’s ability to successfully utilize the intellectual property assets acquired from Syntroleum; potential changes in governmental programs and policies requiring or encouraging the use of biofuels, including RFS2; changes in the spread between biodiesel prices and feedstock costs; the future price and volatility of feedstocks; the future price and volatility of petroleum and products derived from petroleum; availability of federal and state governmental tax credits and incentives for biodiesel production; the effect of excess capacity in the biodiesel industry; unanticipated changes in the biodiesel market from which REG generates almost all of its revenues; and other risks and uncertainties described from time to time in REG's annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other periodic filings with the SEC. The forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this press release and REG does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements based on new developments or changes in its expectations.

ESCO Announces Acquisition of Renewable Energy Industry Supplier




ESCO Announces Acquisition of Renewable Energy Industry Supplier
May 9, 2017  | Press Releases
ST. LOUIS, May 8, 2017 – ESCO Technologies Inc. (NYSE: ESE) today announced that it has acquired NRG Systems, Inc. (NRG), doing business as Renewable NRG Systems, located in Hinesburg, Vermont. NRG, founded in 1982, is the global market leader in the design and manufacture of decision support tools for the renewable energy industry, primarily wind.
NRG serves electric utilities, wind turbine manufacturers, renewable energy developers, research institutes, and government agencies in more than 150 countries.
The business, which will join Doble Engineering as part of ESCO’s Utilities Solutions Group (USG) operating segment, has annualized sales of approximately $45 million (with nearly half of its sales coming from international markets) and operating margins in the mid-teens. The terms of the transaction were not disclosed.
NRG’s expertise spans both resource assessment products and wind plant optimization equipment such as turbine control sensors, Lidar, and condition based monitoring systems. The products are used during both the pre-development stage of a project and the operational stage when project owners need to optimize the performance of their assets.
The company’s products and applications are targeted at the following market segments:
Wind Resource Assessment which is the systematic collection of wind data at potential wind farm sites to allow wind farm developers to estimate the future power output of a variety of wind farm sizes and turbine arrangements. Customers use this information to design the layout of the wind farm, secure project financing, and make other critical decisions.
Wind Plant Optimization enables wind farm operators and owners to maximize their annual energy production, reduce their operating and maintenance (O&M) costs, increase system reliability, and drive down the levelized cost of energy.
Solar Resource Assessment is the systematic collection of solar data at a prospective solar energy production site to develop an accurate estimate of that facility’s annual energy production potential.
Solar Monitoring allows solar project operators to track electrical output precisely in order to trigger real-time maintenance and build long-term preventative maintenance programs.
Bryan Sayler, President of Doble, commented, “The addition of NRG offers Doble the opportunity to access the growing renewable energy market, expand our geographic presence, and provide our existing customers with proven tools to optimize their renewable energy generation assets.”
Justin Wheating, President of NRG, commented, “Becoming part of ESCO further strengthens our ability to grow through the continued investment in new products and the expansion of our existing technologies into new markets. We are excited about our future and pleased to join a company that shares our core values and demonstrates its strong focus on customers and employees.”
Vic Richey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “Adding NRG to our existing utility segment introduces a unique and exciting growth opportunity for ESCO. NRG’s capabilities are a great complement to Doble’s product and solution portfolio providing an immediate entry point into a large and growing market. Clean, renewable and sustainable energy is a $300 billion-plus per year global industry where approximately 600 gigawatts (GW) of new wind capacity and 700 gigawatts (GW) of solar PV capacity is expected to be added over the next 10 years. NRG is clearly a market leader with an exceptional brand, reputation, and strong management team, and I’m excited to welcome the outstanding and dedicated employees of NRG to our team.”

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

(Footnote to table on following page)

(Footnote to table on previous page)

(1) Two of our officers and directors, Craig S. Laughlin and Larry Hopfenspirger,
    advanced a total of $25,000 to us to cover offering expenses. As a portion of
    the offering expenses listed were paid with these funds before the offering,
    repayment of the $25,000 to the officers and directors upon closing of the
    offering is treated as payment of the offering expenses out of the proceeds
    of the offering.

All expenses and uses are estimates, other than the filing fees payable to the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

Between $4,800,000 (if the minimum number of units is sold) and $9,600,000 (if
the maximum number of units is sold) of net proceeds will be placed in a trust
fund maintained by Associated Bank, N.A., Minneapolis, Minnesota, as trustee.
The proceeds will not be released from the trust fund until the earlier of the
completion of a business combination or our liquidation. The proceeds held in
the trust fund may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target
business with which we ultimately complete a business combination. Any amounts
not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target business may be used to
finance operations of the target business or to effect other acquisitions, as
determined by our board of directors at that time.

Craig Laughlin, an officer and director, is providing office space, secretarial
support and related administrative services through his wholly-owned company,
SRC Funding, Inc., at a monthly rate of $1,500. We estimate legal and accounting
fees associated with filing our periodic reports with the Securities and
Exchange Commission over the next two years will be approximately $60,000. This
amount does include additional legal, accounting, or other professional fees
that we may incur in connection with evaluating a prospective business
combination. Transfer Agent and Registrar Fees over the next two years are
estimated at $15,000, and the estimated premium payment on our director and
officer insurance during that period is estimated at between $45,000 and
$95,000.

We intend to use the excess working capital (between approximately $500,000 if
the minimum is sold, and approximately $1,100,000 if the maximum is sold) for
due diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and
negotiating business combinations, which may include compensation to our
directors engaged as consultants to perform specific services in connection with
a business combination as well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by our officers and directors in connection with the search
for and evaluation of prospective business combinations. We believe that the
excess working capital will be sufficient to cover the foregoing expenses and
reimbursement costs.

To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
fund as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance the
operations of the target business.

The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust fund and not immediately
required for the purposes set forth above will only be invested in United States
"government securities," defined as any Treasury Bill issued by the United
States having a maturity of one hundred and eighty days or less so that we are
not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. The
interest income derived from investment of these net proceeds during this period
will be used to defray our general and administrative expenses, as well as costs
relating to compliance with securities laws and regulations, including
associated professional fees, until a business combination is completed.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a
business combination is not consummated during that time.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust fund
(including interest earned on its portion of the trust fund) only in the event
of our liquidation or if that public stockholder were to seek to convert such
shares into cash in connection with a business combination, which the public
stockholder voted against and which we actually consummate. In no other
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust fund.


In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we expect to
encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective
similar to ours. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive
experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through
affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other
resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when
contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there are
numerous potential target businesses that we could acquire with the net proceeds
of this offering, our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target
businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent
competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of
a target business. Further:

 · our obligation to seek stockholder approval of a business combination may delay
   the completion of a transaction;

 · our obligation to convert into cash shares of common stock held by our public
   stockholders in certain instances may reduce the resources available to us for
   a business combination; and

 · our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent,
   may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses.

Any of these obligations may place us at a competitive disadvantage in
successfully negotiating a business combination. Our management believes,
however, that our status as a public entity and potential access to the United
States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over
privately-held entities having a similar business objective as us in acquiring a
target business with significant growth potential on favorable terms.

If we succeed in effecting a business combination, there will be, in all
likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business in the
renewable energy and environmental industries and their related infrastructures
and elsewhere. Such a business combination may also be subject to regulatory
approval. There is substantial competition in all aspects and segments of our
industry focus. Numerous companies, most of which have substantially greater
financial resources available to them than we do, are already engaged in the
industry segments we intend to focus on. We cannot assure you that, subsequent
to a business combination, we will have the resources or ability to compete
effectively.


Company Description
We are a blank check company organized under the laws of the state of Nevada on
June 21, 2007. We were formed to effect a merger, capital stock exchange, asset
acquisition or other similar business combination with an operating business in
either the renewable energy industry or the environmental


 industry and their
related infrastructures. To date, our efforts have been limited to
organizational activities.

The renewable energy industry and its related infrastructure generally includes
the production, generation, transmission and distribution of electricity, heat,
fuel and other consumable forms of energy through the utilization of renewable
fuel sources such as geothermal, biofuels, biomass, wind, fuel cells, ocean
waves, solar and waste stream pyrolysis (to mention a few); and the
infrastructure needed to maintain and operate the facilities, services and
installations used in the foregoing areas. Although we may consider a target
business in any segment of the renewable energy industry, we currently intend to
concentrate our search for an acquisition candidate on companies in the
following areas:

· Wind electric generation, distribution and transmission;

· Solar power;

· Co-generation;

· Bio-mass;

· Synthetic gas production, distribution and transmission;

· Energy efficiency and energy conservation related products and services;

· Alternative transportation technologies;

· Steam generation and distribution;

· Energy storage technologies;

· Other alternative and renewable energy technologies; and

· The development, installation or manufacturing of any of the above;

The environmental industry and its related infrastructure generally includes the
technologies and services that protect the natural and human environment from
destruction and pollution, and the infrastructure needed to maintain and operate
the facilities, services and installations used in the foregoing areas. The
environmental industry also seeks to ameliorate the negative effects of
industrial production and unhealthy practices and materials on our population as
a whole.

Landfill closures and the difficulty of positioning new facilities in certain
parts of the country have required that waste be transported long distances for
environmentally sound disposal. New landfills require additional remediation
measures to ensure that waste does not contaminate the surrounding ground or
nearby water supplies. New technologies and expenditures are increasingly
required with respect to air emissions and water cleanup, as pollution from
power and industrial plants merit increasing examination and concern. Searches
for new energy and water sources must meet stringent environmental standards,
while existing and alternative forms of energy that are being used, developed
and tested must adhere to an expanding body of practices and procedures to
ensure that our environment is protected.

Although we may consider a target business in any segment of the environmental
industry, we currently intend to concentrate our search for an acquisition
candidate on companies in the following areas:

· Waste management and disposal, including wastewater treatment and management
  and sewage control;

· Air treatment and ionization, pollution and emission control;

· Abatement and sequestration of carbon dioxide and other global warming gases;

· Other energy/environmental related technologies; and

· The infrastructure necessary to operate in the environmental industry 
  including but not limited to areas such as the operation of water supply 
  facilities, waste and wastewater treatment facilities, pollution control 
  facilities and transportation facilities and the production, transportation or
  distribution of the equipment and products incidental to such operations.

Although we believe there are many positive trends that make acquisition
candidates in both the renewable energy and environmental industries attractive,
there are various risks of acquiring a business in such industries, including
substantial government regulation. Depending on the industry segment we
ultimately operate in, we may be required to spend substantial amounts of time
and money in complying with such governmental regulations. 

While we may seek to effect business combinations with more than one target
business, our initial business combination must be with a target business whose
fair market value is at least equal to 80% of our net assets at the time of such
acquisition. Consequently, it is likely that we will have the ability to effect
only a single business combination.

Our executive offices are located at 7078 East Fish Lake Road, Suite 800,
Minneapolis MN 55311. Our telephone number is 952-541-1155.

Renewable
Energy Acquisition Corp.

(a
development stage company) 

Notes to
Financial Statements

March 31,
2010 and December 31, 2009

 

 

Note A -
Background and Description of Business

 

Renewable
Energy Acquisition Corp. (Company) was incorporated on June 21,
2007 under the laws of the State of Nevada.

 

The
Company was formed to effect a merger, capital stock exchange,
asset acquisition or other similar business combination with an
operating business in either the renewable energy or the
environmental industry and their related
infrastructures.  To date, our efforts have been limited
to organizational activities.  As the Company has had no
substantial operations or substantial assets since inception, the
Company is considered in the development stage.

 

 

Note B -
Preparation of Financial Statements

 

The
Company follows the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles and has elected a year-end
of December 31.

 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from
those estimates.

 

Management
further acknowledges that it is solely responsible for adopting
sound accounting practices, establishing and maintaining a system
of internal accounting control and preventing and detecting
fraud.  The Company’s system of internal accounting
control is designed to assure, among other items, that 1) recorded
transactions are valid; 2) valid transactions are recorded; and 3)
transactions are recorded in the proper period in a timely manner
to produce financial statements which present fairly the financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company for
the respective periods being presented

 

During
interim periods, the Company follows the accounting policies set
forth in its audited financial statements filed with the U. S.
Securities and Exchange Commission in its General Form for
Registration of Securities Pursuant to Section 12(b) or 12(g) of
The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on Form 10 containing the
Company’s financial statements for the years ended December
31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.  The information
presented within these interim financial statements may not include
all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting
principles and the users of financial information provided for
interim periods should refer to the annual financial information
and footnotes when reviewing the interim financial results
presented herein.

 

In the
opinion of management, the accompanying interim financial
statements, prepared in accordance with the U. S. Securities and
Exchange Commission’s instructions for Form 10-Q, are
unaudited and contain all material adjustments, consisting only of
normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the
Company for the respective interim periods
presented.  The current period results of operations are
not necessarily indicative of results which ultimately will be
reported for the full fiscal year ending December 31,
2010.

 

 

Note C -
Going Concern Uncertainty

 

The
Company was formed to effect a merger, capital stock exchange,
asset acquisition or other similar business combination with an
operating business in either the renewable energy or the
environmental industry and their related
infrastructures.  To date, the Company’s efforts
have been limited to organizational activities.  As the
Company has had no substantial operations or substantial assets
since inception, the Company is considered in the development
stage.  There is no assurance that the Company will be
able to successful in the implementation of this business
plan.

(a

Notes to
Financial Statements - Continued

March 31,
2010 and December 31, 2009

 

 

Note C -
Going Concern Uncertainty - Continued

 

The
Company has no operating history, limited cash on hand, no assets
and has a business plan with inherent risk.  Because of
these factors, the Company’s auditors have issued an audit
opinion on the Company’s financial statements which includes
a statement describing our going concern status.  This
means, in the auditor’s opinion, substantial doubt about our
ability to continue as a going concern exists at the date of their
opinion.

 

The
Company’s current management anticipates that the initial
capitalization will be sufficient to maintain the corporate status
of the Company for the immediate future.  Because of the
Company's lack of operating assets, the Company’s continuance
may become fully dependent upon either future sales of securities
and/or advances or loans from significant stockholders or corporate
officers to provide sufficient working capital to preserve the
integrity of the corporate entity during the development
phase.  In the event that working capital sufficient to
maintain the corporate entity and implement our business plan is
not available, the Company’s existing controlling
stockholders intend to maintain the corporate status of the Company
and provide all necessary working capital support on the Company's
behalf.  However, no formal commitments or arrangements
to advance or loan funds to the Company or repay any such advances
or loans exist.  There is no legal obligation for either
management or existing controlling stockholders to provide
additional future funding. Further, the Company is at the mercy of
future economic trends and business operations for the
Company’s existing controlling stockholders to have the
resources available to support the Company.

 

The
Company's continued existence is dependent upon its ability to
implement its business plan, generate sufficient cash flows from
operations to support its daily operations, and provide sufficient
resources to retire existing liabilities and obligations on a
timely basis.  The Company faces considerable risk in
it’s business plan and a potential shortfall of funding due
to our uncertainty to raise adequate capital in the equity
securities market.

 

The
Company anticipates offering future sales of equity
securities.  However, there is no assurance that the
Company will be able to obtain additional funding through the sales
of additional equity securities or, that such funding, if
available, will be obtained on terms favorable to or affordable by
the Company.

 

The
Company’s Articles of Incorporation authorizes the issuance
of up to 5,000,000 million shares of preferred stock and 50,000,000
shares of common stock.  The Company’s ability to
issue preferred stock may limit the Company’s ability to
obtain debt or equity financing as well as impede the
implementation of the Company’s business plan.  The
Company’s ability to issue these authorized but unissued
securities may also negatively impact our ability to raise
additional capital through the sale of our debt or equity
securities.

 

In such a
restricted cash flow scenario, the Company would be unable to
complete its business plan steps, and would, instead, delay all
cash intensive activities.  Without necessary cash flow,
the Company may become dormant during the next twelve months, or
until such time as necessary funds could be raised in the equity
securities market.

 

While the
Company is of the opinion that good faith estimates of the
Company’s ability to secure additional capital in the future
to reach its goals have been made, there is no guarantee that the
Company will receive sufficient funding to sustain operations or
implement any future business plan steps.

 

 

Note D -
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

 




1.



Cash and
cash equivalents




 

The
Company considers all cash on hand and in banks, certificates of
deposit and other highly-liquid investments with maturities of
three months or less, when purchased, to be cash and cash
equivalents.

 




2.



Organization
costs




 

The
Company has adopted the provisions required by the Start-Up
Activities topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification
whereby all costs incurred with the incorporation and organization
of the Company were charged to operations as incurred.

3.



Income
taxes




 

The
Company files income tax returns in the United States of America
and various states, as appropriate and applicable.  The
Company may become subject to U.S. federal, state and local, as
applicable, income tax examinations by regulatory taxing
authorities for any period since its inception.  However,
the Company does not anticipate any examinations of returns filed
since its inception.

 

The
Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for
income taxes.  At March 31, 2010 and December 31,
2009, respectively, the deferred tax asset and deferred tax
liability accounts, as recorded when material to the financial
statements, are entirely the result of temporary
differences.  Temporary differences generally represent
differences in the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax
and financial reporting purposes, primarily accumulated
depreciation and amortization, allowance for doubtful accounts and
vacation accruals.

 

The
Company has adopted the provisions required by the Income Taxes
topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.  The
Codification Topic requires the recognition of potential
liabilities as a result of management’s acceptance of
potentially uncertain positions for income tax treatment on a
“more-likely-than-not” probability of an assessment
upon examination by a respective taxing authority.  As a
result of the implementation of Codification’s Income Tax
Topic, the Company did not incur any liability for unrecognized tax
benefits.

 




4.



Income
(Loss) per share




 

Basic
earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net income
(loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted-average
number of common shares outstanding during the respective period
presented in our accompanying financial statements.

 

Fully
diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed similar to basic
income (loss) per share except that the denominator is increased to
include the number of common stock equivalents (primarily
outstanding options and warrants).

 

Common
stock equivalents represent the dilutive effect of the assumed
exercise of the outstanding stock options and warrants, using the
treasury stock method, at either the beginning of the respective
period presented or the date of issuance, whichever is later, and
only if the common stock equivalents are considered dilutive based
upon the Company’s net income (loss) position at the
calculation date.

 

As of
March 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company had no outstanding stock
warrants, options or convertible securities which could be
considered as dilutive for purposes of the loss per share
calculation.

 




5.



New and
Pending Accounting Pronouncements




 

The
Company is of the opinion that any and all pending accounting
pronouncements, either in the adoption phase or not yet required to
be adopted, will not have a significant impact on the Company's
financial position or results of operations.

 

 

Note E -
Fair Value of Financial Instruments

 

The
carrying amount of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and
notes payable, as applicable, approximates fair value due to the
short term nature of these items and/or the current interest rates
payable in relation to current market conditions.

Note E -
Fair Value of Financial Instruments - Continued

 

Interest
rate risk is the risk that the Company’s earnings are subject
to fluctuations in interest rates on either investments or on debt
and is fully dependent upon the volatility of these
rates.  The Company does not use derivative instruments
to moderate its exposure to interest rate risk, if any.

 

Financial
risk is the risk that the Company’s earnings are subject to
fluctuations in interest rates or foreign exchange rates and are
fully dependent upon the volatility of these rates.  The
Company does not use derivative instruments to moderate its
exposure to financial risk, if any.

 

 

Note F -
Notes Payable to Stockholders

 

In
conjunction with the initial capitalization of the Company, the
subscribing shareholders agreed that additional working capital
would be needed to support the initial phases of the
Company’s implementation of its business
plan.  Accordingly, two controlling shareholders agreed
to lend the Company an aggregate $25,000 with an initial maturity
of the sooner of August 31, 2008 or 10 days after the closing of an
anticipated initial public offering.

 

The notes
are non-interest bearing and, as such, the Company has recognized
an aggregate of approximately $3,386 as additional paid-in capital
for economic event (calculated at an imputed interest rate of 6.0%
per annum) related to the non-interest bearing feature on the
aforementioned notes payable to stockholders.

 

On
September 29, 2009, the Company paid the controlling shareholders
an aggregate of $19,000 as principal repayment and the controlling
shareholders converted their remaining $6,000 in debt into 250,000
shares of restricted, unregistered common stock.

 

As of
March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, the outstanding balances on
these two separate notes is an aggregate $-0- an

Renewable
Energy Acquisition Corp.

(a
development stage company) 

Notes to
Financial Statements

September
30, 2010 and December 31, 2009

 

 

Note A -
Background and Description of Business

 

Renewable
Energy Acquisition Corp. (Company) was incorporated on June 21,
2007 under the laws of the State of Nevada.

 

The
Company was formed to effect a merger, capital stock exchange,
asset acquisition or other similar business combination with an
operating business in either the renewable energy or the
environmental industry and their related
infrastructures.  To date, our efforts have been limited
to organizational activities and seeking potential acquisition
targets.  As the Company has had no substantial
operations or substantial assets since inception, the Company is
considered in the development stage.

 

 

Note B -
Preparation of Financial Statements

 

The
Company follows the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles and has elected a year-end
of December 31.

 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from
those estimates.

 

Management
further acknowledges that it is solely responsible for adopting
sound accounting practices, establishing and maintaining a system
of internal accounting control and preventing and detecting
fraud.  The Company’s system of internal accounting
control is designed to assure, among other items, that 1) recorded
transactions are valid; 2) valid transactions are recorded; and 3)
transactions are recorded in the proper period in a timely manner
to produce financial statements which present fairly the financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company for
the respective periods being presented

 

During
interim periods, the Company follows the accounting policies set
forth in its audited financial statements filed with the U. S.
Securities and Exchange Commission in its General Form for
Registration of Securities Pursuant to Section 12(b) or 12(g) of
The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on Form 10 containing the
Company’s financial statements for the years ended December
31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.  The information
presented within these interim financial statements may not include
all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting
principles and the users of financial information provided for
interim periods should refer to the annual financial information
and footnotes when reviewing the interim financial results
presented herein.

 

In the
opinion of management, the accompanying interim financial
statements, prepared in accordance with the U. S. Securities and
Exchange Commission’s instructions for Form 10-Q, are
unaudited and contain all material adjustments, consisting only of
normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the
Company for the respective interim periods
presented.  The current period results of operations are
not necessarily indicative of results which ultimately will be
reported for the full fiscal year ending December 31,
2010.

 

 

Note C -
Going Concern Uncertainty

 

The
Company was formed to effect a merger, capital stock exchange,
asset acquisition or other similar business combination with an
operating business in either the renewable energy or the
environmental industry and their related
infrastructures.  To date, the Company’s efforts
have been limited to organizational activities and seeking
potential acquisition targets.  As the Company has had no
substantial operations or substantial assets since inception, the
Company is considered in the development stage.  There is
no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully
consummate an acquisition or merger with a private operating
company or, if successful, that any acquisition or merger will
result in the appreciation of our stockholders’ investment in
the then outstanding common stock.

Energy Acquisition Corp.

(a

Notes to
Financial Statements - Continued

September
30, 2010 and December 31, 2009

 

 

Note C -
Going Concern Uncertainty - Continued

 

The
Company has no operating history, limited cash on hand, no assets
and a business plan with inherent risk.  Because of these
factors, the Company’s auditors have issued an audit opinion
on the Company’s financial statements which includes a
statement describing our going concern status.  This
means, in the auditor’s opinion, substantial doubt about our
ability to continue as a going concern exists at the date of their
opinion.

 

The
Company’s current management anticipated that the initial
capitalization would be sufficient to maintain the corporate status
of the Company for the immediate future.  However,
because of the Company's lack of operating assets, the
Company’s continuance may become fully dependent upon either
future sales of securities and/or advances or loans from
significant stockholders or corporate officers to provide
sufficient working capital to preserve the integrity of the
corporate entity during the development phase.  In the
event that working capital sufficient to maintain the corporate
entity and implement our business plan is not available, the
Company’s existing controlling stockholders intend to
maintain the corporate status of the Company and provide all
necessary working capital support on the Company's
behalf.  However, no formal commitments or arrangements
to advance or loan funds to the Company or repay any such advances
or loans exist.  There is no legal obligation for either
management or existing controlling stockholders to provide
additional future funding. Further, the Company is at the mercy of
future economic trends and business operations for the
Company’s existing controlling stockholders to have the
resources available to support the Company.

 

The
Company's continued existence is dependent upon its ability to
implement its business plan, generate sufficient cash flows from
operations to support its daily operations, and provide sufficient
resources to retire existing liabilities and obligations on a
timely basis.  The Company faces considerable risk in its
business plan and a potential shortfall of funding due to our
uncertain ability to raise adequate capital in the equity
securities market.

 

The
Company anticipates offering future sales of equity
securities.  However, there is no assurance that the
Company will be able to obtain additional funding through the sales
of additional equity securities or, that such funding, if
available, will be obtained on terms favorable to or affordable by
the Company.

 

The
Company’s Articles of Incorporation authorizes the issuance
of up to 5,000,000 million shares of preferred stock and 50,000,000
shares of common stock.  The Company’s ability to
issue preferred stock may limit the Company’s ability to
obtain debt or equity financing as well as impede the
implementation of the Company’s business plan.  The
Company’s ability to issue these authorized but unissued
securities may also negatively impact our ability to raise
additional capital through the sale of our debt or equity
securities.

 

In such a
restricted cash flow scenario, the Company would be unable to
complete its business plan steps, and would, instead, delay all
cash intensive activities.  Without necessary cash flow,
the Company may become dormant during the next twelve months, or
until such time as necessary funds could be raised in the equity
securities market.

 

While the
Company is of the opinion that good faith estimates of the
Company’s ability to secure additional capital in the future
to reach its goals have been made, there is no guarantee that the
Company will receive sufficient funding to sustain operations or
implement any future business plan steps.

 

 

Note D -
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

 




1.



Cash and
cash equivalents




 

The
Company considers all cash on hand and in banks, certificates of
deposit and other highly-liquid investments with maturities of
three months or less, when purchased, to be cash and cash
equivalents.

 




2.



Organization
costs




 

The
Company has adopted the provisions required by the Start-Up
Activities topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification
whereby all costs incurred with the incorporation and organization
of the Company were charged to operations as incurred.

3.



Income
taxes




 

The
Company files income tax returns in the United States of America
and various states, as appropriate and applicable.  The
Company may become subject to U.S. federal, state and local, as
applicable, income tax examinations by regulatory taxing
authorities for any period since its inception.  However,
the Company does not anticipate any examinations of returns filed
since its inception.

 

The
Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for
income taxes.  At September 30, 2010 and
December 31, 2009, respectively, the deferred tax asset and
deferred tax liability accounts, as recorded when material to the
financial statements, are entirely the result of temporary
differences.  Temporary differences generally represent
differences in the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax
and financial reporting purposes, primarily accumulated
depreciation and amortization, allowance for doubtful accounts and
vacation accruals.

 

The
Company has adopted the provisions required by the Income Taxes
topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.  The
Codification Topic requires the recognition of potential
liabilities as a result of management’s acceptance of
potentially uncertain positions for income tax treatment on a
“more-likely-than-not” probability of an assessment
upon examination by a respective taxing authority.  As a
result of the implementation of Codification’s Income Tax
Topic, the Company did not incur any liability for unrecognized tax
benefits.

 




4.



Income
(Loss) per share




 

Basic
earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net income
(loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted-average
number of common shares outstanding during the respective period
presented in our accompanying financial statements.

 

Fully
diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed similar to basic
income (loss) per share except that the denominator is increased to
include the number of common stock equivalents (primarily
outstanding options and warrants).

 

Common
stock equivalents represent the dilutive effect of the assumed
exercise of the outstanding stock options and warrants, using the
treasury stock method, at either the beginning of the respective
period presented or the date of issuance, whichever is later, and
only if the common stock equivalents are considered dilutive based
upon the Company’s net income (loss) position at the
calculation date.

 

As of
September 30, 2010 and 2009, the Company had no outstanding stock
warrants, options or convertible securities which could be
considered as dilutive for purposes of the loss per share
calculation.
