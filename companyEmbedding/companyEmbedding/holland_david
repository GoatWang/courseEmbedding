HDF’s mother company, Farmel collects over 300 million litres of fresh cow milk per year from its own farms. Additionally Farmel also collects organic cow milk, goat milk and trades other dairy liquids. This means that when you deal with HDF you are also dealing with a company that collects and sells raw milk to factories producing cheese and milk powder.
Our vertical and horizontal approach allows us to provide our clients with in-depth knowledge about dairy products and build very strong relationships with all types of dairy factories we supply.
We mostly trade transformed products produced by factories we supply with raw material. HDF also commissions some factories to produce products as per our client’s requirements. Our employees are fully trained and have detailed knowledge of the different uses and applications of dairy powders, fluids, cheeses and butters. At Holland Dairy Foods we all work hard to provide you with the right advice concerning all our products.
