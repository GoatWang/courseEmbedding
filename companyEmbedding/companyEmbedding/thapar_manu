REDWOOD CITY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Rocket 
      Fuel (NASDAQ: FUEL), a leading provider of artificial intelligence 
      (AI) advertising and marketing solutions for global agencies and brands, 
      today announced Manu Thapar has joined the company as Senior Vice 
      President of Research and Development. Manu joins Rocket Fuel with more 
      than 20 years of technology management experience, working with major 
      technology brands and leading large multinational engineering teams with 
      as many as 500 engineers located across the U.S., India, China, and 
      Europe. The Senior Vice President of Research and Development role is a 
      newly created position that provides leadership for all of Rocket Fuel’s 
      technology teams.
    


      "As we scale Rocket Fuel toward our $1B revenue goal across multiple 
      product lines—all built on our core Big Data and machine-learning 
      technology—we need an exemplary leader who can scale teams efficiently 
      while providing technical depth and oversight for Big Data systems such 
      as Rocket Fuel’s,” said George John, Rocket Fuel Chairman and CEO. 
      “Manu’s PhD from Stanford’s engineering school set the foundation for 
      his high-profile career leading engineering teams at some of the 
      Valley’s leading technology companies. He’s done this while building a 
      strong reputation for himself, growing top performing teams, and 
      aligning engineering priorities with corporate goals to great success. 
      Rocket Fuel’s infrastructure represents one of the largest distributed 
      computing systems1 in the world, and we look forward to his 
      leadership at the helm of our technology team.”
    

      “Artificial intelligence and Big Data are terms that a lot of companies 
      lay claim to without the results to match—Rocket Fuel is the real deal, 
      with a cutting-edge AI platform that leads the industry in performance, 
      service, and scale,” said Manu. “This is a unique moment in history for 
      marketers—the potential to deliver personalized consumer experiences 
      across all touchpoints and platforms has never been greater than now, 
      and machine learning plays a crucial role in scaling that 1-to-1 
      opportunity. I’m excited to join a world-class team that is transforming 
      programmatic marketing while continuing to push of boundaries of 
      innovation for global marketers.”
    

      Manu has an extensive background in distributed systems, and in scaling 
      systems, platforms, and organizations. In his role as CTO at Angie’s 
      List, Manu led the technology, engineering, and product teams to 
      incorporate new technologies for search, analytics, and new product 
      areas such as e-commerce. He scaled end-to-end support and performance 
      for the site in line with the company's growth and high performance 
      requirements.
    

      Prior to Angie’s List, Manu served as Vice President at Yahoo!, where he 
      led the technology team and developed foundational technologies for all 
      of Yahoo’s properties. Manu’s previous work as Walmart.com’s VP of

	Angie’s List has lost its second, high-ranking officer in four months, with the departure of Chief Technology Officer Manu Thapar.

	The Indianapolis-based consumer reviews firm announced Thapar's departure on Monday morning in a regulatory filing. “Thapar’s employment with the company has ended effective September 27,” according to the filing.

	Thapar had been with Angie's List two years. It was not immediately clear whether he resigned or was terminated. Conspicuously absent in Monday’s announcement was the type of praise CEO Bill Oesterle heaped on Chief Financial Officer Robert Millard when Millard announced last March that he would step down on June 28.

	In the first nine months of this year, Thapar was busy exercising his Angie’s List stock options, which yielded gains of at least $730,000, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings.

	An Angie's List representative did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday morning. Pending Thapar’s replacement, the responsibilities of CTO have been assumed by other members of Angie’s engineering team.

	Angie's List shares tumbled nearly 6 percent on Monday, and were down another 7 percent in morning trading on Tuesday, to $20.83 per share. The stock price is up 75 percent since the beginning of the year.

	Monday's filing said that Tharpar is eligible to receive severance benefits as promised in his offer letter from Sept. 16, 2011. That letter specified that if the company decided to sever employment without cause, he would be entitled to his annual salary of $300,000 plus his targeted bonus, which was $160,000.

	Before joining Angie’s List Thapar was vice president of engineering at Walmart.com. He also has held various positions at Myspace, Yahoo! and Cisco Systems.

	Thapar helped oversee an expansion of e-commerce functions at Angie’s List, which is best-known for publishing consumer reviews of plumbers, mechanics and other service providers.

	In recent years, Angie’s began offering online deals directly to members through its Storefront and Big Deal functions.

	Millard's former CFO position was filled last month by Tom Fox, former senior director of business planning at wireless phone maker Nokia.

	Angie's List has vexed industry watchers since it went public in November 2011. The 18-year-old company has never turned an annual profit, leading investors to wonder whether it is wildly overvalued or on the brink of hitting a sweet spot for profits.

	The firm is growing at a torrid rate. It had paid memberships at the end of the second quarter of 2.2 million, up 51 percent from a year earlier. Revenue in the first six months of 2013 topped $111 million, up from $61 million. And its loss in the first half of this year shrank to $22 million, compared with $37 million in the first half of 2012.
