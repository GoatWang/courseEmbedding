Gulf Coast Ultra Deep Royalty Trust Key Developments

Nasdaq Stock Market To Delist Units/Beneficial Interest Of Gulf Coast Ultra Deep Royalty Trust
Oct 22 15
The Nasdaq Stock Market announced that it will delist the units/beneficial interest of Gulf Coast Ultra Deep Royalty Trust. Gulf Coast Ultra Deep Royalty Trust’s stock was suspended on October 16, 2015 and has not traded on Nasdaq since that time. Nasdaq will file a Form 25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission to complete the delisting of the company. The delisting becomes effective ten days after the Form 25 is filed.

Oct 15 15
Gulf Coast Ultra Deep Royalty Trust will be removed from Nasdaq Composite Index.



Gulf Coast Ultra Deep Royalty Trust Fails To Regain Compliance With NASDAQ Listing Rule 
Oct 8 15
On April 8, 2015, Gulf Coast Ultra Deep Royalty Trust (the Royalty Trust) received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Staff (the Staff) of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (NASDAQ) notifying the Royalty Trust that, because the closing bid price of the royalty trust units representing beneficial interests in the Royalty Trust (the royalty trust units) had been below $1.00 per unit for 30 consecutive business days, the Royalty Trust no longer complied with the bid price requirements for continued listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market set forth in NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). On October 7, 2015, the Royalty Trust received a letter from the Staff notifying the Royalty Trust that, as a result of the Royalty Trust’s failure to regain compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) within the 180-day period provided by the Staff, the royalty trust units are now subject to delisting from The NASDAQ Capital Market. The letter further provides that, unless the Royalty Trust requests an appeal of this determination, trading of the royalty trust units will be suspended at the opening of business on October 16, 2015, and NASDAQ will file a Form 25-NSE with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which will remove the royalty trust units from listing and registration on The NASDAQ Capital Market. The Royalty Trust does not intend to appeal the Staff’s delisting determination. The royalty trust units are expected to be quoted on the OTCQX U.S. tier of the over-the-counter, or OTC, markets immediately upon suspension of trading on The NASDAQ Capital Market. The transition of the royalty trust units to the OTCQX U.S. will have no effect on the Royalty Trust’s obligation to file reports with the SEC under applicable federal securities laws.

Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding.

Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

In a recent interview (here), T. Boone Pickens was asked about Gulf Coast Ultra Deep Royalty Trust (GULTU) and he immediately changed subjects. Odd, isn’t it, that a guy who has a lot to say about everything all the sudden doesn’t want to talk?
It was his reaction that piqued my curiosity. So I dug in. And what I learned makes me believe Gulf Coast Ultra Deep Royalty Trust is a very special situation.
GULTU was created in connection with Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold’s acquisition of McMoRan Exploration, which was completed on June 3, 2013. Immediately prior to the merger, McMoRan created a trust and conveyed a 5% gross overriding royalty interest in the future production from 20 specified shallow water ILTC (Inboard Lower Tertiary / Cretaceous) exploration prospects located on the Shelf of the Gulf of Mexico and onshore South Louisiana.
The nature of the overriding royalty interest means that GULTU owns a share of future production yet doesn’t have to pay any of the operating expenses or development costs. So the holders in GULTU are getting a free ride on the back of McMoRan’s exploration and development efforts in the Gulf and Southern LA.
There are a few things that are notable about the Trust:

The Royalty Trust is a passive entity and has no employees. All administrative functions of the Royalty Trust are performed by the Trustee who gets paid $150k / year.
If the Trust lacks sufficient funds to pay administrative expenses, FCX has agreed to pay annual trust expenses up to a maximum amount of $350,000, with no right to repayment or interest due. In addition to this annual contribution, FCX has agreed to lend money, on an unsecured, interest-free basis, to the Royalty Trust to cover additional administrative expenses. So not only do unitholders get a free ride on McMoRan’s exploration and development efforts, but FCX is paying the Trust’s operating bills! This is perhaps the definition of “special situation”.
The only assets of the Royalty Trust are the royalty interests. The Royalty Trust is not permitted to acquire other oil and natural gas properties or mineral interests or otherwise engage in activities beyond those necessary for the conservation and protection of the royalty interests.
If and when there is cash flow to the Trust, distributions will be made quarterly.
The Royalty Trust is not subject to tax at the Royalty Trust level. Rather, the Royalty Trust unitholders are considered to own and receive the Royalty Trust’s assets and income and are directly taxable thereon as though no trust were in existence.
The Royalty Trust will dissolve on the earlier of (1) June 3, 2033, (2) the sale of all of the royalty interests, (3) the election of the Trustee following its resignation for cause, (4) a vote of the holders of 80% (which after June 3, 2018, shall be reduced to 66⅔%) or more of the outstanding royalty trust units held by persons other than FCX or any of its affiliates, at a duly called meeting of the Royalty Trust unitholders at which a quorum is present, or (5) the exercise by FCX of the right to call all of the royalty trust units at $10 per royalty trust unit (can only call after June 3, 2018).

The last part is important: FCX has a call option which means if McMoRan is successful in the ILTC, the upside to unitholders is limited to $10 / share plus whatever distributions are paid prior to June 2018.
So we have a tax-free entity (pass through) with very little / no costs that owns the following interests:

Note: the last 3 (Highlander, Lineham Creek and Tortuga) are located in onshore South Louisiana. The rest are offshore targets. Additional targets acquired by McMoRan on or before December 5, 2017 in the Lafitte, England or Morgan blocks are also subject to an overriding royalty interest by GULTU.
All of these targets are located in the ultra-deep (generally greater than 18,000 total vertical depth), making each well unusually expensive to drill. This means that for McMoRan to go ahead and develop a target, they have to find something truly elephant-sized. And if they do, I believe unitholders will find their shares at or near $10 in a hurry.
I have no special insight into the success or failure of individual prospects. But I am aware that recent advances in technology have increased the odds of success for oil exploration companies (read about some of those advances here). Perhaps what’s most interesting to me is that I get to share in the economics of 20 large exploration blocks (with likely hundreds of individual exploration targets) while a large, well-capitalized company pays the bills. It’s hard to find a better deal than that in the public markets.
It seems I am not the only investor that finds GULTU “interesting”. Big, well known funds have been quietly buying in size. Just take a look at the top shareholders:

Paulson owns 6% (source)
Leon Cooperman owns 7.3% (source)
Mount Kellett has been buying hand over fist and now owns 16% (source)
FCX owns 27% (source, p 41)

Four investors hold nearly 60% of the stock! At today’s price, investors are paying $680MM for assets that have been assigned an initial value of $400MM (obviously that value is subject to change with exploration success or failure). One successful well and it’s probable that FCX buys you out at $10 in June 2018. Multiple failures and it’s probable that McMoRan continues its work trying to locate that elephant.
In the meantime, GULTU is working on listing their units on the Nasdaq (source).
Special indeed.

I guess I’m wasting my time posting here since it looks like you’ve abandoned this website but GULTU has a successful well going into production: http://finance.yahoo.com/news/freeport-mcmoran-announces-75mmcf-day-163000335.html. 
I’m surprised the stock price keeps going down. I’m assuming we should start seeing monthly distributions.
