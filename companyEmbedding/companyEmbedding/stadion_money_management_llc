Financial Professionals







Our goal is simple:
Help investors protect and grow their serious money.
"Serious money" is the money that absolutely must be there for important life goals like retirement.













At Stadion, we have several deeply held views that govern our products and services:
Investing should feel as easy as sitting on a porch swing on a warm summer day. 
For more than two decades, Stadion has served thousands of investors as they prepare for their financial futures—in ways that we hope are easy to understand and follow. Our down-to-earth approach comes from our southern roots and a company culture based on doing the right thing. It’s a style that resonates with investors who, like us, think investing should be less stressful and less confusing.

























The less money lost during downturns, means less money that must be made up before gains become actual gains.
That’s why all of our strategies are defensively biased. That is, they aim to protect from large losses during down markets.













Investment decisions should be governed by a disciplined process.
The investments that Stadion money managers make are informed by our own data-driven processes. We never invest based on hunches, intuition, or emotion.


















Investment results are best measured in full market cycles.
Some investors may be quick to jump to where they think returns are highest, which could mean short-term gains but a less satisfying experience when markets turn. Instead, we believe investors should look at how an investment performs over a longer period of time—evaluating how it does in up markets, down markets, and everything in between.

Retirement | Stadion























Stadion Retirement









We have found that many employees lack the time and temperament to manage their retirement plans. Some react emotionally to swings in their account balance, while others just sign up and never open a monthly statement. For those who recognize the importance of professional help, there’s Stadion.







Stadion provides active, defensive money management for employer-sponsored retirement plans. This means that employees participating in the plans have the benefit of professional money managers investing their accounts according to what is going on in the markets.



Employees receive:

Professional money management designed to actively manage their retirement accounts based on market conditions
Tools and resources to provide guidance on investing for retirement
Stadion-run, U.S.-based customer service




Employers receive:

A no-cost employee benefit
Increased protection from fiduciary liability when Stadion Managed Accounts are chosen as the QDIA
A QDIA warranty from Stadion provided when Stadion Managed Accounts are chosen as the QDIA
Phone support from dedicated services team—for the life of the relationship



Money management matters
There is one certainty in the financial markets: no matter their current direction, they will eventually change course. Your long term outcome often depends on whether you have in place the means to respond (versus react) to this certainty. 
DALBAR, Inc., a leading financial industry expert for consistent unbiased evaluations, recently released the 21st Annual QAIB Study. The study concluded investor behavior continuously demonstrates the tendency to sell after experiencing losses and reinvest only after the market recovery is well under way. Unfortunately, this often means missing potential opportunities to grow account value. The chart below shows how average equity fund investors have failed to produce returns remotely equal to market gains as measured by the S&P 500 Index from 1995 – 2014.


The importance of our approach
All markets rise and fall, which is why managing risk is the key to Stadion’s defensive money management. We focus on managing money for full market cycles, not just the upside. When markets decline, investors can suffer significant losses, which can heavily impact total investment outcome. That is why we think it’s not only what you gain but also what you keep that matters. Stadion builds portfolios designed to reduce the magnitude of the market’s most devastating losses, because the less you lose, the less you have to make up before you experience true gains.
 
How Stadion Retirement works
For employers
Stadion’s services are available for retirement plans offered through many national 401(k) plan providers. To learn more, contact your financial advisor. Or contact us, and we can put you in touch with a financial advisor who knows about Stadion. Once you’ve selected Stadion, the onboarding process is easy.
For employees
Once your employer chooses Stadion as an investment option in your retirement plan, you are automatically enrolled (with the option to opt out). Our experienced money managers will actively invest your retirement account based on market conditions (and there’s nothing more you need to do).

Reducing Volatility Can Help Maintain Sanity & Account Balances
Would you rather have annual returns of 5% or 10%? Easy choice, isn’t it? Now pair those positive returns with corresponding -5% and -10% returns and choose which return stream you prefer. read more



Model Reading

Stadion’s investment model measures a number of different market conditions on a daily basis, and we make investment decisions based on these readings.
Our current model reading







*Average equity fund investor as calculated using data supplied by the Investment Company Institute. Investor returns are represented by the change in total mutual fund assets after excluding assets after excluding sales, redemptions, and exchanges. This method of calculation captures realized and unrealized capital gains, dividends, interest, trading costs, sales charges, fees, expenses, and any other costs. After calculating investor returns in dollar terms, two percentages are calculated for the period examined: total investor return rate and annualized investor return rate. Total return rate is determined by calculating the investor return dollars as a percentage of the net of the sales, redemptions, and exchanges for the period. Chart source: DALBAR Quantitative Analysis of Investor Behavior (QAIB) 2014 Survey, published in 2015. Chart data may include professionally managed accounts.
The S&P 500 Index is the Standard & Poor’s Composite Index of 500 stocks and is a widely recognized, unmanaged index of common stock prices. It is not possible to invest directly in indexes (like the S&P 500) which are unmanaged and do not incur fees and charges. Past Performance is no guarantee of future results. Investments are subject to risk, and any of Stadion's investment strategies may lose money.

Strategies with a defensive bias.
Stadion’s approach is simple but powerful: Over time, our goal is to capture most of the market's good times and miss most of its bad times. We believe that missing severe market drops is essential to investment success, because the less investors lose during downturns, the less they have to make up before their gains become true gains during a rebound. Making money is important, but protecting that money can be just as important.
We believe our active management strategies set us apart from many investment managers who employ buy-and-hold methodologies. We don't pretend to predict the market—that would be foolish. Rather, our proprietary processes are based on math and discipline. Our data-driven models recommend investment changes based on market conditions, and our money managers make changes to the Stadion portfolios and funds based solely on these indicators.

 Stadion Alternative Income Fund Commentary June 2017

Investment Approach

Why add non-traditional income sources to your portfolio?Fixed rates are at historically low levels. A prolonged period of rising rates can have a negative effect on your portfolio.The Stadion Alternative Income Fund provides two income generating strategies while seeking to limit downside risk.Investment Process:Screen equity universe to build a high quality porfolio of dividend paying securitiesAnalysis blends company fundamentals, sector weights and other criteria, which may include:5 years of maintaining or growing dividentsMarket Cap greater than $1.5 billionSeeks to protect equity holdings with an index collar to reduce volatility and systematic riskOwn a put on the full notional value of the equitiesSell a call to potentially produce positive yield (long put offset) and help finance the putMonthly, reset portfolio risk exposure while seeking monthly premium income, taxed as 60% long term gains and 40% short term gainsThe Fund's proprietary model uses current levels of equity market volatility and current portfolio positioning to determine:Notional amount of the tradeStrike of options to sell for premiumStrike of options to buy as protectionRatio of calls to puts for exposureBuy protection on the full notional amount of sold options to limit potential lossesLow Correlation4/30/15 - 6/30/17On 4/30/15, the Stadion Alternative Income Fund’s investment management team and investment objective changed. The investment objective is described below.1 The graph above shows the growth of $10,000 from 4/30/15 through 6/30/17. A fund’s performance for very short time periods may not be indicative of future performance. The hypothetical example does not represent returns of any particular investment. Graph source: Stadion.Low FeesThe Stadion Alternative Income Fund offers attractive fees when compared to those of the Morningstar Option Writing Category, as well as all Alternative Categories. Fees as of 6/30/17. Ordinary brokerage commissions apply. Stadion Alternative Income Fund Cost: Class I share fees are shown. Morningstar Option Writing Category Average Cost: The average cost of the least expensive share classes (retirement shares were excluded) in the category is shown. If all share classes were taken into consideration, the average cost would have been higher. All Morningstar Alternative Categories Average Cost: represents funds in the categories that are included in the Alternative Global Asset Class. The least expensive share classes (retirement shares were excluded) were taken into consideration. If all share classes were taken into consideration, the average cost would have been higher.The indices shown are defined as follows. Bloomberg Barclays US Aggregate Bond Index is an unmanaged index of prices of U.S. dollar-denominated investment-grade fixed income securities with remaining maturities of one year and longer. The Morningstar Option Writing Category is a benchmark created and published by Morningstar and is defined as “Option writing portfolios aim to generate a significant portion of their returns from the collection of premiums on options contracts sold.” The Barclays U.S. Corporate High Yield Bond Index is a total return performance benchmark for fixed income securities having a maximum quality rating of Ba1 (as determined by Moody’s Investors Service). Unlike the Fund, the Barclays U.S. Corporate High Yield Bond Index is unmanaged, is not available for investment and does not incur expenses. The HFRX Absolute Return Index and the HFRX Market Directional Index provide investors with exposure to two "opposing" classes of hedge funds: those that seek stable performance regardless of market conditions (the "absolute return funds") and those that add value by participating in and betting on market moves (the "directional funds"). The difference between the two classes becomes apparent in various statistics describing performance – absolute return funds tend to be considerably less volatile and correlate less to major market benchmarks than directional funds. The MSCI World ex USA Index captures large and mid cap representation across 22 of 23 Developed Markets (DM) countries, excluding the United States. The S&P 500 Index is a free-float market-capitalization weighted index of 500 of the largest companies in leading industries of the U.S. economy. You cannot invest directly in the Indices. On 4/30/15, the Stadion Alternative Income Fund’s investment management team and investment objective changed. The investment objective is described below.1 The graph above shows the growth of $10,000 from 4/30/15 through 6/30/17. A fund’s performance for very short time periods may not be indicative of future performance. The hypothetical example does not represent returns of any particular investment. Graph source: Stadion.Adviser has contractually agreed to waive a portion of the Fund’s expenses. Without such waivers, the Fund’s yield would have been -1.17%, and total return would have been lower.ETF RiskThere are additional costs and potential risks associated with investing in domestic and international exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Investments in equities, including ETFs, are subject to market risks, sector risks, tracking risks, ETF net asset value and market price risks. Additionally, investors will indirectly bear fees and expenses charged by the underlying ETFs and investment companies in which a Stadion portfolio invests. International investing involves certain risks not usually associated with domestic investing, including currency fluctuation, economic and political volatility, foreign taxation and differences in financial standards.

For periods of less than 1 year, return figures are not annualized and represent cumulative total return.Please review the Investment Performance disclosures that are integral to your investment decision process. The hypothetical examples do not represent the returns of any particular investment. One cannot invest directly in an index.1The investment objective of the Fund: Seek to provide income and absolute portfolio returns, with a secondary emphasis on lower risk and volatility than the U.S. equity markets. Source of chart: StadionALPS/Stadion does not offer tax advice and it is recommended to consult with an accountant, tax advisor and/or lawyer.The Statistics presented are defined as follows. Beta is a measure of systematic risk, or the sensitivity of a manager to movements in the benchmark. A beta of 1 implies that you can expect the movement of a manager’s return series to match that of the benchmark used to measure beta. The Sharpe ratio measures the excess return per unit of deviation, or risk. Correlation is a measure of how investments move in relation to one another. A correlation of 1 means the two asset classes move exactly in line with each other, while a correlation of -1 means they move in the exact opposite direction. Alpha is a risk-adjusted measure of the so-called active return on an investment. Standard Deviation measures the average deviations of a return series from its mean, and is often used as a measure of risk.The indices shown are defined as follows. Long-short portfolios hold sizeable stakes in both long and short positions in equities and related derivatives. Some funds that fall into this category will shift their exposure to long and short positions depending on their macro outlook or the opportunities they uncover through bottom-up research. Some funds may simply hedge long stock positions through exchange traded funds or derivatives. At least 75% of the assets are in equity securities or derivatives. These funds attempt to reduce systematic risk created by factors such as exposures to sectors, market-cap ranges, investment styles, currencies, and/or countries. They try to achieve this by matching short positions within each area against long positions. These strategies are often managed as beta-neutral, dollar-neutral, or sector-neutral. A distinguishing feature of funds in this category is that they typically have low beta exposures (< 0.3 in absolute value) to market indexes such as MSCI World. In attempting to reduce systematic risk, these funds put the emphasis on issue selection, with profits dependent on their ability to sell short and buy long the correct securities. These funds offer investors exposure to several different alternative investment tactics. Funds in this category have a majority of their assets exposed to alternative strategies. An investor’s exposure to different tactics may change slightly over time in response to market movements. Funds in this category include both funds with static allocations to alternative strategies and funds tactically allocating among alternative strategies and asset classes.  The gross short exposure is greater than 20%. You cannot invest directly in the Indices. +Stadion Money Management, LLC (the “Adviser”) has entered into an Expense Limitation Agreement with the Income Fund under which it has contractually agreed to waive Management Fees and to assume other expenses of the Income Fund, if necessary, in an amount that limits annual operating expenses (exclusive of interest, taxes, brokerage commissions, extraordinary expenses, Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses and payments, if any, under a Rule 12b-1 Distribution Plan) of Class A, Class C and Class I shares to not more than 1.15% of the average daily net assets allocable to each Class of the Income Fund.

The Morningstar Rating for funds, or “star rating”, is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history.  Exchange traded funds and open ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.  It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product’s monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance.  The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.  The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-,five-,and 10 year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.  The weights are 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five year rating/40%three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10 year rating/30%five-year rating/20%three year rating for 120 or more months of total returns.  While the 10 year overall rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10 year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. For 1 year performance, the fund ranked in the 95th percentile out of 114 funds. For 3 year performance, the fund ranked in the 60th percentile out of 76 funds. Stadion Alternative Income Fund was rated against the following numbers of Option Writing funds over the following time periods: 76 funds in the last three years. With respect to these Option Income funds, the Stadion Alternative Income Fund received a Morningstar Rating of 3 stars for the three-year period. 3 star overall rating out of 76 Tactical Allocation funds as of 6-30-17.

Investment Approach

Core Equity Fund That Can Become Defensive A Risk Adjusted Approach to Security SelectionHow we manage the fund:ResearchSharpe ratio research is conducted daily on almost 2,000 ETFs. Sharpe ratio, developed by Nobel Laureate William F. Sharpe, has become the industry standard for calculating risk-adjusted return of a portfolio.AnalysisSharpe ratio is a tool to compare risk and return characteristics of different types of ETFs. We identify ETFs with persistently high or growing Sharpe ratios.SelectionAs market conditions and Sharpe ratios change, the fund can reduce or increase equity exposure. A diversified portfolio of 8-15 ETFs is constructed accounting for market volatility and return potential. Fund Quarter-End AllocationsThe Stadion Tactical Growth Fund shifts between domestic equity ETFs, international equity ETFs, and a defensive allocation based on our proprietary Sharpe ratio analysis.Portfolio allocations are a historical reference and no guarantee of how the portfolio will be allocated in the future. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Allocations are subject to change. 1Average quarterly allocation of international and equity ETFs.Investment results are best measured in full market cycles.Since the Last PeakThe Stadion Tactical Growth Fund losses from the 2007 – 2009 global financial crisis were recovered by the Fund by 12/23/09. In comparison, the S&P 500 Index recovery took an additional 2 years, until 4/2/12.Performance data quotes represents past performance. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Please review the Investment Performance disclosures that are integral to your investment decision process. The hypothetical examples do not represent the returns of any particular investment. One cannot invest directly in an index. Diversification does not eliminate the risk of experiencing investment losses. 1BarUS Agg = Bloomberg Barclays US Aggregate Bond Index.ETF RiskThere are additional costs and potential risks associated with investing in domestic and international exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Investments in equities, including ETFs, are subject to market risks, sector risks, tracking risks, ETF net asset value and market price risks. Additionally, investors will indirectly bear fees and expenses charged by the underlying ETFs and investment companies in which a Stadion portfolio invests. International investing involves certain risks not usually associated with domestic investing, including currency fluctuation, economic and political volatility, foreign taxation and differences in financial standards.

Performance data quotes represents past performance. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investments are subject to risk, and any of Stadion’s investment strategies may lose money. Stadion’s actively managed portfolios may underperform in bull markets. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance data may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. To review our most recent monthly performance, please visit www.stadionfunds.com.There is no guarantee that this investment strategy will succeed, the strategy is not an indicator of future performance and investment results may vary. The investment strategy presented is not appropriate for every investor and individual clients should review with their financial advisors the terms and conditions and risk involved with specific products or services. Stadion’s actively managed portfolios may underperform during bull markets.Bloomberg Barclays US Aggregate Bond Index is an unmanaged index of prices of U.S. dollar-denominated investment-grade fixed income securities with remaining maturities of one year and longer. The Morningstar Target Risk Index family is designed to meet the needs of investors who would like to maintain a target level of equity exposure through a portfolio diversified across equities, bonds and inflation-hedged instruments. The Morningstar Moderately Aggressive Target Risk Index seeks approximately 80% global equity exposure. The S&P 500 Index is the Standard & Poor’s Composite Index of 500 stocks and is a widely recognized, unmanaged index of common stock prices. One cannot invest directly in an index.The Statistics presented are defined as follows. Beta is a measure of systematic risk, or the sensitivity of a manager to movements in the benchmark. A beta of 1 implies that you can expect the movement of a manager’s return series to match that of the benchmark used to measure beta. The Sharpe ratio measures the excess return per unit of deviation, or risk. Correlation is a measure of how investments move in relation to one another. A correlation of 1 means the two asset classes move exactly in line with each other, while a correlation of -1 means they move in the exact opposite direction.Investment Risks:Investment in the Fund is subject to investment risks, including, without limitation, market risk, management style risk, risks related to “fund of funds” structure, sector risk, fixed income risk, tracking risk, risks related to ETF net asset value and market price, foreign securities risk, risks related to portfolio turnover and small capitalization companies risk. Since the Fund is a “fund of funds,” an investor will indirectly bear fees and expenses charged by the underlying ETFs and investment companies in which the Fund invests in addition to the Fund’s direct fees and expenses. More information about these risks and other risks can be found in the Fund’s prospectus.© 2017 Morningstar, Inc. All rights reserved. The information contained herein: (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers; (2) may not be copied or distributed; and (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete, or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The Morningstar Rating for funds, or “star rating”, is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history.  Exchange traded funds and open ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.  It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product’s monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance.  The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.  The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-,five-,and 10 year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.  The weights are 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five year rating/40%three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10 year rating/30%five-year rating/20%three year rating for 120 or more months of total returns.  While the 10 year overall rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10 year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. For 1 year performance, the fund ranked in the 14th percentile out of 302 funds. Stadion Tactical Growth Fund was rated against the following numbers of U.S.-domiciled Tactical Allocation funds over the following time periods: 249 funds in the last three years, 176 funds in the last five years, and 66 funds in the last 10 years. With respect to these Tactical Allocation funds, the Stadion Tactical Growth Fund received a Morningstar Rating of 5 stars, 4 stars and 4 stars for the three-, five- and 10-year periods, respectively. 4 star overall rating out of 249 Tactical Allocation funds as of 6-30-17. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Morningstar Rating is for the I share class only; other classes may have different performance characteristics. Prior to March 28, 2014, the Fund was named the Market Opportunity Fund.Click here for a link to the Fund's prospectus.

Five Questions: Will McGough of Stadion Money Management

							Portfolio manager of one of the largest ETF managers tells us what he sees in store for exchange-traded products in 2013.
						


By Andrew Barber





At over $5 billion in assets under management in mutual
    funds and separate accounts, Stadion Money Management is one of
    the largest managers of exchange-traded funds and related
    products. Stadion has quietly grown its business from a
    headquarters in Watkinsville, Georgia, since launching in 1991.
    In June of 2011 private equity firm TA Associates acquired a
    controlling stake in the firm. Institutional Investor
    contributor Andrew Barber recently sat down with Will McGough,
    a portfolio manager at Stadion, to pick his brain about what
    2013 holds for the ETF industry, and how asset management firms
    like his will adapt to the changing landscape.
1. What are some of the big stories that you see
    developing for the ETF market in 2013?
One of the most interesting developments is the Fidelity
    news that they have recently filed for a series of actively
    managed bond and equity ETFs. The proliferation of actively
    managed ETFs had been primarily focused among smaller managers
    at first. If the Fidelitys of the world are willing to let
    everyone see their daily holdings, though, it may be a
    game-changer, signaling more entries by big fund families to
    come. The success of the Pimco Total Return ETF may be causing
    a broad reassessing of business plans. We very much look
    forward to new ways to access different strategies for our
    portfolios through these new offerings.
2. What do you think about the prospects for the
    fixed income ETF market in 2013?
Everyone has been waiting for the bond bubble to pop. Animal
    spirits on the hunt for yield have been crowding certain
    sectors like high yield via the ETF market for a while now. QE4
    was announced the other day and in that announcement the Fed
    further defined limitations on how long they are willing to
    keep the foot on the pedal. People looking for yield need to
    understand the risks that come with it, because eventually the
    bond markets will turn, and when they do, that riskier paper
    will be hit first and hardest.
3. Another popular space in ETFs has been emerging
    markets, both fixed income and equity. What are your
    firms thoughts on allocating there in the coming
    year? 
Weve seen a lot of what the emerging markets have to
    offer in terms of growth prospects and, in some cases, positive
    demographic inflections. The developed world is largely
    following Japans lead with rapidly aging populations and
    economies that are groaning under debt levels of historic
    proportions. With these severe economic drags, the investment
    opportunities in emerging markets could become increasingly
    attractive for tactical shifts away from domestic allocations
    during cyclical bull moves.
4. What about the ETP industry itself? Do you see
    any changes coming for the makeup of the competitive
    landscape?
I dont really see much change in the issuers at the
    higher level. Youll always have the iShares, SPDRs, and
    Vanguards and such. Things are getting tougher for midtier
    players like First Trust, however, and they will have to be
    really focused on developing products that have significant
    demand but are still niche enough to justify higher-than-index
    fee structures. The really small guys will definitely have a
    huge battle ahead trying to capture investor attention in such
    a saturated market.
5. Speaking of fees, do you anticipate further fee
    contraction in the coming year?
Yes, absolutely. Just look at what iShares is doing with
    fees on their core lineup. In the institutional world, where
    fee disclosure is critical, its imperative that
    commoditized beta offerings have lower costs to compete.
    Basically the fee is the tracking error at that stage, given
    equal fund structure and portfolio manager expertise. This
    trend of fee compression for commoditized products can only
    continue as more institutional interest develops for these
    products.
If you think about it, that is really the root cause of
    Vanguards move away from MSCI for their index products.
    Sure, there have been some outflows as investors that need to
    track specific indices go away, but for the most part, the
    expense ratio is of paramount importance to the institutions
    that are becoming an increasing part of this market
    audience.
