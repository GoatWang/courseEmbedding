Value Process



Senior Portfolio Manager Harrison Grodnick explains MPMG’s five-step investment process.


Our process starts with valuations. We look for where the potential bargains are in asset classes, in world markets and especially in individual companies for it is on the proverbial bargain table where we believe that excess market risks may have been already minimized. This means looking for such things as lower Price-to-Sales, Price-to-Cash Flow, Price-to-Book and Price-to-future earnings ratios, among many other factors.
We also attempt to identify where a company’s business risks may be lessened. This means looking for, what we believe are, solid balance sheets, strong assets, modest liabilities, and well-rooted market shares.
That said, even the least expensive company with the strongest balance sheet may be no bargain if that company’s business is in decline. So, we look for growing and needed products and services with managements which we believe are committed to growth, incented to stay, and savvy-enough to strongly build their businesses in a highly competitive world.
Finally, we look for confirmation that our homework is being echoed by other significant investors and that others are awakening to the potential value of these companies so that we won’t be sitting forever alone waiting for our finds to be discovered and rewarded.
Investment Process – Buy

On the sell side, we look for broad awareness of the success of our investments for evidence that a company is reaching its potential and that the final elements of the investing herd feel confident about stepping in.
Investment Process – Sell

Our Philosophy



Senior Portfolio Manager Harrison Grodnick discusses MPMG’s value based philosophy.


We believe that price is everything.
It has been our observation that Wall Street is as much a creature of psychology as it is of economics…that economic conditions, whether global or company-specific, tend to be amplified by the actions of the herd. Stocks – and markets themselves – often move disproportionately to their underlying fundamentals as subtleties of changes in either valuation or growth rates become overrun by masses of buying or selling.
Philosophically, we try to take advantage of this for the benefit of our clients. So, we invest the old-fashioned way – endeavoring to buy low and sell high…by shopping amidst the well-positioned bargains and then, later, selling back to the eager.
Finally, we believe that there will always be promising bargains somewhere. It is our conviction that if one is not constrained by asset class or by nation or by market capitalization, one can most often find something attractive.
The Results
We take a disciplined approach for both individuals and institutions. Allowing us to manage for the longer term, through the various market cycles has resulted in the All Cap Value Composite portfolio beating the S&P 500 index (including reinvestment of dividends) for every year for 10 consecutive years starting in 1999, and for every 10 year period from 1995 through 2013 (all performance is GIPS compliant).

Financial advisors use their knowledge of investments, 
tax laws, and insurance to recommend financial options to individuals.
The SEC typically regulates investment advisers that have assets under management in excess of $25,000,000. Investment advisers that do not meet this threshold generally are regulated by the states. The SEC registers IA firms but does not separately register individual representatives of IA firms. The states register IA firms, and many separately register individual investment adviser representatives.

Currently, you can only search for IA firms on this website. In the future, this website also will provide the ability to search for individual investment adviser representatives.

In 1996 Congress amended the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to require that the SEC establish a readily accessible electronic process to respond to public inquiries about investment advisers and their disciplinary information. The SEC created this website to satisfy Congress? mandate.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for NN (NASDAQ:NNBR) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Hold Rating, 2 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.67)Consensus Price Target: $33.50 (16.32% upside)
