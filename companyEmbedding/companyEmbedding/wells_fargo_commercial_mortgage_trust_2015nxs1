Press Releases
Date of Release: April 27, 2017
DBRS Confirms Ratings of Wells Fargo Commercial Mortgage Trust 2015-NXS1, Stable Trends


April 27, 2017







DBRS Limited (DBRS) has today confirmed all classes of Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2015-NXS1 (the Certificates) issued by Wells Fargo Commercial Mortgage Trust 2015-NXS1 as follows:

-- Class A-1 at AAA (sf) 
-- Class A-2 at AAA (sf) 
-- Class A-3 at AAA (sf) 
-- Class A-4 at AAA (sf) 
-- Class A-5 at AAA (sf) 
-- Class A-SB at AAA (sf) 
-- Class A-S at AAA (sf) 
-- Class X-A at AAA (sf) 
-- Class B at AA (low) (sf) 
-- Class X-B at A (sf) 
-- Class C at A (low) (sf) 
-- Class PEX at A (low) (sf) 
-- Class D at BBB (low) (sf) 
-- Class X-E at BB (sf) 
-- Class E at BB (low) (sf) 
-- Class X-F at B (sf) 
-- Class F at B (low) (sf)

All trends are Stable. 

The rating confirmations reflect the overall stable performance exhibited by the transaction since issuance in 2015. The collateral consists of 68 fixed-rate loans secured by 93 commercial properties. As of the April 2017 remittance, the pool had an aggregate principal balance of approximately $943.0 million, representing a collateral reduction of 1.2% since issuance as a result of scheduled loan amortization.

The pool is primarily concentrated by two property types, as 22 loans, representing 53.0% of the pool, are secured by office properties, and 30 loans, representing 26.8% of the pool, are secured by retail properties. By geographical location, the pool is relatively concentrated, as the largest concentration by state is California with 14 loans (30.1% of the pool), followed by Virginia with one loan (10.1% of the pool), New York with four loans (10.9% of the pool) and Texas with 11 loans (9.9% of the pool). Seven loans (24.9% of the pool) are structured with full interest-only (IO) terms, while an additional 16 loans (34.6% of the pool) have partial IO periods remaining, ranging from 11 month to 36 months.

To date, 48 loans (86.3% of the pool) have reported YE2016 net cash flow (NCF) figures, while 13 loans (10.2% of the pool) have reported partial-year 2016 NCF figures (most being Q3 2016) and seven loans (2.5% of the pool) show YE2015 NCF figures as the most recent set of reported financials. As calculated based on the most recent NCF figures showing for the loans in the pool, the transaction had a weighted-average (WA) amortizing debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and WA debt yield of 1.70 times (x) and 9.3%, respectively, compared with the DBRS issuance figures of 1.55x and 8.0%, respectively. 

Based on the most recent NCF figures (both partial year and YE2016), the top 15 loans (57.4% of the pool) reported a WA amortizing DSCR of 1.80x, compared with the DBRS issuance figure of 1.72x, which is reflective of a WA NCF growth of 7.1%. There are three loans (9.3% of the pool) in the top 15 exhibiting NCF declines as compared with the DBRS issuance figures, with declines ranging from 0.9% to 29.6%. These three loans include 760 & 800 Westchester Avenue (Prospectus ID#7, 3.7% of the pool), 45 Waterview Boulevard (Prospectus ID#9, 2.8% of the pool) and Hotel Valencia (Prospectus ID#10, 2.8% of the pool). While the minor performance declines with the 760 & 800 Westchester Avenue and 45 Waterview Boulevard loans have been driven by increased vacancy and expenses, respectively, Hotel Valencia in San Antonio has struggled to compete with the downturn of the energy markets and the addition of new supply in the market. Detailed commentary for these loans is available on the DBRS IReports platform. 

As of the April 2017 remittance, there are four loans (4.8% of the pool) on the servicers watchlist. The largest of these loans, Colonades II (Prospectus ID#16, 2.1% of the pool) is a single-tenant, Class A office property located in Raleigh, North Carolina. The property was formerly 100% occupied by Salix Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; however, the property is now dark following the tenants acquisition by Valeant Pharmaceuticals in April 2015 and subsequent closure of this location. The smallest two loans (1.8% of the pool) on the servicers watchlist were flagged as a result of a decline in performance, which appear to be market and expense driven. Based on the most recent cash flow reporting (both partial year and YE2016), these two loans had a WA DSCR of 1.03x, compared to the DBRS issuance figure of 1.51x, reflective of a 29.5% NCF decline. 

At issuance, DBRS shadow-rated both the Patriots Park (Prospectus ID#1, 10.1% of the pool) and 45 Waterview Boulevard (Prospectus ID#9, 2.8% of the current pool balance) loans as investment grade. DBRS confirms that the performance of both loans remains consistent with investment-grade loan characteristics.

The rating assigned to Class F materially deviates from a higher rating implied by the large pool multi-borrower parameters. DBRS considers this to be a methodology deviation when there is a rating differential of three or more notches between the assigned rating and the rating implied by the large pool multi-borrower parameters; in this case, the sustainability of loan performance trends was not demonstrated and, as such, was reflected in the ratings.

DBRS has provided updated loan-level commentary and analysis for larger and/or pivotal watchlisted loans, as well as for the largest 15 loans in the pool, in the DBRS commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) IReports platform. Registration is free. To view these and future loan-level updates provided as part of DBRSs ongoing surveillance for this transaction, please register or log in at www.ireports.dbrs.com.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
