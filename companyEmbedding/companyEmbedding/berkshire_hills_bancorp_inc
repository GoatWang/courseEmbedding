I would now like to turn the conference over to Allison O'Rourke. Please go ahead.
Allison O'Rourke

As a reminder, none of today's discussion is intended as proxy solicitation. Our remarks will include forward-looking statements and actual results could differ materially from those statements. For detail on related factors, please see our earnings release and most recent SEC reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q.

References to non-GAAP measures are only provided to assist you in understanding Berkshire's results and performance trends, and should not be relied upon as financial measures of actual results or future projections. A comparison and reconciliation to GAAP measures is included in our news release.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to CEO, Mike Daly. Mike?
Mike Daly
Thank you, Ally. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us this morning for our second quarter call. I'll provide an overview of the quarter and then I'll turn it over to Jamie Moses, our CFO. He'll walk you through some of the specifics in our financials, we'll discuss our outlook, our guidance, and then I'll wrap it up.
So, it was a good quarter for us and we delivered 11% growth in core earnings. We had double-digit annualized loan growth. We had good operating leverage and we improved profitability. We also executed a merger agreement to take us over $10 billion.
We completed an equity offering and we announced our plans to move our headquarters to Boston. So, it's been a busy few months for us, but I really believe that the benefits of a lot of hard work from a cohesive employee base and our previous acquisitions and organic strategies are coming together.
And we boosted our returns this quarter, driving core ROA to 92 basis points and we believe this performance ratio will improve even further in the third quarter.
Annualized loan growth was 13% quarter-over-quarter including 10% annualized commercial growth. This was led by significant gains in C&I and as you know, we've been working hard on driving more C&I growth. We're focusing our teams and hiring new lenders in several markets. So, I'd expect us to continue to see good results there.
On the regional level, we're having success in Central New York where there's a fair amount of economic activity and our relationships continue to grow. We also saw growth in Western Mass and we're seeing a pick up in ABL activity in Eastern Mass in the Mid-Atlantic this year.
Mortgage balances were up for the quarter, including growth in adjustable-rate mortgages as well as our short-term leverage strategy for the new capital and Jamie will touch on that in just a few minutes.
But with a clear path past the $10 billion threshold and additional capital, we do expect to continue to produce solid commercial loan growth for the remainder of the year. Total annualized loan growth is expected to be in the mid-to-high single-digits for the third quarter.

On the deposit side, we had 4% annualized growth in the second quarter and we expect seasonal commercial demand deposits to bounce back in the second half of the year. So, we expect overall annualized deposit growth to be no less than mid-single digits again in the third quarter.
And deposit pricing has so far remained resistant to the move-up in fed funds. Base rates have seen little to no movement in our markets and while pricing on CDs has inched up as the deposits rollover, the betas remain significantly below the rate hikes.
Meanwhile we're going to closely monitor our markets for changes in behavior. Our fee income grew 15% quarter-over-quarter in line with our expectations. The SBA business contributed $2.5 million to that number and mortgage banking fees were up 28%.
We originated $680 million in held for sale mortgages this quarter with new production coming on 75% purchase that's up from 70% in the first quarter. For the third quarter, we expect to see fee income grow in the mid-to-high single digits, led by mortgage fee revenue, further growth in loans fee income and stable wealth management insurance and deposit fees.
As we've noted in the past, some of this revenue will be offset by corresponding expenses, but the overall growth is expected to have a positive effect on earnings.
Now with that, I am going to turn it over to Jamie who'll give you some additional financial detail and then I'll wrap it up, Jamie?
Jamie Moses
Thanks Mike and good morning, everyone. It was another strong quarter for us. We're demonstrating positive operating leverage, improving our profitability and maintaining a strong credit profile while growing the business.
Core EPS was $0.58 for the second quarter and GAAP EPS came in at $0.53 primarily reflecting acquisition activity. Average earning assets grew 2.5%. Our net interest margin was 3.36% for the quarter and 3.24% excluding purchased loan accretion.
The increase in margin this quarter was primarily due to the positive effects of the recent rate hikes, coupled with some outsized prepayment penalties. For the third quarter, we expect the short-term leveraging of a new capital to bring the margin down by about five basis points. I'll touch more on that in a minute.
Purchased loan accretion for the second quarter came in at $2.6 million, $2 million of that attributable to recovery. We expect total purchased loan accretion to remain near this level in the third quarter. The provision was $4.9 million in the second quarter, exceeding net charge-offs.
We don't expect any significant changes to our overall credit or charge-off levels in the third quarter and we anticipate our provision will be in the area of $5 million again. We continue to feel that credit is performing strongly and we are disciplined in managing our credit selection and concentrations.
Moving on to expenses, the 6% increase in operating expense quarter-over-quarter was primarily tied to increased loan production, particularly in mortgage and SBA. The efficiency ratio improved slightly to 61.7%, importantly stripping out the First Choice mortgage business, the bank operated at a 58.7% efficiency in the second quarter.
We expect a low-to-mid single-digit increase in operating expenses in the third quarter, relating to the fee income growth that Mike mentioned earlier. Our core tax rate for the second quarter was 30%, including the benefit of some small tax credit investments.
This is slightly higher than we guided to last quarter as one of the historic tax credit deals we were working slipped into the third quarter. That particular deal has already closed and we expect a couple more deals to close this quarter bringing our core tax rate for Q3 down to the 25% to 27% range with a corresponding charge to noninterest income of approximately $3 million. We still anticipate the 2017 full-year core tax rate to be around 27%.

Looking at the big picture, we expect to deliver $0.58 in core EPS in the third quarter, with only a $0.01 or $0.02 of non-core charges tied to acquisition. Factoring in the additional shares, this would result in a mid to high single-digit increase in core earnings quarter-over-quarter on the heels of the 11% increase in Q2.
We are pleased with our progress this quarter toward our profitability goals. Core ROA improved to 92 basis points and we expect to do at least that well over the next couple of quarters. Core return on tangible equity came in at 12%. Due to non-core charges, GAAP return on assets was 84 basis points for the second quarter and return on equity was 7%.
As a result of our recent capital raise at quarter our tangible equity was 9.2% of tangible assets. We initially used some of the $150 million in proceeds to pay down borrowings and then began the process of leveraging the capital.
As discussed on our May conference call, $100 million of the raise will support the commerce transaction. So, we are intentionally investing in shorter duration assets including CMO's. This strategy impacts our NIM in the short run and factors into our Q3 guidance.
As Mike mentioned, we also added to our mortgage portfolio and we will be increasing our [bully] exposure. The rest of the funds will be used to support commercial growth. The net effect of this strategy is to offset some of the share count drag on our EPS, while continuing to drive ROA North.
We estimate that the diluted share count will average around 40.3 million shares in the third quarter. We are pleased with our performance this quarter and excited about our prospects for delivering solid results for the rest of the year. Our financial condition is good and we expect to continue to make progress on our strategic goals.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Mike.
Mike Daly
Thank you, Jamie. So as Jamie said, we're expecting mid-to-high single-digit growth in core earnings next quarter, but of course with the increased share count, our core EPS is expected to be flat.
Importantly these results would translate into a core ROA in the mid-90s and stable efficiency and for the full year, we continue to anticipate core EPS growth in the 3% to 4% range, which is the equivalent of the high end of our original guidance when you take into account the impact of the recent share issuance.
We also expect stronger loan growth and the core ROA to improve into the 90s for the year. Now this guidance doesn't include the impact from commerce as the expected timing of close is of course still unknown.
Our local regions continue to show signs of optimism and we're looking to capitalize on that while continuing to adhere to our credit disciplines. Now the team at commerce has been terrific to work with and we look forward to solidifying that partnership in the months ahead.
Our strong integration history gives me confidence in our ability to hit the ground running and continue to build on expanded platforms. We're anticipating a great cultural fit and in smooth transition for customers and employees.
I've been spending much of my time in the Boston Area lately, meeting with customers and employees as we thoughtfully build out our present there. I'm pleased with the response we've gotten so far and the relationship we've been able to further develop.
We've also been identifying talent in this market and we're pleased with the reception we're getting in this regard. As you know, it's a competitive market, but also one where we believe we can be effective.
Now let me touch on our preparations for crossing $10 billion. We're comfortable with the work we've done leading up to the commerce acquisition and we've been running internal DFAST ready stress test for two years now and we had anticipated a dry run with regulators next year ahead of our first official filing in 2019.

And as I've said in the past, we've got the people and the systems in place to support our growth well past these asset levels. Over the next several quarters however, we're going to be entirely focused on growing our organic business, closing and integrating our acquisition of Commerce Bank and opening our new headquarters in Boston.
We expect to deliver strong results over this period and that momentum should benefit all of our constituents. And with that, I'm going to open it up to any questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Mark Fitzgibbon of Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.
Mark Fitzgibbon
Hey guys. Good morning.
Mike Daly
Good morning, Mark.
Mark Fitzgibbon
Hey Mark, just to clarify I thought you had said you expected earnings in the third quarter to be $0.57 but then later you said, they would be flat. Did I hear incorrectly because flat would imply $0.58, correct?
Mike Daly
Yes, that's the incorrectly number. I don't know if I said it or you heard it somewhere else, but the $0.58 is the correct number.
Mark Fitzgibbon
Okay. Great. And then how much in tax credit investments do you plan to make in the third quarter and also maybe some sense for fourth quarter expectation?
Jamie Moses
Hey Mark, it's Jamie. We expect that we're going to do a little bit of that in Q3 and Q4 and that's going to bring down the Q3 and Q4 tax rate in the 25% to 27% range or so and we expect than the full-year of core tax rate to be about 27%, which is straight in the middle of the guidance that we had talked about at the start of the year.
Mark Fitzgibbon
Okay. Great. And then Jamie, is it possible you could give us maybe a little more detail on the mortgage banking income line, maybe the approximate gain on sale margins and what the mix of originations look like?
Jamie Moses
Yeah, so the originations came on at I think as Mike said in his script 75% in the purchase category and I guess kind of the way to think about it Mark, we don't -- we don't have this accounting segment broken out here, but I think the way that we're thinking about for you guys is probably in the 30 to 35 basis points range in terms of profitability dropping to the bottom line.
Mark Fitzgibbon
Okay. And then do you have handy by chance the size of your commercial loan pipeline?
Sean Gray
Sure Mark. Sean here, it remained strong, approaching the $150 million mark. I think we've got a good spread amongst all geographies with C&I remaining the focus, but a little bit more balanced growth C&I increase on a go-forward.
Mark Fitzgibbon
Okay. And Sean, I know it's early, but the Boston off Congress Street there, can you share with us any early data on loans and deposits out of that location?
Sean Gray
Yes. Going well. Organically that Boston office in and of itself has driven about $15 million in deposits. We look at this post the Commerce acquisition. We will have four branches in Boston, which will be a great platform.
Within those four branches we'll have about $350 million in collective deposits and the bank in Boston will have close to $2 billion in overall after. So, we feel post commerce, it's a great entry and a great platform to really increase our production in that Boston market.
Mark Fitzgibbon
Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from Laurie Hunsicker of Compass Point. Please go ahead.
Laurie Hunsicker
Hey. Good morning.
Mike Daly
Good morning, Laurie.
Laurie Hunsicker
Just to follow-up on Boston, I guess the marketing expense jump that we saw linked quarter from $2 million to $3.2 million, is that somewhat related to Boston or how should we think about that as you continue to push toward Boston?
Sean Gray
Laurie, Sean here. That had nothing to do with Boston. What that is, is additional marketing related to the additional production we saw in mortgage this quarter. It was within our expectation and within our budget.

Laurie Hunsicker
Okay. And so how should we be thinking about that one going forward?
Mike Daly
Laurie, I think you should think about it in terms of seasonality tied to the mortgage production. So, may be about the same or a little bit higher in Q3 and then dropping down into Q4.
Laurie Hunsicker
Okay. And then as we look at pro forma Boston and pro forma rate now just overlaying Commerce, your $265 million in deposits, the way that I guess I'm screening it for us now. How do we think about that if we fast forward a year or two years? How -- where do you want to see your Boston footprint with respect to your overall franchise value?
Mike Daly
We see that as the area of most right for growth, but one of the things that we see as an advantage to us from an opportunistic perspective is the geographic diversity we have. We're very particular from a profitability and a credit discipline perspective.
So, we'll remain opportunistic rather than pigeonhole ourselves to growth in a particular area, but we do see the contribution from that marketplace to continue to be a major factor on a go-forward.
Laurie Hunsicker
Okay. All right. And then the merger charges of 2.9, that was all related to Commerce, First Choice is completely done, is that correct?
Mike Daly
No. No. It was about two thirds related to commerce and a third related to First Choice. There will be a small pale in Q3 related to First Choice, but not more than a $0.01 or $0.02 in terms of non-core charges in Q3.
Laurie Hunsicker
Okay. I thought you guys had mentioned last quarter that First Choice was all done in merger charges. Was there something else that come up or did I misheard that?
Mike Daly
This is small sale -- there's just a small sale that's left in Q3. We thought it was all going to be finished up in Q2. Some things came in towards the end.
Allison O'Rourke
Laurie, this is Ali, we said that we thought there was about $2 million worth left that we thought would be in Q2. We're going to come in total less that even though there is just a little bit left.
Laurie Hunsicker
Okay. And then with respect to your Commerce, can you update us on your $103 million tax A portfolio?
Jamie Moses
We really can't get into a lot of detail on Commerce right now. The S4 will be out probably in the next several days Laurie and so we're kind of precluded to get into any information on Commerce at this point.
Laurie Hunsicker
Okay. Okay. And then just lastly on Firestone, can you just give us where you are on loan balance, new originations and nonperformers?
Richard Marotta
Yeah Laurie, this is Richard, ended the quarter at about $226 million, which is about 2% growth quarter-over-quarter. Originations were about $30 million for the quarter. NPLs came in at about $1.9 versus the $1.8 million at the end of the first and charge-offs for the quarter were 25 Bps about $140,000 versus the $700,000 in the first quarter.
Laurie Hunsicker
Okay. Thanks.
Mike Daly
Thanks Laurie.

Our next question comes from Collyn Gilbert of KBW. Please go ahead.
Collyn Gilbert
Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
Mike Daly
Hey Collyn.
Collyn Gilbert
Just to go back to a follow-up on some of the questions, can you give me just talk a little bit more about sort of the seasonality that we should be expecting in the mortgage banking business? And I guess part of my question there is your mid-to-high single digit core fee income growth linked quarter seems strong -- really strong especially relatively to what you put up this quarter.
So just trying to frame that as we kind of look out for the rest of the year? How we should be thinking about the volatility there?
Mike Daly
Yeah Collyn, thanks. I think that's a good number for Q3. There is going to be seasonality in that mortgage business. Q3 is going to be the highest in terms of expenses and then we think we should come back down to around the same levels of Q2, in between Q2 and Q1 in terms of expenses in Q4.

That will generally be the pattern of the seasonality in the mortgage business and of course that can be affected obviously by things that happen in the macro markets in terms of interest rates, but I think that's about the right way to think about it.
Allison O'Rourke
From the fee income -- the fee income guide Collyn, I'll also include some seasonality in the SBA business. So that business too has a higher Q2, Q3 and then tailing off a little bit.
Collyn Gilbert
Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then just back to the marketing number, it's a big number, was there something, I know you said it was tied to loan production, but is there also something else that goes on in the second quarter within First Choice's mortgage business that that marketing number is going to be elevated? I am just, it's just a big number to try to reconcile?
Jamie Moses
No, nothing. No Collyn nothing else coming through. Essentially, it's going to be a derivative of volumes, so as a percentage and continue on this path.
Collyn Gilbert
Okay. Okay. And then just on the commercial pipeline Sean, you mentioned the competition, but how about the yields? Where are you guys seeing kind of origination yield relative to portfolio yields?
Sean Gray
We're actually seeing a slightly stronger roll-on than roll-off by low-to-mid single digits in that perspective.
Collyn Gilbert
Okay. And then on the deposit side, the pricing side too, Mike I know you said in your opening comments that despite the fed move, you're not seeing much deposit pricing pressure in the core products. Can you just talk a little bit about the competitive environment as it relates to deposit pricing and maybe Sean how you guys are positioning yourselves kind of going forward as you think about deposit pricing competition?
Mike Daly
Of course, that's the benefit of the regionality of the franchise in the rural markets, but Sean, you may want to give some color on that.
Sean Gray
Yeah, obviously the New Jersey market, Boston market from a macro perspective are more competitive. You do see higher deposit rates. We set our thresholds based on profitability and mix and then mine our entire geography and we're bullish that we will be able to continue to do that and maintain the appropriate cost of deposits on the franchise.
Mike Daly
And Collyn, I'll just one thing to that is that in terms of our base rates across our geography, we're not seeing much of a change to those if any. The changes in rates that we see are tied to time deposits, which I suppose you would expect when rates rise and so -- but we're not seeing betas that are anything approaching historical averages. They're much lower than.
Sean Gray
The larger bank market leaders have remained disciplined to this point, which has helped all of this as well.
Collyn Gilbert
Okay. Okay. That's helpful and then just one final question. You mentioned -- and if you guys talked about last quarter, I apologize, what's the relationship with Costco and I am assuming that acronym was First Choice or whatever the acronym was in the press release?
Sean Gray
Okay. What's the specific question is…
Collyn Gilbert
Oh! I just didn't know what that relationship was cost like what that even was about, like what is that?
Sean Gray
Okay. So, we're the endorsed lender for the Costco relationship from a mortgage perspective. So, we affiliate branding and marketing and we were very happy with it because it really drives our brand on a national level.
Collyn Gilbert
That's right. That's right. Okay. And that was something that First Choice had had before you guys entered into the agreement with them right or is that's a new relationship?
Sean Gray
No, something First Choice has had for a long time, a good long-standing relationship.
Collyn Gilbert
Okay. I'll leave it there. Thanks guys.

Mike Daly
Thanks, Collyn.
Operator
Our next question comes from Matthew Breese of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
Matthew Breese
Just to follow-up on that Costco question, I know when the deal was first announced, that they had, they were with Costco and then Costco did a lot of refi business, but now the competition has switched right, some more purchase versus refi and not I was curious if Costco has moved in kind? Have they moved more towards purchase?
Mike Daly
Yes. The Costco team, our Costco team is based out of California. It's a fantastic team. They have been able to move in kind and mind that purchase activity more. I think that's a derivative of the strength of Costco's membership and the brand loyalty they have that translates over as market conditions translate.
And it's also a testament to the leadership of the overall FCLS team that they built a team with purchase-oriented LOs and will continue to be able to keep that strong pace.
Matthew Breese
And of the overall mortgage banking activities how much stems from Costco.
Mike Daly
Costco still remains under a third of the overall activity. So, we haven't seen no additional jumps in Costco. The blend has remained consistent from the early FCLS days.
Matthew Breese
Okay. And then I just wanted to get a firm handle on the margin this quarter and the outlook for next quarter. So, the 3.36% headline, you had accretive yield. So, the core is 3.24%. How much of the nine-basis point increase was due to prepayment and how much was due to the leverage strategy?
Jamie Moses
So, thanks Matt for the question. There is a nine-basis point increase as you highlighted. A lot of that is due to prepayment, a lot of it is due to just the rate hike activity that we saw, heading into Q2 and then there was a little bit of -- we paid down some borrowings towards the end the quarter based on the leverage strategy that we had.
And I guess I would say from a go-forward standpoint, as we highlighted in the script, we're going to see about a five-basis point decrease in the NIM and that's primarily going to be based on the leverage strategy that we have over the back half of the year.
Matthew Breese
Okay. But that's all inclusively like you're not backing out the prepayment and then applying to their five-basis point decrease.
Jamie Moses
No. That's all inclusive. Our guidance of five basis point is where we think we'll be.
Matthew Breese
Okay. And then do you have any idea of where the blended NIM will shake out once Commerce is completed?
Jamie Moses
We don't have that broken out exactly yet Matt, but we expect it's going to be -- we expect to be pretty flat in terms of NIM.
Matthew Breese
And then the one thing in the press release I noticed was the alliance with Princeton Advisory Group, can you just talk what that is and what the benefits are, the cost, the expenses, just more color.
Sean Gray
Sure Matt. It's Sean here. It's a strategic partnership. So, there's no cost to us, but what we provide is private banking and deposit services for their customers. So, what that did was open up another wealth management book for us to provide our banking and deposit services to help them insulate themselves from some larger institutions that may pirate those customers.
What we get is they supplement our wealth banking offering. They have a professional athlete offering. They have a multitude of different offerings that allows us to build our skill in wealth management in a very practical sense down in New Jersey over time.
So, a great partnership from both ends that really is no cost with strategic upside.
Matthew Breese
Okay. Can we quantify the upside or is it more or less gravy if it works out well?
Sean Gray
I think it'll be gravy as it works out to this point, but I think it then opens up additional partnerships with other organizations over time.

Matthew Breese
Understood. Okay. My question, Mike you noted in your commentary activity Upstate in New York was a little bit better and I was just curious was that a quarterly phenomenon or are you seeing in general better activity in those markets?
Mike Daly
Well, we've said for some time that the chip manufacturing that's going on there would begin to show signs of a real economic activity and at this point this is just a continuance of what we've seen over the last few quarters.
So, there is nothing major that's occurring other than there is the maturity of a market that we've been expecting for some time and the economic activity in that market is positive and it's solid. So, we're taking advantage of it.
Matthew Breese
Understood. That's all I had. Thanks for taking my questions.
Mike Daly
You bet. Thank you.

This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mike Daly for any closing remarks.

    Acquisition, Stock Offering And New Headquarters: What A Quarter For Berkshire  
 Reprints | Print  

                   By 
                  Bram Berkowitz                    | Jul 21, 2017              

 


In an activity-packed quarter that included a major acquisition, a stock offering, the relocation of its headquarters to Boston and the passing of the $10 billion asset threshold, Berkshire Hills Bancorp continued to produce major earnings growth.
The bank reported net income of $19.7 million in the second quarter, up more than 23 percent year-over-year. Core earnings totaled $21.6 million in the second quarter, an increase of 31 percent year-over-year, mainly due to the bank’s expansion.
Earnings per share for net income year-over-year, was up 2 percent to $0.53, while core earnings per share increased 7 percent to $0.58.
“We had a strong second quarter, extending the operating momentum from the first quarter. We also conducted a successful stock offering and completed an agreement to acquire Worcester-based Commerce Bancshares,” Berkshire CEO Michael Daly said in a statement. “These actions support our plan to cross the $10 billion asset threshold and provide the capital resources to accelerate our growth.”
The company raised $153 million in cash after issuing 4.6 million shares.
The recent share issuance, according to Berkshire executives, will keep earnings per share flat at $0.58 next quarter, before expecting to see full year core EPS growth in the range of 3 to 4 percent.
Total assets finished just over $9.6 billion in the second quarter, up from just over $8 billion at this time last year.
For the six months ending June 30, net interest income finished 0ver $136 million, up 18 percent from the same time last year.
Non-interest income for the six months ending June 30 was over $67 million, up from just over $30 million from the same period last year.
“Our net interest income advanced and fee income grew by 15 percent to 32 percent of total revenue [in the second quarter],” Daly said in a statement. “Our strong and diversified revenue sources produced a 42 percent year-over-year increase in total revenue, which now exceeds $400 million on an annualized basis.”
During an earnings conference call, Berkshire executives expressed excitement about the Commerce acquisition, first announced in May, and the relocation of its headquarters to Boston, a market in which the company seeks to accelerate business development.
So far, Berkshire’s first Boston branch, which opened earlier this year on Congress Street in the Seaport, has brought in $15 million in deposits.
Once Berkshire completes the Commerce Bank acquisition, it will have four branches and a headquarters in Boston that Berkshire executives expect will bring in $350 million worth of collective deposits and nearly $2 billion in loans.
Crossing the $10 billion asset threshold will also subject Berkshire to more stringent regulation from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
“The team at Commerce has been terrific to work with,” said Daly, adding that Berkshire has been running stress tests of their own to prepare for CFPB oversight. “They are a great cultural fit and it will be a smooth transition for customers and employees.”
Berkshire executives declined to comment on Commerce’s $103 million commercial taxi medallion portfolio, loans that are of major concern due to the declining value of the medallions, citing pending negotiations.
Berkshire spent $2.9 million on merger, restructuring and other expenses in the second quarter, one-third on its first quarter acquisition of First Choice Bank and two-thirds on the Commerce acquisition.
Net loans at the end of the second quarter were valued over $6.8 billion, up more than $300 million since the end of 2016.
Commercial real estate, commercial and industrial, residential mortgages and consumer loans all increased their position in Berkshire’s portfolio since the end of 2016; residential mortgages, which tend to increase heavily in quarters two and three, were up more than $40 million.

Berkshire Bank's profits grew 23%






Courtesy/Creative Commons/Terageorge
Berkshire Hills Bancorp completed an agreement to acquire Commerce Bank in Worcester.






Following its completion of an agreement to acquire Worcester-based Commerce Bancshares, net income at Berkshire Hills Bancorp, Inc. grew by 23 percent in the second quarter.The bank's net income for the second quarter was $19.7 million, or $0.53 per share. Total assets increased at a 10-percent annualized rate in the first half of the year to $9.6 billion. The bank said it plans to cross the $10-billion asset mark soon.Following its acquisition of Commerce, Berkshire said it planned to move its headquarters to Boston. Total revenue for the quarter was up 42 percent, to $102.3 million from $72 million the year before.Also in the second quarter, the bank formed an alliance with the Princeton Advisory Group, which manages more than $700 million in client investments. Its wealth management group also recruited new talent in Albany, N.Y.Correction: A previous headline of this story called Berkshire Bank the parent company of Commerce Bank, when the proposed acquisition has not yet been completed. In May, Berkshire said the transaction could take six to nine months to close. A clarification has also been added to reflect that Berkshire plans to move its headquarters to Boston.

Berkshire Hills Reports Second-quarter Earnings 
 BusinessWest Staff on July 20, 2017 in Daily News 

PITTSFIELD — Berkshire Hills Bancorp Inc. reported second-quarter 2017 net income of $19.7 million, or $0.53 per share. Core earnings totaled $21.6 million, or $0.58 per share. Net income was up 23% year-over-year, while core earnings grew 31% due to the benefit of business expansion. Net income per share increased by 2%, while core EPS increased by 7%. Net income was impacted by net non-core charges related primarily to acquisitions.
“We had a strong second quarter, extending the operating momentum from the first quarter,” CEO Michael Daly said. “We also conducted a successful stock offering and completed an agreement to acquire Worcester-based Commerce Bancshares. These actions support our plan to cross the $10 billion asset threshold and provide the capital resources to accelerate our growth. Total assets increased at a 10% annualized rate in the first half, reaching $9.6 billion at mid-year. We announced a planned move of our headquarters to Boston and are accelerating our business development in New England’s largest and fastest-growing markets.”
Daly also noted that net interest income advanced and fee income grew by 15% to 32% of total revenue. “Our strong and diversified revenue sources produced a 42% year-over-year increase in total revenue, which now exceeds $400 million on an annualized basis. The resulting positive operating leverage led to the achievement of a profitability milestone, with core return on assets advancing to 92 basis points. GAAP return on assets was 84 basis points after non-core charges primarily related to merger activity.”

Top Company Interviews


        CEO Michael Daly stated, 'We had a strong second quarter, extending the operating momentum from the first quarter.  We also conducted a successful stock offering and completed an agreement to acquire Worcester based Commerce Bancshares.  These actions support our plan to cross the $10 billion asset threshold and provide the capital resources to accelerate our growth.   Total assets increased at a 10% annualized rate in the first half, reaching $9.6 billion at midyear.  We announced a planned move of our headquarters to Boston and are accelerating our business development in New England's largest and fastest growing markets.'
      
      
        Mr. Daly continued, 'Our net interest income advanced and fee income grew by 15% to 32% of total revenue.  Our strong and diversified revenue sources produced a 42% year-over-year increase in total revenue which now exceeds $400 million on an annualized basis.  The resulting positive operating leverage led to the achievement of a profitability milestone, with core return on assets advancing to 92 basis points.  GAAP return on assets was 84 basis points after non-core charges primarily related to merger activity.'
      
      
        Mr. Daly concluded, 'Berkshire is seeing early success in our new Boston branch, bringing our brand of revolutionary banking to this market.  Our Mid-Atlantic team announced a strategic alliance with the Princeton Advisory Group, which manages over $700 million in client investments.   Our Wealth Management group recruited additional talent in Albany, NY.  Berkshire's annual Xtraordinary Day of community service events engaged 92% of our team in completing 65 community projects.  Across our footprint, we are reaching out for new market share and new opportunities to deliver on our franchise promise to all of our constituencies.'
      
      
        DIVIDEND DECLARED
      
      
        The Board of Directors voted to declare a cash dividend of $0.21 per share to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 10, 2017, payable on August 24, 2017.  The dividend equates to a 2.3% annualized yield based on the $35.98 average closing price of Berkshire Hills Bancorp common stock during the quarter.
      
      
        FINANCIAL CONDITION
      
      
        Total assets measured $9.6 billion at June 30, 2017, increasing at a 10% annualized rate in the first half of the year.   The 10% annualized first half loan growth included solid growth in all major loan categories, led by a 13% annualized increase in commercial loans.  Average loan yields improved and included the benefit of recent short term interest rate increases.  Deposit growth was 4% annualized in the most recent quarter.   Additionally, Berkshire issued 4.6 million shares and received $153 million in net cash proceeds from its May common stock offering.  Together with additional borrowings, these sources funded the loan growth as well as a 3% increase in investment securities during the quarter.       
      
      
        At midyear, the ratio of equity/assets increased to 13.2%, from 11.8% at the start of the year.  The ratio of tangible equity/assets increased to 9.2% from 7.6%.  Book value per share increased to $31.37, while tangible book value improved to $20.96 per share.  The ratio of loans/deposits increased to 102%.  The Commerce acquisition is expected to further leverage the recently acquired capital and to also provide new deposit funding sources to improve liquidity and support loan portfolio growth.   Delinquent and non-accruing loans decreased to 0.70% of total loans, and annualized net loan charge-offs remained at 0.20% of average loans during the quarter. 
      
      
        RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
      
      
        The growth in earnings and earnings per share included first year results for the First Choice operations acquired at the end of 2016, along with the full period benefit of other 2016 acquisitions.   Most measures of revenue and expense increased year-over-year due to these business combinations.  Per share earnings included the impact of shares issued as merger consideration and in the stock offering.  Second quarter non-core charges were mostly merger related, including First Choice and Commerce.
      
      
        Compared to the prior quarter, net interest income increased by $2.7 million, or 4%, supported by higher volume and margin expansion.   The net interest margin increased to 3.36% from 3.33%.  Measured before purchased loan accretion, the margin improved to 3.24% from 3.15%.  The margin benefited from increased short term interest rates, higher prepayment penalties, and the first quarter balance sheet restructuring.  The contribution from purchased loan accretion decreased to $2.6 million from $3.7 million.
      
      
        Second quarter fee income increased by $4.4 million, or 15%, including a $3.6 million increase in mortgage banking fees, along with growth in other loan and deposit income.  Mortgage banking revenues increased by 28% over the prior quarter due primarily to seasonally higher volume.  Wealth and insurance revenues declined from seasonally high first quarter levels.
      
      
        Second quarter non-interest expense decreased by $4.8 million, or 6%, compared to the prior quarter due to the restructuring charges and First Choice integration costs recorded in the first quarter.  Core non-interest expense increased by $4.0 million, or 6%, primarily due to seasonal mortgage volume growth.  The efficiency ratio remained unchanged at 62%.  Full time equivalent staff totaled 1,756 positions at midyear, compared to 1,731 at the start of the year.   The effective GAAP income tax rate was 29% and the core income tax rate was 30% in the most recent quarter.

        FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS
      
      
        This document contains forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. There are several factors that could cause actual results to differ significantly from expectations described in the forward-looking statements. For a discussion of such factors, please see Berkshire's most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. Berkshire does not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements.
      
      
        ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND WHERE TO FIND IT
      
      
        In connection with the proposed merger, Berkshire will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') a Registration Statement on Form S-4 that will include a Proxy Statement of Commerce and a Prospectus of Berkshire, as well as other relevant documents concerning the proposed merger. Investors and stockholders are urged to read the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus regarding the proposed merger when it becomes available and any other relevant documents filed with the SEC, as well as any amendments or supplements to those documents, because they will contain important information. A free copy of the Registration Statement and Proxy Statement/Prospectus, as well as other filings containing information about Berkshire and Commerce, when they become available, may be obtained at the SEC's Internet site (www.sec.gov). Copies of the Registration Statement and Proxy Statement/Prospectus (when they become available) and the filings that will be incorporated by reference therein may also be obtained, free of charge, from Berkshire's website at ir.berkshirebank.com or by contacting Berkshire Investor Relations at 413-236-3149 or William Burke at Commerce at 508-797-6996.
      
      
        PARTICIPANTS IN SOLICITATION
      
      
        Berkshire and Commerce and certain of their respective directors and executive officers may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies from the stockholders of Commerce in connection with the proposed merger. Information about the directors and executive officers of Berkshire is set forth in the proxy statement for Berkshire's 2017 annual meeting of stockholders, as filed with the SEC on a Schedule 14A on April 7, 2017. Information about the directors and executive officers of Commerce will be set forth in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Additional information regarding the interests of those participants and other persons who may be deemed participants in the transaction and a description of their direct and indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, may be obtained by reading the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and other relevant documents regarding the proposed merger to be filed with the SEC (when they become available). Free copies of these documents may be obtained as described in the preceding paragraph.
      
      
        NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
      
      
        This document contains certain non-GAAP financial measures in addition to results presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ('GAAP').  These non-GAAP measures provide supplemental perspectives on operating results, performance trends, and financial condition.  They are not a substitute for GAAP measures; they should be read and used in conjunction with the Company's GAAP financial information.  A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures is included on page F-9 in the accompanying financial tables.  In all cases, it should be understood that non-GAAP per share measures do not depict amounts that accrue directly to the benefit of shareholders. 
      
      
        The Company utilizes the non-GAAP measure of core earnings in evaluating operating trends, including components for core revenue and expense.  These measures exclude items which the Company does not view as related to its normalized operations.  These items primarily include securities gains/losses, merger costs, and restructuring costs.  Charges related to merger and acquisition activity consist primarily of severance/benefit related expenses, contract termination costs, systems conversion costs, variable compensation expenses, and professional fees.  These charges are related to the following business combinations: First Choice Bank, 44 Business Capital, financial planning assets, and Commerce.  Restructuring costs generally consist of costs and losses associated with the disposition of assets and liabilities and lease terminations, including costs related to branch sales.  Additionally, the Company recorded charges for hedge terminations in the first quarter of 2017 and legal settlement costs in the second quarter of 2017. 
      
      
        Non-core adjustments are presented net of an adjustment for income tax expense.  This adjustment is determined as the difference between the GAAP tax rate and the effective tax rate applicable to core income.  The efficiency ratio is adjusted for non-core revenue and expense items and for tax preference items.  The Company also calculates measures related to tangible equity, which adjust equity (and assets where applicable) to exclude intangible assets due to the importance of these measures to the investment community.  Of note, following systems upgrades, non-material revisions were made in the first quarter of 2017 to the calculations of the net interest margin and efficiency ratio and prior period measures were revised to include these changes.

PITTSFIELD, Mass. (AP) _ Berkshire Hills Bancorp Inc. (BHLB) on Wednesday reported second-quarter earnings of $19.7 million.
On a per-share basis, the Pittsfield, Massachusetts-based company said it had profit of 53 cents. Earnings, adjusted for costs related to mergers and acquisitions, were 58 cents per share.

This Stock Has A 3.05% Yield, Sells For Less Than Book, and Insiders Have Been Buying
In this series, we look through the most recent Dividend Channel ''DividendRank'' report, and then we cherry pick only those companies that have experienced insider buying within the past six months.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
