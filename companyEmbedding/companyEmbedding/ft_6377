                    Anacortes is a popular destination for boaters and those traveling on to the San Juan Islands. The city maintains a 220-acre city park on the northwestern end of Fidalgo Island named Washington Park. This park features camping, boat launching, and majestic views of the San Juan Islands. The most prominent view is of Cypress Island. As a result of Anacortes proximity to the Strait of Juan de Fuca, the area provides opportunities for whale-watching. The waters off of Anacortes and Fidalgo Island offer numerous varieties of marine-life, including three resident Orca pods.
