I really enjoy the work and the schedule.ConsDowntown Austin area is very congested.

Generally positive teamwork. There are many smart, dedicated employees who care about the work they do and the people they serve. Terrific place to work if you want to do challenging work and still have a family life, especially for investments and legal staff who are used to 60 hours a week in the private sector. Pay is not comparable but a pension is a huge benefit, and investments staff qualify for incentive compensation.ConsJust enough resources for basic operational priorities but no more. Takes years for tech projects to get done, after which they are immediately obsolete. Most resources go toward the Investments division, even though the agency also manages a $3 billion dollar health plan and many other programs. A flat organization means little room for advancement. Regarding hiring and promotions practices, there is a strong perception that buddies and brown nosing matter more than skills and experience.Advice to ManagementToo much focus on day-to-day emergencies means that opportunities to innovate or add value to programs are being missed. Invest in new ideas, and when new projects come on line, make sure resources are available to properly implement. Give managers and staff the breathing room to do outstanding work. Provide more opportunities for advancement for your best employees. It's okay to hire or promote people with political connections, but make sure they have the skills required for the job.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Employees Retirement System of Texas Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Employees Retirement System of Texas 2017-07-18 13:08 PDT Join the Employees Retirement System of Texas team See Our Latest Jobs Apr 6, 2017"State Agency = Politics Rule"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Anonymous Employee in Austin, TXFormer Employee - Anonymous Employee in Austin, TXDoesn't RecommendNegative OutlookDisapproves of CEOI worked at Employees Retirement System of Texas full-timeProsOffer continuing education, flexible schedule, easy to use vacation time, lots of state holidays off.

 Benefits and Retirement
Benefits
University of Houston faculty and staff benefit from a comprehensive choice of insurance plans including medical, vision, dental, life, accident, short-term disability, long-term disability, and short-term disability, and flexible spending accounts.  Medical coverage is provided through Employees Retirement System of Texas (ERS) at no cost to full-time benefits eligible faculty and staff.  Dependent medical coverage and other insurance coverage is available at attractive rates. Dependent eligibility is subject to an audit by ERS or their designee.
Link to ERS: http://www.ers.state.tx.us/  
Benefits Eligibility
Faculty and staff who work 20 hours or more per week for a period of 4.5 months or longer in a fiscal year (September through August) are eligible for some benefits, while other benefits are available to employees with 12 month appointments or who work an average of at least 30 hours per week.
Benefits Elections
After meeting with the Benefits/HRMS Manager (located in the Human Resources office) to review the benefits package, an employee has 30 days from the date of hire/benefits eligibility to elect optional benefits such as dental, vision, or life insurance. An employee has 60 days to select a medical insurance plan and add dependents, otherwise their medical benefits will default to Health Select insurance for self only. These election windows are regardless of any state or university holidays, or university closures. It is the employee's responsibility to learn about their benefits options and make elections in a timely manner.
Changes to benefits can be made outside the 30-day window during annual summer enrollment, which is typically in late July. One can also make benefits changes if one experiences a qualifying life event (QLE). A QLE can be marriage, divorce, the birth or adoption of a child, or a married partner gaining or losing insurance through their own employer. Please contact the Benefits/HRMS Manager if you have questions about what types of events are considered a QLE for benefits purposes.
Optional Benefits
The University of Houston System is partnering with Aflac and Trust Mark to sponsor several optional benefits plans for System benefits-eligible employees through payroll deduction. These supplemental benefits are in addition to the benefits currently offered by the Employees Retirement System of Texas; however, the cost of each product will be the employee's sole responsibility and will not be supplemented in any way by the university or System. In addition, these supplemental benefits will be available for coverage of domestic partners.
Aflac
The products being offered by Aflac are Accident, Cancer, Critical Illness and Hospital Protection plans.
To speak with an Aflac representative, call (713) 226-9690, or email: www.aflact.com/universityofhouston
Trust Mark
Trust Mark offers Universal Life insurance plans and Long-Term Care plans.
To speak with a Trust Mark representative, call (832) 251-5435 or go to the Trust Mark website for the most current information.
Retirement
All regular, benefits-eligible employees are required by state law to participate in one of two retirement programs offered by the university: Teacher Retirement System of Texas (TRS) or Optional Retirement Program (ORP). In addition to these two programs, all benefits-eligible employees may participate in one or both of our voluntary savings options: Tax Deferred Annuity (TDA) and Deferred Compensation.
Teacher Retirement System of Texas (TRS)
Participation in the Teacher Retirement System is open to all benefits-eligible employees of the university. Rights to benefits are vested upon completion of 5 years of creditable service. Currently employees contribute 7.7% of their gross salary monthly and the state contributes 6.8% of the employee's gross salary to a state account to pay retirement benefits. Employees earn interest at a rate of 2% annually on their account balance.
The Optional Retirement Program (ORP)
Optional retirement plans are available to full-time (100 percent FTE) benefits-eligible faculty members and certain professional administrative staff under the provisions of State law. Employees may obtain a list of approved companies and their representatives from the Human Resources Department. It is the employee's responsibility to select a company in which to invest their retirement contributions. All benefits eligible employees will automatically be enrolled in the TRS plan and have 90 days from his/her official hire date to elect the ORP plan in lieu of TRS.
Retirement at Work
The Retirement at Work (RAW) online portal is a one-stop shop for managing your retirement savings (with the exception of Teachers Retirement System).  The RAW portal brings together information from all your investment providers in one spot to give you a more complete picture of your retirement savings.  Already an ORP participant and/or have an additional 403(b)?  You can review and update your contribution amount and investment choices, and take advantage of calculators and other tools to help plan for the type of retirement you want.  Not an ORP participant but would like to start putting more money aside for retirement? Use the RAW portal to enroll in a 403(b) and get started today.
Retirement at Work
UHS Retirement at work guide
Tax Deferred Annuity (TDA) or Supplemental Retirement Annuity (SRA)
The tax deferred annuity program or supplemental retirement annuity is offered to all benefits eligible employees. Investments are through life insurance companies and mutual fund companies licensed to do business in the State of Texas. All contributions are excluded from taxable income until distributed from the account to the employee.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
