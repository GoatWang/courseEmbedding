SUPPLEMENTAL
INDENTURE

Supplemental Indenture (this “
Supplemental Indenture ”), dated as of
October 11, 2012, among Flik, Inc., a Delaware corporation,
EPT Gulf Pointe, Inc., a Delaware corporation, EPT Mesquite, Inc.,
a Delaware corporation, EPT Barrington South, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (each, a “ Guaranteeing Subsidiary ”
and, collectively, the “ Guaranteeing Subsidiaries
”), Entertainment Properties Trust, a Maryland real estate
investment trust (the “ Issuer ”), the other
Guarantors (as defined in the Indenture referred to below) and UMB

“ Trustee ”).

W I T N E S S E T
H

WHEREAS, the Issuer has heretofore
executed and delivered to the Trustee an indenture, dated as of
June 30, 2010, as supplemented by a supplemental indenture
dated as of October 13, 2011 (as so supplemented, the “
Indenture ”), providing for the issuance of 7.750%
Senior Notes due 2020 (the “ Notes
”);

WHEREAS, the Indenture provides that
under certain circumstances the Guaranteeing Subsidiaries shall
execute and deliver to the Trustee a supplemental indenture
pursuant to which the Guaranteeing Subsidiaries shall
unconditionally guarantee all of the Issuer’s Obligations (as
defined in the Indenture) under the Notes and the Indenture on the
terms and conditions set forth herein (the “ Notes
Guarantee ”); and

WHEREAS, pursuant to
Section 9.01 of the Indenture, the Trustee is authorized to
execute and deliver this Supplemental Indenture.

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of
the foregoing and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the Guaranteeing
Subsidiaries and the Trustee mutually covenant and agree for the
equal and ratable benefit of the Holders of the Notes as
follows:

1. Capitalized Terms .
Capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the
meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.

2. Agreement to Guarantee .
The Guaranteeing Subsidiaries hereby agree as follows:

(a) Subject to Article 10 of the
Indenture, the Guaranteeing Subsidiaries hereby, jointly and
severally with all other Guarantors, unconditionally guarantee to
each Holder of a Note authenticated and delivered by the Trustee
and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns, irrespective of
the validity and enforceability of the Indenture, the Notes or the
obligations of the Issuer hereunder or thereunder, that:

(i) the principal of, and premium,
if any, and interest on the Notes will be promptly paid in full
when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, redemption or
otherwise, and interest on the overdue principal of and interest on
the Notes, if any, if lawful, and all other obligations of the
Issuer to the Holders or the Trustee hereunder or thereunder will
be promptly paid in full or performed, all in accordance with the
terms hereof and thereof; and



(ii) in case of any extension of
time of payment or renewal of any Notes or any of such other
obligations, that same will be promptly paid in full when due or
performed in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal,
whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or
otherwise.

Failing payment when due of any
amount so guaranteed or any performance so guaranteed for whatever
reason, the Guarantors shall be jointly and severally obligated to
pay the same immediately.

(b) The obligations hereunder shall
be unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or
enforceability of the Notes or the Indenture, the absence of any
action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any Holder of
the Notes with respect to any provisions hereof or thereof, the
recovery of any judgment against the Issuer, any action to enforce
the same or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute
a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a Guarantor, other
than payment in full of all Obligations under the Notes.

(c) The following is hereby waived:
diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a
court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Issuer, any
right to require a proceeding first against the Issuer, protest,
notice and all demands whatsoever.

(d) This Notes Guarantee shall not
be discharged except by complete performance of the obligations
contained in the Notes and the Indenture, and each Guaranteeing
Subsidiary accepts all obligations of a Guarantor under the
Indenture.

(e) If any Holder or the Trustee is
required by any court or otherwise to return to the Issuer, the
Guarantors, or any custodian, trustee, liquidator or other similar
official acting in relation to either the Issuer or the Guarantors,
any amount paid by either to the Trustee or such Holder, this Notes
Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged, shall be
reinstated in full force and effect.

(f) The Guaranteeing Subsidiaries
shall not be entitled to any right of subrogation in relation to
the Holders in respect of any obligations guaranteed hereby until
payment in full of all obligations guaranteed hereby.

(g) As between the Guarantors, on
the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand,
(x) the maturity of the obligations guaranteed hereby may be
accelerated as provided in Article 6 of the Indenture for the
purposes of this Notes Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay,
injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in
respect of the obligations guaranteed hereby, and (y) in the
event of any declaration of acceleration of such obligations as
provided in Article 6 of the Indenture, such obligations (whether
or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by
the Guarantors for the purpose of this Notes Guarantee.

(h) The Guarantors shall have the
right to seek contribution from any nonpaying Guarantor so long as
the exercise of such right does not impair the rights of the
Holders under this Notes Guarantee.

(i) In accordance with
Section 10.02 of the Indenture, after giving effect to any
maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities that
are relevant under any applicable Bankruptcy Law or fraudulent
conveyance law, and after giving effect to any collections from,
rights to receive contribution from or payments made by or on
behalf of any other Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such
other Guarantor under Article 10 of the Indenture, this Notes
Guarantee shall be limited to the maximum amount permissible such
that the obligations of such Guarantor under this Notes Guarantee
will not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.

3. Guaranteeing Subsidiaries may
Consolidate, etc., on Certain Terms .

(a) No Guaranteeing Subsidiary may
sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets
to, or consolidate with or merge with or into (whether or not such
Guaranteeing Subsidiary is the surviving Person) another Person,
other than the Issuer or another Guarantor unless:

(i) immediately after giving effect
to such transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists;
and

(ii) subject to Section 10.05
of the Indenture, the Person acquiring the property in any such
sale or disposition or the Person formed by or surviving any such
consolidation or merger assumes all of the obligations of such
Guaranteeing Subsidiary under the Indenture and this Notes
Guarantee pursuant to a supplemental indenture in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee.

(b) In case of any such
consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance and upon the assumption
by the successor Person, by supplemental indenture, executed and
delivered to the Trustee and satisfactory in form to the Trustee,
of this Notes Guarantee endorsed upon the Notes and the due and
punctual performance of all of the covenants and conditions of the
Indenture to be performed by the Guaranteeing Subsidiary, such
successor Person shall succeed to and be substituted for the
Guaranteeing Subsidiary with the same effect as if it had been
named herein as a Guaranteeing Subsidiary. Such successor Person
thereupon may cause to be signed any or all of the Notes Guarantees
to be endorsed upon all of the Notes issuable under the Indenture
which theretofore shall not have been signed by the Issuer and
delivered to the Trustee. All the Notes Guarantees so issued shall
in all respects have the same legal rank and benefit under the
Indenture as the Notes Guarantees theretofore and thereafter issued
in accordance with the terms of the Indenture as though all of such
Notes Guarantees had been issued at the date of the execution
hereof.

(c) Except as set forth in Articles
4 and 5 and Section 10.04 of the Indenture, and
notwithstanding clauses (a) and (b) above, nothing
contained in the Indenture or in any of the Notes shall prevent any
consolidation or merger of a Guaranteeing Subsidiary with or into
the Issuer or another Guarantor, or shall prevent any sale or
conveyance of the property of a Guaranteeing Subsidiary as an
entirety or substantially as an entirety to the Issuer or another
Guarantor.

4. Releases .

(a) The Notes Guarantee of a
Guaranteeing Subsidiary shall be released, and any Person acquiring
assets (including by way of merger or consolidation) or Capital
Stock of a Guaranteeing Subsidiary under those circumstances
specified in Section 10.05 of the Indenture shall not be
required to assume the obligations of such Guaranteeing Subsidiary.
Upon delivery by the Issuer to the Trustee of an Officers’
Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that the provisions
of Section 10.05 of the Indenture have been complied with, the
Trustee shall execute any documents reasonably required in order to
evidence the release of such Guaranteeing Subsidiary from its
obligations under this Notes Guarantee.

(b) Any Guarantor not released from
its obligations under its Notes Guarantee shall remain liable for
the full amount of principal of and interest on the Notes and for
the other obligations of any Guarantor under the Indenture as
provided in Article 10 of the Indenture.

Guarantors shall have the right to seek contribution from any
nonpaying Guarantor so long as the exercise of such right does not
impair the rights of the Holders under this Notes
Guarantee.
