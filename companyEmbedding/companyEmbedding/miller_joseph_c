Item Description: ReInk Books, 2017. Softcover. Book Condition: NEW. Reprinted from 1911 edition. Language: English. NO changes have been made to the original text. This is NOT a retyped or an ocr'd reprint. Illustrations, Index, if any, are included in black and white. Each page is checked manually before printing. As this reprint is from very old book, there could be some missing or flawed pages, but we always try to make the book as complete as possible. Fold-outs, if any, are not part of the book. If the original book was published in multiple volumes then this reprint is of only one volume, not the whole set. This paperback book is SEWN, where the book block is actually sewn (smythe sewn/section sewn) with thread before binding which results in a more durable type of paperback binding. It can also be open wide. The pages will not fall out and will be around for a lot longer than normal paperbacks. This print on demand book is printed on high quality acid-free paper. Original Publisher: J. Wiley 85 pages.  Bookseller Inventory # 451619228

Item Description: ReInk Books, 2017. Hardcover. Book Condition: NEW. Reprinted from 1911 edition. Language: English. NO changes have been made to the original text. This is NOT a retyped or an ocr'd reprint. Illustrations, Index, if any, are included in black and white. Each page is checked manually before printing. As this reprint is from very old book, there could be some missing or flawed pages, but we always try to make the book as complete as possible. Fold-outs, if any, are not part of the book. If the original book was published in multiple volumes then this reprint is of only one volume, not the whole set. This hardcover book is SEWN, where the book block is actually sewn (smythe sewn/section sewn) with thread before binding which results in a more durable type of hardcover binding. It can also be open wide. The pages will not fall out and will be around for a lot longer than normal hardcovers. This book is printed on demand on acid-free paper. Original Publisher: J. Wiley 85 pages.  Bookseller Inventory # HB451619228

Welcome
Miller R/C Products offers precision-engineered starting products for model airplanes, helicopters and boats.  Miller R/C is known world-wide for outstanding performance and enduring quality. 

For more than 30 years Miller R/C Products has been the answer to starting problems for thousands of demanding hobbyists around the world.
          
The outstanding performance of our starting inserts is the foundation of our success. Our inserts will not mar or damage your nose cones and will last 100 times longer than any other insert worldwide. 

Our Persuader Belt Reduction units are designed to start those big cubic inch engines. Big Grip starting cup and insert is engineered for larger nose cones (for the hobbyist to build their own starter or adapt to your purchased starter). Our ½ A Starter is used to start those small engines like .049, .051, and .09. Helicopter extension inserts and mounting back rubber inserts are available to fit different starters and different helicopter extensions. Miller R/C Products also has many miscellaneous inserts and products that have been developed through the years. 
If what you need is not available from Miller R/C Products, chances are we can custom-make it for you. See your favorite hobby dealer or contact Hap and Nancy Miller direct.            
We invite you to see for yourself what sets us apart.
