		We know that life is better together and everyone is happiest when they’re with family, whether it’s immediate family, extended family, or a family of friends.  That’s why we treat everyone who walks through our doors like part of our family, sharing the food we love with the people we love, and spending the time we have, together.
      





















Where Great Food and Great Friends Come Together

			Since its founding in Orlando in 1982, Olive Garden has been dedicated to providing a warm and welcoming dining experience to everyone who walks in the door. These principles combined with its delicious food led to rapid expansion until it was the largest chain of Italian themed restaurants in the nation. 
          
Inspired by Italian generosity and food made with love, Olive Garden’s menu is always changing and expanding to ensure that there is always a new dish to try, a new flavor to discover. From exciting new specials and classic Italian favorites to a full menu of appetizers, desserts, wines, gluten-free and new lighter fare options, there’s something delicious for everyone at Olive Garden.

Olive Garden is Community

				Every day, in every Olive Garden location across the country, team members spend extra time to prepare, package, freeze and store unserved, surplus food for donation to local food banks, shelters and other charitable organizations.  Last year, those restaurants donated three million pounds of wholesome and ready-to-eat food.  Since 2003, Olive Garden has donated 33 million pounds of food to help those in need.

What's Good Now.






















The Best of Each Season.
Straight to Your Table.

			Seasons 52 is a fresh grill and wine bar that offers a seasonal menu inspired by the fresh appeal of a farmer’s market and what’s good now. We use ingredients at their peak and rustic cooking techniques, like brick-oven roasting and open fire grilling over oak and mesquite, which bring out the natural flavors of food.
          
Our menu is paired with an ever-changing collection of more than 100 wines, with 52 available by the glass, along with exceptional signature handcrafted cocktails. Enjoy music and laughter in our vibrant wine bar. Or host a group at our Chef’s Table or in a private dining room.
There’s always something new to discover at Seasons 52.

Product Overview

                        Jane McCrea, a 25-year veteran of nursing management with a history of nursing-leadership roles and significant work experience, was eager to apply her newly acquired knowledge of the Six Sigma improvement methodology to the Emergency Department (ED) Wait Time project at Academic Medical Hospital (AMH). The ED Wait Time project was one of the first Six Sigma improvement projects undertaken at AMH, which were being led by Black Belts like McCrea. In this short case, the student must develop some proposed action plans regarding the project. This case should be used with the three-case series "Six Sigma at Academic Medical Hospital" (UVA-OM-1058, UVA-OM-1078, and UVA-OM-1079).
