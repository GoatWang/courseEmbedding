The medical device industry is highly competitive, subject to rapid
technological change and significantly affected by new product introductions and
market activities of other participants. Therefore, our currently marketed
products are, and future products we commercialize will be, subject to
competition. Almost all of our competitors have greater financial capabilities
and name recognition then we do. There is no direct and indirect competitor on
genome repair technology in the market so far.


Company Description
Amchi Gendynamy Science Corporation is an early-stage development company using
a special designed message machine along with acoustic wave to replace medicine
and insulin to help diabetes patients to recovery from high blood sugar and
medicine side effect. In China, Amchi is one of a few companies


 in the field of
developing a physical method to treat Diabetes, utilizing electrical frequencies
and special acoustic waves, which the founder of the Company has devoted many
years in researching this Chinese traditional sound wave treatment. The Company
has been working to determine what is the right multiple frequency, and how this
frequency works on Diabetes to lower blood sugar. The theory behind this is that
we believe certain frequency with the right fore trajectory message through the
spinal cord can build on the right energy field of the body to help certain 
acoustic waves to penetrate to the cell level to stimulate the insulin secretion
and enhancement of the sugar metabolism in order to lower the blood sugar level.
The Company has completed several therapy sessions with individuals in China
with some success in rehabilitating and in the prevention of various Diabetes, 
and to replace insulin and medicine to lower the blood sugar. Preliminary
clinical results have shown that it has effectiveness. The Company is planning
to do more case studies on Diabetes in China and the United States. Those case 
reports may not be as effective as the Company may expect. If the case reports
are as Company expect, the Company intends to raise capital to get relative
prove for commercialize the products. The therapy protocol and its energy 
treatment will be proved by the scientific and medical communities by the
reports of the case studies. The Company is looking for a partner to join it for
diabetes dynamic pathophysiology studies at the end of 2016. The Company’s 
research is in its early stages and there is no assurance that its therapy 
protocol or its energy devices will ever be able to be proved and accepted by
the scientific and medical communities.  

Furthermore, the Company, as of this date, has not published any peer reviewed
studies or articles, nor has it conducted any clinical trials or studies that
have received approval in any country where approval of this therapy will be
sought, or have we received any regulatory approvals for the commercialization
of our products. 

The Company was incorporated in the State of Delaware in May 20, 2014, and was
formerly known as Pretty Valley Acquisition Corporation.

EXPLANATORY
NOTE

  

The
purpose of this Amendment to Form 10-Q (“Amendment”) is
to amend our initial filing of a Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for
the quarterly period ended March 31, 2016, filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on May 16, 2016 (the
“Initial Filing”), to reclassify $60,445 of Deposits
previously categorized in the Statement of Cash Flows for the three
months ended March 31, 2016 (Unaudited) in the Cash Flows From
Operating Activities, to the Cash Flows From Financing Activities.
This change also resulted in increase in general and administrative
expenses by $45 to $46,216 and increase in a net loss to $46,191
for the three months ended March 31, 2016 (Unaudited). In addition,
we revised Item IV “Controls and Procedures” section.
Except with respect to the changes in the financial statements
described above, and corresponding changes to the
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations section of this report, and revising Item
IV - Controls and Procedures, the Initial Filing has not been
amended, updated or otherwise modified.

 

Unless
specified, the disclosures provided in this report have not been
updated for more current information. Therefore, this Amendment
should be read in conjunction with our other filings made with the
Securities and Exchange Commission subsequent to the date of the
Initial Filing.

 

CAUTIONARY
STATEMENT

 

All
statements included or incorporated by reference in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q /A, other than statements or
characterizations of historical fact, are forward-looking
statements. Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are
not limited to, statements concerning projected net sales, costs
and expenses and gross profit margins; our accounting estimates,
assumptions and judgments; the demand for our products; the
competitive nature of and anticipated growth in our industries; and
our prospective needs for additional capital. These forward-looking
statements are based on our current expectations, estimates,
approximations and projections about our industries and business,
management’s beliefs, and certain assumptions made by us, all
of which are subject to change. Forward-looking statements can
often be identified by words such as “anticipates,”
“expects,” “intends,” “plans,”
“predicts,” “believes,”
“seeks,” “estimates,” “may,”
“will,” “should,” “would,”
“could,” “potential,”
“continue,” “ongoing,” similar expressions,
and variations or negatives of these words. These statements are
not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks,
uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict.
Therefore, our actual results could differ materially and adversely
from those expressed in any forward-looking statements as a result
of various factors, some of which are listed under “Risk
Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2015 and in Item 1A of Part II of this report.
These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this
report. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any
forward-looking statement for any reason, except as otherwise
required by law.

Amchi
Gendynamy Science Corporation 

Notes to
Financial Statements

For the
Three Months Ended March
31, 201 6 and 2015

(Unaudited)

 

 

NOTE 1
– NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND GOING CONCERN

 

As used
herein and except as otherwise noted, the term
“Company”, “it(s)”, “our”,
“us”, “we” and “Amchi” shall
mean Amchi Gendynamy Science Corporation, a Delaware
corporation.

 

A mchi
Gendynamy Science Corporation, formerly known as Pretty Valley
Acquisition Corporation, was incorporated on May 20, 2014 under the
laws of the state of Delaware. On June 18, 2014, Pretty Valley
Acquisition Corporation filed a registration statement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 10 by which it became a
public reporting company. In September, 2015, the Company
implemented a change of control by redeeming shares of existing
shareholders, issuing shares to new shareholders, electing new
officers and directors and accepting the resignations of its then
existing officers and directors. In connection with the change of
control, the shareholders of the Company and its board of directors
unanimously approved the change of the Company’s name from
Pretty Valley Acquisition Corporation to Amchi Gendynamy Science
Corporation. The Company has been formed to provide a method for a
foreign or domestic private company to become a reporting company
with a class of securities registered under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934.

 

The
Company is an early-stage development company using a special
designed message machine along with acoustic wave to replace
medicine and insulin to help diabetes patients to recovery from
high blood sugar and medicine side effects. In China, Amchi is one
of a few companies in the field of developing a physical method to
treat Diabetes, utilizing electrical frequencies and special
acoustic waves, which the founder of the Company has devoted many
years in researching this Chinese traditional sound wave treatment.
The Company has been working to determine what is the right
multiple frequency, and how this frequency works on Diabetes to
lower blood sugar. The Company’s research is in its early
stages and there is no assurance that its therapy protocol or its
energy devices will ever be able to be proved and accepted by the
scientific and medical communities.

Company’s financial statements are prepared using generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States of America
applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization
of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course
of business. The Company has not yet generated any revenue and has
sustained operating losses since inception to date and allow it to
continue as a going concern. The continuation of the Company as a
going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support
from its shareholders, the ability of the Company to obtain
necessary financing to continue operations, and the attainment of
profitable operations. The Company incurred a net loss of $46,191
for the three months ended March 31, 2016, used net cash in
operating activities of $39,628, had a working capital surplus of
$491,085, and has an accumulated deficit of $147,922 as of March
31, 2016. These factors, among others raise a substantial doubt
regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going
concern. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it
could be forced to cease operations. The accompanying financial
statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the
recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and
classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the
Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

Use of
Estimates

The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with
U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company
bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical
experience and various other factors that it believes to be
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the
basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and
liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not
readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced
by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the
Company’s estimates of valuation of equity instruments. To
the extent there are material differences between the estimates and
the actual results, future results of operations will be
affected.

 

Cash and
Cash Equivalents

Cash and
cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit at banking
institutions. The Company did not have cash equivalents as of March
31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

 

Concentration
of Risk

Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations
of credit risk consist principally of cash. The Company places its
cash with high quality banking institutions. The Company has the
cash balances in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation limit as of March 31, 2016 and not as of December 31,
2015.

 

Income
Taxes

The
Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability
method in accordance with ASC 740, “ Income
Taxes” . The asset and liability method provides that
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected
future tax consequences of temporary differences between the
financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities, and
for operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax
rates and laws. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce
deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than
not to be realized.

 

The
Company follows the provisions of ASC 740-10, “ Accounting
for Uncertain Income Tax Positions .” When tax returns
are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be
sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others
are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken
or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained.
In accordance with the guidance of ASC 740-10, the benefit of a tax
position is recognized in the financial statements in the period
during which, based on all available evidence, management believes
it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon
examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation
processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated
with other positions. Tax positions that meet the
more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the
largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely
of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing
authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax
positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above
should be reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets along with any
associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the
taxing authorities upon examination.

Earnings
(Loss) Per Common Share

The
Company computes net earnings (loss) per share in accordance with
ASC 260, “ Earnings per Share” . ASC 260
requires presentation of both basic and diluted net earnings per
share (“EPS”) on the face of the income statement.
Basic EPS is computed by dividing earnings (loss) available to
common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of
shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS
gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding
during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible
note and preferred stock using the if-converted method. In
computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is
used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased
from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS
excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is
anti-dilutive. At March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were
no convertible notes, options or warrants available for conversion
that if exercised, may dilute future earnings per
share.

 

Fair value
of Financial Instruments and Fair Value
Measurements

ASC 820,
“ Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures”,
requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and
minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.
ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of
independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to
measure fair value. A financial instrument’s categorization
within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of
input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 820
prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to
measure fair value:

 

Level
1

Level 1
applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices
in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities.

 

Level
2

Level 2
applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other
than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability
such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active
markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in
markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less
active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant
inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or
corroborated by, observable market data.

 

Level
3

Level 3
applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable
inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the
measurement of the fair value of the assets or
liabilities.

 

The
Company’s financial instruments consist principally of cash,
accounts payable, payable to a related party and short term
deposits. Pursuant to ASC 820 and ASC 825, “ Financial
Instruments” , the fair value of our cash equivalents is
determined based on “Level 1” inputs, which consist of
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The Company
believes that the recorded values of all of the other financial
instruments approximate their current fair values because of their
nature and respective maturity dates or durations.

Patents
Rights and Trademark

 

Patent
rights and trademarks which are stated at cost, relate to the cost
of applications submitted for obtaining patent and trademark of our
Genome Repair Device, a non-invasive treatment device. Cost is
based on third party expenditures for patent applications. We will
begin amortizing our patent rights and trademark over their
estimated remaining useful life when we begin revenue-producing
activities. We will determine the useful lives of patent rights and
trademark after considering the specific facts and circumstances
related to each such asset. Factors we consider when determining
useful lives include the contractual term of any agreement related
to the asset, the historical performance of the asset, our
long-term strategy for using the asset, any laws or other local
regulations that could impact the useful life of the asset, and
other economic factors, including competition and specific market
conditions. As of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company
expended $30,400 and $10,400 in costs for submitting the
application for patent rights and trademark which includes patent
rights assigned by our Officer to the Company.

 

New
Accounting Pronouncements  

 

The
Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are
in effect and that may impact its consolidated financial statements
and does not believe that there are any other new accounting
pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material
impact on its financial position or results of
operations.

 

NOTE 3
– RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

 

On
September 16, 2015, Everrich Global Investments Limited
(“Everrich”), an entity owned and controlled by Wisdom
Qiao, the Chief Executive Officer of the Company (the
“Officer”), entered into an agreement with Tiber Creek
Corporation (“Tiber Creek”), an entity controlled by
the founders of the Company, to exercise change in control of the
Company. Upon the change in control of the Company, the existing
shareholders of Tiber Creek retained 500,000 common shares of the
Company and the remaining outstanding shares were returned to the
Company. In full satisfaction of the services of Tiber Creek,
Everrich agreed to pay a non-refundable consideration of $85,000 in
legal and professional fees to Tiber Creek. The Officer has paid on
behalf of the Company $80,000 of the consideration to Tiber Creek
and the remaining $5,000 is recorded as accounts payable as of
March 31, 2016.

 

 

On January
26, 2016, the Company’s Board of Directors approved and
ratified the assignment (the “Assignment”) by the
Officer of her entire right, title and ownership interest in a
patent application entitled “DYNAMIC RECOVERY AND THERAPY
SYSTEM” (the “Invention”) in exchange for
200,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. Pursuant to
the Assignment, on January 26, 2016, the Company issued 200,000,000
shares of its common stock to its Officer and valued them at
$20,000 (Note 6). The transfer of nonmonetary asset by its Officer
in exchange of common stock is recorded at the Officer’s
historical cost basis determined under USGAAP. Since the common
stock of the Company is closely held and not traded, estimating the
fair value of the common stock issued is not appropriate.
Therefore, upon the assignment of entire right, title and ownership
interest in patent application by the Officer to the Company in
exchange for 200,000,000 shares of the Company’s common
stock, the Company valued the patent rights, title and ownership at
its historical cost which approximated $20,000.

 

The
Officer has occasionally provided short term advances to the
Company for opening its bank accounts and payments to vendors for
performing services to the Company. The short term advances are
non-interest bearing, unsecured and due on demand. For the three
months ended March 31, 2016, the Company paid to the Officer
$92,313 towards the advances provided for its working capital
needs. The Company is indebted to the Officer $9,859 and $102,172
due and payable as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
respectively.

received cash deposits of $0 and $60,445 from two investors for
purchase of common shares pursuant to a prospective private
placement. The private placement for sale of common shares took
place in January 2016, and such deposits received from two
investors, were converted into equity, by issuance of 218,000
shares of common shares pursuant to the private placement as of
March 31, 2016 (Note 6).

The medical device industry is highly competitive, subject to rapid
technological change and significantly affected by new product introductions and
market activities of other participants. Therefore, our currently marketed
products are, and future products we commercialize will be, subject to
competition. Almost all of our competitors have greater financial capabilities
and name recognition then we do. There is no direct and indirect competitor on
genome repair technology in the market so far.


Company Description
Amchi Gendynamy Science Corporation is an early-stage development company using
a special designed message machine along with acoustic wave to replace medicine
and insulin to help diabetes patients to recovery from high blood sugar and
medicine side effect. In China, Amchi is one of a few companies


 in the field of
developing a physical method to treat Diabetes, utilizing electrical frequencies
and special acoustic waves, which the founder of the Company has devoted many
years in researching this Chinese traditional sound wave treatment. The Company
has been working to determine what is the right multiple frequency, and how this
frequency works on Diabetes to lower blood sugar. The theory behind this is that
we believe certain frequency with the right fore trajectory message through the
spinal cord can build on the right energy field of the body to help certain 
acoustic waves to penetrate to the cell level to stimulate the insulin secretion
and enhancement of the sugar metabolism in order to lower the blood sugar level.
The Company has completed several therapy sessions with individuals in China
with some success in rehabilitating and in the prevention of various Diabetes, 
and to replace insulin and medicine to lower the blood sugar. Preliminary
clinical results have shown that it has effectiveness. The Company is planning
to do more case studies on Diabetes in China and the United States. Those case 
reports may not be as effective as the Company may expect. If the case reports
are as Company expect, the Company intends to raise capital to get relative
prove for commercialize the products. The therapy protocol and its energy 
treatment will be proved by the scientific and medical communities by the
reports of the case studies. The Company is looking for a partner to join it for
diabetes dynamic pathophysiology studies at the end of 2016. The Company’s 
research is in its early stages and there is no assurance that its therapy 
protocol or its energy devices will ever be able to be proved and accepted by
the scientific and medical communities.  

Furthermore, the Company, as of this date, has not published any peer reviewed
studies or articles, nor has it conducted any clinical trials or studies that
have received approval in any country where approval of this therapy will be
sought, or have we received any regulatory approvals for the commercialization
of our products. 

The Company was incorporated in the State of Delaware in May 20, 2014, and was
formerly known as Pretty Valley Acquisition Corporation.
