NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)

Note 1—Trust
Organization and Provisions

        The
Mesa Royalty Trust (the "Trust") was created on November 1,
1979. On that date, Mesa Petroleum Co., predecessor to Mesa Limited
Partnership ("MLP") which was the predecessor to MESA Inc.,
conveyed to the Trust an overriding royalty interest (the
"Royalty") equal to 90% of the Net Proceeds (as defined in the
Conveyance and described below) attributable to the specified
interests in properties conveyed by the assignor on that date (the
"Subject Interests"). The Subject Interests consisted of interests
in certain producing oil and gas properties located in the Hugoton
field of Kansas, the San Juan Basin field of New Mexico and
Colorado and the Yellow Creek field of Wyoming (the "Royalty
Properties"). The Royalty is evidenced by counterparts of an
Overriding Royalty Conveyance dated as of November 1, 1979
(the "Conveyance"). On April 30, 1991, MLP sold its interests
in the Royalty Properties located in the San Juan Basin field to
ConocoPhillips. ConocoPhillips sold the portion of its interests in
the San Juan Basin Royalty Properties located in Colorado to
MarkWest Energy Partners, Ltd. (effective January 1, 1993) and
Red Willow Production Company (effective April 1, 1992). On
October 26, 1994, MarkWest Energy Partners, Ltd. sold
substantially all of its interest in the Colorado San Juan Basin
Royalty Properties to BP Amoco Company ("BP"), a subsidiary of BP
p.l.c. Until August 7, 1997, MESA Inc. operated the
Hugoton Royalty Properties through Mesa Operating Co., a wholly
owned subsidiary of MESA Inc. On August 7, 1997,
MESA Inc. merged with and into Pioneer Natural Resources
Company ("Pioneer"), formerly a wholly owned subsidiary of
MESA Inc., and Parker & Parsley Petroleum Company
merged with and into Pioneer Natural Resources USA, Inc. (successor
to Mesa Operating Co.), a wholly owned subsidiary of Pioneer
("PNR") (collectively, the mergers are referred to herein as the
"Merger"). Subsequent to the Merger, the Hugoton Royalty Properties
have been operated by PNR. Substantially all of the San Juan Basin
Royalty Properties located in New Mexico are operated by
ConocoPhillips. Effective January 1, 2005, ConocoPhillips
assigned its interest in an immaterial number of San Juan Basin
Royalty Properties located in New Mexico to XTO Energy Inc. The San
Juan Basin Royalty Properties located in Colorado are operated by
BP. As used in this report, PNR refers to the operator of the
Hugoton Royalty Properties, ConocoPhillips refers to the operator
of the San Juan Basin Royalty Properties, other than the portion of
such properties located in Colorado, and BP refers to the operator
of the Colorado San Juan Basin Royalty Properties unless otherwise
indicated.

        Effective
October 2, 2006, The Bank of New York Mellon Trust
Company, N.A. (the "Trustee") succeeded JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
as Trustee of the Trust. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is the successor
by mergers to the original name of the Trustee, Texas Commerce Bank
National Association. The terms of the Mesa Royalty Trust Indenture
(the "Trust Indenture") provide, among other things,
that:

        (a)   the
Trust cannot engage in any business or investment activity or
purchase any assets;

        (b)   the
Royalty can be sold in part or in total for cash upon approval by
the unitholders;

        (c)   the
Trustee can establish cash reserves and borrow funds to pay
liabilities of the Trust and can pledge assets of the Trust to
secure payment of the borrowings;

4

 

  

        (d)   the
Trustee will make cash distributions to the unitholders in January,
April, July and October each year as discussed more fully in
Note 2;

        (e)   the
Trust will terminate upon the first to occur of the following
events: (i) at such time as the Trust's royalty income for two
successive years is less than $250,000 per year or (ii) a vote
by the unitholders in favor of termination. Upon termination of the
Trust, the Trustee will sell for cash all the assets held in the
Trust estate and make a final distribution to unitholders of any
funds remaining after all Trust liabilities have been satisfied;
and

        (f)    PNR,
ConocoPhillips and BP (collectively the "Working Interest Owners")
will reimburse the Trust for 59.34%, 27.45% and 1.77%,
respectively, for general and administrative expenses of the
Trust.

Note 2—Basis
of Presentation

        The
accompanying unaudited financial information has been prepared by
the Trustee in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q.
The preparation of the financial statements requires estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. The Trustee believes such information
includes all the disclosures necessary to make the information
presented not misleading. The information furnished reflects all
adjustments which are, in the opinion of the Trustee, necessary for
a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods
presented. The financial information should be read in conjunction
with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the
Trust's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2009. The Trust considers all highly liquid
investments with a maturity of three months or less to be cash
equivalents. Subsequent events were evaluated through the issuance
date of the financial statements.

        In
accordance with the Conveyance, the Working Interest Owners are
obligated to calculate and pay the Trust each month an amount equal
to 90% of the Net Proceeds (as defined in the Conveyance)
attributable to the month. In 1985, the Trust Indenture was amended
and the Trust conveyed to an affiliate of Mesa Petroleum Co.
88.5571% of the original Royalty (such transfer, the "1985
Assignment"). The effect of the 1985 Assignment was an overall
reduction of approximately 88.56% in the size of the Trust. As a
result, the Trust is now entitled to receive 11.44% of 90% of the
Net Proceeds attributable to each month.

        The
financial statements of the Trust are prepared on the following
basis:

        (a)   Royalty
income recorded for a month is the amount computed and paid by the
Working Interest Owners to the Trustee for such month rather than
either the value of a portion of the oil and gas produced by the
Working Interest Owners for such month or the amount subsequently
determined to be the Trust's proportionate share of the net
proceeds for such month;

        (b)   Interest
income, interest receivable and distributions payable to
unitholders include interest to be earned on short-term investments
from the financial statement date through the next date of
distribution;

        (c)   Trust
general and administrative expenses, net of reimbursements, are
recorded in the month they are included in the calculation of the
monthly distribution amount;

5

 

  

        (d)   Amortization
of the Royalty is computed on a unit-of-production basis and is
charged directly to trust corpus since such amount does not affect
distributable income; and

        (e)   Distributions
payable are determined on a monthly basis and are payable to
unitholders of record as of the last business day of each month or
such later date as the Trustee determines is required to comply
with applicable law or stock exchange requirements. However, cash
distributions are made quarterly in January, April, July and
October, and include interest earned from the monthly record dates
to the date of distribution.

        This
basis for reporting distributable income is considered to be the
most meaningful because distributions to the unitholders for a
month are based on net cash receipts for such month. However, these
statements differ from financial statements prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America because, under such principles, royalty income for a
month would be based on net proceeds from production for such month
without regard to when calculated or received, general and
administrative expenses would be recorded in the month they accrue,
and interest income for a month would be calculated only through
the end of such month.

Note 3—Legal
Proceedings

        There
are no pending legal proceedings to which the Trust is a named
party. The Trustee has been advised by PNR, ConocoPhillips and BP
Amoco that it is subject to litigation in the ordinary course of
business for certain matters that include the Royalty Properties.
While each of the working interest owners has advised the Trustee
that it does not currently believe any of the pending litigation
will have a material adverse effect net to the Trust, in the event
such matters were adjudicated or settled in a material amount and
charges were made against Royalty income, such charges could have a
material impact of future Royalty income.

Note 4—Income
Tax Matters

        In
a technical advice memorandum dated February 26, 1982, the IRS
advised the Dallas District Director that the Trust is classifiable
as a grantor trust and not as an association taxable as a
corporation. As a grantor trust, the Trust incurs no federal income
tax liability and each unitholder is subject to tax on the
unitholder's pro rata share of the income and expense of the Trust
as if the unitholder were the direct owner of a pro rata share of
the Trust's assets. In addition, there is no state tax liability
for the period.

        The
Trustee assumes that some Trust Units are held by a middleman, as
such term is broadly defined in U.S. Treasury Regulations (and
includes custodians, nominees, certain joint owners, and brokers
holding an interest for a custodian in street name). Therefore, the
Trustee considers the Trust to be a non-mortgage widely held fixed
investment trust ("WHFIT") for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., 919 Congress
Avenue, Austin, Texas 78701, telephone number 1-800-852-1422, is
the representative of the Trust that will provide tax information
in accordance with applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations governing
the information reporting requirements of the Trust as a
WHFIT.

Note 5—Excess
Production Costs

        Excess
production costs result when costs, charges, and expenses
attributable to a Working Interest Property exceed the revenue
received from the sale of oil, gas, and other hydrocarbons produced
from

6

 

  

 

such
property. Excess production costs related to the San Juan
Basin—Colorado properties were approximately $0 as of
March 31, 2010 and $20,606 as of December 31, 2009. The
excess production costs must be recovered by the Working Interest
Owners before any distribution of Royalty income from the
properties will be made to the Trust.

Note 6—Tax
Assessment

        PNR
has advised the Trustee that it received a proposed assessment from
the Kansas Department of Revenue on September 10, 2009, for
additional tax, penalty and interest of approximately
$4.1 million resulting primarily from the settlement of the
lawsuit John Steven Alford and Robert Larrabee, individually and
on behalf of a Plaintiff Class v. Pioneer Natural Resources
USA, Inc. in early 2007. The portion of the tax assessment net
to the Trust is approximately $181,000, which could adversely
affect Trust distributions. PNR has submitted a written response
objecting to the proposed assessment. On March 25, 2010, The
Kansas Department of Revenue issued a final assessment, which
included additional interest and penalties, increasing the amount
assessed to approximately $4.5 million. The portion of the tax
assessment net to the Trust is approximately $197,000, which could
adverserly affect Trust distributions. PNR intends to challenge the
March 25, 2010 final assessment through the administrative
process provided for under Kansas law. No assurance can be made
that any objections or disputed items raised by PNR will be
successful.

        PNR
has also advised the Trustee that it is preparing to file for a
severance tax refund with the state of Kansas for approximately
$2.8 million, the estimated share of the refund due the Trust
is approximately $156,000. As of April 30, 2010, PNR has filed
for approximately $1.7 million of severance tax refunds, of
which the Trust share is approximately $96,000. There can be no
assurance that the state will agree to PNR's position.

    Item 2.    
Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.

        The
following review of the Trust's financial condition and results of
operations should be read in conjunction with the financial
statements and notes thereto. The discussion of net production
attributable to the Hugoton and San Juan properties represents
production volumes that are to a large extent hypothetical as the
Trust does not own and is not entitled to any specific production
volumes. See Note 10 to the financial statements in the
Trust's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2009. Any discussion of "actual" production
volumes represents the hydrocarbons that were produced from the
properties in which the Trust has an overriding royalty
interest.

        The
Trust is a passive entity whose purposes are limited to:
(1) converting the Royalties to cash, either by retaining them
and collecting the proceeds of production (until production has
ceased or the Royalties are otherwise terminated) or by selling or
otherwise disposing of the Royalties; and (2) distributing
such cash, net of amounts for payments of liabilities to the Trust,
to the unitholders. The Trust has no sources of liquidity or
capital resources other than the revenues, if any, attributable to
the Royalties and interest on cash held by the Trustee as a reserve
for liabilities or for distribution.

Note
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

        This
Form 10-Q includes "forward-looking statements" within the
meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended. All statements other than statements of
historical facts included in this Form 10-Q, including without
limitation the statements under "Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," are
forward-looking statements. Although the Working Interest Owners
have advised the Trust that they believe that the expectations
reflected in the forward-looking statements contained herein are
reasonable, no assurance can be given that such expectations will
prove to be correct. Important factors that could cause actual
results to differ materially from expectations ("Cautionary
Statements") are disclosed in this Form 10-Q and in the
Trust's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2009, including under "Item 1A. Risk
Factors". All subsequent written and oral forward-looking
statements attributable to the Trust or persons acting on its
behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the Cautionary
Statements.

Why royalties may be the best income investment on earth









Why Buy Royalties
In today’s investing landscape, investors are looking for new ways to insulate their money from unpredictable stock market fluctuations. This has led to a substantial rise in the popularity of alternative investments like royalties. Investing in royalties offers buyers the opportunity to purchase future royalty stream revenue generated by royalty assets.
At Royalty Exchange, you will now have access to purchase some of these alternative assets in an online marketplace:

Auctions
Royalty Exchange take royalty transactions out of the private, backroom deal and into the open marketplace through online public auctions. Every listing provides all the relevant rights and catalog information, financial data, media, and any other information needed to make a sound investment decision. 
Advances [beta]
Royalty Exchange’s Peer Advance platform allows you to provide advances with fixed rates and terms to royalty rightsholders, backed by their royalty income. It’s as close to a guaranteed return as you can get.

Steady Income
Royalties are generally stable investments, they pay consistent income every year. Each asset listing on our site will include historical financial data.


Longevity
Royalty streams last for the life of the copyright or patent. In many cases, with royalties generated from copyrights, those payments can last up to 75 years.


Diversification
Royalties from intellectual property, especially music royalties, are uncorrelated assets. Meaning they are not influenced by fluctuations in the stock market. This is a good way to stabilize the income your portfolio generates.


Potential Upside
Some royalties, especially in music, experience large spikes in revenue based on increased use. For example, when a song is used in a popular commercial, revenue spikes... or when a popular artist covers an older song, the owners of the copyright enjoy a major boost in royalty payments.








Why royalties could be the perfect income investment
Intellectual property assets with a strong track record of consistent earnings may be the perfect investment for those seeking income. Owners of intellectual property of any kind are paid every time their IP is used. They create an asset once, and then collect payment over and over again.
Imagine this… you’re a songwriter. You write a song for a film and this move becomes a classic; the type of film that people watch many times over a period of years. One of these films–even 20 years after its release date–still airs on TV nearly every week and is purchased or streamed on iTunes, Amazon Video, Netflix, and even on DVD.Every time one this film is bought, streamed, or aired on TV you get paid.
Billy Goodrum is one of these songwriters. He penned original music for the hit comedy Dumb and Dumber (1994), among others. Below, you can see that the royalties he earned from that movie increased at least 15% every year from 2011 through 2014, ultimately reaching a 12-month total of over $22,000 before he sold it in early 2015.


Royalties don't rust. They don't get sued by angry workers. And they don't require expensive tools or machinery to make money. Somebody creates it once and they make money for decades.
Until recently, you probably never had the opportunity to own income-producing intellectual property. That’s where Royalty Exchange comes in. We’re a marketplace where these types of royalty assets are bought and sold. We specialize in intellectual property with a documented track record of regular, consistent income.

Through our one-of-a-kind platform, investors can buy privately owned royalty rights directly from the artists, inventors and creators. In a world of negative interest rates, these income-generating royalty rights just might be the perfect investment.

Why royalties may be the best income investment on earth









Why Buy Royalties
In today’s investing landscape, investors are looking for new ways to insulate their money from unpredictable stock market fluctuations. This has led to a substantial rise in the popularity of alternative investments like royalties. Investing in royalties offers buyers the opportunity to purchase future royalty stream revenue generated by royalty assets.
At Royalty Exchange, you will now have access to purchase some of these alternative assets in an online marketplace:

Auctions
Royalty Exchange take royalty transactions out of the private, backroom deal and into the open marketplace through online public auctions. Every listing provides all the relevant rights and catalog information, financial data, media, and any other information needed to make a sound investment decision. 
Advances [beta]
Royalty Exchange’s Peer Advance platform allows you to provide advances with fixed rates and terms to royalty rightsholders, backed by their royalty income. It’s as close to a guaranteed return as you can get.

Steady Income
Royalties are generally stable investments, they pay consistent income every year. Each asset listing on our site will include historical financial data.


Longevity
Royalty streams last for the life of the copyright or patent. In many cases, with royalties generated from copyrights, those payments can last up to 75 years.


Diversification
Royalties from intellectual property, especially music royalties, are uncorrelated assets. Meaning they are not influenced by fluctuations in the stock market. This is a good way to stabilize the income your portfolio generates.


Potential Upside
Some royalties, especially in music, experience large spikes in revenue based on increased use. For example, when a song is used in a popular commercial, revenue spikes... or when a popular artist covers an older song, the owners of the copyright enjoy a major boost in royalty payments.








Why royalties could be the perfect income investment
Intellectual property assets with a strong track record of consistent earnings may be the perfect investment for those seeking income. Owners of intellectual property of any kind are paid every time their IP is used. They create an asset once, and then collect payment over and over again.
Imagine this… you’re a songwriter. You write a song for a film and this move becomes a classic; the type of film that people watch many times over a period of years. One of these films–even 20 years after its release date–still airs on TV nearly every week and is purchased or streamed on iTunes, Amazon Video, Netflix, and even on DVD.Every time one this film is bought, streamed, or aired on TV you get paid.
Billy Goodrum is one of these songwriters. He penned original music for the hit comedy Dumb and Dumber (1994), among others. Below, you can see that the royalties he earned from that movie increased at least 15% every year from 2011 through 2014, ultimately reaching a 12-month total of over $22,000 before he sold it in early 2015.

Why we will get you the best deal
For too long songwriters and musicians have sold their catalogs or sought advances in backroom deals that often left them with a very bad result. But there are tens of thousands of investors outside the music industry interested in acquiring royalties willing to provide much better options.
If you've tried to leverage your catalog or raise money in the past, you know how difficult it can be to find willing investors with the capital you need. Royalty Exchange is the marketplace where this takes place. We’ve assembled and vetted all the investors on our site. So you can get instant access to a large group of investors that would be impossible to attract on your own.
That's why we've been able to get creatives much better deals than anybody else out there. And that's why, if you're looking to raise money — you're in the right place.

We only get paid if the deal gets done on your terms. If you don't successfully raise money, you don't owe us a dime.Fast: We can put together a custom deal for you, market it, and close the fundraising in less than 30 days. We have a team of attorneys, accountants, and analysts that can make these deals happen fast. If you want to get started on your next project ASAP, we'll help you make it happen.

We've done auctions for a single song, part or all of a catalog, and more.

You have complete control over what you want to do to hit your fundraising goals.Keep all of your future work. We connect you with investors who are interested in your back catalog only. That means you can use your older work to finance new projects or major purchases. And you can do it without giving up any creative control or copyrights on your future projects. Many of the creatives we've worked with have leveraged their back catalog in order to fund their new album, film, or other project.


    








Why other creatives like you have worked with us
Since 2013, we’ve helped recording artists, songwriters, and other creative rightsholders raise millions. More than half have returned to conduct additional auctions, or have personally recommended us to their peers. 
We've helped them raise money to fund a documentary about women in Africa. We've helped artists and songwriters build out home studios. We've even helped a songwriter raise money to buy a rental property in New York.
James Michael Thomas, who wrote the hook for the hit Kanye song “Mercy” came to us first with an emergency, and returned for a second time with a plan. We helped him raise nearly $20,000 which he put to good use! [Read More]
Alicia Angel, who wrote a number of songs in the children's show “Dora and Friends” wanted to finance a project she was deeply passionate about: a documentary about the cruel treatment of women in certain African nations. We helped Alicia fund her documentary and spread the word about this critical issue. [Read More]
Brian Maher, a top-tier songwriter in Nashville, wrote the hit song “Til My Last Day” performed by Justin Moore. He sold part of his writer's share of that single song and raised money to finance his career and help provide a little extra for his family. We helped him raise more than $50,000 in a day.
We've helped a company that owns an enormous catalog of iconic celebrity photos raise more than $300,000 to acquire more amazing photos and bring a new line of beautiful and affordable collectibles to markets everywhere. We've helped provide them the funding they need to grow their business.
Those are just a few of the many creatives that we've helped raise money through Royalty Exchange's platform. We hope you'll be next.
