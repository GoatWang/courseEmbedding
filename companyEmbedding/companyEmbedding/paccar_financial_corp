Environmental Leadership
Environmental leadership is one of PACCAR’s core values. Reducing the environmental impact of our activities is an integral part of the process of continuous improvement. Our commitment to the environment is demonstrated in our energy efficient operations and technologically advanced products and recognized in the communities in which we live and work around the world.
Eco-Efficiency
PACCAR is committed to reduce its environmental footprint in greenhouse gas emissions (GHG),water consumption and waste.


     
Energy
Reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emission intensity in manufacturing operations.
Water
Reduce water consumption.
Waste
Reduce waste.
Products
Continual reduction in environmental impact and a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.



Investing in Sustainable Operations

Finding ways to reduce waste, reuse materials, conserve energy and reduce the environmental impact of Company activities occurs daily in both small and significant ways across the Company. PACCAR is driving clean manufacturing into every aspect of its business not only because it is the right thing to do but because it makes good long-term business sense.
All Company manufacturing locations that have been in operation for more than two years have achieved ISO14001 certification.
The Company has invested $160 million over the past ten years in facility projects that have improved energy efficiency, reduced emissions, reduced water consumption and waste including $35 million in reusable containers. PACCAR’s environmental leadership is demonstrated by being the first in the truck industry to implement chassis robotic paint systems. This process has enhanced paint quality, reduced cost and decreased paint usage, waste and air emissions.



PACCAR’s DAF Leyland assembly plant in the United Kingdom was the first in the world to robotically paint truck chassis on a moving assembly line reducing paint per chassis by six percent.


Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions
From 2009 to 2016 PACCAR reduced greenhouse gas emissions 32% on a per revenue basis as shown below. Hazardous air emissions have been reduced by over 200 metric tonnes per year in paint and other processes. PACCAR’s goal is a continual reduction of its environmental footprint including a reduction of greenhouse gas emission.

PACCAR joined the CDP Reporter Services for reporting greenhouse gas emissions and to benchmark performance to continue reducing our greenhouse gas footprint.

 


Reducing Waste
Many of the Company’s manufacturing locations achieve “zero waste to landfill” by recycling, employing reusable containers and composting food and paper waste. Kenworth’s Renton, Washington plant received the 2013 Best Workplace for Waste Prevention and Recycling Award for the fifth consecutive year from the King County, Washington Solid Waste Division.
Conserving Resources

Company facilities employ a variety of energy conservation actions. We reduce the use of water through internal recycling, reduce paint waste through robotic paint systems and conserve energy by using new technologies such regenerative dynamometers that capture electricity from vehicle testing. Motion-sensing light fixtures were recently installed in the expanded distribution center in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. The fixtures work in conjunction with daylight harvesting to reduce electricity usage by a projected 40%.
Kenworth Australia projected a reduction in its CO² output by 28 metric tonnes per year by replacing its fixtures with LED lighting systems.


Six Sigma Environmental Award

The Company chairman rewards projects designed to reduce the Company’s impact on the environment by presenting an annual Six Sigma award to the team project that contributes the most to improve eco-efficiency.
The 2013 Six Sigma Environmental Award was earned by the DAF cab plant in Westerlo, Belgium for a project which is projected to reduce water consumption per cab 41%, enough to fill 18 Olympic size swimming pools.


Products
All PACCAR vehicles have near-zero emissions of NOx, a smog causing compound, and are compliant with all applicable standards including those by the California Air Resources Board (CARB), the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the European Commission.
PACCAR’s commitment to making the highest quality, most sustainable vehicles begins with product design. PACCAR uses Ecodesign, a software tool, to reduce environmental impacts through product design. Through this process, engineers increase recyclability of our trucks, reduce air emissions, use lighter materials to reduce fuel consumption and use fewer hazardous materials.
Advanced Vehicle DevelopmentPACCAR’s focus on quality and sustainability is reflected in the new Kenworth T680, Peterbilt Model 579 and the DAF XF Euro 6.

The new Kenworth and Peterbilt products improve aerodynamic efficiencies up to 10% generating an annualized fuel savings of up to 950 gallons per vehicle in an over-the-road application and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by almost 10 metric tonnes per vehicle.
As part of a U.S. Dept. of Energy program, Peterbilt has partnered with several component suppliers to develop an advanced concept tractor/trailer “SuperTruck” capable of achieving ten mpg in real-condition testing compared with the industry-wide average of approximately six miles per gallon, a 65% improvement. Technologies from this project are being evaluated for their incorporation into future PACCAR products.

Hybrids, Alternative Fuel, & Emission Reduction TechnologiesPACCAR has been a market leader in manufacturing trucks powered by liquefied natural gas (LNG) and compressed natural gas (CNG) since 1996 with over 35% U.S. market share. Natural gas engines reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 20%.
Kenworth and Peterbilt also offer resource-conserving technologies like an electric hybrid drive system which can provide up to a 28% improvement in fuel economy, 28% emissions reduction and 50% reduction in brake wear.

The New York City parks department uses its fleet of Kenworth T370 hybrids to haul dirt to more than 500 ball fields throughout the city’s 1,700 parks resulting in a 30% improvement in fuel economy.



Fuel-Efficient, Low-Emission PACCAR Engines
PACCAR has strengthened its leadership in environmental stewardship by expanding its global portfolio of high performing low emission engines. Over the past five years, these engines have reduced GHG emissions by up to 14%. NOx and particulate matter have also been reduced by over 83%. Continued research and investments are expected to achieve further GHG reduction in the future.

Advanced combustion and aftertreatment research is conducted at PACCAR’s Engineering Centers located in Eindhoven, The Netherlands and Mount Vernon, Washington. These world-class facilities ensure all PACCAR MX-13 and MX-11 engines achieve the optimal combination of fuel-efficiency and emission reductions.

PACCAR Inc is an American Fortune 500 company[6] and counts among the largest manufacturers of medium- and heavy-duty trucks in the world,[7][8] and has substantial manufacturing in light and medium vehicles through its various subsidiaries. For its leadership in the development of aerodynamic, lightweight commercial vehicles that has led to reduced fuel consumption and increased efficiencies, PACCAR Inc was awarded the National Medal of Technology at the White House in 2006.[9][10] The company’s presence has been especially strong in Renton, Washington, where it remains the oldest continually operating business. PACCAR's assembly plant in Renton was recognized as one of the best workplaces for commuters for the fifth consecutive year by the National Center for Transit Research in June 2013. The plant also celebrated its 20th anniversary in June 2013 and has produced more than 130,000 heavy-duty and medium-duty Kenworth trucks since it started its operations in 1993.[11][12][13]

History[edit]




Seattle Car and Foundry works at Renton, Washington, 1916.


PACCAR Inc started as Seattle Car Manufacturing Company in 1905 with a capitalization of $10,000 and was founded by William Pigott, Sr., its original business was the production of railway and logging equipment. The company built a new factory in Renton in 1909 after its Duwamish facility was destroyed in fire as well as to fulfill large number of orders.[14] In 1917 it merged with a Portland firm, Twohy Brothers which was its only competitor on the west coast at the time and company was renamed as Pacific Car and Foundry Company. The company manufactured horse or oxen-drawn logging trucks built specifically to address the dense, hilly forests in which the Northwest logging industry operated to transport massive logs. The following years the company specialized in designing air brakes, open cars, refrigerated boxcars for shipment of perishable items and the universal trailer which could be pulled by a truck.[15] The company also manufactured structural steel that was finished by hand that was used to create columns and girders that went into many a Seattle landmark building.[16][17] In 1924, the founder, William Pigott sold a controlling interest in the company to American Car and Foundry Company. However, his son, Paul Pigott reacquired a significant interest in the company from American Car and Foundry Company in 1934.[18][19]
During the Great Depression in 1930 despite the stock market crash, the company's earnings rose; but as the Great Depression deepened, Pacific Car and Foundry became one of the most depressed businesses in the Northwest.[20] During the late 1930s, Pacific Car and Foundry received government contracts for steel fabrication for construction of Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge as well as orders from other companies.[21]
During World War II[edit]
During World War II, Pacific Car and Foundry’s sales grew due to an increased demand for steel used in airplanes, airports, bridges, naval ships, highways and other equipment that helped build America’s infrastructure to support the war effort. Pacific Car also sub-contracted for Boeing, building aluminum wingspans for B-17 bombers. During the spring of 1942 the company also built M4A1 Shermans tanks for the U.S. Army. The company was able to cast almost all the parts for the tanks at its own foundry. Other notable vehicles that were built included the M25 Tank Transporter, known as the Dragon Wagon, and the T28 Super Heavy Tank.[17] Everett-Pacific Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Company was established in 1942 that built ships and other marine products for the US Navy in Port Gardner Bay in Everett. It was bought by Pacific Car and Foundry in 1944.[22]
Post war[edit]




PACCAR's History in the 1900s. Clockwise from top: Seattle Car Mfg in 1909, Pacific Car & Foundry's Railroad car in 1950, Kenworth T-10 truck and T28 Super Heavy Tank during WW 2


After World War II ended, Pacific Car was a part of the federal government’s Mobilization Planning Program, which meant that it promised to devote 100 percent of its facilities to military production in the event of a national emergency. The company was a prime contractor during the Korean War for producing tanks. Pacific Car chose to subcontract many of the necessary parts, boosting smaller businesses in the state.[17][23][24] In 1945 Pacific Car purchased the Kenworth Motor Truck Corporation which was named after the stockholders Harry Kent and Edgar Worthington.. Kenworth had been producing trucks in Seattle since it was incorporated in 1923. During World War II, Kenworth produced trucks, airplane assemblies and sub-assemblies for the United States military. As the war drew to an end Kenworth shifted attention to production of commercial trucks for the postwar market. In 1956 Kenworth lost independent status and became a division directly under Pacific Car and Foundry.[25]
In 1954, Pacific Car acquired the Dart Truck Company of Kansas City, Missouri, and the Peterbilt Motors Company, of Oakland, California. Dart built primarily heavy off-highway dump trucks and specialty vehicles. Peterbilt had been a major competitor with Kenworth, producing many kinds of trucks and buses. Peterbilt operated as Pacific Car’s wholly owned subsidiary until 1960, following which it was dissolved and made a division of Pacific Car and Foundry.[26][27][28] Pacific Car’s structural steel division made the steel used to build the 50-story Seattle-First National Bank headquarters and to build Seattle’s Space Needle in 1961. The firm provided 5,668 steel panels, weighing 58,000 tons, which formed a major part of the load bearing walls for New York City's World Trade Center twin towers. The World Trade Center, like the Sea-First building, bore the building’s load on the exterior walls rather than on an interior structural skeleton. The steel panels were shipped by rail from Seattle to New York City on more than 1,600 railcars. Pacific Car was the largest contractor of the 13 steel fabricators that provided steel for the World Trade Center towers.[15][29][30][31]
The 1970s to 1990s[edit]
Despite a serious slowdown due to National Recessions during 1974, PACCAR continued to generate increasing sales throughout the 1970s. PACCAR purchased Wagner Mining Company in 1975, which built underground Mining Vehicles, International Car Company in 1975 and Foden Trucks a British truck manufacturer in 1980.[32][33] Fodens sold trucks in Europe and Africa.[34][35][36] PACCAR International was formed in 1972 that promoted exports worldwide.[37][38] PACCAR Technical Center was established in 1980 in Mount Vernon, Washington as a research and testing facility. The facility included test tracks, engine test cells, materials test laboratories and structural laboratories. The tech center conducts an Open House event every April that coincides with the Skagit Valley Tulip Festival.[39][40] In 1983 the International Car Co Division in Kenton Ohio, which had been acquired on December 1, 1975,[41] was disbanded.[42] In 1983 the PACCAR Rail Leasing Inc subsidiary in Renton WA and the RAILEASE Inc subsidiary in Bellevue WA were disbanded.[43] In 1986 the Pacific Car and Foundry subsidiary in Renton WA was renamed to PACCAR Defense Systems Division.[44] In 1984 PACCAR posted record sales in its history of $2.25 billion.[45][46]
In the mid 1980s, PACCAR's share of Class 8 trucks dropped to about 18% owing to aggressive competition from Freightliner Trucks, which is a subsidiary of Daimler AG and the merged operations of Volvo White and General. This competition forced PACCAR to close its Kenworth assembly plant in Kansas City in April, 1986 and its Peterbilt plant in Newark, California, the following October.[47] PACCAR acquired Trico Industries in 1986 which was a manufacturer of oil exploration equipment based in Gardena, California for $65 million in order to reduce its dependence on the Class 8 Truck market.[48][49] During the mid-80's PACCAR was negotiating with the Rover Group, for acquiring its British Leyland truck division. However, Rover management decided to sell the truck division to DAF Trucks which was a Dutch automotive concern. Its Dart Truck Company and Wagner Mining Equipment Company were sold in 1984 and 1989 in order to remain profitable.[50][51] In 1987, PACCAR acquired Al’s Auto Supply and Grand Auto Incorporated which led to its entry into the automotive parts & accessories retail market that gave the company greater ability to weather periods of national economic downturn.[52][53][54]
The 1990s and beyond[edit]
PACCAR Parts was created in 1992 in Renton, Washington. The building it was housed in occupied part of the company’s historic Pacific Car and Foundry site. In the same year, PACCAR purchased a 21 percent stake in Wood Group ESP which added to its oil field equipment manufacturing.[55][56][57] In 1993, PACCAR acquired a line of winches from heavy equipment manufacturer Caterpillar. The same year it brought a new plant in Washington on line to help meet the increased demand for trucks. In 1994 the company began selling in New Zealand for the first time and entered new countries in Asia and Central and South America. The company made its Mexican joint venture VILPAC, S.A., a wholly owned subsidiary in 1995. PACCAR's Winch division was one of the world’s largest manufacturer of industrial winches by 1994.[58][59]
PACCAR International marketed trucks to more than 40 countries, and was one of the largest exporters of capital goods in North America by 1995. Kenworth truck factory in Renton, Washington was opened on June 4, 1993.[60] In 1997 Mark Pigott assumed PACCAR's presidency as Charles Pigott retired in 1997.[61] In 1996 & 1998 the company spent $543 million to acquire DAF Trucks N.V. based in the Netherlands and Leyland Trucks Ltd., an acquisition it first pursued back in the mid-1980s. These acquisitions were funded in part by the sale of Trico Industries to EVI in 1997.[62][63][64][65] Financial and leasing subsidiaries also performed well in the late 1990s. Also, in 1998 PACCAR acquired UK-based Leyland Trucks for its light and medium truck (6 to 44 metric tons) design and manufacture capability. With its Peterbilt, Kenworth, and DAF nameplates, PACCAR ranks second in production numbers in the United States and third in production numbers globally in "big rig" truck production; behind Daimler AG in the US market. Other Major heavy-truck competitors include Navistar International and AB Volvo.[66][67][68][69]

PACCAR Inc is an American Fortune 500 company[6] and counts among the largest manufacturers of medium- and heavy-duty trucks in the world,[7][8] and has substantial manufacturing in light and medium vehicles through its various subsidiaries. For its leadership in the development of aerodynamic, lightweight commercial vehicles that has led to reduced fuel consumption and increased efficiencies, PACCAR Inc was awarded the National Medal of Technology at the White House in 2006.[9][10] The company’s presence has been especially strong in Renton, Washington, where it remains the oldest continually operating business. PACCAR's assembly plant in Renton was recognized as one of the best workplaces for commuters for the fifth consecutive year by the National Center for Transit Research in June 2013. The plant also celebrated its 20th anniversary in June 2013 and has produced more than 130,000 heavy-duty and medium-duty Kenworth trucks since it started its operations in 1993.[11][12][13]

PACCAR Inc started as Seattle Car Manufacturing Company in 1905 with a capitalization of $10,000 and was founded by William Pigott, Sr., its original business was the production of railway and logging equipment. The company built a new factory in Renton in 1909 after its Duwamish facility was destroyed in fire as well as to fulfill large number of orders.[14] In 1917 it merged with a Portland firm, Twohy Brothers which was its only competitor on the west coast at the time and company was renamed as Pacific Car and Foundry Company. The company manufactured horse or oxen-drawn logging trucks built specifically to address the dense, hilly forests in which the Northwest logging industry operated to transport massive logs. The following years the company specialized in designing air brakes, open cars, refrigerated boxcars for shipment of perishable items and the universal trailer which could be pulled by a truck.[15] The company also manufactured structural steel that was finished by hand that was used to create columns and girders that went into many a Seattle landmark building.[16][17] In 1924, the founder, William Pigott sold a controlling interest in the company to American Car and Foundry Company. However, his son, Paul Pigott reacquired a significant interest in the company from American Car and Foundry Company in 1934.[18][19]
During the Great Depression in 1930 despite the stock market crash, the company's earnings rose; but as the Great Depression deepened, Pacific Car and Foundry became one of the most depressed businesses in the Northwest.[20] During the late 1930s, Pacific Car and Foundry received government contracts for steel fabrication for construction of Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge as well as orders from other companies.[21]
During World War II[edit]
During World War II, Pacific Car and Foundry’s sales grew due to an increased demand for steel used in airplanes, airports, bridges, naval ships, highways and other equipment that helped build America’s infrastructure to support the war effort. Pacific Car also sub-contracted for Boeing, building aluminum wingspans for B-17 bombers. During the spring of 1942 the company also built M4A1 Shermans tanks for the U.S. Army. The company was able to cast almost all the parts for the tanks at its own foundry. Other notable vehicles that were built included the M25 Tank Transporter, known as the Dragon Wagon, and the T28 Super Heavy Tank.[17] Everett-Pacific Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Company was established in 1942 that built ships and other marine products for the US Navy in Port Gardner Bay in Everett. It was bought by Pacific Car and Foundry in 1944.[22]
Post war[edit]




PACCAR's History in the 1900s. Clockwise from top: Seattle Car Mfg in 1909, Pacific Car & Foundry's Railroad car in 1950, Kenworth T-10 truck and T28 Super Heavy Tank during WW 2


After World War II ended, Pacific Car was a part of the federal government’s Mobilization Planning Program, which meant that it promised to devote 100 percent of its facilities to military production in the event of a national emergency. The company was a prime contractor during the Korean War for producing tanks. Pacific Car chose to subcontract many of the necessary parts, boosting smaller businesses in the state.[17][23][24] In 1945 Pacific Car purchased the Kenworth Motor Truck Corporation which was named after the stockholders Harry Kent and Edgar Worthington.. Kenworth had been producing trucks in Seattle since it was incorporated in 1923. During World War II, Kenworth produced trucks, airplane assemblies and sub-assemblies for the United States military. As the war drew to an end Kenworth shifted attention to production of commercial trucks for the postwar market. In 1956 Kenworth lost independent status and became a division directly under Pacific Car and Foundry.[25]
In 1954, Pacific Car acquired the Dart Truck Company of Kansas City, Missouri, and the Peterbilt Motors Company, of Oakland, California. Dart built primarily heavy off-highway dump trucks and specialty vehicles. Peterbilt had been a major competitor with Kenworth, producing many kinds of trucks and buses. Peterbilt operated as Pacific Car’s wholly owned subsidiary until 1960, following which it was dissolved and made a division of Pacific Car and Foundry.[26][27][28] Pacific Car’s structural steel division made the steel used to build the 50-story Seattle-First National Bank headquarters and to build Seattle’s Space Needle in 1961. The firm provided 5,668 steel panels, weighing 58,000 tons, which formed a major part of the load bearing walls for New York City's World Trade Center twin towers. The World Trade Center, like the Sea-First building, bore the building’s load on the exterior walls rather than on an interior structural skeleton. The steel panels were shipped by rail from Seattle to New York City on more than 1,600 railcars. Pacific Car was the largest contractor of the 13 steel fabricators that provided steel for the World Trade Center towers.[15][29][30][31]
The 1970s to 1990s[edit]
Despite a serious slowdown due to National Recessions during 1974, PACCAR continued to generate increasing sales throughout the 1970s. PACCAR purchased Wagner Mining Company in 1975, which built underground Mining Vehicles, International Car Company in 1975 and Foden Trucks a British truck manufacturer in 1980.[32][33] Fodens sold trucks in Europe and Africa.[34][35][36] PACCAR International was formed in 1972 that promoted exports worldwide.[37][38] PACCAR Technical Center was established in 1980 in Mount Vernon, Washington as a research and testing facility. The facility included test tracks, engine test cells, materials test laboratories and structural laboratories. The tech center conducts an Open House event every April that coincides with the Skagit Valley Tulip Festival.[39][40] In 1983 the International Car Co Division in Kenton Ohio, which had been acquired on December 1, 1975,[41] was disbanded.[42] In 1983 the PACCAR Rail Leasing Inc subsidiary in Renton WA and the RAILEASE Inc subsidiary in Bellevue WA were disbanded.[43] In 1986 the Pacific Car and Foundry subsidiary in Renton WA was renamed to PACCAR Defense Systems Division.[44] In 1984 PACCAR posted record sales in its history of $2.25 billion.[45][46]
In the mid 1980s, PACCAR's share of Class 8 trucks dropped to about 18% owing to aggressive competition from Freightliner Trucks, which is a subsidiary of Daimler AG and the merged operations of Volvo White and General. This competition forced PACCAR to close its Kenworth assembly plant in Kansas City in April, 1986 and its Peterbilt plant in Newark, California, the following October.[47] PACCAR acquired Trico Industries in 1986 which was a manufacturer of oil exploration equipment based in Gardena, California for $65 million in order to reduce its dependence on the Class 8 Truck market.[48][49] During the mid-80's PACCAR was negotiating with the Rover Group, for acquiring its British Leyland truck division. However, Rover management decided to sell the truck division to DAF Trucks which was a Dutch automotive concern. Its Dart Truck Company and Wagner Mining Equipment Company were sold in 1984 and 1989 in order to remain profitable.[50][51] In 1987, PACCAR acquired Al’s Auto Supply and Grand Auto Incorporated which led to its entry into the automotive parts & accessories retail market that gave the company greater ability to weather periods of national economic downturn.[52][53][54]
The 1990s and beyond[edit]
PACCAR Parts was created in 1992 in Renton, Washington. The building it was housed in occupied part of the company’s historic Pacific Car and Foundry site. In the same year, PACCAR purchased a 21 percent stake in Wood Group ESP which added to its oil field equipment manufacturing.[55][56][57] In 1993, PACCAR acquired a line of winches from heavy equipment manufacturer Caterpillar. The same year it brought a new plant in Washington on line to help meet the increased demand for trucks. In 1994 the company began selling in New Zealand for the first time and entered new countries in Asia and Central and South America. The company made its Mexican joint venture VILPAC, S.A., a wholly owned subsidiary in 1995. PACCAR's Winch division was one of the world’s largest manufacturer of industrial winches by 1994.[58][59]
PACCAR International marketed trucks to more than 40 countries, and was one of the largest exporters of capital goods in North America by 1995. Kenworth truck factory in Renton, Washington was opened on June 4, 1993.[60] In 1997 Mark Pigott assumed PACCAR's presidency as Charles Pigott retired in 1997.[61] In 1996 & 1998 the company spent $543 million to acquire DAF Trucks N.V. based in the Netherlands and Leyland Trucks Ltd., an acquisition it first pursued back in the mid-1980s. These acquisitions were funded in part by the sale of Trico Industries to EVI in 1997.[62][63][64][65] Financial and leasing subsidiaries also performed well in the late 1990s. Also, in 1998 PACCAR acquired UK-based Leyland Trucks for its light and medium truck (6 to 44 metric tons) design and manufacture capability. With its Peterbilt, Kenworth, and DAF nameplates, PACCAR ranks second in production numbers in the United States and third in production numbers globally in "big rig" truck production; behind Daimler AG in the US market. Other Major heavy-truck competitors include Navistar International and AB Volvo.[66][67][68][69]

PACCAR Inc is an American Fortune 500 company[6] and counts among the largest manufacturers of medium- and heavy-duty trucks in the world,[7][8] and has substantial manufacturing in light and medium vehicles through its various subsidiaries. For its leadership in the development of aerodynamic, lightweight commercial vehicles that has led to reduced fuel consumption and increased efficiencies, PACCAR Inc was awarded the National Medal of Technology at the White House in 2006.[9][10] The company’s presence has been especially strong in Renton, Washington, where it remains the oldest continually operating business. PACCAR's assembly plant in Renton was recognized as one of the best workplaces for commuters for the fifth consecutive year by the National Center for Transit Research in June 2013. The plant also celebrated its 20th anniversary in June 2013 and has produced more than 130,000 heavy-duty and medium-duty Kenworth trucks since it started its operations in 1993.[11][12][13]

History[edit]




Seattle Car and Foundry works at Renton, Washington, 1916.


PACCAR Inc started as Seattle Car Manufacturing Company in 1905 with a capitalization of $10,000 and was founded by William Pigott, Sr., its original business was the production of railway and logging equipment. The company built a new factory in Renton in 1909 after its Duwamish facility was destroyed in fire as well as to fulfill large number of orders.[14] In 1917 it merged with a Portland firm, Twohy Brothers which was its only competitor on the west coast at the time and company was renamed as Pacific Car and Foundry Company. The company manufactured horse or oxen-drawn logging trucks built specifically to address the dense, hilly forests in which the Northwest logging industry operated to transport massive logs. The following years the company specialized in designing air brakes, open cars, refrigerated boxcars for shipment of perishable items and the universal trailer which could be pulled by a truck.[15] The company also manufactured structural steel that was finished by hand that was used to create columns and girders that went into many a Seattle landmark building.[16][17] In 1924, the founder, William Pigott sold a controlling interest in the company to American Car and Foundry Company. However, his son, Paul Pigott reacquired a significant interest in the company from American Car and Foundry Company in 1934.[18][19]
During the Great Depression in 1930 despite the stock market crash, the company's earnings rose; but as the Great Depression deepened, Pacific Car and Foundry became one of the most depressed businesses in the Northwest.[20] During the late 1930s, Pacific Car and Foundry received government contracts for steel fabrication for construction of Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge as well as orders from other companies.[21]
During World War II[edit]
During World War II, Pacific Car and Foundry’s sales grew due to an increased demand for steel used in airplanes, airports, bridges, naval ships, highways and other equipment that helped build America’s infrastructure to support the war effort. Pacific Car also sub-contracted for Boeing, building aluminum wingspans for B-17 bombers. During the spring of 1942 the company also built M4A1 Shermans tanks for the U.S. Army. The company was able to cast almost all the parts for the tanks at its own foundry. Other notable vehicles that were built included the M25 Tank Transporter, known as the Dragon Wagon, and the T28 Super Heavy Tank.[17] Everett-Pacific Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Company was established in 1942 that built ships and other marine products for the US Navy in Port Gardner Bay in Everett. It was bought by Pacific Car and Foundry in 1944.[22]
Post war[edit]




PACCAR's History in the 1900s. Clockwise from top: Seattle Car Mfg in 1909, Pacific Car & Foundry's Railroad car in 1950, Kenworth T-10 truck and T28 Super Heavy Tank during WW 2


After World War II ended, Pacific Car was a part of the federal government’s Mobilization Planning Program, which meant that it promised to devote 100 percent of its facilities to military production in the event of a national emergency. The company was a prime contractor during the Korean War for producing tanks. Pacific Car chose to subcontract many of the necessary parts, boosting smaller businesses in the state.[17][23][24] In 1945 Pacific Car purchased the Kenworth Motor Truck Corporation which was named after the stockholders Harry Kent and Edgar Worthington.. Kenworth had been producing trucks in Seattle since it was incorporated in 1923. During World War II, Kenworth produced trucks, airplane assemblies and sub-assemblies for the United States military. As the war drew to an end Kenworth shifted attention to production of commercial trucks for the postwar market. In 1956 Kenworth lost independent status and became a division directly under Pacific Car and Foundry.[25]
In 1954, Pacific Car acquired the Dart Truck Company of Kansas City, Missouri, and the Peterbilt Motors Company, of Oakland, California. Dart built primarily heavy off-highway dump trucks and specialty vehicles. Peterbilt had been a major competitor with Kenworth, producing many kinds of trucks and buses. Peterbilt operated as Pacific Car’s wholly owned subsidiary until 1960, following which it was dissolved and made a division of Pacific Car and Foundry.[26][27][28] Pacific Car’s structural steel division made the steel used to build the 50-story Seattle-First National Bank headquarters and to build Seattle’s Space Needle in 1961. The firm provided 5,668 steel panels, weighing 58,000 tons, which formed a major part of the load bearing walls for New York City's World Trade Center twin towers. The World Trade Center, like the Sea-First building, bore the building’s load on the exterior walls rather than on an interior structural skeleton. The steel panels were shipped by rail from Seattle to New York City on more than 1,600 railcars. Pacific Car was the largest contractor of the 13 steel fabricators that provided steel for the World Trade Center towers.[15][29][30][31]
The 1970s to 1990s[edit]
Despite a serious slowdown due to National Recessions during 1974, PACCAR continued to generate increasing sales throughout the 1970s. PACCAR purchased Wagner Mining Company in 1975, which built underground Mining Vehicles, International Car Company in 1975 and Foden Trucks a British truck manufacturer in 1980.[32][33] Fodens sold trucks in Europe and Africa.[34][35][36] PACCAR International was formed in 1972 that promoted exports worldwide.[37][38] PACCAR Technical Center was established in 1980 in Mount Vernon, Washington as a research and testing facility. The facility included test tracks, engine test cells, materials test laboratories and structural laboratories. The tech center conducts an Open House event every April that coincides with the Skagit Valley Tulip Festival.[39][40] In 1983 the International Car Co Division in Kenton Ohio, which had been acquired on December 1, 1975,[41] was disbanded.[42] In 1983 the PACCAR Rail Leasing Inc subsidiary in Renton WA and the RAILEASE Inc subsidiary in Bellevue WA were disbanded.[43] In 1986 the Pacific Car and Foundry subsidiary in Renton WA was renamed to PACCAR Defense Systems Division.[44] In 1984 PACCAR posted record sales in its history of $2.25 billion.[45][46]
In the mid 1980s, PACCAR's share of Class 8 trucks dropped to about 18% owing to aggressive competition from Freightliner Trucks, which is a subsidiary of Daimler AG and the merged operations of Volvo White and General. This competition forced PACCAR to close its Kenworth assembly plant in Kansas City in April, 1986 and its Peterbilt plant in Newark, California, the following October.[47] PACCAR acquired Trico Industries in 1986 which was a manufacturer of oil exploration equipment based in Gardena, California for $65 million in order to reduce its dependence on the Class 8 Truck market.[48][49] During the mid-80's PACCAR was negotiating with the Rover Group, for acquiring its British Leyland truck division. However, Rover management decided to sell the truck division to DAF Trucks which was a Dutch automotive concern. Its Dart Truck Company and Wagner Mining Equipment Company were sold in 1984 and 1989 in order to remain profitable.[50][51] In 1987, PACCAR acquired Al’s Auto Supply and Grand Auto Incorporated which led to its entry into the automotive parts & accessories retail market that gave the company greater ability to weather periods of national economic downturn.[52][53][54]
The 1990s and beyond[edit]
PACCAR Parts was created in 1992 in Renton, Washington. The building it was housed in occupied part of the company’s historic Pacific Car and Foundry site. In the same year, PACCAR purchased a 21 percent stake in Wood Group ESP which added to its oil field equipment manufacturing.[55][56][57] In 1993, PACCAR acquired a line of winches from heavy equipment manufacturer Caterpillar. The same year it brought a new plant in Washington on line to help meet the increased demand for trucks. In 1994 the company began selling in New Zealand for the first time and entered new countries in Asia and Central and South America. The company made its Mexican joint venture VILPAC, S.A., a wholly owned subsidiary in 1995. PACCAR's Winch division was one of the world’s largest manufacturer of industrial winches by 1994.[58][59]
PACCAR International marketed trucks to more than 40 countries, and was one of the largest exporters of capital goods in North America by 1995. Kenworth truck factory in Renton, Washington was opened on June 4, 1993.[60] In 1997 Mark Pigott assumed PACCAR's presidency as Charles Pigott retired in 1997.[61] In 1996 & 1998 the company spent $543 million to acquire DAF Trucks N.V. based in the Netherlands and Leyland Trucks Ltd., an acquisition it first pursued back in the mid-1980s. These acquisitions were funded in part by the sale of Trico Industries to EVI in 1997.[62][63][64][65] Financial and leasing subsidiaries also performed well in the late 1990s. Also, in 1998 PACCAR acquired UK-based Leyland Trucks for its light and medium truck (6 to 44 metric tons) design and manufacture capability. With its Peterbilt, Kenworth, and DAF nameplates, PACCAR ranks second in production numbers in the United States and third in production numbers globally in "big rig" truck production; behind Daimler AG in the US market. Other Major heavy-truck competitors include Navistar International and AB Volvo.[66][67][68][69]

PACCAR Inc is an American Fortune 500 company[6] and counts among the largest manufacturers of medium- and heavy-duty trucks in the world,[7][8] and has substantial manufacturing in light and medium vehicles through its various subsidiaries. For its leadership in the development of aerodynamic, lightweight commercial vehicles that has led to reduced fuel consumption and increased efficiencies, PACCAR Inc was awarded the National Medal of Technology at the White House in 2006.[9][10] The company’s presence has been especially strong in Renton, Washington, where it remains the oldest continually operating business. PACCAR's assembly plant in Renton was recognized as one of the best workplaces for commuters for the fifth consecutive year by the National Center for Transit Research in June 2013. The plant also celebrated its 20th anniversary in June 2013 and has produced more than 130,000 heavy-duty and medium-duty Kenworth trucks since it started its operations in 1993.[11][12][13]

History[edit]




Seattle Car and Foundry works at Renton, Washington, 1916.


PACCAR Inc started as Seattle Car Manufacturing Company in 1905 with a capitalization of $10,000 and was founded by William Pigott, Sr., its original business was the production of railway and logging equipment. The company built a new factory in Renton in 1909 after its Duwamish facility was destroyed in fire as well as to fulfill large number of orders.[14] In 1917 it merged with a Portland firm, Twohy Brothers which was its only competitor on the west coast at the time and company was renamed as Pacific Car and Foundry Company. The company manufactured horse or oxen-drawn logging trucks built specifically to address the dense, hilly forests in which the Northwest logging industry operated to transport massive logs. The following years the company specialized in designing air brakes, open cars, refrigerated boxcars for shipment of perishable items and the universal trailer which could be pulled by a truck.[15] The company also manufactured structural steel that was finished by hand that was used to create columns and girders that went into many a Seattle landmark building.[16][17] In 1924, the founder, William Pigott sold a controlling interest in the company to American Car and Foundry Company. However, his son, Paul Pigott reacquired a significant interest in the company from American Car and Foundry Company in 1934.[18][19]
During the Great Depression in 1930 despite the stock market crash, the company's earnings rose; but as the Great Depression deepened, Pacific Car and Foundry became one of the most depressed businesses in the Northwest.[20] During the late 1930s, Pacific Car and Foundry received government contracts for steel fabrication for construction of Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge as well as orders from other companies.[21]
During World War II[edit]
During World War II, Pacific Car and Foundry’s sales grew due to an increased demand for steel used in airplanes, airports, bridges, naval ships, highways and other equipment that helped build America’s infrastructure to support the war effort. Pacific Car also sub-contracted for Boeing, building aluminum wingspans for B-17 bombers. During the spring of 1942 the company also built M4A1 Shermans tanks for the U.S. Army. The company was able to cast almost all the parts for the tanks at its own foundry. Other notable vehicles that were built included the M25 Tank Transporter, known as the Dragon Wagon, and the T28 Super Heavy Tank.[17] Everett-Pacific Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Company was established in 1942 that built ships and other marine products for the US Navy in Port Gardner Bay in Everett. It was bought by Pacific Car and Foundry in 1944.[22]
Post war[edit]




PACCAR's History in the 1900s. Clockwise from top: Seattle Car Mfg in 1909, Pacific Car & Foundry's Railroad car in 1950, Kenworth T-10 truck and T28 Super Heavy Tank during WW 2


After World War II ended, Pacific Car was a part of the federal government’s Mobilization Planning Program, which meant that it promised to devote 100 percent of its facilities to military production in the event of a national emergency. The company was a prime contractor during the Korean War for producing tanks. Pacific Car chose to subcontract many of the necessary parts, boosting smaller businesses in the state.[17][23][24] In 1945 Pacific Car purchased the Kenworth Motor Truck Corporation which was named after the stockholders Harry Kent and Edgar Worthington.. Kenworth had been producing trucks in Seattle since it was incorporated in 1923. During World War II, Kenworth produced trucks, airplane assemblies and sub-assemblies for the United States military. As the war drew to an end Kenworth shifted attention to production of commercial trucks for the postwar market. In 1956 Kenworth lost independent status and became a division directly under Pacific Car and Foundry.[25]
In 1954, Pacific Car acquired the Dart Truck Company of Kansas City, Missouri, and the Peterbilt Motors Company, of Oakland, California. Dart built primarily heavy off-highway dump trucks and specialty vehicles. Peterbilt had been a major competitor with Kenworth, producing many kinds of trucks and buses. Peterbilt operated as Pacific Car’s wholly owned subsidiary until 1960, following which it was dissolved and made a division of Pacific Car and Foundry.[26][27][28] Pacific Car’s structural steel division made the steel used to build the 50-story Seattle-First National Bank headquarters and to build Seattle’s Space Needle in 1961. The firm provided 5,668 steel panels, weighing 58,000 tons, which formed a major part of the load bearing walls for New York City's World Trade Center twin towers. The World Trade Center, like the Sea-First building, bore the building’s load on the exterior walls rather than on an interior structural skeleton. The steel panels were shipped by rail from Seattle to New York City on more than 1,600 railcars. Pacific Car was the largest contractor of the 13 steel fabricators that provided steel for the World Trade Center towers.[15][29][30][31]
The 1970s to 1990s[edit]
Despite a serious slowdown due to National Recessions during 1974, PACCAR continued to generate increasing sales throughout the 1970s. PACCAR purchased Wagner Mining Company in 1975, which built underground Mining Vehicles, International Car Company in 1975 and Foden Trucks a British truck manufacturer in 1980.[32][33] Fodens sold trucks in Europe and Africa.[34][35][36] PACCAR International was formed in 1972 that promoted exports worldwide.[37][38] PACCAR Technical Center was established in 1980 in Mount Vernon, Washington as a research and testing facility. The facility included test tracks, engine test cells, materials test laboratories and structural laboratories. The tech center conducts an Open House event every April that coincides with the Skagit Valley Tulip Festival.[39][40] In 1983 the International Car Co Division in Kenton Ohio, which had been acquired on December 1, 1975,[41] was disbanded.[42] In 1983 the PACCAR Rail Leasing Inc subsidiary in Renton WA and the RAILEASE Inc subsidiary in Bellevue WA were disbanded.[43] In 1986 the Pacific Car and Foundry subsidiary in Renton WA was renamed to PACCAR Defense Systems Division.[44] In 1984 PACCAR posted record sales in its history of $2.25 billion.[45][46]
In the mid 1980s, PACCAR's share of Class 8 trucks dropped to about 18% owing to aggressive competition from Freightliner Trucks, which is a subsidiary of Daimler AG and the merged operations of Volvo White and General. This competition forced PACCAR to close its Kenworth assembly plant in Kansas City in April, 1986 and its Peterbilt plant in Newark, California, the following October.[47] PACCAR acquired Trico Industries in 1986 which was a manufacturer of oil exploration equipment based in Gardena, California for $65 million in order to reduce its dependence on the Class 8 Truck market.[48][49] During the mid-80's PACCAR was negotiating with the Rover Group, for acquiring its British Leyland truck division. However, Rover management decided to sell the truck division to DAF Trucks which was a Dutch automotive concern. Its Dart Truck Company and Wagner Mining Equipment Company were sold in 1984 and 1989 in order to remain profitable.[50][51] In 1987, PACCAR acquired Al’s Auto Supply and Grand Auto Incorporated which led to its entry into the automotive parts & accessories retail market that gave the company greater ability to weather periods of national economic downturn.[52][53][54]
The 1990s and beyond[edit]
PACCAR Parts was created in 1992 in Renton, Washington. The building it was housed in occupied part of the company’s historic Pacific Car and Foundry site. In the same year, PACCAR purchased a 21 percent stake in Wood Group ESP which added to its oil field equipment manufacturing.[55][56][57] In 1993, PACCAR acquired a line of winches from heavy equipment manufacturer Caterpillar. The same year it brought a new plant in Washington on line to help meet the increased demand for trucks. In 1994 the company began selling in New Zealand for the first time and entered new countries in Asia and Central and South America. The company made its Mexican joint venture VILPAC, S.A., a wholly owned subsidiary in 1995. PACCAR's Winch division was one of the world’s largest manufacturer of industrial winches by 1994.[58][59]
PACCAR International marketed trucks to more than 40 countries, and was one of the largest exporters of capital goods in North America by 1995. Kenworth truck factory in Renton, Washington was opened on June 4, 1993.[60] In 1997 Mark Pigott assumed PACCAR's presidency as Charles Pigott retired in 1997.[61] In 1996 & 1998 the company spent $543 million to acquire DAF Trucks N.V. based in the Netherlands and Leyland Trucks Ltd., an acquisition it first pursued back in the mid-1980s. These acquisitions were funded in part by the sale of Trico Industries to EVI in 1997.[62][63][64][65] Financial and leasing subsidiaries also performed well in the late 1990s. Also, in 1998 PACCAR acquired UK-based Leyland Trucks for its light and medium truck (6 to 44 metric tons) design and manufacture capability. With its Peterbilt, Kenworth, and DAF nameplates, PACCAR ranks second in production numbers in the United States and third in production numbers globally in "big rig" truck production; behind Daimler AG in the US market. Other Major heavy-truck competitors include Navistar International and AB Volvo.[66][67][68][69]

PACCAR Inc is an American Fortune 500 company[6] and counts among the largest manufacturers of medium- and heavy-duty trucks in the world,[7][8] and has substantial manufacturing in light and medium vehicles through its various subsidiaries. For its leadership in the development of aerodynamic, lightweight commercial vehicles that has led to reduced fuel consumption and increased efficiencies, PACCAR Inc was awarded the National Medal of Technology at the White House in 2006.[9][10] The company’s presence has been especially strong in Renton, Washington, where it remains the oldest continually operating business. PACCAR's assembly plant in Renton was recognized as one of the best workplaces for commuters for the fifth consecutive year by the National Center for Transit Research in June 2013. The plant also celebrated its 20th anniversary in June 2013 and has produced more than 130,000 heavy-duty and medium-duty Kenworth trucks since it started its operations in 1993.[11][12][13]

History[edit]




Seattle Car and Foundry works at Renton, Washington, 1916.


PACCAR Inc started as Seattle Car Manufacturing Company in 1905 with a capitalization of $10,000 and was founded by William Pigott, Sr., its original business was the production of railway and logging equipment. The company built a new factory in Renton in 1909 after its Duwamish facility was destroyed in fire as well as to fulfill large number of orders.[14] In 1917 it merged with a Portland firm, Twohy Brothers which was its only competitor on the west coast at the time and company was renamed as Pacific Car and Foundry Company. The company manufactured horse or oxen-drawn logging trucks built specifically to address the dense, hilly forests in which the Northwest logging industry operated to transport massive logs. The following years the company specialized in designing air brakes, open cars, refrigerated boxcars for shipment of perishable items and the universal trailer which could be pulled by a truck.[15] The company also manufactured structural steel that was finished by hand that was used to create columns and girders that went into many a Seattle landmark building.[16][17] In 1924, the founder, William Pigott sold a controlling interest in the company to American Car and Foundry Company. However, his son, Paul Pigott reacquired a significant interest in the company from American Car and Foundry Company in 1934.[18][19]
During the Great Depression in 1930 despite the stock market crash, the company's earnings rose; but as the Great Depression deepened, Pacific Car and Foundry became one of the most depressed businesses in the Northwest.[20] During the late 1930s, Pacific Car and Foundry received government contracts for steel fabrication for construction of Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge as well as orders from other companies.[21]
During World War II[edit]
During World War II, Pacific Car and Foundry’s sales grew due to an increased demand for steel used in airplanes, airports, bridges, naval ships, highways and other equipment that helped build America’s infrastructure to support the war effort. Pacific Car also sub-contracted for Boeing, building aluminum wingspans for B-17 bombers. During the spring of 1942 the company also built M4A1 Shermans tanks for the U.S. Army. The company was able to cast almost all the parts for the tanks at its own foundry. Other notable vehicles that were built included the M25 Tank Transporter, known as the Dragon Wagon, and the T28 Super Heavy Tank.[17] Everett-Pacific Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Company was established in 1942 that built ships and other marine products for the US Navy in Port Gardner Bay in Everett. It was bought by Pacific Car and Foundry in 1944.[22]
Post war[edit]




PACCAR's History in the 1900s. Clockwise from top: Seattle Car Mfg in 1909, Pacific Car & Foundry's Railroad car in 1950, Kenworth T-10 truck and T28 Super Heavy Tank during WW 2


After World War II ended, Pacific Car was a part of the federal government’s Mobilization Planning Program, which meant that it promised to devote 100 percent of its facilities to military production in the event of a national emergency. The company was a prime contractor during the Korean War for producing tanks. Pacific Car chose to subcontract many of the necessary parts, boosting smaller businesses in the state.[17][23][24] In 1945 Pacific Car purchased the Kenworth Motor Truck Corporation which was named after the stockholders Harry Kent and Edgar Worthington.. Kenworth had been producing trucks in Seattle since it was incorporated in 1923. During World War II, Kenworth produced trucks, airplane assemblies and sub-assemblies for the United States military. As the war drew to an end Kenworth shifted attention to production of commercial trucks for the postwar market. In 1956 Kenworth lost independent status and became a division directly under Pacific Car and Foundry.[25]
In 1954, Pacific Car acquired the Dart Truck Company of Kansas City, Missouri, and the Peterbilt Motors Company, of Oakland, California. Dart built primarily heavy off-highway dump trucks and specialty vehicles. Peterbilt had been a major competitor with Kenworth, producing many kinds of trucks and buses. Peterbilt operated as Pacific Car’s wholly owned subsidiary until 1960, following which it was dissolved and made a division of Pacific Car and Foundry.[26][27][28] Pacific Car’s structural steel division made the steel used to build the 50-story Seattle-First National Bank headquarters and to build Seattle’s Space Needle in 1961. The firm provided 5,668 steel panels, weighing 58,000 tons, which formed a major part of the load bearing walls for New York City's World Trade Center twin towers. The World Trade Center, like the Sea-First building, bore the building’s load on the exterior walls rather than on an interior structural skeleton. The steel panels were shipped by rail from Seattle to New York City on more than 1,600 railcars. Pacific Car was the largest contractor of the 13 steel fabricators that provided steel for the World Trade Center towers.[15][29][30][31]
The 1970s to 1990s[edit]
Despite a serious slowdown due to National Recessions during 1974, PACCAR continued to generate increasing sales throughout the 1970s. PACCAR purchased Wagner Mining Company in 1975, which built underground Mining Vehicles, International Car Company in 1975 and Foden Trucks a British truck manufacturer in 1980.[32][33] Fodens sold trucks in Europe and Africa.[34][35][36] PACCAR International was formed in 1972 that promoted exports worldwide.[37][38] PACCAR Technical Center was established in 1980 in Mount Vernon, Washington as a research and testing facility. The facility included test tracks, engine test cells, materials test laboratories and structural laboratories. The tech center conducts an Open House event every April that coincides with the Skagit Valley Tulip Festival.[39][40] In 1983 the International Car Co Division in Kenton Ohio, which had been acquired on December 1, 1975,[41] was disbanded.[42] In 1983 the PACCAR Rail Leasing Inc subsidiary in Renton WA and the RAILEASE Inc subsidiary in Bellevue WA were disbanded.[43] In 1986 the Pacific Car and Foundry subsidiary in Renton WA was renamed to PACCAR Defense Systems Division.[44] In 1984 PACCAR posted record sales in its history of $2.25 billion.[45][46]
In the mid 1980s, PACCAR's share of Class 8 trucks dropped to about 18% owing to aggressive competition from Freightliner Trucks, which is a subsidiary of Daimler AG and the merged operations of Volvo White and General. This competition forced PACCAR to close its Kenworth assembly plant in Kansas City in April, 1986 and its Peterbilt plant in Newark, California, the following October.[47] PACCAR acquired Trico Industries in 1986 which was a manufacturer of oil exploration equipment based in Gardena, California for $65 million in order to reduce its dependence on the Class 8 Truck market.[48][49] During the mid-80's PACCAR was negotiating with the Rover Group, for acquiring its British Leyland truck division. However, Rover management decided to sell the truck division to DAF Trucks which was a Dutch automotive concern. Its Dart Truck Company and Wagner Mining Equipment Company were sold in 1984 and 1989 in order to remain profitable.[50][51] In 1987, PACCAR acquired Al’s Auto Supply and Grand Auto Incorporated which led to its entry into the automotive parts & accessories retail market that gave the company greater ability to weather periods of national economic downturn.[52][53][54]
The 1990s and beyond[edit]
PACCAR Parts was created in 1992 in Renton, Washington. The building it was housed in occupied part of the company’s historic Pacific Car and Foundry site. In the same year, PACCAR purchased a 21 percent stake in Wood Group ESP which added to its oil field equipment manufacturing.[55][56][57] In 1993, PACCAR acquired a line of winches from heavy equipment manufacturer Caterpillar. The same year it brought a new plant in Washington on line to help meet the increased demand for trucks. In 1994 the company began selling in New Zealand for the first time and entered new countries in Asia and Central and South America. The company made its Mexican joint venture VILPAC, S.A., a wholly owned subsidiary in 1995. PACCAR's Winch division was one of the world’s largest manufacturer of industrial winches by 1994.[58][59]
PACCAR International marketed trucks to more than 40 countries, and was one of the largest exporters of capital goods in North America by 1995. Kenworth truck factory in Renton, Washington was opened on June 4, 1993.[60] In 1997 Mark Pigott assumed PACCAR's presidency as Charles Pigott retired in 1997.[61] In 1996 & 1998 the company spent $543 million to acquire DAF Trucks N.V. based in the Netherlands and Leyland Trucks Ltd., an acquisition it first pursued back in the mid-1980s. These acquisitions were funded in part by the sale of Trico Industries to EVI in 1997.[62][63][64][65] Financial and leasing subsidiaries also performed well in the late 1990s. Also, in 1998 PACCAR acquired UK-based Leyland Trucks for its light and medium truck (6 to 44 metric tons) design and manufacture capability. With its Peterbilt, Kenworth, and DAF nameplates, PACCAR ranks second in production numbers in the United States and third in production numbers globally in "big rig" truck production; behind Daimler AG in the US market. Other Major heavy-truck competitors include Navistar International and AB Volvo.[66][67][68][69]

PACCAR Inc is an American Fortune 500 company[6] and counts among the largest manufacturers of medium- and heavy-duty trucks in the world,[7][8] and has substantial manufacturing in light and medium vehicles through its various subsidiaries. For its leadership in the development of aerodynamic, lightweight commercial vehicles that has led to reduced fuel consumption and increased efficiencies, PACCAR Inc was awarded the National Medal of Technology at the White House in 2006.[9][10] The company’s presence has been especially strong in Renton, Washington, where it remains the oldest continually operating business. PACCAR's assembly plant in Renton was recognized as one of the best workplaces for commuters for the fifth consecutive year by the National Center for Transit Research in June 2013. The plant also celebrated its 20th anniversary in June 2013 and has produced more than 130,000 heavy-duty and medium-duty Kenworth trucks since it started its operations in 1993.[11][12][13]

History[edit]




Seattle Car and Foundry works at Renton, Washington, 1916.


PACCAR Inc started as Seattle Car Manufacturing Company in 1905 with a capitalization of $10,000 and was founded by William Pigott, Sr., its original business was the production of railway and logging equipment. The company built a new factory in Renton in 1909 after its Duwamish facility was destroyed in fire as well as to fulfill large number of orders.[14] In 1917 it merged with a Portland firm, Twohy Brothers which was its only competitor on the west coast at the time and company was renamed as Pacific Car and Foundry Company. The company manufactured horse or oxen-drawn logging trucks built specifically to address the dense, hilly forests in which the Northwest logging industry operated to transport massive logs. The following years the company specialized in designing air brakes, open cars, refrigerated boxcars for shipment of perishable items and the universal trailer which could be pulled by a truck.[15] The company also manufactured structural steel that was finished by hand that was used to create columns and girders that went into many a Seattle landmark building.[16][17] In 1924, the founder, William Pigott sold a controlling interest in the company to American Car and Foundry Company. However, his son, Paul Pigott reacquired a significant interest in the company from American Car and Foundry Company in 1934.[18][19]
During the Great Depression in 1930 despite the stock market crash, the company's earnings rose; but as the Great Depression deepened, Pacific Car and Foundry became one of the most depressed businesses in the Northwest.[20] During the late 1930s, Pacific Car and Foundry received government contracts for steel fabrication for construction of Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge as well as orders from other companies.[21]
During World War II[edit]
During World War II, Pacific Car and Foundry’s sales grew due to an increased demand for steel used in airplanes, airports, bridges, naval ships, highways and other equipment that helped build America’s infrastructure to support the war effort. Pacific Car also sub-contracted for Boeing, building aluminum wingspans for B-17 bombers. During the spring of 1942 the company also built M4A1 Shermans tanks for the U.S. Army. The company was able to cast almost all the parts for the tanks at its own foundry. Other notable vehicles that were built included the M25 Tank Transporter, known as the Dragon Wagon, and the T28 Super Heavy Tank.[17] Everett-Pacific Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Company was established in 1942 that built ships and other marine products for the US Navy in Port Gardner Bay in Everett. It was bought by Pacific Car and Foundry in 1944.[22]
Post war[edit]




PACCAR's History in the 1900s. Clockwise from top: Seattle Car Mfg in 1909, Pacific Car & Foundry's Railroad car in 1950, Kenworth T-10 truck and T28 Super Heavy Tank during WW 2


After World War II ended, Pacific Car was a part of the federal government’s Mobilization Planning Program, which meant that it promised to devote 100 percent of its facilities to military production in the event of a national emergency. The company was a prime contractor during the Korean War for producing tanks. Pacific Car chose to subcontract many of the necessary parts, boosting smaller businesses in the state.[17][23][24] In 1945 Pacific Car purchased the Kenworth Motor Truck Corporation which was named after the stockholders Harry Kent and Edgar Worthington.. Kenworth had been producing trucks in Seattle since it was incorporated in 1923. During World War II, Kenworth produced trucks, airplane assemblies and sub-assemblies for the United States military. As the war drew to an end Kenworth shifted attention to production of commercial trucks for the postwar market. In 1956 Kenworth lost independent status and became a division directly under Pacific Car and Foundry.[25]
In 1954, Pacific Car acquired the Dart Truck Company of Kansas City, Missouri, and the Peterbilt Motors Company, of Oakland, California. Dart built primarily heavy off-highway dump trucks and specialty vehicles. Peterbilt had been a major competitor with Kenworth, producing many kinds of trucks and buses. Peterbilt operated as Pacific Car’s wholly owned subsidiary until 1960, following which it was dissolved and made a division of Pacific Car and Foundry.[26][27][28] Pacific Car’s structural steel division made the steel used to build the 50-story Seattle-First National Bank headquarters and to build Seattle’s Space Needle in 1961. The firm provided 5,668 steel panels, weighing 58,000 tons, which formed a major part of the load bearing walls for New York City's World Trade Center twin towers. The World Trade Center, like the Sea-First building, bore the building’s load on the exterior walls rather than on an interior structural skeleton. The steel panels were shipped by rail from Seattle to New York City on more than 1,600 railcars. Pacific Car was the largest contractor of the 13 steel fabricators that provided steel for the World Trade Center towers.[15][29][30][31]
The 1970s to 1990s[edit]
Despite a serious slowdown due to National Recessions during 1974, PACCAR continued to generate increasing sales throughout the 1970s. PACCAR purchased Wagner Mining Company in 1975, which built underground Mining Vehicles, International Car Company in 1975 and Foden Trucks a British truck manufacturer in 1980.[32][33] Fodens sold trucks in Europe and Africa.[34][35][36] PACCAR International was formed in 1972 that promoted exports worldwide.[37][38] PACCAR Technical Center was established in 1980 in Mount Vernon, Washington as a research and testing facility. The facility included test tracks, engine test cells, materials test laboratories and structural laboratories. The tech center conducts an Open House event every April that coincides with the Skagit Valley Tulip Festival.[39][40] In 1983 the International Car Co Division in Kenton Ohio, which had been acquired on December 1, 1975,[41] was disbanded.[42] In 1983 the PACCAR Rail Leasing Inc subsidiary in Renton WA and the RAILEASE Inc subsidiary in Bellevue WA were disbanded.[43] In 1986 the Pacific Car and Foundry subsidiary in Renton WA was renamed to PACCAR Defense Systems Division.[44] In 1984 PACCAR posted record sales in its history of $2.25 billion.[45][46]
In the mid 1980s, PACCAR's share of Class 8 trucks dropped to about 18% owing to aggressive competition from Freightliner Trucks, which is a subsidiary of Daimler AG and the merged operations of Volvo White and General. This competition forced PACCAR to close its Kenworth assembly plant in Kansas City in April, 1986 and its Peterbilt plant in Newark, California, the following October.[47] PACCAR acquired Trico Industries in 1986 which was a manufacturer of oil exploration equipment based in Gardena, California for $65 million in order to reduce its dependence on the Class 8 Truck market.[48][49] During the mid-80's PACCAR was negotiating with the Rover Group, for acquiring its British Leyland truck division. However, Rover management decided to sell the truck division to DAF Trucks which was a Dutch automotive concern. Its Dart Truck Company and Wagner Mining Equipment Company were sold in 1984 and 1989 in order to remain profitable.[50][51] In 1987, PACCAR acquired Al’s Auto Supply and Grand Auto Incorporated which led to its entry into the automotive parts & accessories retail market that gave the company greater ability to weather periods of national economic downturn.[52][53][54]
The 1990s and beyond[edit]
PACCAR Parts was created in 1992 in Renton, Washington. The building it was housed in occupied part of the company’s historic Pacific Car and Foundry site. In the same year, PACCAR purchased a 21 percent stake in Wood Group ESP which added to its oil field equipment manufacturing.[55][56][57] In 1993, PACCAR acquired a line of winches from heavy equipment manufacturer Caterpillar. The same year it brought a new plant in Washington on line to help meet the increased demand for trucks. In 1994 the company began selling in New Zealand for the first time and entered new countries in Asia and Central and South America. The company made its Mexican joint venture VILPAC, S.A., a wholly owned subsidiary in 1995. PACCAR's Winch division was one of the world’s largest manufacturer of industrial winches by 1994.[58][59]
PACCAR International marketed trucks to more than 40 countries, and was one of the largest exporters of capital goods in North America by 1995. Kenworth truck factory in Renton, Washington was opened on June 4, 1993.[60] In 1997 Mark Pigott assumed PACCAR's presidency as Charles Pigott retired in 1997.[61] In 1996 & 1998 the company spent $543 million to acquire DAF Trucks N.V. based in the Netherlands and Leyland Trucks Ltd., an acquisition it first pursued back in the mid-1980s. These acquisitions were funded in part by the sale of Trico Industries to EVI in 1997.[62][63][64][65] Financial and leasing subsidiaries also performed well in the late 1990s. Also, in 1998 PACCAR acquired UK-based Leyland Trucks for its light and medium truck (6 to 44 metric tons) design and manufacture capability. With its Peterbilt, Kenworth, and DAF nameplates, PACCAR ranks second in production numbers in the United States and third in production numbers globally in "big rig" truck production; behind Daimler AG in the US market. Other Major heavy-truck competitors include Navistar International and AB Volvo.[66][67][68][69]

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Results of Operations  2016 Compared to 2015: Year ended December 31 2016 2015 % Change New business volume by product: Retail loans and direct financing leases $ 1,467.7 $ 1,744.1 (16 ) Equipment on operating leases 621.4 518.2 20 Dealer master notes 154.0 217.5 (29 ) $ 2,243.1 $ 2,479.8 (10 ) Average earning assets by product: Retail loans and direct financing leases $ 4,448.2 $ 4,308.7 3 Equipment on operating leases 1,433.4 1,353.0 6 Dealer wholesale financing 927.6 1,017.3 (9 ) Dealer master notes 30.9 59.9 (48 ) $ 6,840.1 $ 6,738.9 2 Revenue by product: Retail loans and direct financing leases $ 210.8 $ 201.0 5 Equipment on operating leases 351.4 337.0 4 Dealer wholesale financing 26.0 26.7 (3 ) Dealer master notes 1.0 1.9 (47 ) Used truck sales, other revenues and fees 34.5 37.5 (8 ) $ 623.7 $ 604.1 3 Income before income taxes $ 139.2 $ 182.2 (24 )  New Business Volume  New business volume from retail loans and direct financing leases in 2016 decreased 16% from 2015 due to lower retail sales of PACCAR trucks in 2016. Equipment on operating leases new business volume increased 20% in 2016 from 2015, attributable to higher fleet business in 2016. Dealer master notes new business volume in 2016 decreased 29% from 2015 due to lower retail truck sales resulting in decreased finance volume from dealers.  Market share on new PACCAR trucks was 23.3% in 2016 compared to 22.4% in 2015 due to increased fleet business.  The Company has programs to assign new lease and loan contracts to third parties to limit the risk of portfolio concentration with certain large customers and to generate new business. These transactions are accounted for as sales of the related retail loans, direct financing leases, or equipment on operating leases, and are excluded from new business volume. The Company sold retail loans and direct financing leases with a book value of $16.2 and $6.2 in 2016 and 2015, and received cash proceeds of $16.5 and $6.3 in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company sold equipment under operating leases with a book value of $4.8 and $11.3 in 2016 and 2015, and received cash proceeds of $5.0 and $11.6 in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company retains servicing responsibilities for these retail loans and leases, and fees received for servicing are deferred and recognized over the contract term.  Table of Contents  PACCAR Financial Corp.  (Millions of Dollars)  Income Before Income Taxes  The Company's income before income taxes was $139.2 in 2016 compared to $182.2 in 2015. The decrease in income before income taxes in 2016 was the result of lower operating lease margin of $18.5, lower finance margin of $12.6, higher provision for losses of $4.9, lower results from used trucks and other of $4.7, and higher selling, general and administrative expenses of $2.3.  Revenue and Expenses The major factors for the changes in interest and fee income, interest and other borrowing costs and finance margin in 2016 compared to 2015 are summarized below: Interest and Interest and Other Borrowing Finance Fee Income Costs Margin 2015 $ 234.9 $ 67.4 $ 167.5 Increase (decrease) Average finance receivables .9 .9 Average receivables from PACCAR and affiliates (.4 ) (.4 ) Average debt balances .5 (.5 ) Yields 3.7 3.7 Borrowing rates 16.3 (16.3 ) Total increase (decrease) 4.2 16.8 (12.6 ) 2016 $ 239.1 $ 84.2 $ 154.9   Average finance receivables in 2016 increased $20.8 as a result of retail portfolio new business volume exceeding collections.   Average receivables from PACCAR and affiliates decreased $33.5 in 2016 as a result of collections exceeding new loans to affiliated companies.   Average debt balances increased $34.2 in 2016. The higher average debt balances reflect funding for the higher average earning asset portfolio, including retail loans and finance leases and operating leases.   Average yields on finance receivables were 4.2% in 2016, compared to 4.1% in 2015. Yields increased primarily due to higher yields on receivables from PACCAR and affiliates (1.3% in 2016, compared to 1.1% in 2015).   Average borrowing rates in 2016 were 1.4% compared to 1.2% in 2015 due to higher debt market interest rates.  Table of Contents  PACCAR Financial Corp.  (Millions of Dollars)  The major factors for the changes in operating lease and rental revenues, depreciation and other rental expenses and operating lease margin in 2016 compared to 2015 are summarized below:   Operating Lease Depreciation and Rental and Other Operating Revenues Rental Expenses Lease Margin 2015 $ 337.0 $ 273.5 $ 63.5 Increase (decrease) Operating lease impairment 10.6 (10.6 ) Results on returned lease assets 8.8 (8.8 ) Average operating lease assets 20.6 17.4 3.2 Revenue and cost per asset (6.2 ) (3.9 ) (2.3 ) Total increase (decrease) 14.4 32.9 (18.5 ) 2016 $ 351.4 $ 306.4 $ 45.0   Operating lease impairments increased in 2016 reflecting lower used truck market prices.   Results on returned lease assets were lower in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to lower margin per unit sold.   Average operating lease assets increased as a result of higher volume of equipment placed in service from higher demand for leased vehicles.   Revenue per asset decreased driven by lower rental utilization and fuel surcharge revenue. Cost per asset decreased due to lower vehicle related expenses, including lower fuel expenses.  Used truck sales and other revenues and cost of used truck sales and other expenses are summarized below for 2016 compared to 2015:   Year ended December 31 2016 2015 Used truck sales and other revenues $ 33.2 $ 32.2 Cost of used truck sales and other expenses 32.1 26.4 Results from used trucks and other $ 1.1 $ 5.8  Results from used trucks and other decreased by $4.7, primarily due to impairments and loss on sales of used trucks resulting from lower used truck market prices ($1.5), and higher insurance expense ($1.3).  Table of Contents  PACCAR Financial Corp.  (Millions of Dollars)  Allowance for Credit Losses Year ended December 31 2016 2015 Balance at beginning of period $ 59.3 $ 56.0 Provision for losses 12.3 7.4 Charge-offs (13.5 ) (6.0 ) Recoveries 1.3 1.9 Balance at end of period $ 59.4 $ 59.3 Ratios: Charge-offs, net of recoveries ($12.2 in 2016) to average total portfolio ($5,406.7 in 2016) .23 % .08 % Allowance for credit losses ($59.4 in 2016) to year-end total portfolio ($5,294.3 in 2016) 1.12 % 1.07 % Year-end retail loan and lease receivables past due over 30 days ($13.5 in 2016) to year-end retail loan and lease receivables ($4,444.3 in 2016) .30 % .31 %  The provision for losses on receivables increased to $12.3 in 2016 from $7.4 in 2015 primarily due to losses from customers associated with the oil and gas exploration business.  Charge-offs, net of recoveries increased to $12.2 in 2016 from $4.1 in 2015 primarily due to customers associated with the oil and gas exploration business.  Retail loan and lease receivables past due over 30 days was .30% at December 31, 2016 compared to .31% at December 31, 2015. The Company continues to focus on maintaining low past due balances.  The estimation methods and factors considered for determining the allowance during the periods included in this filing have been consistently applied. See "Critical Accounting Policies", "Note A - Significant Accounting Policies" and "Note B - Finance and Other Receivables" for additional discussion regarding the Allowance for Credit Losses.  Table of Contents  PACCAR Financial Corp.  (Millions of Dollars)  Modifications  The Company modifies loans and finance leases in the normal course of its operations. The Company may modify loans and finance leases for commercial reasons or for credit reasons. Modifications for commercial reasons are changes to contract terms for customers that are not considered to be in financial difficulty. Insignificant delays are modifications extending terms up to three months for customers experiencing some short-term financial stress, but not considered to be in financial difficulty. Modifications for credit reasons are changes to contract terms for customers considered to be in financial difficulty. The Company's modifications typically result in granting more time to pay the contractual amounts owed and charging a fee and interest for the term of the modification. When considering whether to modify customer accounts for credit reasons, the Company evaluates the creditworthiness of the customers and modifies those accounts that the Company considers likely to perform under the modified terms. When the Company modifies loans and finance leases for credit reasons and grants a concession, the modifications are classified as troubled debt restructurings (TDR).  The post-modification balances of accounts modified during 2016 and 2015 are summarized below:   Year ended December 31 2016 2015 Recorded % of Total Recorded % of Total Investment Portfolio* Investment Portfolio* Commercial $ 205.7 3.9 % $ 114.7 2.1 % Insignificant Delay 69.1 1.3 % 39.1 .7 % Credit - No Concession 6.3 .1 % 2.2 Credit - TDR 17.8 .4 % 10.4 .2 % $ 298.9 5.7 % $ 166.4 3.0 %  * Recorded investment immediately after modification as a percentage of the year-end portfolio balance.  Total modification activity increased in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to modifications for commercial reasons reflecting higher volumes of refinancing, including contract modifications for one large customer. The increase in modifications for insignificant delay reflects more fleet customers requesting payment relief for up to three months. The increase in modifications for credit - TDR is due to the contract modifications of two large fleet customers in 2016.  When the Company modifies a 30+ days past due account, the customer is then generally considered current under the revised contractual terms. The Company modified $.7 of accounts during the fourth quarter of 2016 and $.1 of accounts during the fourth quarter of 2015 that were 30+ days past due and became current at the time of modification. Had these accounts not been modified and had they continued to not make payments, the pro forma percentage of retail loan and lease accounts 30+ days past due would have been as follows:   As of December 31 2016 2015 Pro forma percentage of retail loan and lease accounts 30+ days past due .32 % .31 % Modification of accounts in prior quarters that were more than 30 days past due at the time of modification are included in past dues if they were not performing under the modified terms at December 31, 2016 and 2015. The effect of the allowance for credit losses from such modifications was not significant at December 31, 2016 and 2015.  Table of Contents  PACCAR Financial Corp.  (Millions of Dollars)  Portfolio The Company's portfolio is concentrated with customers in the heavy- and medium-duty truck transportation industry. The portfolio is comprised of retail loans and leases, dealer wholesale financing and dealer master notes as follows: December 31 December 31 2016 2015 Retail loans $ 2,948.6 56 % $ 2,898.4 52 % Retail leases 1,495.7 28 % 1,552.0 28 % Dealer wholesale financing 760.3 15 % 967.1 18 % Dealer master notes 23.8 43.0 1 % Operating lease and other trade receivables 65.9 1 % 62.1 1 % Total portfolio $ 5,294.3 100 % $ 5,522.6 100 %  Retail loans increased to $2,948.6 at December 31, 2016 from $2,898.4 at December 31, 2015, due to new business volume exceeding collections.  Retail leases decreased to $1,495.7 at December 31, 2016 from $1,552.0 at December 31, 2015 reflecting collections exceeding new business volume.  Dealer wholesale financing balances decreased to $760.3 at December 31, 2016 from $967.1 at December 31, 2015 due to lower dealer new truck inventory.  Dealer master notes were $23.8 at December 31, 2016 compared to $43.0 at December 31, 2015. The dealer may pay the loans early or make additional draws up to specified balances of the contracts pledged to the Company. As of December 31, 2016, the underlying pledged contracts were $104.7 of which the dealers have $51.6 as potential additional borrowing capacity.  Income Taxes  The Company's effective income tax rate was 36.1% for 2016 compared to 38.1% for 2015, reflecting lower deferred state tax expense in 2016 compared to 2015 as a result of a lower state tax rate on the deferred tax liabilities.  The Company is included in the consolidated federal income tax return of PACCAR. Federal income taxes for the Company are determined on a separate return basis. State income taxes, where the Company files combined tax returns with PACCAR, are determined on a blended statutory rate, which is substantially the same as the rate computed on a separate return basis.  During 2016, the Company's deferred income tax provision was $30.2 compared to $7.9 during 2015. The Company's net deferred tax liability increased to $804.9 at December 31, 2016 from $773.7 at December 31, 2015 primarily due to higher benefits from accelerated depreciation. Deferred taxes are impacted by new business volume and the accelerated depreciation deduction rate under U.S. tax law. The difference in the timing of depreciation for financial statement and income tax purposes does not impact operating results and is not expected to have a significant impact on liquidity in 2017.  Table of Contents  PACCAR Financial Corp.  (Millions of Dollars)  2015 Compared to 2014: Year ended December 31 2015 2014 % Change New business volume by product: Retail loans and direct financing leases $ 1,744.1 $ 1,715.9 2 Equipment on operating leases 518.2 488.7 6 Dealer master notes 217.5 233.2 (7 ) $ 2,479.8 $ 2,437.8 2 Average earning assets by product: Retail loans and direct financing leases $ 4,308.7 $ 4,018.5 7 Equipment on operating leases 1,353.0 1,243.9 9 Dealer wholesale financing 1,017.3 666.7 53 Dealer master notes 59.9 74.3 (19 ) $ 6,738.9 $ 6,003.4 12 Revenue by product: Retail loans and direct financing leases $ 201.0 $ 191.2 5 Equipment on operating leases 337.0 324.6 4 Dealer wholesale financing 26.7 17.5 53 Dealer master notes 1.9 2.4 (21 ) Used truck sales, other revenues and fees 37.5 27.8 35 $ 604.1 $ 563.5 7 Income before income taxes $ 182.2 $ 175.0 4  Table of Contents  PACCAR Financial Corp.  (Millions of Dollars)  New Business Volume  New business volume from retail loans and direct financing leases in 2015 increased 2% from 2014 due to higher retail sales of PACCAR trucks in 2015. Equipment on operating leases new business volume increased 6% in 2015 from 2014, attributable to higher operating lease fleet business in 2015. Dealer master notes new business volume in 2015 decreased 7% from 2014 due to decreased finance volume from dealers.  Market share on new PACCAR trucks was 22.4% in 2015 compared to 24.4% in 2014 due to increased competition.  The Company has programs to assign new lease and loan contracts to third parties to limit the risk of portfolio concentration with certain large customers and to generate new business. These transactions are accounted for as sales of the related retail loans, direct financing leases, or equipment on operating leases, and are excluded from new business volume. The Company sold retail loans and direct financing leases with a book value of $6.2 and nil in 2015 and 2014, and received cash proceeds of $6.3 and nil in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Company sold equipment under operating leases with a book value of $11.3 and $19.1 in 2015 and 2014, and received cash proceeds of $11.6 and $19.5 in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Company retains servicing responsibilities for these retail loans and leases, and fees received for servicing are capitalized and recognized over the contract term.  Income Before Income Taxes  The Company's income before income taxes was $182.2 in 2015 compared to $175.0 in 2014. The increase in income before income taxes in 2015 was the result of higher finance margin of $12.2 and higher operating lease margin of $1.7, partially offset by lower results from used trucks and other of $2.3, higher selling, general and administrative expenses of $2.3, and higher provision for losses of $2.1.  Revenue and Expenses The major factors for the changes in interest and fee income, interest and other borrowing costs and finance margin in 2015 compared to 2014 are summarized below: Interest and Interest and Other Borrowing Finance Fee Income Costs Margin 2014 $ 215.6 $ 60.3 $ 155.3 Increase (decrease) Average finance receivables 25.9 25.9 Average receivables from PACCAR and affiliates (1.1 ) (1.1 ) Average debt balances 4.8 (4.8 ) Yields (5.5 ) (5.5 ) Borrowing rates 2.3 (2.3 ) Total increase 19.3 7.1 12.2 2015 $ 234.9 $ 67.4 $ 167.5   Average finance receivables in 2015 increased $626.4 as a result of higher dealer wholesale financing and retail portfolio growth.   Average receivables from PACCAR and affiliates decreased $99.4 in 2015 as a result of collections exceeding new loans to affiliated companies.   Average debt balances increased $421.5 in 2015. The higher average debt balances reflect funding for the higher average earning asset portfolio, including dealer wholesale financing, operating leases and retail loans and finance leases.   Average yields in 2015 were 4.1% compared to 4.3% in 2014. The lower yield was due to increased competition and a higher proportion of dealer wholesale financing, which typically has lower yield than the rest of the portfolio.   Average borrowing rates in 2015 were 1.2% compared to 1.1% in 2014 due to higher market rates.  Table of Contents  PACCAR Financial Corp.  (Millions of Dollars)  The major factors for the changes in operating lease and rental revenues, depreciation and other rental expenses and operating lease margin in 2015 compared to 2014 are summarized below:   Operating Lease Depreciation and Rental and Other Operating Revenues Rental Expenses Lease Margin 2014 $ 324.6 $ 262.8 $ 61.8 Increase (decrease) Results on returned lease assets 5.9 (5.9 ) Average operating lease assets 9.3 7.8 1.5 Revenue and cost per asset 3.1 (3.0 ) 6.1 Total increase 12.4 10.7 1.7 2015 $ 337.0 $ 273.5 $ 63.5   Results on returned lease assets were lower in 2015 compared to 2014 due to fewer units sold and lower gains per unit.   Average operating lease assets increased as a result of a higher volume of equipment placed in service.   Revenue per asset increased due to higher rental rates and increased miles driven, partially offset by lower fuel revenue. Cost per asset decreased due to lower vehicle related expenses, including lower fuel expenses.  . . .  Feb 21, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

Equipment on operating leases new business volume decreased to $94.0 in the first quarter of 2017 from $122.2 in the first quarter of 2016, primarily due to lower fleet business in 2017. Dealer master notes new business volume increased to $35.0 in the first quarter of 2017 from $27.3 in the first quarter of 2016 due to increased finance volume from dealers.  In the first quarter of 2017, market share on new PACCAR trucks was 19.8% compared to 19.4% in the first quarter of 2016.  - 22 -  Table of Contents  PACCAR FINANCIAL CORP. - FORM 10-Q  Income Before Income Taxes  The Company's income before income taxes was $20.0 for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $38.3 for the first quarter of 2016. The decrease in income before income taxes in 2017 was primarily the result of lower operating lease margin of $11.5, lower finance margin of $5.6 and higher provision for losses of $1.1.  Included in Other assets on the Company's Balance Sheets are used trucks held for sale, net of impairments, of $174.4 at March 31, 2017 and $205.5 at December 31, 2016. These trucks are primarily related to units returned from matured operating leases in the ordinary course of business, and may also include trucks acquired from repossessions or through acquisitions of used trucks in trades related to new truck sales. In the first quarter, the Company recognized losses on used trucks, excluding repossessions, of $13.3 in 2017 and $3.8 in 2016, including losses on multiple unit transactions of $8.5 in 2017 and $1.1 in 2016. Used truck losses related to repossessions, which are recognized as credit losses, were not significant for the first quarters of 2017 and 2016.  Revenue and Expenses The major factors for the change in interest and fee income, interest and other borrowing costs and finance margin for the three months ended March 31, 2017 are outlined in the table below: Interest and Interest and Other Borrowing Finance Fee Income Costs Margin Three Months Ended March 31, 2016 $ 59.2 $ 19.3 $ 39.9 (Decrease) increase Average finance receivables (2.5 ) (2.5 ) Average receivables from PACCAR and affiliates .6 .6 Average debt balances .5 (.5 ) Yields .4 .4 Borrowing rates 3.6 (3.6 ) Total (decrease) increase (1.5 ) 4.1 (5.6 ) Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 $ 57.7 $ 23.4 $ 34.3   Average finance receivables decreased $247.1 in the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to lower dealer wholesale financing and a lower retail portfolio.   Average receivables from PACCAR and affiliates increased $173.6 in the first quarter of 2017 as a result of new loans to affiliated companies exceeding collections.   Average debt balances increased $133.5 in the first quarter of 2017, reflecting funding requirements for the portfolio and affiliated companies.   Average yields increased primarily due to higher yields on receivables from PACCAR and affiliates (1.47% in the first quarter of 2017, compared to 1.23% in the first quarter of 2016). Average yields on customer finance receivables were 4.19% in the first quarter of 2017, compared to 4.21% in the first quarter of 2016.   Average borrowing rates in the first quarter of 2017 were 1.62% compared to 1.36% in the first quarter of 2016 due to higher debt market interest rates.  - 23 -  Table of Contents  PACCAR FINANCIAL CORP. - FORM 10-Q  The major factors for the change in operating lease and rental revenues, depreciation and other rental expenses and operating lease margin for the three months ended March 31, 2017 are outlined in the table below:   Operating Lease Depreciation and Rental and Other Operating Revenues Rental Expenses Lease Margin Three Months Ended March 31, 2016 $ 84.8 $ 72.3 $ 12.5 Increase (decrease) Operating lease impairment 4.1 (4.1 ) Results on returned lease assets 8.5 (8.5 ) Average operating lease assets 8.9 7.4 1.5 Revenue and cost per asset (1.0 ) (.6 ) (.4 ) Total increase (decrease) 7.9 19.4 (11.5 ) Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 $ 92.7 $ 91.7 $ 1.0   Operating lease impairments increased in 2017 reflecting higher operating lease assets and lower used truck market prices.   Results on returned lease assets were lower in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to higher losses on sales of returned lease units.   Average operating lease assets increased due to higher demand for leased vehicles compared to the volume of expiring leases.   Revenue and cost per asset decreased by $1.0 and $.6, respectively. Operating lease margin per asset decreased by $.4 primarily due to lower fleet utilization and lower vehicle related expenses.  Used truck sales and other revenues and cost of used truck sales and other expenses are summarized below for the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016:   Three Months Ended March 31 2017 2016 Used truck sales and other revenues $ 15.7 $ 6.7 Cost of used truck sales and other expenses 15.0 6.5 Results from used trucks and other $ .7 $ .2  Results from used trucks and other in the first quarter of 2017 increased by $.5 compared to the first quarter of 2016, primarily due to improved results from the sale of used trucks received on trade.  - 24 -  Table of Contents   PACCAR FINANCIAL CORP. - FORM 10-Q Allowance for Credit Losses The following table summarizes information on the Company's allowance for credit losses on receivables and asset portfolio and presents related ratios: Three Months Ended Year Ended Three Months Ended March 31 December 31 March 31 2017 2016 2016 Balance at beginning of period $ 59.4 $ 59.3 $ 59.3 Provision for losses 3.0 12.3 1.9 Charge-offs (4.6 ) (13.5 ) (4.3 ) Recoveries .5 1.3 .5 Balance at end of period $ 58.3 $ 59.4 $ 57.4 Ratios: Charge-offs, net of recoveries ($4.1 in 2017) to average total portfolio ($5,168.7 in 2017) annualized at March 31, 2017 .32 % .23 % .28 % Allowance for credit losses ($58.3 in 2017) to period-end total portfolio ($5,194.6 in 2017) 1.12 % 1.12 % 1.06 % Period-end retail loan and lease receivables past due over 30 days ($8.7 in 2017) to period-end retail loan and lease receivables ($4,320.8 in 2017) .20 % .30 % .16 %  The provision for losses on receivables was $3.0 for the first quarter of 2017, compared to $1.9 for the first quarter of 2016, reflecting continued good portfolio performance.  Retail loan and lease receivables past due over 30 days at March 31, 2017 was .20% compared to .30% at December 31, 2016, reflecting four fleet customers charged off in 2017, and .16% at March 31, 2016. The Company continues to focus on maintaining low past due balances.  The estimation methods and factors considered for determining the allowance during the periods included in this filing have been consistently applied. See "Note B - Finance and Other Receivables" for additional discussion regarding the Allowance for Credit Losses.  - 25 -  Table of Contents  PACCAR FINANCIAL CORP. - FORM 10-Q  Modifications  The Company modifies loans and finance leases in the normal course of its operations. The Company may modify loans and finance leases for commercial reasons or for credit reasons. Modifications for commercial reasons are changes to contract terms for customers that are not considered to be in financial difficulty. Insignificant delays are modifications extending terms up to three months for customers experiencing some short-term financial stress, but not considered to be in financial difficulty. Modifications for credit reasons are changes to contract terms for customers considered to be in financial difficulty. The Company's modifications typically result in granting more time to pay the contractual amounts owed and charging a fee and interest for the term of the modification. When considering whether to modify customer accounts for credit reasons, the Company evaluates the creditworthiness of the customers and modifies those accounts that the Company considers likely to perform under the modified terms. When the Company modifies loans and finance leases for credit reasons and grants a concession, the modifications are classified as troubled debt restructurings (TDR).  The post-modification balance of accounts modified during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 are summarized below:   Three Months Ended Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 March 31, 2016 Recorded % of Total Recorded % of Total Investment Portfolio* Investment Portfolio* Commercial $ 43.4 3.4 % $ 44.5 3.3 % Insignificant Delay 23.5 1.8 % 20.2 1.5 % Credit - No Concession .2 .4 Credit - TDR 8.8 .7 % 6.7 .5 % $ 75.9 5.9 % $ 71.8 5.3 %  * Recorded investment immediately after modification as a percentage of period-end portfolio, on an annualized basis  Modification activity increased in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016. The decrease in modifications for commercial reasons primarily reflects lower volumes of refinancing. The increase in modifications for insignificant delay reflects more fleet customers requesting payment relief for up to three months. Credit - TDR modifications increased to $8.8 in 2017 from $6.7 in 2016 mainly due to the contract modifications for one large fleet customer.  When the Company modifies a 30+ days past due account, the customer is then generally considered current under the revised contractual terms. The Company modified $.3 of accounts during the first quarter of 2017, $.7 of accounts during the fourth quarter of 2016 and $.1 of accounts during the first quarter of 2016 that were 30+ days past due and became current at the time of modification. Had these accounts not been modified and had they continued to not make payments, the pro forma percentage of retail loan and lease accounts 30+ days past due would have been as follows:   March 31 December 31 March 31 2017 2016 2016 Pro forma percentage of retail loan and lease accounts 30+ days past due .21 % .32 % .17 %  - 26 -  Table of Contents   PACCAR FINANCIAL CORP. - FORM 10-Q Portfolio The Company's portfolio is concentrated with customers in the heavy- and medium-duty truck transportation industry. The portfolio is comprised of retail loans and leases, dealer wholesale financing and dealer master notes as follows: March 31 December 31 March 31 2017 2016 2016 Retail loans $ 2,878.4 56 % $ 2,948.6 56 % $ 2,887.1 53 % Retail leases 1,442.4 28 % 1,495.7 28 % 1,513.8 28 % Dealer wholesale financing 780.2 15 % 760.3 15 % 895.3 17 % Dealer master notes 24.3 23.8 31.7 1 % Operating lease receivables and other 69.3 1 % 65.9 1 % 63.4 1 % Total portfolio $ 5,194.6 100 % $ 5,294.3 100 % $ 5,391.3 100 %  Retail loans and leases decreased to $2,878.4 and $1,442.4 at March 31, 2017 from $2,948.6 and $1,495.7 at December 31, 2016 reflecting collections exceeding new business volume.  Dealer wholesale financing balances increased to $780.2 at March 31, 2017 from $760.3 at December 31, 2016 due to higher dealer new truck inventory.  Dealer master notes were $24.3 at March 31, 2017 compared to $23.8 at December 31, 2016. Dealers may pay the loans early or make additional draws up to specified balances of the contracts pledged to the Company. As of March 31, 2017, the underlying pledged contracts were $87.4 upon which the dealers have available $48.3 as potential additional borrowing capacity.  Income Taxes  The effective income tax rate for the first quarter of 2017 was 37.5% compared to 36.6% for the first quarter of 2016, reflecting higher state tax expense in 2017 compared to 2016.  The Company is included in the consolidated federal income tax return of PACCAR. Federal income taxes for the Company are determined on a separate return basis. State income taxes, where the Company files combined tax returns with PACCAR, are determined on a blended statutory rate, which is substantially the same as the rate computed on a separate return basis.  The Company's deferred income tax benefit for the first quarter of 2017 was $7.5 compared to $8.8 for the first quarter of 2016. The Company's net deferred tax liability decreased to $797.7 at March 31, 2017 from $804.9 at December 31, 2016 due to lower benefits from accelerated depreciation. Deferred taxes are impacted by new business volume and the accelerated depreciation deduction rate under U.S. tax law. The difference in the timing of depreciation for financial statement and income tax purposes does not impact operating results and is not expected to have a significant impact on liquidity in 2017.  - 27 -  Table of Contents  PACCAR FINANCIAL CORP. - FORM 10-Q  Company Outlook  Truck industry Class 8 retail sales in the U.S. in 2017 are expected to be 165,000 - 195,000 units compared to 192,700 units in 2016. Average earning assets in 2017 are expected to be comparable to 2016. Current good levels of freight tonnage, freight rates and fleet utilization are contributing to customers' profitability and cash flow. If current freight transportation conditions decline due to weaker economic conditions, then past due accounts, truck repossessions and credit losses would likely increase from the current low levels. See the Forward-Looking Statements section of Management's Discussion and Analysis for factors that may affect this outlook.  Funding and Liquidity The Company's debt ratings at March 31, 2017 are as follows: Standard and Poor's Moody's Commercial paper A-1 P-1 Senior unsecured debt A+ A1  A decrease in these credit ratings could negatively impact the Company's ability to access capital markets at competitive interest rates and the Company's ability to maintain liquidity and financial stability.  The Company periodically registers debt securities under the Securities Act of 1933 for offering to the public. In November 2015, the Company filed a shelf registration statement to issue medium-term notes. The shelf registration statement expires in November 2018 and does not limit the principal amount of debt securities that may be issued during the period.  The Company participated with PACCAR and certain other PACCAR affiliates in syndicated credit facilities of $3,000.0 at March 31, 2017. Of this amount, $1,000.0 expires in June 2017, $1,000.0 expires in June 2020 and $1,000.0 expires in June 2021. PACCAR and the Company intend to extend or replace these credit facilities on or before expiration to maintain facilities of similar amounts and duration.  Of the $3,000.0 credit facilities, $1,953.0 is available for use by the Company and/or PACCAR and PACCAR Financial Europe. The remaining $1,047.0 is allocated to other non-U.S. PACCAR financial subsidiaries. These credit facilities are used to provide backup liquidity for the Company's commercial paper and maturing medium-term notes. The Company is liable only for its own borrowings under these credit facilities. There were no borrowings under these credit facilities in the three months ended March 31, 2017.  The Company issues commercial paper and medium-term notes to fund its financing and leasing operations. Some of this commercial paper is converted to fixed interest rate debt through the use of interest-rate swaps, which are used to manage interest rate risk. The total principal amounts of commercial paper and medium-term notes outstanding for the Company as of March 31, 2017 were $1,171.1 and $4,650.0, respectively.  The Company believes its current investment grade credit ratings of A+/A1, syndicated bank lines, collections on existing loans and leases and its ability to borrow from PACCAR, if necessary, will continue to provide it with sufficient resources and access to capital markets at competitive interest rates to maintain its liquidity and financial stability. In the event of a decrease in the Company's credit ratings or a disruption in the financial markets, the Company may not be able to refinance its maturing debt in the financial markets. In such circumstances, the Company would be exposed to liquidity risk to the degree that the timing of debt maturities differs from the timing of receivable collections from customers. The Company believes its various sources of liquidity would continue to provide it with sufficient funding resources to service its maturing debt obligations.  - 28 -  Table of Contents  PACCAR FINANCIAL CORP. - FORM 10-Q  Other information on liquidity, sources of capital, and contractual cash commitments as presented in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 (the "2016 Annual Report") continues to be relevant.  Forward-Looking Statements  This report contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include statements relating to future results of operations or financial position and any other statement that does not relate to any historical or current fact. Such statements are based on currently available operating, financial and other information and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may affect actual results. Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: national and local economic, political and industry conditions; changes in the levels of new business volume due to unit fluctuations in new PACCAR truck sales or reduced market share; changes in competitive factors; changes affecting the profitability of truck owners and operators; price changes impacting equipment costs and residual values; changes in interest rates and other operating costs; insufficient liquidity in the capital markets and availability of other funding sources; cybersecurity risks to the Company's information technology systems; litigation including the Company or affiliated entities; and legislation and governmental regulation.

PACCAR Inc is an American Fortune 500 company[6] and counts among the largest manufacturers of medium- and heavy-duty trucks in the world,[7][8] and has substantial manufacturing in light and medium vehicles through its various subsidiaries. For its leadership in the development of aerodynamic, lightweight commercial vehicles that has led to reduced fuel consumption and increased efficiencies, PACCAR Inc was awarded the National Medal of Technology at the White House in 2006.[9][10] The company’s presence has been especially strong in Renton, Washington, where it remains the oldest continually operating business. PACCAR's assembly plant in Renton was recognized as one of the best workplaces for commuters for the fifth consecutive year by the National Center for Transit Research in June 2013. The plant also celebrated its 20th anniversary in June 2013 and has produced more than 130,000 heavy-duty and medium-duty Kenworth trucks since it started its operations in 1993.[11][12][13]

History[edit]




Seattle Car and Foundry works at Renton, Washington, 1916.


PACCAR Inc started as Seattle Car Manufacturing Company in 1905 with a capitalization of $10,000 and was founded by William Pigott, Sr., its original business was the production of railway and logging equipment. The company built a new factory in Renton in 1909 after its Duwamish facility was destroyed in fire as well as to fulfill large number of orders.[14] In 1917 it merged with a Portland firm, Twohy Brothers which was its only competitor on the west coast at the time and company was renamed as Pacific Car and Foundry Company. The company manufactured horse or oxen-drawn logging trucks built specifically to address the dense, hilly forests in which the Northwest logging industry operated to transport massive logs. The following years the company specialized in designing air brakes, open cars, refrigerated boxcars for shipment of perishable items and the universal trailer which could be pulled by a truck.[15] The company also manufactured structural steel that was finished by hand that was used to create columns and girders that went into many a Seattle landmark building.[16][17] In 1924, the founder, William Pigott sold a controlling interest in the company to American Car and Foundry Company. However, his son, Paul Pigott reacquired a significant interest in the company from American Car and Foundry Company in 1934.[18][19]
During the Great Depression in 1930 despite the stock market crash, the company's earnings rose; but as the Great Depression deepened, Pacific Car and Foundry became one of the most depressed businesses in the Northwest.[20] During the late 1930s, Pacific Car and Foundry received government contracts for steel fabrication for construction of Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge as well as orders from other companies.[21]
During World War II[edit]
During World War II, Pacific Car and Foundry’s sales grew due to an increased demand for steel used in airplanes, airports, bridges, naval ships, highways and other equipment that helped build America’s infrastructure to support the war effort. Pacific Car also sub-contracted for Boeing, building aluminum wingspans for B-17 bombers. During the spring of 1942 the company also built M4A1 Shermans tanks for the U.S. Army. The company was able to cast almost all the parts for the tanks at its own foundry. Other notable vehicles that were built included the M25 Tank Transporter, known as the Dragon Wagon, and the T28 Super Heavy Tank.[17] Everett-Pacific Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Company was established in 1942 that built ships and other marine products for the US Navy in Port Gardner Bay in Everett. It was bought by Pacific Car and Foundry in 1944.[22]
Post war[edit]




PACCAR's History in the 1900s. Clockwise from top: Seattle Car Mfg in 1909, Pacific Car & Foundry's Railroad car in 1950, Kenworth T-10 truck and T28 Super Heavy Tank during WW 2


After World War II ended, Pacific Car was a part of the federal government’s Mobilization Planning Program, which meant that it promised to devote 100 percent of its facilities to military production in the event of a national emergency. The company was a prime contractor during the Korean War for producing tanks. Pacific Car chose to subcontract many of the necessary parts, boosting smaller businesses in the state.[17][23][24] In 1945 Pacific Car purchased the Kenworth Motor Truck Corporation which was named after the stockholders Harry Kent and Edgar Worthington.. Kenworth had been producing trucks in Seattle since it was incorporated in 1923. During World War II, Kenworth produced trucks, airplane assemblies and sub-assemblies for the United States military. As the war drew to an end Kenworth shifted attention to production of commercial trucks for the postwar market. In 1956 Kenworth lost independent status and became a division directly under Pacific Car and Foundry.[25]
In 1954, Pacific Car acquired the Dart Truck Company of Kansas City, Missouri, and the Peterbilt Motors Company, of Oakland, California. Dart built primarily heavy off-highway dump trucks and specialty vehicles. Peterbilt had been a major competitor with Kenworth, producing many kinds of trucks and buses. Peterbilt operated as Pacific Car’s wholly owned subsidiary until 1960, following which it was dissolved and made a division of Pacific Car and Foundry.[26][27][28] Pacific Car’s structural steel division made the steel used to build the 50-story Seattle-First National Bank headquarters and to build Seattle’s Space Needle in 1961. The firm provided 5,668 steel panels, weighing 58,000 tons, which formed a major part of the load bearing walls for New York City's World Trade Center twin towers. The World Trade Center, like the Sea-First building, bore the building’s load on the exterior walls rather than on an interior structural skeleton. The steel panels were shipped by rail from Seattle to New York City on more than 1,600 railcars. Pacific Car was the largest contractor of the 13 steel fabricators that provided steel for the World Trade Center towers.[15][29][30][31]
The 1970s to 1990s[edit]
Despite a serious slowdown due to National Recessions during 1974, PACCAR continued to generate increasing sales throughout the 1970s. PACCAR purchased Wagner Mining Company in 1975, which built underground Mining Vehicles, International Car Company in 1975 and Foden Trucks a British truck manufacturer in 1980.[32][33] Fodens sold trucks in Europe and Africa.[34][35][36] PACCAR International was formed in 1972 that promoted exports worldwide.[37][38] PACCAR Technical Center was established in 1980 in Mount Vernon, Washington as a research and testing facility. The facility included test tracks, engine test cells, materials test laboratories and structural laboratories. The tech center conducts an Open House event every April that coincides with the Skagit Valley Tulip Festival.[39][40] In 1983 the International Car Co Division in Kenton Ohio, which had been acquired on December 1, 1975,[41] was disbanded.[42] In 1983 the PACCAR Rail Leasing Inc subsidiary in Renton WA and the RAILEASE Inc subsidiary in Bellevue WA were disbanded.[43] In 1986 the Pacific Car and Foundry subsidiary in Renton WA was renamed to PACCAR Defense Systems Division.[44] In 1984 PACCAR posted record sales in its history of $2.25 billion.[45][46]
In the mid 1980s, PACCAR's share of Class 8 trucks dropped to about 18% owing to aggressive competition from Freightliner Trucks, which is a subsidiary of Daimler AG and the merged operations of Volvo White and General. This competition forced PACCAR to close its Kenworth assembly plant in Kansas City in April, 1986 and its Peterbilt plant in Newark, California, the following October.[47] PACCAR acquired Trico Industries in 1986 which was a manufacturer of oil exploration equipment based in Gardena, California for $65 million in order to reduce its dependence on the Class 8 Truck market.[48][49] During the mid-80's PACCAR was negotiating with the Rover Group, for acquiring its British Leyland truck division. However, Rover management decided to sell the truck division to DAF Trucks which was a Dutch automotive concern. Its Dart Truck Company and Wagner Mining Equipment Company were sold in 1984 and 1989 in order to remain profitable.[50][51] In 1987, PACCAR acquired Al’s Auto Supply and Grand Auto Incorporated which led to its entry into the automotive parts & accessories retail market that gave the company greater ability to weather periods of national economic downturn.[52][53][54]
The 1990s and beyond[edit]
PACCAR Parts was created in 1992 in Renton, Washington. The building it was housed in occupied part of the company’s historic Pacific Car and Foundry site. In the same year, PACCAR purchased a 21 percent stake in Wood Group ESP which added to its oil field equipment manufacturing.[55][56][57] In 1993, PACCAR acquired a line of winches from heavy equipment manufacturer Caterpillar. The same year it brought a new plant in Washington on line to help meet the increased demand for trucks. In 1994 the company began selling in New Zealand for the first time and entered new countries in Asia and Central and South America. The company made its Mexican joint venture VILPAC, S.A., a wholly owned subsidiary in 1995. PACCAR's Winch division was one of the world’s largest manufacturer of industrial winches by 1994.[58][59]
PACCAR International marketed trucks to more than 40 countries, and was one of the largest exporters of capital goods in North America by 1995. Kenworth truck factory in Renton, Washington was opened on June 4, 1993.[60] In 1997 Mark Pigott assumed PACCAR's presidency as Charles Pigott retired in 1997.[61] In 1996 & 1998 the company spent $543 million to acquire DAF Trucks N.V. based in the Netherlands and Leyland Trucks Ltd., an acquisition it first pursued back in the mid-1980s. These acquisitions were funded in part by the sale of Trico Industries to EVI in 1997.[62][63][64][65] Financial and leasing subsidiaries also performed well in the late 1990s. Also, in 1998 PACCAR acquired UK-based Leyland Trucks for its light and medium truck (6 to 44 metric tons) design and manufacture capability. With its Peterbilt, Kenworth, and DAF nameplates, PACCAR ranks second in production numbers in the United States and third in production numbers globally in "big rig" truck production; behind Daimler AG in the US market. Other Major heavy-truck competitors include Navistar International and AB Volvo.[66][67][68][69]

PACCAR Inc is an American Fortune 500 company[6] and counts among the largest manufacturers of medium- and heavy-duty trucks in the world,[7][8] and has substantial manufacturing in light and medium vehicles through its various subsidiaries. For its leadership in the development of aerodynamic, lightweight commercial vehicles that has led to reduced fuel consumption and increased efficiencies, PACCAR Inc was awarded the National Medal of Technology at the White House in 2006.[9][10] The company’s presence has been especially strong in Renton, Washington, where it remains the oldest continually operating business. PACCAR's assembly plant in Renton was recognized as one of the best workplaces for commuters for the fifth consecutive year by the National Center for Transit Research in June 2013. The plant also celebrated its 20th anniversary in June 2013 and has produced more than 130,000 heavy-duty and medium-duty Kenworth trucks since it started its operations in 1993.[11][12][13]

History[edit]




Seattle Car and Foundry works at Renton, Washington, 1916.


PACCAR Inc started as Seattle Car Manufacturing Company in 1905 with a capitalization of $10,000 and was founded by William Pigott, Sr., its original business was the production of railway and logging equipment. The company built a new factory in Renton in 1909 after its Duwamish facility was destroyed in fire as well as to fulfill large number of orders.[14] In 1917 it merged with a Portland firm, Twohy Brothers which was its only competitor on the west coast at the time and company was renamed as Pacific Car and Foundry Company. The company manufactured horse or oxen-drawn logging trucks built specifically to address the dense, hilly forests in which the Northwest logging industry operated to transport massive logs. The following years the company specialized in designing air brakes, open cars, refrigerated boxcars for shipment of perishable items and the universal trailer which could be pulled by a truck.[15] The company also manufactured structural steel that was finished by hand that was used to create columns and girders that went into many a Seattle landmark building.[16][17] In 1924, the founder, William Pigott sold a controlling interest in the company to American Car and Foundry Company. However, his son, Paul Pigott reacquired a significant interest in the company from American Car and Foundry Company in 1934.[18][19]
During the Great Depression in 1930 despite the stock market crash, the company's earnings rose; but as the Great Depression deepened, Pacific Car and Foundry became one of the most depressed businesses in the Northwest.[20] During the late 1930s, Pacific Car and Foundry received government contracts for steel fabrication for construction of Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge as well as orders from other companies.[21]
During World War II[edit]
During World War II, Pacific Car and Foundry’s sales grew due to an increased demand for steel used in airplanes, airports, bridges, naval ships, highways and other equipment that helped build America’s infrastructure to support the war effort. Pacific Car also sub-contracted for Boeing, building aluminum wingspans for B-17 bombers. During the spring of 1942 the company also built M4A1 Shermans tanks for the U.S. Army. The company was able to cast almost all the parts for the tanks at its own foundry. Other notable vehicles that were built included the M25 Tank Transporter, known as the Dragon Wagon, and the T28 Super Heavy Tank.[17] Everett-Pacific Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Company was established in 1942 that built ships and other marine products for the US Navy in Port Gardner Bay in Everett. It was bought by Pacific Car and Foundry in 1944.[22]
Post war[edit]




PACCAR's History in the 1900s. Clockwise from top: Seattle Car Mfg in 1909, Pacific Car & Foundry's Railroad car in 1950, Kenworth T-10 truck and T28 Super Heavy Tank during WW 2


After World War II ended, Pacific Car was a part of the federal government’s Mobilization Planning Program, which meant that it promised to devote 100 percent of its facilities to military production in the event of a national emergency. The company was a prime contractor during the Korean War for producing tanks. Pacific Car chose to subcontract many of the necessary parts, boosting smaller businesses in the state.[17][23][24] In 1945 Pacific Car purchased the Kenworth Motor Truck Corporation which was named after the stockholders Harry Kent and Edgar Worthington.. Kenworth had been producing trucks in Seattle since it was incorporated in 1923. During World War II, Kenworth produced trucks, airplane assemblies and sub-assemblies for the United States military. As the war drew to an end Kenworth shifted attention to production of commercial trucks for the postwar market. In 1956 Kenworth lost independent status and became a division directly under Pacific Car and Foundry.[25]
In 1954, Pacific Car acquired the Dart Truck Company of Kansas City, Missouri, and the Peterbilt Motors Company, of Oakland, California. Dart built primarily heavy off-highway dump trucks and specialty vehicles. Peterbilt had been a major competitor with Kenworth, producing many kinds of trucks and buses. Peterbilt operated as Pacific Car’s wholly owned subsidiary until 1960, following which it was dissolved and made a division of Pacific Car and Foundry.[26][27][28] Pacific Car’s structural steel division made the steel used to build the 50-story Seattle-First National Bank headquarters and to build Seattle’s Space Needle in 1961. The firm provided 5,668 steel panels, weighing 58,000 tons, which formed a major part of the load bearing walls for New York City's World Trade Center twin towers. The World Trade Center, like the Sea-First building, bore the building’s load on the exterior walls rather than on an interior structural skeleton. The steel panels were shipped by rail from Seattle to New York City on more than 1,600 railcars. Pacific Car was the largest contractor of the 13 steel fabricators that provided steel for the World Trade Center towers.[15][29][30][31]
The 1970s to 1990s[edit]
Despite a serious slowdown due to National Recessions during 1974, PACCAR continued to generate increasing sales throughout the 1970s. PACCAR purchased Wagner Mining Company in 1975, which built underground Mining Vehicles, International Car Company in 1975 and Foden Trucks a British truck manufacturer in 1980.[32][33] Fodens sold trucks in Europe and Africa.[34][35][36] PACCAR International was formed in 1972 that promoted exports worldwide.[37][38] PACCAR Technical Center was established in 1980 in Mount Vernon, Washington as a research and testing facility. The facility included test tracks, engine test cells, materials test laboratories and structural laboratories. The tech center conducts an Open House event every April that coincides with the Skagit Valley Tulip Festival.[39][40] In 1983 the International Car Co Division in Kenton Ohio, which had been acquired on December 1, 1975,[41] was disbanded.[42] In 1983 the PACCAR Rail Leasing Inc subsidiary in Renton WA and the RAILEASE Inc subsidiary in Bellevue WA were disbanded.[43] In 1986 the Pacific Car and Foundry subsidiary in Renton WA was renamed to PACCAR Defense Systems Division.[44] In 1984 PACCAR posted record sales in its history of $2.25 billion.[45][46]
In the mid 1980s, PACCAR's share of Class 8 trucks dropped to about 18% owing to aggressive competition from Freightliner Trucks, which is a subsidiary of Daimler AG and the merged operations of Volvo White and General. This competition forced PACCAR to close its Kenworth assembly plant in Kansas City in April, 1986 and its Peterbilt plant in Newark, California, the following October.[47] PACCAR acquired Trico Industries in 1986 which was a manufacturer of oil exploration equipment based in Gardena, California for $65 million in order to reduce its dependence on the Class 8 Truck market.[48][49] During the mid-80's PACCAR was negotiating with the Rover Group, for acquiring its British Leyland truck division. However, Rover management decided to sell the truck division to DAF Trucks which was a Dutch automotive concern. Its Dart Truck Company and Wagner Mining Equipment Company were sold in 1984 and 1989 in order to remain profitable.[50][51] In 1987, PACCAR acquired Al’s Auto Supply and Grand Auto Incorporated which led to its entry into the automotive parts & accessories retail market that gave the company greater ability to weather periods of national economic downturn.[52][53][54]
The 1990s and beyond[edit]
PACCAR Parts was created in 1992 in Renton, Washington. The building it was housed in occupied part of the company’s historic Pacific Car and Foundry site. In the same year, PACCAR purchased a 21 percent stake in Wood Group ESP which added to its oil field equipment manufacturing.[55][56][57] In 1993, PACCAR acquired a line of winches from heavy equipment manufacturer Caterpillar. The same year it brought a new plant in Washington on line to help meet the increased demand for trucks. In 1994 the company began selling in New Zealand for the first time and entered new countries in Asia and Central and South America. The company made its Mexican joint venture VILPAC, S.A., a wholly owned subsidiary in 1995. PACCAR's Winch division was one of the world’s largest manufacturer of industrial winches by 1994.[58][59]
PACCAR International marketed trucks to more than 40 countries, and was one of the largest exporters of capital goods in North America by 1995. Kenworth truck factory in Renton, Washington was opened on June 4, 1993.[60] In 1997 Mark Pigott assumed PACCAR's presidency as Charles Pigott retired in 1997.[61] In 1996 & 1998 the company spent $543 million to acquire DAF Trucks N.V. based in the Netherlands and Leyland Trucks Ltd., an acquisition it first pursued back in the mid-1980s. These acquisitions were funded in part by the sale of Trico Industries to EVI in 1997.[62][63][64][65] Financial and leasing subsidiaries also performed well in the late 1990s. Also, in 1998 PACCAR acquired UK-based Leyland Trucks for its light and medium truck (6 to 44 metric tons) design and manufacture capability. With its Peterbilt, Kenworth, and DAF nameplates, PACCAR ranks second in production numbers in the United States and third in production numbers globally in "big rig" truck production; behind Daimler AG in the US market. Other Major heavy-truck competitors include Navistar International and AB Volvo.[66][67][68][69]

PACCAR Inc is an American Fortune 500 company[6] and counts among the largest manufacturers of medium- and heavy-duty trucks in the world,[7][8] and has substantial manufacturing in light and medium vehicles through its various subsidiaries. For its leadership in the development of aerodynamic, lightweight commercial vehicles that has led to reduced fuel consumption and increased efficiencies, PACCAR Inc was awarded the National Medal of Technology at the White House in 2006.[9][10] The company’s presence has been especially strong in Renton, Washington, where it remains the oldest continually operating business. PACCAR's assembly plant in Renton was recognized as one of the best workplaces for commuters for the fifth consecutive year by the National Center for Transit Research in June 2013. The plant also celebrated its 20th anniversary in June 2013 and has produced more than 130,000 heavy-duty and medium-duty Kenworth trucks since it started its operations in 1993.[11][12][13]

History[edit]




Seattle Car and Foundry works at Renton, Washington, 1916.


PACCAR Inc started as Seattle Car Manufacturing Company in 1905 with a capitalization of $10,000 and was founded by William Pigott, Sr., its original business was the production of railway and logging equipment. The company built a new factory in Renton in 1909 after its Duwamish facility was destroyed in fire as well as to fulfill large number of orders.[14] In 1917 it merged with a Portland firm, Twohy Brothers which was its only competitor on the west coast at the time and company was renamed as Pacific Car and Foundry Company. The company manufactured horse or oxen-drawn logging trucks built specifically to address the dense, hilly forests in which the Northwest logging industry operated to transport massive logs. The following years the company specialized in designing air brakes, open cars, refrigerated boxcars for shipment of perishable items and the universal trailer which could be pulled by a truck.[15] The company also manufactured structural steel that was finished by hand that was used to create columns and girders that went into many a Seattle landmark building.[16][17] In 1924, the founder, William Pigott sold a controlling interest in the company to American Car and Foundry Company. However, his son, Paul Pigott reacquired a significant interest in the company from American Car and Foundry Company in 1934.[18][19]
During the Great Depression in 1930 despite the stock market crash, the company's earnings rose; but as the Great Depression deepened, Pacific Car and Foundry became one of the most depressed businesses in the Northwest.[20] During the late 1930s, Pacific Car and Foundry received government contracts for steel fabrication for construction of Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge as well as orders from other companies.[21]
During World War II[edit]
During World War II, Pacific Car and Foundry’s sales grew due to an increased demand for steel used in airplanes, airports, bridges, naval ships, highways and other equipment that helped build America’s infrastructure to support the war effort. Pacific Car also sub-contracted for Boeing, building aluminum wingspans for B-17 bombers. During the spring of 1942 the company also built M4A1 Shermans tanks for the U.S. Army. The company was able to cast almost all the parts for the tanks at its own foundry. Other notable vehicles that were built included the M25 Tank Transporter, known as the Dragon Wagon, and the T28 Super Heavy Tank.[17] Everett-Pacific Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Company was established in 1942 that built ships and other marine products for the US Navy in Port Gardner Bay in Everett. It was bought by Pacific Car and Foundry in 1944.[22]
Post war[edit]




PACCAR's History in the 1900s. Clockwise from top: Seattle Car Mfg in 1909, Pacific Car & Foundry's Railroad car in 1950, Kenworth T-10 truck and T28 Super Heavy Tank during WW 2


After World War II ended, Pacific Car was a part of the federal government’s Mobilization Planning Program, which meant that it promised to devote 100 percent of its facilities to military production in the event of a national emergency. The company was a prime contractor during the Korean War for producing tanks. Pacific Car chose to subcontract many of the necessary parts, boosting smaller businesses in the state.[17][23][24] In 1945 Pacific Car purchased the Kenworth Motor Truck Corporation which was named after the stockholders Harry Kent and Edgar Worthington.. Kenworth had been producing trucks in Seattle since it was incorporated in 1923. During World War II, Kenworth produced trucks, airplane assemblies and sub-assemblies for the United States military. As the war drew to an end Kenworth shifted attention to production of commercial trucks for the postwar market. In 1956 Kenworth lost independent status and became a division directly under Pacific Car and Foundry.[25]
In 1954, Pacific Car acquired the Dart Truck Company of Kansas City, Missouri, and the Peterbilt Motors Company, of Oakland, California. Dart built primarily heavy off-highway dump trucks and specialty vehicles. Peterbilt had been a major competitor with Kenworth, producing many kinds of trucks and buses. Peterbilt operated as Pacific Car’s wholly owned subsidiary until 1960, following which it was dissolved and made a division of Pacific Car and Foundry.[26][27][28] Pacific Car’s structural steel division made the steel used to build the 50-story Seattle-First National Bank headquarters and to build Seattle’s Space Needle in 1961. The firm provided 5,668 steel panels, weighing 58,000 tons, which formed a major part of the load bearing walls for New York City's World Trade Center twin towers. The World Trade Center, like the Sea-First building, bore the building’s load on the exterior walls rather than on an interior structural skeleton. The steel panels were shipped by rail from Seattle to New York City on more than 1,600 railcars. Pacific Car was the largest contractor of the 13 steel fabricators that provided steel for the World Trade Center towers.[15][29][30][31]
The 1970s to 1990s[edit]
Despite a serious slowdown due to National Recessions during 1974, PACCAR continued to generate increasing sales throughout the 1970s. PACCAR purchased Wagner Mining Company in 1975, which built underground Mining Vehicles, International Car Company in 1975 and Foden Trucks a British truck manufacturer in 1980.[32][33] Fodens sold trucks in Europe and Africa.[34][35][36] PACCAR International was formed in 1972 that promoted exports worldwide.[37][38] PACCAR Technical Center was established in 1980 in Mount Vernon, Washington as a research and testing facility. The facility included test tracks, engine test cells, materials test laboratories and structural laboratories. The tech center conducts an Open House event every April that coincides with the Skagit Valley Tulip Festival.[39][40] In 1983 the International Car Co Division in Kenton Ohio, which had been acquired on December 1, 1975,[41] was disbanded.[42] In 1983 the PACCAR Rail Leasing Inc subsidiary in Renton WA and the RAILEASE Inc subsidiary in Bellevue WA were disbanded.[43] In 1986 the Pacific Car and Foundry subsidiary in Renton WA was renamed to PACCAR Defense Systems Division.[44] In 1984 PACCAR posted record sales in its history of $2.25 billion.[45][46]
In the mid 1980s, PACCAR's share of Class 8 trucks dropped to about 18% owing to aggressive competition from Freightliner Trucks, which is a subsidiary of Daimler AG and the merged operations of Volvo White and General. This competition forced PACCAR to close its Kenworth assembly plant in Kansas City in April, 1986 and its Peterbilt plant in Newark, California, the following October.[47] PACCAR acquired Trico Industries in 1986 which was a manufacturer of oil exploration equipment based in Gardena, California for $65 million in order to reduce its dependence on the Class 8 Truck market.[48][49] During the mid-80's PACCAR was negotiating with the Rover Group, for acquiring its British Leyland truck division. However, Rover management decided to sell the truck division to DAF Trucks which was a Dutch automotive concern. Its Dart Truck Company and Wagner Mining Equipment Company were sold in 1984 and 1989 in order to remain profitable.[50][51] In 1987, PACCAR acquired Al’s Auto Supply and Grand Auto Incorporated which led to its entry into the automotive parts & accessories retail market that gave the company greater ability to weather periods of national economic downturn.[52][53][54]
The 1990s and beyond[edit]
PACCAR Parts was created in 1992 in Renton, Washington. The building it was housed in occupied part of the company’s historic Pacific Car and Foundry site. In the same year, PACCAR purchased a 21 percent stake in Wood Group ESP which added to its oil field equipment manufacturing.[55][56][57] In 1993, PACCAR acquired a line of winches from heavy equipment manufacturer Caterpillar. The same year it brought a new plant in Washington on line to help meet the increased demand for trucks. In 1994 the company began selling in New Zealand for the first time and entered new countries in Asia and Central and South America. The company made its Mexican joint venture VILPAC, S.A., a wholly owned subsidiary in 1995. PACCAR's Winch division was one of the world’s largest manufacturer of industrial winches by 1994.[58][59]
PACCAR International marketed trucks to more than 40 countries, and was one of the largest exporters of capital goods in North America by 1995. Kenworth truck factory in Renton, Washington was opened on June 4, 1993.[60] In 1997 Mark Pigott assumed PACCAR's presidency as Charles Pigott retired in 1997.[61] In 1996 & 1998 the company spent $543 million to acquire DAF Trucks N.V. based in the Netherlands and Leyland Trucks Ltd., an acquisition it first pursued back in the mid-1980s. These acquisitions were funded in part by the sale of Trico Industries to EVI in 1997.[62][63][64][65] Financial and leasing subsidiaries also performed well in the late 1990s. Also, in 1998 PACCAR acquired UK-based Leyland Trucks for its light and medium truck (6 to 44 metric tons) design and manufacture capability. With its Peterbilt, Kenworth, and DAF nameplates, PACCAR ranks second in production numbers in the United States and third in production numbers globally in "big rig" truck production; behind Daimler AG in the US market. Other Major heavy-truck competitors include Navistar International and AB Volvo.[66][67][68][69]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
