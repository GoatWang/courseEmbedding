FINDING GOLD IN THE YUKONFINDINGGOLD IN THEYUKONFINDING GOLD IN THE YUKON

Triumph Gold’s Freegold Mountain project is located in the Dawson Range and covers a highly prospective section of the Big Creek fault zone. The project is endowed with three significant mineral deposits. This includes the Nucleus Au deposit, the Revenue Cu-Au-Mo-Ag deposit and the Tinta Hill poly-metallic vein system, as well as numerous other gold showings.


A 2016 review of Revenue and Nucleus geological models recognized new controls on mineralization, leading to identification of three new exploration targets.

2016 New Discovery – The Generation Zone: Dense copper and gold bearing porphyry-style stockwork veining and intense high-temperature alteration identified in Revenue Creek.

SWOT Analysis
SWOT, which stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats, is an analytical framework that identifies the internal and external factors that are favorable and unfavorable for a company.

Enhanced SWOT Analysis
Enhanced SWOT is a 3×3 grid that arranges strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats into one scheme:

How to use the strengths to take advantage of the opportunities?
How to use the strengths to reduce likelihood and impact of the threats?
How to overcome the weaknesses that obstruct taking advantage of the opportunities? 
How to overcome the weaknesses that can make the threats a reality?

Upon answering these questions a company can develop a project plan to improve its business performance.

PESTEL Analysis
PESTEL (also termed as PESTLE) is an ideal tool to strategically analyze what influence different outside factors – political, economic, sociocultural, technological, environmental and legal – exert on a business to later chart its long term targets.
Being part of the external analysis when carrying out a strategic assessment or performing a market study, PESTEL gives an overview of diverse macro-environmental factors that any company should thoughtfully consider. By perceiving these outside environments, businesses can maximally benefit from the opportunities while minimizing the threats to the organization.
Key Factors Examined by PESTEL Analysis:

Political – What opportunities and pressures are brought by political bodies and what is the degree of public regulations’ impact on the business?
Economic – What economic policies, trends and structures are expected to affect the organization, what is this influence’s degree?
Sociological – What cultural and societal aspects will work upon the demand for the business’s products and operations?
Technological – What impact do the technological aspects, innovations, incentives and barriers have on the organization?
Environmental – What environmental and ecological facets, both locally and farther afield, are likely to predetermine the business?
Legal – What laws and legislation will exert influence on the style the business is carried out?


IFE, EFE, IE Matrices
The Internal Factor Evaluation matrix (IFE matrix) is a strategic management tool helping audit or evaluate major weaknesses and strengths in a business’s functional areas. In addition, IFE matrix serves as a basis for identifying and assessing relationships amongst those areas. The IFE matrix is utilised in strategy formulation.
The External Factor Evaluation matrix (EFE matrix) is a tool of strategic management that is typically utilised to assess current market conditions. It is an ideal instrument for visualising and prioritising the threats and opportunities a firm is facing.
The essential difference between the above mentioned matrices lies in the type of factors incorporated in the model; whilst the latter is engaged in internal factors, the former deals exceptionally with external factors – those exposed to social, political, economic, legal, etc. external forces. 
Being a continuation of the EFE matrix and IFE matrix models, the Internal External matrix (IE matrix) rests upon an investigation of external and internal business factors integrated into one suggestive model. 

Porter Five Forces Analysis
The Porter’s five forces analysis studies the industry of operation and helps the company find new sources of competitive advantage. The analysis surveys an industry through five major questions:

What composes a threat of substitute products and services?
Is there a threat of new competitors entering the market?
What is the intensity of competitive rivalry?
How big is the bargaining power of buyers?
How significant is the bargaining power of suppliers?


VRIO Analysis
VRIO stands for Value, Rarity, Imitability, Organization. This analysis helps to evaluate all company’s resources and capabilities and bring them together into one aggregate table that includes:

Tangible resources
Financial
Physical
Technological
Organizational

Intangible resources
Human
Innovation and Creativity
Reputation

Organizational capabilities

The result of the analysis gives a clear picture of company’s competitive and economic implications, answering the questions if the resources mentioned above are:

Valuable?
Rare? 
Costly to imitate? 
Organized properly?

Northern Freegold Resources Ltd. (TSX.V: NFR) (OTCQX: NFRGF) is a growth oriented, Canadian-based, precious metals exploration and development company. Northern Freegold is focused on creating value through the advancement of the district scale Freegold Mountain project, which hosts one of the largest undeveloped gold and copper resources in the Yukon, and the Burro Creek gold and silver property in Arizona. SNNLive spoke with John Burges, President & CEO of Northern Freegold Resources Ltd. at Cambridge House International's Toronto Resource Investment Conference 2013.
“Northern Freegold is a publicly traded company based in Vancouver we’ve got two principal properties. We have a small project down in Arizona called Burro Creek its in Mojave County, which is a good jurisdiction to be in. Its about twenty kilometers to the west of the big copper mine, the Bagdad mine owned by Freeport.”
He goes on to describe the projects that they are working on, “We’ve already found two very large deposits on the property in the Yukon. You could assume revenue and in total there’s about 3 million ounces of gold there, we’ve also got fair amount of copper and molybdenum silver, which about doubles the overall resource. So you know substantial metal in the ground already found. The property we have in the Yukon is big. Its two hundred square kilometers and we think we’ve got a big district scale system there...The other key attribute we have on that property is its very accessible, its about 4 hours drive from White Horse. So when you’re operating in the northern county, you wanna be in an environment where you can actually get…Infrastructure.” For more information about Northern Freegold Resources Ltd., check out their website: http://www.northernfreegold.com/s/Home.asp.
