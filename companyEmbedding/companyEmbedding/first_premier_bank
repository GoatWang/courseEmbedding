First Premier Bank Reviews







January 22, 2008


Terrible company!
								
				
I have been a customer with First Premier Bank for over three years. I have 2 credit cards (Centennial and Platinum) issued by them. During the years I have been a customer, I have always stayed under my credit limit and paid my bills before the due date; usually more than the minimum due. All this time I never requested and was never offered a credit limit increase (my current limits are $200 and $300.) I have been repairing my damaged, but not horrible, credit over the last year or so and have 2 other credit cards (Rewards660 and Aspire) with $1000 credit limits. I also have an HSBC and Total card with $300 limits, but they are newer.

My issue is that I am planning to pay off and close my low limit accounts in hopes of further improving my credit. Since the First Premier cards are relatively long standing, good accounts I didn't want to close them. I, for the first time, requested a credit limit increase and was denied; they say because of my credit history. But, they also say that they don't access one's credit report for limit increase requests.

This does not ring logical with me considering the fact that all my other cards are under the limits and are always paid on time also. During the next billing cycle, First Premier charged their excessive annual fees, and that, coupled with their other fees/interest put me a couple dollars over limit for the first time. Obviously, they were quick to add the overlimit fees as well. I didn't fight this because I take responsibility for my own balance and have since paid my accounts back under the limits.

I don't know if anybody is given increases from this predatory company, but I believe that I was denied just so they could charge me the overlimit fees. I plan to pay off these worthless cards and close the accounts. Please do not support this card issuer. Get an Aspire or Orchard card instead.

Terrible experience!
								
				
I lost my job in 2006 and tried to utilize this insurance with first premier bank. I was denied several times. So i tried to keep up with the payments but i fell behind and received several calls saying if i made payments by western union that i would receive extra credit for doing so. Everything that i was told was a lie. when i tried to close the account they would not let me or even try to work with me to get it caught up. This company wants your money and does not want to give you honest information.








September 18, 2007

July 8, 2007


Someone else used my social security number!
								
				
I recently inquired about a letter I received from First Premier Bank. I contacted the Bank stating that I did not feel comfortable about mailing the info requested. After giving my social security number I was informed that my information did not match the information you had in your system. I was told that my issues would be addressed and I would be contacted.

This was about a week ago. I am sending in a letter to make sure my complaint is noted.








August 7, 2006


Stay way away from premier bank
								
				
I have had a visa card with premier for over three years and they are a FRAUD i paid my balance off in full and they said it would be 15 to 20 days before they could post it to my account but then when I canceled my account with then they took the money out of my checking with in 20 minuets of cancellation; amazing how they are in no rush till they loose your business. Stay way away from premier bank.








July 28, 2006


Do not deal with them at all
								
				
Hello, my complaint is against First Premier Bank. I am telling everyone do not deal with them at all. This bank DO NOT HELP YOU REBUILD CREDIT. They are actually taking from you instead of helping you. This bank do not report you are paying your bill on time until you have paid 10 months on time. They are not being honest with their customers at all. I do not want anything to do with First Premier Bank.

First Premier Bank




Founder
T. Denny Sanford


Headquarters
Sioux Falls, South Dakota


Website
firstpremier.com


First Premier Bank, headquartered in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, is the 10th largest issuer of MasterCard brand credit cards in the United States.[1] The bank is known for specializing in a wide range of subprime credit cards that are marketed to individuals with "less than perfect" credit. The bank was founded by T. Denny Sanford.
In 2007, the bank settled a case with the New York Attorney General who claimed the bank used deceptive practices to market its credit cards. The bank paid $4.5 million as part of the deal.[2]
In October 2010, the bank was cited for providing the nation's worst credit cards by the Consumers Union.[3] The group reported the bank charged as much as 59% interest on credit cards limited to $300. These cards are marketed under the names Centennial and Aventium as well as First Premier.
As of December 2010, Premier Bank was reportedly offering a credit card with a 79.9% interest rate and a $300 limit. This was cited by Senator Bernie Sanders as an example of what he called "extortion and loan sharking".[4]
As of August 2011, Premier Bank is offering a credit card with a 49.9% interest rate and a $300 limit. Additionally, it requires a security deposit of $95, and a $75 annual fee the first year. After the first year, the annual fee becomes $45 and a $6.50 monthly servicing fee is added (a total of $125 in fees annually). Cash advances are charged a minimum fee of $6 and limited to 10% of the total credit limit for at least the first 90 days. Any credit limit increases are charged a limit increase fee of 25% the amount of the increase, and increases may happen automatically after the first 13 months, though the customer may request the automatic increase be reversed within 30 days and the fee will be refunded. The contract also allows Premier Bank or any third party it chooses to contact customers via cell phone or text message even if the number was obtained without the consumer's consent via a third party.[5]
In 2014 it was announced that First Premier Bank sued cardhub.com for allowing customers to view rates and terms and also letting users review the card.[6]
First Premier Bank's CEO, Dana J. Dykhouse, was referenced in a 2014 piece in the Argus Leader as belonging to a group of would-be local benefactors who the author wrote, "should quit gouging poor people who can't make it from paycheck to paycheck, or don't qualify for regular credit cards. ... Loan sharks who charge an obscene profit just because they can don't make good community leaders."[7]

PREMIER FINANCIAL TIPS

What’s in a credit score?Credit scores are used by creditors to indicate probability that an individual will repay their debt.  Usually in the 300-900 range, the higher the number the better the score.  Typically scores are determined by reviewing the following data:Your history of late paymentsNon paymentsCurrent level of debtTypes of credit accountsLength of credit historyNumber of credit inquiriesHistory of applying for credit Bad credit behavior, such as writing bad checks What creditors look for…When  applying for a loan, credit or mortgage, creditors look at several factors in  your credit background before approval. It’s important that you stay on top of  your credit payments and more, in order to improve your credit rating. Here’s what creditors commonly review:Bill paying historyHow many accounts you haveLate paymentsLongevity of accountsOutstanding debtCollections actionsWatch out for credit card scams.Offers of easy credit or credit without a credit check. No one can guarantee to get you credit. Before deciding whether to give you a credit card, legitimate credit providers examine your credit report. Instructions to call a "900" number to apply for a credit card. You pay for calls with a "900" prefix --and you may never receive a credit card. (The operators, of course, make their money from the telephone call.)Credit cards offered by "credit repair" companies or "credit clinics." These businesses also may offer to clean-up your credit history for a fee. However, you can correct genuine inaccuracies or outdated information yourself by contacting the credit bureaus directly. Remember that only time and good credit habits will restore your credit worthiness. Any offer that sounds too good to be true. It almost certainly is. When you consider a legitimate credit card offer, it is always helpful to study the card offer closely, checking the annual fee (if any), the interest rate, term penalty charges, and billing methods. Make sure you agree with all the terms before investing any time in further research. Protect your credit history!First PREMIER Bank wants you to protect your credit history. It’s important when you’re looking to apply for other credit, purchase a home or car, and for many other reasons.  Here are some tips to follow to help you ensure a positive credit profile:Make payments by the due date-mail payment at least one week in advance of the due dateSet up automatic paymentsPay at least the full minimum payment dueReview your credit bureau at least annually Shield your credit from identity theft.Take the steps to protect you and your credit against identity theft.  Check your credit report regularly to reveal any suspicious activity on inactive accounts or new unauthorized accounts.  Here are some other steps to keep your identity safe:Safeguard your credit cards just as you would cashReduce the number of cards you carry daily; one or two are sufficientMinimize the amount of personal information a criminal can steal.  Don’t routinely carry your Social Security card, birth certificate, or passport with youKeep a list of all of your credit cards with their respective account information in case of theft or lossSign any new cards as soon as you receive themWhen credit card bills are late, call the card’s customer service number to ensure your bill was not mailed to a different addressNever give anyone your card number over the telephone unless you initiated the callShred anything that displays your credit card information before putting it in the trash

PREMIER FINANCIAL TIPS

What creditors look for…When  applying for a loan, credit or mortgage, creditors look at several factors in  your credit background before approval. It’s important that you stay on top of  your credit payments and more, in order to improve your credit rating. Here’s what creditors commonly review:Bill paying historyHow many accounts you haveLate paymentsLongevity of accountsOutstanding debtCollections actionsProtect your credit history!First PREMIER Bank wants you to protect your credit history. It’s important when you’re looking to apply for other credit, purchase a home or car, and for many other reasons.  Here are some tips to follow to help you ensure a positive credit profile:Make payments by the due date-mail payment at least one week in advance of the due dateSet up automatic paymentsPay at least the full minimum payment dueReview your credit bureau at least annually What’s in a credit score?Credit scores are used by creditors to indicate probability that an individual will repay their debt.  Usually in the 300-900 range, the higher the number the better the score.  Typically scores are determined by reviewing the following data:Your history of late paymentsNon paymentsCurrent level of debtTypes of credit accountsLength of credit historyNumber of credit inquiriesHistory of applying for credit Bad credit behavior, such as writing bad checks Watch out for credit card scams.Offers of easy credit or credit without a credit check. No one can guarantee to get you credit. Before deciding whether to give you a credit card, legitimate credit providers examine your credit report. Instructions to call a "900" number to apply for a credit card. You pay for calls with a "900" prefix --and you may never receive a credit card. (The operators, of course, make their money from the telephone call.)Credit cards offered by "credit repair" companies or "credit clinics." These businesses also may offer to clean-up your credit history for a fee. However, you can correct genuine inaccuracies or outdated information yourself by contacting the credit bureaus directly. Remember that only time and good credit habits will restore your credit worthiness. Any offer that sounds too good to be true. It almost certainly is. When you consider a legitimate credit card offer, it is always helpful to study the card offer closely, checking the annual fee (if any), the interest rate, term penalty charges, and billing methods. Make sure you agree with all the terms before investing any time in further research. Shield your credit from identity theft.Take the steps to protect you and your credit against identity theft.  Check your credit report regularly to reveal any suspicious activity on inactive accounts or new unauthorized accounts.  Here are some other steps to keep your identity safe:Safeguard your credit cards just as you would cashReduce the number of cards you carry daily; one or two are sufficientMinimize the amount of personal information a criminal can steal.  Don’t routinely carry your Social Security card, birth certificate, or passport with youKeep a list of all of your credit cards with their respective account information in case of theft or lossSign any new cards as soon as you receive themWhen credit card bills are late, call the card’s customer service number to ensure your bill was not mailed to a different addressNever give anyone your card number over the telephone unless you initiated the callShred anything that displays your credit card information before putting it in the trash

The SCRA expands and improves the provisions of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940 (SSCRA), allowing servicemembers in the United States military to devote their full attention to service by easing some of their financial obligations and, in certain cases, suspending the enforcement of civil liabilities. Some of the SCRA's benefits and protections are intended to protect military personnel who had an existing financial obligation prior to becoming active-duty military. Other SCRA protections apply to all military members while serving during an eligible period.What is the SCRA? The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) is a federal statute that provides financial relief and protections to eligible military personnel serving on active duty.

were opened before the start of the Servicemember’s active duty period.How do I apply for SCRA benefits?You can request benefits in writing by: Fax: 605-357-3438Mail: PREMIER Bankcard, Attn: SCRA Request, PO Box 5524, Sioux Falls, SD 57117-5524Written requests should include:The Servicemember's nameFirst PREMIER Bank account numberCopy of active duty orders or a letter from your executive or commanding officer on official letterhead that includes:Servicemember's name and SSNActive duty start dateBranch of serviceWhen will I know if I'm eligible for SCRA benefits under PREMIER Bankcard's SCRA Program?PREMIER Bankcard will generate a letter to the address we have on file with the determined outcome within 30 days of receipt of your documentation.

I am writing this review to let everyone know its OK. It really is. I got this card back in May 2015 and cancelled it January 6, 1017. I kept this card approximately 1 1/2 years. When I first applied for this card my credit was terrible. But, they approved me for a $300.00 limit. And, at the time of approval I was very grateful. The first thing I did was set up an online account for the purpose of making payments. Most importantly, I made all payments on time (making sure to pay a few days before the due date and paying in full when I could.) Never any issues with customer service or payment receipts. They really do help to rebuild you credit because payments are reported to the 3 major credit bureaus every month. I cancelled the card because, I now qualify for high limit, no interest credit cards without annual fees and First Premier does not provide credit line increases with out a charge. So do what I did...use the First Primier credit card as a tool to re-establish your credit. And, everything else will fall into place. Keep in mind, this is not the card for people with excellent credit so use it wisely and responsibly

                                Good for Rebuilding Credit

This card is meant to be used to pay in full on time everytime. They penalize you for being a minute late, and for those like me that ended up rebuilding credit this card is God send. All other companies denied me except this one.	After the first year they start charging a monthly 6.25 servicing fee which adds onto your existing interest so beware. You will not pay off this card off in minimum payments, it's a death trap for those that don't know how to manage their finances.	But what this card did do for me is rebuild my credit, which is what it is intended to do. They report to all three credit bureau's every month. My score started off at 550 after I lost my job and started racking debt. I ended up paying off all of my existing debt, as well as making small purchases like gas and electric bill on this card every month, paid in full every month. Seven months later I get approved for a loan to purchase a new car at 1.9%. Four months later I purchase another used car for 6%. The bank that is providing me the loan for my used car is capital one, so I quickly apply for their quicksilver one credit card and and get approved for a 300 limit. A year later I'm bumped up to a $1000.00 limit, two years an amazon credit card, and now after three years I just qualified for an amex everyday card. None of this would have happened if it wasn't for the first premier credit card, but now it's finally time to cancel because paying this monthly fee of 6.25 is getting ridiculous as well as an annual fee. But I can safely say I can cancel after two car loans, renting an apartment, with three major good credit cards.	I was given a second chance, I took it, and I didn't mess up this time. I plan to keep it that way.	For those that are interested, I went from 550 to 650 in one year. Rebuilding process is quick, but once you're past 650 it slows down. Be patient and don't apply for any other major credit cards until after a year later, the more you apply and get denied the more hard inquiries hit your credit report; which will delay the process of getting a better card even with a decent credit score.

Use this card for 1 year, pay off in full, dump it after 1 years use, second years fees too expensive,  I qualified for better cards only after 1 full years use, this card serves it's purpose.

This bank will give you the card, then utilize every excuse to penalize you in any way possible. I made above minimum payments mothly EARLY....and they would still send "reminders" to my email "reminding" me of my monthly payment due. I called several times customer service, only to be told the "reminders" are automatic, despite the fact I was able to verify with confirmation number my above minimum payment was already processed early for the said month. Equally, they were always tacking on various "processing" fees, which when I called customer service I was told they are routine. Bottom line they are a total SCAM....essentially a legal loan shark...do yourself a favor and stay away at all costs not worth it.

After months of on time payments and using this card monthly about $200-$400 and would pay off in full. Within two weeks of my automatic payment not going through they closed my account and I only found this out when I went to make a $200 payment via the phone. They told me if it happens twice they automatically close your account. The automatic payment attempts were two days apart, I cannot believe I did not receive a letter or a voicemail stating what happened and that they were going to close my account. Would never recommend this bank to anyone, will continue to use my business elsewhere.

I applied for this joke of a card simply to have something set aside for emergencies. My credit is not fantastic but frankly not that bad either. i've got other cards and a car loan and none of them are this utterly ridiculous. I was expected to pay a $95 "program fee" AND an annual fee AND a monthly fee, all for a lousy $600 credit limit. When i called them and told tht that was obscene and said cancel it, i still got daily phone calls to remond me to pay thiere "program fee" before i could use the card.. <insert your choice of expletive here) NO!!	Stay far far away from this card.Try for Capital One. They will give most anyone a chance to prove yourself, and they won't rip you off with absurd fees.

It's a great card to start out building up your credit. If you don't know how credit cards work get more information before getting one. Seriously it's pretty cool.

I had filed bankruptcy and my credit was in the toilet - I needed to establish good credit again and this bank card helped me do  just that. Yes,  you have to pay to get started again, fees, etc. but it is better than not having credit which is something we need in this society. They were a great help to me in my time of need,  but I have other cards with no high fees and annual payments. so I cancelled my cards. but thank Premiere for the help and support I needed it.

This is the WORST card ever they charge you a percent of charges that you dont  even make becasue byt the time they take out this and that you have nothing left to spend every month they charge me anywhere from 14.66 to 14.95 of interest like I said on purchases not ever make, DON'T EVER GET THIS CARD EVEN IF YOUR TRYING TOO BUILD YOUR CREDIT, THERE ARE OTHERS THAT ARE BETTER..

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
