Use of Solid Edge with synchronous technology delivers higher design productivity and more fun





Kimball International
Faster new design, edits and import of legacy CAD data



Design breakthroughKimball International, Inc. (Kimball) provides a variety of products from two business segments: the Electronic Manufacturing Services segment and the Furniture segment. The Kimball Electronics Group provides engineering and manufacturing services, which utilize common production and support capabilities globally, to automotive, industrial, medical and public safety markets. The Furniture segment provides furniture for the office and hospitality markets sold under the family of brand names Kimball Office, National Office Furniture, and Kimball Hospitality. As with any company that adapts well to change, Kimball’s flexibility and versatility allow it to stay in front of business challenges, including the ever-changing office environment along with the escalating indirect and direct costs of running a responsible, global company.“Office furniture has changed significantly in the last few years,” says Ricardo Espinosa, R&D Engineering Services manager at Kimball.“The traditional office space continues to evolve,” Espinosa notes. “A considerable number of office environments have migrated to an open plan concept for better interaction, collaboration, and networking. New communication technology translates into people using office space in different ways. We’re designing furniture to accommodate technology that has increased the integration of power and communications, which places new demands on engineering.”These business drivers impact more than 50 product designers at Kimball. The company develops several new product lines each year with hundreds of configurations each. “Resources must be managed carefully, and we have to be very efficient to hit our targets and produce the high-quality products Kimball is known for,” says Espinosa.New demands placed on engineering also increase the need to better leverage decades of design work. Lots of the computer-aided design (CAD) data was created using I-deas™ software, with a knowledge base dating back to the 1980s and 90s.The legacy design data is extremely valuable to Kimball.In 2004, Kimball moved it designers to Siemens PLM Software’s Solid Edge® software. At the time, Solid Edge was a history-based CAD system only. While the move updated Kimball to a new, modern CAD system, leveraging the older data created using I-deas remained difficult, but still important.Even though Kimball products are unique, they share similar components. “We use these as a base for the final product, which is ultimately being defined by the innovation features and functionality added to it,” says Espinosa. “The final result is completely different.”Enter synchronous technologyKimball used traditional, history-tree based Solid Edge for years. In 2008, Siemens PLM Software launched Solid Edge with synchronous technology to enable users to accelerate new design processes, make faster changes to existing designs and improve the re-use of imported data. Kimball moved to Solid Edge with synchronous technology to address its business and engineering challenges.Kimball started the change to synchronous technology with a small group of super-users, in early summer. With the knowledge from this experience, Kimball is now in the process of moving all 50+ product engineers to synchronous technology, with an expected completion in early fall.“When you work with a traditional CAD system, it’s very slow to create all these little modifications; basically, you have to do the same thing over and over,” says Espinosa. With synchronous technology, Kimball can create models without doing additional calculations. “Without even knowing the dimensions of the final components, we can just edit the existing part and create something new. We are learning how to adapt our products much faster.”“Even small changes may take hours, if you have to open and edit individual parts in a traditional CAD model,” says Espinosa.“With synchronous technology, we anticipate significant time savings in producing documentation and drawings for products with hundreds of different configurations. We anticipate going from days to hours.“Before synchronous technology, we had to start from scratch. Now with synchronous technology, we can re-use the legacy data that came in during the ’90s and ’80s. It’s really easy to use the existing information and create new components.”According to the veteran designer, the game-changing speed of synchronous technology applies to both new and edited design work.Espinosa explains, “We bring assemblies created using I-deas into synchronous technology, and then we use it to work on individual components. We don’t modify everything; sometimes we make small changes like adding holes or slots. We change dimensions and that’s all we do. Sometimes we use one of these existing components and create a brand-new product based on the geometry we already have.”Kimball now imports legacy data created with I-deas into Solid Edge quickly, as opposed to what used to be a lengthy history-based CAD process. “We import parts and have them ready for use in a much more timely fashion with synchronous technology,” says Espinosa.Prior to synchronous technology, Kimball stopped re-using some of the important data it had created using I-deas. “In history-based CAD, if you aren’t the original designer, there’s no way to figure out how it was designed,” says Espinosa. “We had to redesign most components from scratch. The data we could retrieve took days to import, but using synchronous technology it now takes minutes.”More user-friendly, more enjoyable process for product developmentKimball estimates that most of the time savings will come from simply importing and editing its legacy CAD designs. With the challenge of not increasing staff, synchronous technology’s potential to be a time-saver provides the opportunity for improved productivity,” says Espinosa.“There’s a nice return on investment when adopting synchronous technology, but our main reason for implementing the tool is to be more productive, design better products, get to market faster and create an easier process to leverage legacy data,” says Espinosa.Espinosa notes synchronous technology took some adjustment, but proved itself quickly: “I had to erase in my mind 20 years of history-tree design technology. Within a couple of weeks, I started liking it and so did the rest of the people in my company.”“You can become more productive; you can enjoy more of what you’re doing,” says Espinosa. “When you work with traditional CAD, product engineering work becomes very repetitive. With synchronous technology, you can participate more in the design process, the fun side of developing products.”

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
