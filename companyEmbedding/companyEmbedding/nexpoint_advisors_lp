Tax Information Regarding Spin-Off of NXRT




Highland Code of Ethics










Performance data represents past performance, which does not guarantee future results. Current performance may differ from figures shown. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate with market conditions, and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. See the Performance tab for most recent month-end performance.
Source: American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC
The performance data quoted here represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares when redeemed may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than performance data quoted.
Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Please consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of NexPoint Credit Strategies Fund carefully before investing. A prospectus with this and other information about NexPoint Credit Strategies Fund may be found on our website's Fund Documents tab. You may also obtain a prospectus by calling 866-351-4440. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.
Non-Payment Risk. Senior Loans, like other corporate debt obligations, are subject to the risk of non-payment of scheduled interest and/or principal. Non-payment would result in a reduction of income to the Fund, a reduction in the value of the Senior Loan experiencing non-payment and a potential decrease in the NAV of the Fund.
Credit Risk. The Fund may invest all or substantially all of its assets in Senior Loans or other securities that are rated below investment grade and unrated Senior Loans deemed by Highland to be of comparable quality. Securities rated below investment grade are commonly referred to as “high yield securities” or “junk securities.” They are regarded as predominantly speculative with respect to the issuing company’s continuing ability to meet principal and interest payments. Investments in high yield Senior Loans and other securities may result in greater NAV fluctuation than if the Fund did not make such investments.
Interest Rate Risk. The Fund’s NAV will usually change in response to interest rate fluctuations. When interest rates decline, the value of fixed rate securities already held by the Fund can be expected to rise. Conversely, when interest rates rise, the value of existing fixed rate securities can be expected to decline.
Senior Loans Risk. The risks associated with Senior Loans are similar to the risks of below investment grade securities, although Senior Loans are typically senior and secured in contrast to other below investment grade securities, which are often subordinated and unsecured.
Risk of Restrictions on Resale. Senior Loans may not be readily marketable and may be subject to restrictions on resale. As a result, the ability of the Fund to dispose of its investments in a timely fashion and at an advantageous price may be restricted.
Ongoing Monitoring Risk. On behalf of the several Lenders, the Agent generally will be required to administer and manage the Senior Loans and, with respect to collateralized Senior Loans, to service or monitor the collateral.
Closed-End Fund Risk. The Fund is a closed-end investment company designed primarily for long-term investors and not as a trading vehicle. The Fund does not intend to list its shares for trading on any national securities. There is not expected to be any secondary trading market in the shares, and the shares should be considered illiquid.
Leverage Risk. Leverage may increase the risk of loss, cause fluctuations in the market value of the Fund’s portfolio to have disproportionately large effects or cause the net asset value (“NAV”) of the Fund generally to decline faster than it would otherwise.

 Highland Capital Management Fund Advisors Expands Independent Broker-Dealer Distribution Channel with Series of New Hires 



in Press Releases 
21 Mar 2016 

Highland Capital Management attracts experienced wholesalers with diverse product offerings for growing independent channel
DALLAS, March 21, 2016 /PRNewswire/ — Highland Capital Management Fund Advisors, L.P., the retail affiliate of Dallas-based investment management firm Highland Capital Management, L.P., is strengthening its commitment to serving the independent broker-dealer (IBD) sales channel with a series of new hires, adding 14 IBD sales professionals in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016 alone.
Highland’s IBD sales team represents a broad spectrum of products both from Highland Fund Advisors and from affiliates NexPoint Advisors, L.P., NexPoint Capital, Inc. and NexPoint Real Estate Advisors, L.P. Products include non-traded business development companies (BDCs), REITs, mutual funds and ETFs. The firm also expects to roll out a series of interval funds later this year.
“The diverse product offerings we have across the Highland and NexPoint platforms are a significant draw for experienced wholesalers,” said Brad Ross, president of Highland Funds. “The opportunity to represent this broad range of products has been a key factor in attracting top talent and growing our IBD sales team.”
Among that top talent is PJ McDaniel, managing director and head of IBD sales, who joined Highland in October 2015 and has served as a catalyst for the firm’s growth in this area. His background includes more than a decade of experience in the independent channel, which most recently involved building a team of wholesalers at SC Distributors to represent a series of non-traded products.
“We’ve been gaining momentum in the IBD distribution channel that we expect to continue throughout the year,” said McDaniel, who has brought on 10 sales directors and three sales consultants since joining the firm himself. “We’ve already expanded from seven to 15 territories and have several product launches on the horizon that will certainly fuel our growth. And with new hires from the non-traded, liquid alternatives and variable annuity sectors, among others, we continue to build an impressive team with backgrounds as diverse as our product offerings.”
Highland has served the IBD channel since 2013; however, the firm began reinforcing its efforts in the channel last year in response to the expanding role of independents within the advisor network and evidence of that trend intensifying.
The expanded IBD channel presence complements the sizeable, existing presence that Highland has built in the traditional wirehouse channel since 2004.

Dr. Arthur Laffer
Director








Dr. Arthur Laffer is the founder and chairman of Laffer Associates, an economic research and consulting firm. A former member of President Reagan’s Economic Policy Advisory Board during the 1980s, Dr. Laffer’s economic acumen and influence have earned him the distinction in many publications as The Father of Supply-Side Economics. He has served on several boards of directors of public and private companies, including staffing company MPS Group, Inc., which was sold to Adecco Group for $1.3 billion in 2009. Dr. Laffer was previously a consultant to Secretary of the Treasury William Simon, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and Secretary of the Treasury George Shultz. In the early 1970s, Dr. Laffer was the first to hold the title of Chief Economist at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Mr. Shultz. Additionally, Dr. Laffer was formerly the Distinguished University Professor at Pepperdine University and a member of the Pepperdine Board of Directors. He also served as Charles B. Thornton Professor of Business Economics at the University of Southern California and as Associate Professor of Business Economics at the University of Chicago. Laffer is credited with advancing the concept of supply-side economics when he drew a curve on the back of a napkin at a dinner meeting, showing that government tax receipts can sometimes increase when federal income tax rates are lowered. The Laffer Curve and supply-side economics served as the foundation for Reaganomics in the 1980s when Dr. Laffer served on the President’s Economic Policy Advisory Board from 1981 to 1989. Dr. Laffer has been recognized for his achievements in economics, having been featured in Time Magazine’s 1999 cover story, The Century’s Greatest Minds, for inventing the Laffer Curve, which Time deemed one of a few of the advances that powered this extraordinary century.

 Highland Capital Management Announces Launch of Non-Traded Product Line with Affiliate NexPoint Advisors



in Press Releases 
20 Aug 2014 

DALLAS, August 20, 2014 – Highland Capital Management, L.P., (“Highland”), a Dallas-based investment management firm, which together with its affiliates has approximately $19 billion in assets under management, today announced the launch of its non-traded product line with a publicly-registered Business Development Company (BDC) NexPoint Capital, Inc.  The BDC will be the industry’s first healthcare-focused fund of its kind with a target raise of $1.5B in capital for investing primarily in medium-sized businesses.
NexPoint Capital, Inc. represents Highland’s initial non-traded product with the company announcing plans to introduce additional non-traded products later this year. The BDC will be distributed by Highland Capital Funds Distributor, and will be led by Brad Ross, President of Highland Funds, and Brian Mitts, Chief Operating Officer of NexPoint Advisors and head of business development for Highland’s alternative products.
“We believe alternative products offer a compelling, income producing and non-correlated investment option for investors,” said Mr. Mitts. “We’re confident our current suite of liquid alternative mutual funds combined with the non-traded products we’ll be launching over the next few months will offer independent advisors one of the industry’s strongest and most robust product lineups.”
As part of the firm’s expansion into non-traded products, Highland hired Jennifer Ricci as Director of National Accounts in February, and has added eight wholesalers for the wire house channel and five wholesalers for the independent channel to augment its distribution team. The sales team is dedicated to educating investors on alternative products in the independent broker dealer channel. For more information please contact Brian Mitts at BMitts@highlandfunds.com.
