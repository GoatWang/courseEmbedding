Operator
Good morning. My name is Tina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Donaldson Company First Quarter Fiscal 2008 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].
Thank you. Mr. Sheffer, you may begin your conference.
Rich Sheffer - Director of Investor Relations and Assistant Treasurer
Thank you, Tina. And this is Rich Sheffer, Donaldson's Assistant Treasurer and Director of Investor Relations and I welcome you to Donaldson's 2008 first quarter conference call and webcast.
Following my brief introduction, Tom VerHage, our Vice President and CFO, will give us a brief review of our record first quarter operating results. Tom will then turn the call over to Bill Cook, our Chairman, President and CEO, who will discuss our positive outlook for the balance of fiscal 2008 and the business conditions shaping that view. Following Bill's remarks, we will open up the call to questions.
Before I turn the call over to Tom, I need to review our Safe Harbor statement with you. Any statements in this call regarding our business that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements, and our future results could differ materially from the forward-looking statements made today. Our actual results may be affected by many important factors, including the risks and uncertainties identified in our press release and in our SEC filings.
Now I'd like to introduce Tom VerHage. Tom?
Thomas R. VerHage - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Well, thanks Rich and good morning everyone. Well, as you saw in our press release late yesterday, we are starting our fiscal '08 with a fine quarter. Thanks to our continued strong top line growth particularly outside of NAFTA. Stronger foreign currencies boosted our sales by 4.6%. But just to give you a sense of the strength of our business globally, year-over-year sales increases in our three regions in local currency were a 25% in Asia Pacific, 17% in Europe, Middle East and Africa and 6% in NAFTA.
As you know, heavy truck build rates are down considerably in NAFTA, which resulted in a $22 million year-over-year decrease in sales to that portion of the market. Bill will comment on global market conditions across our major product lines in just a few minutes.
Our operating margin for the quarter was 12.1% compared to 12% last year. As you know, we target a minimum operating margin of 11% for the year. Gross margin of 32.9% compares favorably to 32.2% last year, and operating expenses of 20.8% are up a bit from last year's rate of 20.2%. The operating expense ratio was impacted by investments to capture growth opportunities and the higher mix of Industrial segment sales which generally have both higher gross margins and operating expenses than Engine Segment sales.
Our gross margin and operating expense ratio will fluctuate each quarter, and be impacted by factors such as product mix, investments in new product development and various other factors. Our tax rate of 27.1% for the quarter compares to a prior year rate of 31.2%. In our year-end webcast, we mentioned that our first quarter tax rate would be lower than our annual projected rate due to a lower tax rate that was signed into law in Germany that allowed us to reduce our German deferred tax liabilities and the expiration of the statute of limitations on certain matters that were previously reserved.

Now, I would like to provide you with some further detail on a few matters for you to consider in your analysis for the remainder of 2008. We have not changed our annual margin outlook, which is for gross margin to exceed 32% and operating expense to be in the 21% range. If we achieve these targets, our operating margin should be at a minimum of 11%. We expect the operating income to grow by 13% to 18% this year compared to last year's $211 million. Interest expense should increase by $2 million to $3 million with the primary driver being the full year of debt related to our acquisition of AFS this past March.
Our tax rate will continue to fluctuate by quarter, and we are maintaining our annual guidance of 29% to 32%. You are all probably aware that we have adopted a new income tax accounting rules required by FIN 48 in fiscal '08. And this new rule did not have a significant impact on our first quarter financial statements.
Our CapEx outlook is in the range of $60 million to $70 million and we expect depreciation and amortization in a range of $51 million to $55 million, which includes $2 million of amortization related to the intangible assets of the AFS acquisition. And we are maintaining our free cash flow outlook for the year of a range of $100 million to $140 million.
As you consider your quarterly earnings estimates for the remainder of the year, we want to remind you that our second quarter is impacted by the significant number of holidays, which results in more days that both our customers and our plants are closed, making this our weakest sales quarter of the year. Also due to the timing of our annual stock option grants, approximately 75% or $3 million to $3.5 million of our annual stock option expense is recorded in the second quarter.
One another reminder is that last year contained an extra week of domestic sales in our fourth quarter, which provided a one-time boost of approximately $16 million. So, thanks primarily to our robust sales growth in the first quarter, we have increased our EPS outlook for the year to a range of $1.97 to $2.07. And with that, I'll pass it over to Bill, who will provide more background on our outlook. Bill?
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks Tom and good morning everyone. Our first quarter results proved again the power of our diversified portfolio of filter businesses around the world. So, although we saw some weaker end markets in NAFTA including on-road heavy truck and residential construction, these were balanced by a strong growth in Europe and Asia in both our Engine and Industrial business segments. And in addition, with our strong international presence we benefited from the weaker dollar.
Now, I'd like to briefly cover some highlights by segments and I will start with our Engine business in Europe. In Europe, our off-road and on-road businesses, both grew over 20% and our Engine aftermarket grew by more than 30% in the quarter. European business conditions for us continued to be good due to the combination of general economic growth together with new business we won at both existing and new customers. And with our aftermarket growth in the European emerging markets, which we include Eastern Europe, Middle East and North Africa, this has been a priority for us as we've had more distributors throughout these developing regions.
In Asia, our Engine off-road and aftermarket businesses also had a strong quarter. The strength was seen across the region. Japan, we saw continued strong construction market. In China, we added new off-road customers and increased our aftermarket distribution and in Australia, we saw good growth as a result of the mining boom.
Now, switching to NAFTA, as expected our NAFTA engine businesses were mixture of different stories this quarter. In off-road, the small construction market and our sales to it remained weak due to the much publicized residential housing crisis. However, this was offset by the Ag equipment sector which was strong by... which was fueled by strong farm and crop conditions. Our aerospace and defense sales were up on strong military demand, particularly for filters for the new MRAP vehicles and replacement parts for existing military equipment that needs overhauling. In addition, our acquisition last year of AFS also added about $4.4 million to quarter one sales.

In our replacement parts, our aftermarket business truck ton miles in NAFTA moderated as the economy has slowed and general equipment utilization rates are mixed, better for large equipment in ag but slower or less for small construction equipment, resulting in a good quarter for aftermarket, which ended up 9%. And, finally the heavy truck downturn was about what we expected. Our NAFTA on-road sales were down 56% following last year's Big 3 buy in front of the January 2007 new emission regulations.
Now, I'm going to switch to our Industrial businesses and I'll start with our industrial filtration solution business, which had a great quarter internationally, up 20% in both Asia and Europe.
In Asia, our sales in China were very strong, reflecting the continued strong manufacturing investment climate there. In Europe, we also benefited from the continued capital investment across the continent as Western Europe continued adding capacity and Eastern and Central Europe continue to make new investments. And in NAFTA our sales were up 6% as we continued to see good demand for both our systems and replacement filters.
In our gas turbine business, we started the year very strong, but I should remind everyone that these are typically large systems, in fact the largest we make and the result, our shipments to our customers by quarter are volatile and tend to bounce around a bit. But overall the gas turbine market we serve continues to enjoy a strong up cycle in both the power generation and oil and gas markets.
And then finally, our special application sales were good in quarter one as we saw solid growth in both our disk drive filter and PTFE membranes businesses.
Now switching to our outlook for the balance of the fiscal year, it's good for fiscal '08 as noted in our press release; we have just increased our full year sales expectations for both business segments. Earnings and business sales are now expected to be up between 7% to 9%, up from our previous forecast of 5% to 7%. And our Industrial business segment should be up between 11% and 13% and we previously forecast that to be up between 8% and 10%. So we picked up both of our forecast for both the Engine and Industrial sides of our company.
Now many of you may be thinking, after an 18% revenue increase in quarter one why our full year numbers aren't higher, so let me briefly explain. During quarter one, we did receive a benefit on the revenue line of about 4.6% due to foreign exchange as Tom mentioned. And we don't expect to see a similar size benefit during the second half of this year.
Second reason is as I mentioned our GTS shipments by nature bounce around by quarter. We had an outstanding quarter one, but we don't forecast the next several quarters to be quite as large. And then third, remember we had a strong second half last year with our first $500 million quarter in the fourth. So our comps would be getting tougher. But having said that, we are looking at another good revenue year, with total sales up approximately 11% and our first $2 billion sales year ever.
Now looking at the outlook conditions by segment, starting first with our Engine business. Despite some current weakness in NAFTA, both the construction and mining equipment sales continue to grow internationally. In the Ag equipment sector, we see strong growth there globally. The latest reports forecast both good crop prices and farmer incomes to be up, which is positive for the Ag equipment market. We expect demand to continue growing in out Aerospace and Defense business and in addition last March's acquisition of AFS will continue to benefit our sales line.
We expect our aftermarket sales to continue to grow strong internationally as we focus on continuing to develop new markets and adding distribution. And finally, as Tom mentioned we continue to see the NAFTA Truck business being down about $30 million to $40 million this year through our third quarter before starting to pick up in the fourth quarter of fiscal '08.

In our Industrial businesses, we see all of the major business groups up in fiscal '08. In IFS which includes our industrial dust collectors and compressed air filters, incoming orders remain good for both equipment and replacement filters. So we have increased our sales growth guidance up 10% to 15% for fiscal '08.
In our GTS business, we have significant orders in hand already for fiscal '08 and we're expecting a 10... 15% to 20% sales growth for the full year as we continue to see good conditions in the Middle East, Asia and parts of Africa. And finally we're expecting 5% to 10% revenue growth in our special application business this year.
As Tom mentioned, we expect our fiscal 2008 operating margin to be a minimum of 11%. We have now increased our full year EPS to that range and expect EPS to be between $1.97 and $2.07 per share and which would be our 19th consecutive year of record earnings.
Now as our habit, I want to give you an update on two of the new platforms that we have talked about; one is PowerCore and the other one is the diesel emissions. And I'll start first with PowerCore. We have now won 93 equipment platforms with our OEM customers, 73 of these are already in production and another dozen are expected to go into production during the fiscal '08.
Our sales... our PowerCore sales in the first quarter were up 20% to $12.5 million and we still have another 80 plus platforms in the proposal stage with our OEM customers. So with our current win rate of over 90%, we are confident of the continued growth of PowerCore technology. Then finally, we will be releasing our next generation PowerCore technology in 2008, which utilizes the latest advances in Donaldson technology which will allow us to further reduce the footprint of the filtration systems by about one-third.
Switching to emissions; while we continue to be positive regarding our long-term participation in the diesel emissions market, we have now reduced our estimate for our on-road business to $80 million by the end of 2012. So why make this adjustment? Well, based on our current expectations of platform wins for 2010, coupled with current volume projections for those wins, we feel that $80 million is our best estimate today.
In addition, we believe that it will take approximately 2 years from the implementation of the 2010 EPA regulations, the industry market volumes to recover to normal production levels. We will continue to support our existing on-road emission customers, while we increase our focus to the retrofit off-road market, which we now believe are better fit for our product development skills.
So, the bottom line around this emissions opportunity is that we continue to see the on-road and off-road diesel emissions as a good growth opportunity for Donaldson, although not quite as large as we had first hoped.
Now I want to offer some wrap up comments on the quarter. We are off to a very good start in fiscal '08 with strong sales, a new record and a 12% operating margin. Our overall sales outlook for fiscal '08 is good for both the Engine segment and the Industrial segment. The strength of our business model, which is a portfolio of diversified filtration businesses around the globe, continues to work as the weakness in those end markets in the midst of cyclical downturns like heavy truck, has been and will be offset this year by the strength in our Industrial businesses globally and our international Engine business.
In addition, in this period of continuous improvement, we have been remained focused on improving the long-term profitability of our business. As Tom reported, we made good progress this quarter, specifically one of the areas of immediate focus for us is that we will be continuing to improve our distribution efficiencies by investing in people, processes and systems to yield a long-term sustainable improvement. The bottom line with all this is that we expect to deliver another record year of sales and earnings, making fiscal 2008 our 19th consecutive EPS record.

Tina that concludes our prepared remarks. Now, we'd like to open it up to questions.
Question And Answer
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Charlie Brady with BMO Capital Market.
Charles Brady - BMO Capital Markets
Hi, thanks. Good morning, guys.
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning, Charlie.
Charles Brady - BMO Capital Markets
Hey, a great quarter by the way. In your gas turbine business and I know it's lumpy, but, it's clear the expectation for that business relative to where you were at the end of the year, you've really ratcheted that it up a lot. I am just wondering is that just being driven by a more near term influx of customer orders that have come in or projects that may be we're in the pipeline that were possible. But a little more uncertainty now that the uncertainty there has increased such that is always coming over much more highly probable, I mean the outlook for that business is up significantly from where you previously thought it was going to be?
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Charlie, this is Bill. It's mostly around I think the second point which is orders firming up. So we can see the projects but always see now as the orders firming up so that's why we've increased our guidance.
Charles Brady - BMO Capital Markets
Okay. And switching gears on special applications business. How much of that business is disk drive business now?
Thomas R. VerHage - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Charlie, this is Tom, approximately two-thirds of that business is disk drive.
Charles Brady - BMO Capital Markets
Okay. I mean, the performance in the Ag business in the quarter was also pretty strong and I am just wondering given the strength in Q1 why the rest of the year, if you had all together why the overall year performance wouldn't be little bit even stronger than kind of what you are projecting right now?
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Charlie, this is Bill. I think we don't have a tremendous amount of visibility in the described business. So, what we must rely on is sort of industry estimates of hard described shipments and that's what we factored into our guidance.
Charles Brady - BMO Capital Markets
Okay. Thanks. I'll get back in the queue.
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Okay.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Brian Drab of William Blair.
Brian Drab - William Blair
Hi. Good morning.
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning Brian.
Brian Drab - William Blair
First question, just around working capital. Looks like there is a slight up tick in accounts receivable and inventory days, wondering if you could just talk a little bit about that?
Thomas R. VerHage - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Hey Brian, this is Tom. Receivables are up actually quite a bit less than sales. I think receivables increased in the first quarter about 10% and as you know our sales growth was up 17% to 18%. So, we are fairly comfortable with where the receivables are. I'd say also on receivables, as you know; a lot of our sales growth took place overseas and generally overseas customers get longer terms than domestic customers. I mean on inventories, inventories were up by, I believe about 7%. Keep in mind that about half of that's currency with the stronger currencies.
Brian Drab - William Blair
Right.
Thomas R. VerHage - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
And, then consistent with our growing aftermarket model and having enough inventory and distribution centers to supply our customers as they need them, that would be another reason why inventories are up a bit.
Brian Drab - William Blair

Okay. And then thanks for the update on PowerCore, wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the dynamic, competitive dynamic between PowerCore and channel flowing? How you are seeing that develop?
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Brain, this is Bill. I think as we've talked about this the last couple of years, we knew or expected that if PowerCore was successful, other people would try and copy it and so may be in the spirit of imitation being the most sincere form of flattery other people are trying to copy it.
Brian Drab - William Blair
Right.
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
That's absolutely why we had started a couple of years working on the next generation and why we are going to be releasing this year. So, we are going to raise the bar again with the next generation PowerCore for our customers improve value in a smaller size. That's the way we are dealing with that. So, we do see competitors trying to copy our first generation technology, we are going to release the next generation.
Brian Drab - William Blair
Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from line of Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird
Good morning.
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning Rick.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird
Hey Bill, I just want to clarify the sales growth rates that you are providing the boost 7 and 9 for Engine and 11 to 13 for Industrial, is that in local currency for the full year?
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
That's in dollars, Rick.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird
Okay. So that's in reported dollars. Okay.
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Right.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird
And then you had referenced the defense and aerospace business as part of the Engine segment, which I understand, but could you give us... could you size that for us? How bigger piece do you talk to when you think of aerospace and defense and is that in the off-road piece or is that kind of the whole Engine segment?
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Rick, it is in the off-road piece and in fact this is between 3% and 4% of our total sales.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird
Okay. And then the last thing is and I struggle with this just a little bit, but the leverage in the business given the sales growth we've seen and I know you have made investments which may explain this. But if I try to adjust the sales and op profit for currency impact, my incremental op margin is around 10%. And by your segment disclosure, it would look like the greater incremental margin is coming out of the Industrial business than the Engine business. And I am just struggling a little bit as to why... are we intentionally absorbing some of that leverage with what I think is growth investments or why are we not showing a bit more incremental profit on the sales group?
Thomas R. VerHage - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Rick, this is Tom. Actually, I anticipated your question.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird
I must ask you too much.
Thomas R. VerHage - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
I think you did notice year-over-year that our Industrial Products margins did improve and that's going to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. Last year as you might recall, we were opening up a new plant in the Czech Republic for dust collectors and that had some plant start-up cost and the like. As far as growth investments, there is no question, we are going to continue to do that and I think that's paid for itself if you look at our growth in the first quarter, we wouldn't have that growth, if we wouldn't have made some of those growth investment. So, there is a lot of new product platforms coming out particularly on the Engine side that we are investing in. We are investing in sales and marketing both especially outside the United States. So, I think it's primarily the growth opportunities that we see and we are just going to need to continue to make those investments.

Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird
Okay. And do you feel that... exports up significantly for you or is again the international growth coming, product is manufactured there. But is the weaker dollar helped you in terms of exports?
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Rick, this is Bill. We do supply from our plants in the U.S. outside of NAFTA. But primarily most of what we sell outside of NAFTA, we make in the region and that actually helps us in terms of being naturally hedged. So, from a weaker dollar perspective, we haven't seen a big gain because we export a lot.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird
Yes, I understand. Okay, great. Thank you.
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Sure.

Your next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Bears Stearns.
Scott R. Graham - Bears Stearns
Hey good morning.
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning Scott.
Scott R. Graham - Bears Stearns
Couple of questions; one on the margin, one on the sales. We were... you indicated to us sort of during the middle two quarters of last year that you had this organizational spending to improve service rates to help out some of the newer facilities with logistics and what have you, that number I think raced all the way up to as much as $4 million and I think always the second or third quarter of last year. And then came off a bit in the fourth quarter, I was just kind of wondering if you would may recall out that what that number was this quarter?
Thomas R. VerHage - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Scott, this is Tom. I think what you are referring to is the third quarter last year when we did see that spike and identified the need to make some significant investments. We had two projects, key projects underway; one was in Belgium where we converted a manufacturing plant to a distribution center. That project is pretty much behind us, and now we are working on our distribution center in the United States on some important technology and process and organizational initiatives. So, that spending will continue for a bit yet and perhaps later on in the fiscal year, we'll hope we start to see some of those benefits. But that's going to be a long-term gain and we are going to see the benefits in the future.
Scott R. Graham - Bears Stearns
It doesn't though appears if it was as high this quarter as it was in that quarter that you indicated that was $4 million. Is that a fair statement?
Thomas R. VerHage - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
The $4 million back in the third quarter of last year included both of those distribution centers.
Scott R. Graham - Bears Stearns
Yes.
Thomas R. VerHage - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
We are still incurring some extra expenses in the first quarter of this year. And on a year-over-year basis, those extra expenses are approximately couple of million dollars.
Scott R. Graham - Bears Stearns
Thank you. On the sales growth, 5 of your 6 segment sales growth were really terrific and I was just wondering 2 of them in particular, off-road and aftermarket. Those sales looks like they accelerated this past quarter and maybe I've even lumped into that the IFS and I am just wondering if you could call out what other than strong international, was it more of a new customers, new distribution been to that and also the IFS being up 15, we had slower factory activity in United States and Europe. Yet, those sales were also were quite strong. I was just maybe wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on off-road, aftermarket and IFS.
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Scott, Bill here. First on the off-road, I think there, we are getting a benefit within that as we mentioned earlier in response to Rick's question about that our defense business is often its small portion of that, but it's up alive. It's up for two reasons: stronger sales to military customers and then the second is the inclusion of the AFS acquisition which we didn't have this time a year ago. So that helps. But aside from that, when we see very strong off-road conditions internationally, and we also see very strong Ag equipment conditions both in the U.S. and internationally, so, it's combination of those positive factors and off-road and more than offsetting what we see is some weakness in say residential construction equipment smaller, construction equipment that some of our customers have talked about in their releases. So the positives are more than offsetting that in the off-road.

In the aftermarket, I think it's to your point and as we discussed in our comments, it's around new distribution, more proprietary products and expanding internationally, it's a combination of those factors, we saw in the emerging markets in Europe that I referenced we saw very significant growth as a result of those efforts. And so that's a... those are the types of things that are add up to good aftermarket growth globally.
And then the last one in IFS; we see stronger growth there in Asia and Europe than we do in NAFTA, although as I mentioned our NAFTA business was up. But it's up a lot more in Asia and Europe and we really haven't seen what you've referenced, a slow down in Europe in that business. So we've seen continued strength at least through the first quarter there as well.
Scott R. Graham - Bears Stearns
That's very helpful, Thank you.
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Okay.

[Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from the line of Eli Lustgarten, with Longbow Securities.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research
Good morning.
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning Eli.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research
Couple of quick... just wanted to make sure I understood. You said, aerospace defense was 3% to 4% up total corporate sales or total engine sales?
Thomas R. VerHage - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Total corporate sales Eli.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research
The corporate sales, okay. And you also indicated in the prepared remarks the $2.5 million of option expense in the second quarter, that's coming. Do you have an idea what the share count change will look like over the year, are you expecting to buyback most of the pre-book, what's going on with share count based on the options?
Thomas R. VerHage - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes, Eli I'm going to go back to history on the share count. Think you might be aware that we bought back on average about 3% of our shares per year over the last 18 years and that's resulted in a net reduction of 2% after the stock options and grants, employee plans. We really don't comment prospectively, I think our press release indicated what we bought back in the --
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research
In the quarter, yes.
Thomas R. VerHage - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
So, what we do in the future will just depend on market conditions, share price and --
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research
But the game plan hasn't changed to make sure that to continue the process of hopefully offsetting share base.
Thomas R. VerHage - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes, over the long-term Eli that would continue to be our plan.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research
Okay. And what percentage of your off-road business is North American residential construction?
Rich Sheffer - Director of Investor Relations and Assistant Treasurer
Eli, this is Rich. North America is about 55% of our off-road business.
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
And you said residential.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research
Yes, how much of that is residential... is the small step with the medium lot?
Thomas R. VerHage - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
We look at the mix within off-road 20% to 25% is related to construction, less than half of that would be related to residential.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research
Okay, and the rest of it is mining and aerospace, to tell you that how you're defining off-road?
Thomas R. VerHage - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes mining...
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
And residential construction.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research
And average in that, right?
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Right.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research
Same question in the aftermarket business, what percentage is North American construction in the aftermarket business in Engine?
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Eli, this is Bill, I don't think we break that out typically.
Thomas R. VerHage - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes, the way we report off our aftermarket sales is a combination of both off-road and on-road replacement.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research
I realize that.
Thomas R. VerHage - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes. If you look at North America aftermarket is about 50% to 55% of our total aftermarket. So you're looking at a pretty small fraction once you get down to residential construction.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research
All right. Thank you.
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Sure.

We have a follow up question from the Charlie Brady with BMO Capital Markets.
Charles Brady - BMO Capital Markets
Thanks. If you could just get back to the diesel emission opportunity and sort of ratchet it down your expectation. There was fairly significant down tick in your expectation, can you just give a little more detail to what sort of played into that over the past I guess three months relative to where you were thinking before?
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Charlie, this is Bill, I think what we saw happen is the business started to be awarded for the next couple of years that we didn't win some of the platforms that we expected. And so, that's why we updated our guidance and provided. We still think that, that's a good growth opportunity, its not going to be as large as we hoped on the on-road side but as there is growth opportunity there for us and we are still pursuing it and then in the next decade around the off-road regulations, which come in 2011 and 2014, we think that there is going to be may be an opportunity that we are better suited to go after. So, we're going to be a long-term player, we just wanted to update the guidance based on what we see happening now.
Charles Brady - BMO Capital Markets
Are there still platforms yet to be awarded?
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
For the on-road for 2010; most of those have been awarded at this point.
Charles Brady - BMO Capital Markets
When would you expect the off-road awards to start coming out?
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Bill again here, the off-road we're probably over the next couple of, say, year to two years, okay. They are going to be at advance of the 2011, so in 2008, 2009.
Charles Brady - BMO Capital Markets
Great. Thanks very much.
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Sure.

Your next question comes from the line of Andrew DeAngelis [ph] with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Unidentified Analyst
Hi, guys.
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning.
Unidentified Analyst
My first question is a follow up from question asked earlier as it relates to PowerCore. I was just wondering what percentage of the aftermarket you currently expect that you're capturing as it relates to PowerCore sales?
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Which percentage, systems that we put out there or we captured with our --
Unidentified Analyst
From an aftermarket perspective, yes.
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
The PowerCore systems that we put out there, we're capturing, if not... may be not a 100% but pretty darn close to 100% of the replacement parts for those systems.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay, that's helpful. And then I wanted to focus not specifically on your GTS business. I know you don't provide margin by unit, but we're just kind of curious as to the margin trajectory of that business over the last several quarters and what we can expect going forward?

Thomas R. VerHage - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Andrew, this is Tom. You are right in your earlier comment. We don't provide margin guidance by product line, so I guess we won't be able to answer that question.
Unidentified Analyst
I mean can you talk implicitly though as to what the margins in that unit have done over the last several quarters and what you'd expect from the profile going forward?
Rich Sheffer - Director of Investor Relations and Assistant Treasurer
Sure. Andrew, this is Rich. I think what you are referring to is last year we had one or two issues with some large systems. I think its safe to say, since we didn't call anything out that we do not have recurrence of that this quarter that caused a down draft in the margins. So, I think things are operating fairly normally there.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. And then my last question relates to your Transportation Products Group. There is an ongoing share shift in the on-road segment in terms of the engine and I know your guidance hasn't changed in terms of the revenue growth profile that unit over fiscal 2008. I was just wondering what part of that $30 million to $40 million fall off in the first three quarters is kind of related to the market and what the impact of the share shift in that segment of the business might have to plan to the expectations over the next 3 or 4 quarters?
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
It's essentially all market.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Production volumes being down.
Unidentified Analyst
So you are not seeing a notable impact from the ongoing share shift there in on the engine side?
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
No
Unidentified Analyst
Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.

William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Sure.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Donaldson Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2008 Conference Call. During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. [Operator Instructions]. This conference is being recorded September 3rd, 2008.
I would now like to turn the call over to Rich Sheffer. Please go ahead.
Rich Sheffer - Investor Relations
Thank you, Nicole and welcome to Donaldson's 2008 fourth quarter conference call and webcast. Following my brief introduction, Tom VerHage, our Vice President and CFO will give us a brief review of our record fourth quarter operating results. Tom will then turn the call over to Bill Cook, our Chairman, President and CEO, who will discuss our initial outlook for fiscal 2009 and the business conditions shaping that view. Following Bill's remarks, we'll open up the call to questions.
Before I turn the call over to Tom, I need to review our Safe Harbor statement with you. Any statements in this call regarding our business that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements, and our future results could differ materially from the forward-looking statements made today. Our actual results may be affected by many important factors, including risks, and uncertainties identified in our press release, and in our SEC filings.
Now I'd like to introduce Tom VerHage. Tom?
Thomas R. VerHage - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Well thanks Rich, and good morning everyone. Well, as you saw in our press release late yesterday, we reported both another quarter and our 19th consecutive year of record earnings. Thanks to the continued broad-based strength in our sales growth. Each of our three regions and nearly all of our major product lines contributed to our 16% sales growth, with the impact of stronger foreign currencies being 7.2%.
As you will recall, our fourth quarter sales last year, included an extra week of sales in the U.S. which increased prior year sales by $16 million. Looking at the remainder of the income statement, we achieved our targeted 11% operating margin for the year, just like we did last year.
For the fourth quarter, our operating margin was 11.2%, which is down from 12.3% last year. This reduction is due to an increase in our operating expenses as a percent of sales. The major drivers of this increase include our business mix in the fourth quarter, information technology spending for our global customer support capabilities, end cost for product development initiatives that include a fourth quarter reclassification of some expenses or some of these expenses from cost of sales to operating expenses.
For fiscal '09, we're targeting operating expenses to once again be in the 21% range, compared to 21.5% for fiscal '08. While operating expenses as a percent of sales increased in the quarter, our gross margin percentage also increased.
The gross margin improvement is primarily due to the combination of higher production volumes, cost reduction and control efforts, planned productivity improvements and the recovery from customers of some previously incurred program development costs.
These benefits are partially offset by the rapid escalation on commodity costs and some lingering impact of the cost associated with the warehouse management system that we implemented earlier this year. As most of you are aware, we use the Last-In First Out or LIFO accounting method for our domestic inventories, which represent approximately half of our consolidated inventories.

In times of rising commodity costs, these cost increases are immediately charged to income rather than capitalized in inventory costs. We selected this method decades ago, as it lowers our taxable income, preserving cash flow for business needs rather than making higher tax payments. If you read the footnotes to our financial statements, you'll see that our LIFO reserve for year-end inventories is $38 million. This represents $38 million of lower taxable income over the many years we've used LIFO in comparison to the alternative First-In First Out or FIFO accounting method. And as stated in our press release, this LIFO method lowered our pre-tax income by $5 million in the fourth quarter alone.
Like the other companies, we continue to experience significant year-over-year purchased commodity costs in nearly all categories on a global basis. Steel and petroleum based commodities are at the top of our list of cost pressures. We are taking pricing actions in many of our product groups and will continue to negotiate recovery of these costs from our customers. In addition, we remain focused on our own product cost reduction efforts. Because of the rapid commodity price increases that we experienced in the fourth quarter, it may take a number of months before we accomplish all price recovery for these costs. However, we are maintaining our longstanding gross margin target of 32% for fiscal '09.
Our tax rate for the quarter was 26.6% and for the year the rate was 27.2%. This is slightly below the low end of the range that we provided last quarter of 28% to 31%.
In the fourth quarter, our earnings mix was more heavily weighted to lower tax countries and we received a 1.8 percentage point benefit from a foreign dividend and a favorable resolution of a foreign tax decision. Our tax rate expectation for fiscal '09 is in range of 29% to 32%.
Our CapEx came in at $70.8 million for the year, which is down from $76.6 million last year. We provided an estimate of $65 million to $70 million last quarter. It slightly exceeded the upper end of that range due to the stronger foreign currencies in the countries where much of our CapEx took place. Our CapEx outlook for fiscal '09 is a range of $70 million to $80 million and our estimate of depreciation and amortization is a range of $58 million to $62 million.
Free cash flow came in at $103 million, which is above the range of $75 million to $100 million that we previously provided. The fiscal '08 performance compares favorably to the prior year amount of $40 million. Our outlook for fiscal '09 is a range of $110 million to $140 million.
At this point, we expect interest expense in '09 to be comparable to the current year amount of $16.5 million. Our press release contains our fiscal '09 sales guidance, which is an increase of 9% to 11%. In previous years, our pricing has been relatively flat on a composite basis as we continue to redesign products and take out both content and cost. For fiscal '09 we have built in a 3.5% price increase into our sales to hopefully compensate for a significant portion of the commodity price increases.
So we are pleased to be able to report our 19th consecutive year of record earnings, and the fiscal 2009 achieves our expected EPS between $2.30 and $2.40 per share, it will be year 20 of this record string of earnings.
So with that, I will pass it over to Bill who will provide more background on our outlook. Bill?
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks Tom, and good morning everyone. In the next few minutes and before we open the call up to your questions, I'd like to cover three topics. First, I'll talk a little bit about our fourth quarter highlights, then our outlook for fiscal '09 and then I'll give you an update on two of our growth initiatives.

So starting first with our fourth quarter highlights, as Tom mentioned our sales growth was 16% and say that at constant exchange rates, it was 9%. Looking at our fourth quarter sales by region and in local currencies, sales were up 9% in NAFTA, 8% in both Europe and Asia-Pacific, and 19% in South Africa. As you may already know, we have two reporting segments; Engine and Industrial, which are lead by Jay Ward and Charlie McMurray respectively, and I'd like to give you some of their quarter highlights.
But before I get started, please note that all of the fourth quarter sales numbers I will cover will be stated in local currency. So they exclude the positive impact of exchange rate movement, and therefore are more indicative of our real business conditions and strength.
So starting first with our Engine segment in Europe, our European Engine business grew by 6%, due to good performances and our sales to off-road equipment OEMs as well as sales of replacement filters in the aftermarket. We attribute our off-road OEM growth of 7% during the quarter, to the combination of solid production rates of new equipment by our customers, as well as our own market share gains.
Our European Engine aftermarket business grew by 7%, aftermarket growth in the European emerging markets has been as we've mentioned before, one of our key growth priorities. We continue to expand our distribution of sales coverage in the Eastern Europe, Russia and the Middle East. And during the past year, this emerging market initiative delivered a 20% year-over-year sales increase.
Now switching to Asia, all of our engine businesses, OEM off-road, OEM on-road and the aftermarket had strong quarters up 24%, 14% and 8% respectively. Off-road equipment production by our customers is strong across Asia, as the heavy construction, mining and ag end markets there remain in the growth mode.
Truck production picked up in Japan, leading to our sales increase there. And continued healthy economic activity generally throughout the Asia-Pacific region had demand for our replacement filters growing in the quarter.
And now finally in NAFTA, our Engine business is up 3%, off-road equipment sales were up 9%, due primarily to a very strong performance by our aerospace and defense business unit. Their sales were up over 40% in the quarter, due to the combination of continued strong demand for filters for the new MRAP vehicles as well as replacement filters for the military equipment already in the field.
In addition, sales by one of our newest acquisitions, AFS of our Retrofit Air Filtration Systems for the Blackhawk helicopters have been very good. On the other hand, our NAFTA transportation business was down 27% in the quarter. Heavy truck build rates that our customers appeared to have now stabilized, but medium and light duty build rates continue to decline.
And in our NAFTA Engine aftermarket business, sales were up 8% in the quarter, a strong equipment utilization rates for larger off-road equipment that are used in heavy construction, mining and ag offset the weaker conditions in both the truck and smaller construction equipment related to the housing industry.
Now I switch to the other part of our company, the Industrial Group to talk about some of their highlights. So within the Industrial Group, the sales for our Industrial Filtration Solutions business were up 10%, as all 3 major regions grew between 8% and 11%.
In Europe, we saw solid demand for our IFS products in Western and Central Europe. Our NAFTA sales were strong for both new equipment and replacement filters. And in addition, our third quarter acquisition of LMC West contributed about 5% of the 11% sales increase in NAFTA during the quarter.
Our Gas Turbine business had an extremely strong shipment quarter with sales reaching $60 million, which represented a 26% increase over the same quarter in the prior year. Growth has been good globally in both the power generation and oil and gas end markets we serve.

And finally, our Special Applications business set... they closed out a record year with sales up... full year sales up 11%. The fourth quarter sales of our disk drive filters and membrane filtration products were up 2% over a very strong finish last year.
Now I am going to switch gears and talk about our outlook for the New Year for fiscal '09. And as you can see in our press release, we have provided our initial guidance and that is for our company sales to be up between 9% and 11%. Please note that this includes the benefit of some pricing as Tom mentioned, but excludes the impact of any potential future acquisitions. It also assumes that exchange rates remain at current levels.
So I'll start first with a general overall comment, we are expecting organic volume growth to be lower next year than the year we just ended, as general economic conditions are expected to be weaker in Europe.
Now talking about each of the businesses, and starting first with engine. Our full year Engine business sales are forecasted to up between 10% and 12%. Within our Engine business, heavy construction and mining equipment production rates by our customers remain solid. However, production rates for smaller equipments used primarily in residential construction are expected to remain weak.
We see our NAFTA truck-related business remaining at current levels through the first half of our fiscal year and then beginning to grow in the second half. It is expected that another pre-buy will begin during calendar 2009, in advance of the 2010 diesel emission regulations. And that the calendar 2009 build rates will increase by 30% to 35% over 2008. However, the exact timing of this projected improvement is difficult to gauge at this time.
Our customers ag equipment production rates is expected to remain strong, as the latest reports forecast both U.S. crop prices and farmers' incomes to be up, which is a positive sign for the ag equipment market.
And finally, in the Engine business, we expect our aftermarket filter sales to grow, as we continue to create proprietary replacement opportunities for ourselves, and as we focus on developing new markets internationally.
Now switching to the fiscal '09 outlook for our Industrial segment, in our Industrial business overall, we see full year sales growing at 8% to 10%. Within our IFS business, which includes our best collectors and compressed air filters, our order backlogs are good and suggest a strong start to the new year.
In addition, we should benefit from market share gains from our new line of recently introduced PowerCore dust collectors. As a result, we expect sales growth of 8% to 12% in fiscal 2009.
In our gas turbine business, we have good visibility for shipments over the next few quarters. We expect our full year sales growth rate to be in the 5% to 10% as there are now some industry capacity constraints. We still expect that demand for gas turbines and our filter systems will continue to grow through 2011.
And finally, we expect our special application business to be up 5% to 10% in fiscal 2009. This is expected to be led by continued growth in our PTFE membrane filtration products business.
Now, let me give you an update on two of our major growth initiatives, and the first is PowerCore. We talked about this for quite a while and we continue to be very successful with this breakthrough air filtration technology. Our engine-related PowerCore sales were up 56% in the quarter to $19 million, as first fit [ph] sales grew 26% and replacement filter sales grew 76%.
And as you may have seen, earlier this year, we raised the bar again with the introduction of our PowerCore Generation2 or Gen2. PowerCore Gen2 allows us to further reduce the system size or enhance the system performance, which is critically important for our customers, given the new engine technologies and their vehicle space and weight constraints.

We have already won 10 platforms, five on-road and five off with Gen2. And 70% of the platforms we currently have in either the proposal or development stage are with our new Gen2 technology. In the gas turbine we are continuing to market... the market introduction of our PowerCore technology. Since introduction, we shipped 32 systems and have orders for an additional two systems already in hand for fiscal '09.
And finally, as I mentioned a minute ago, we've now introduced a new line of dust collectors in our IFS business, these new products also use our PowerCore technology, and allow us to deliver a system that is 50% smaller than the traditional baghouse system it replaces. We introduced this product this spring and have been very pleased with this strong initial market acceptance.
The other growth initiative I want to cover is our expansion projects and as Tom mentioned, we expect the CapEx to be between $70 million and $80 million in fiscal 2009. In addition to supporting numerous process improvement and cost reduction projects, we have a number of major expansion projects underway to support our continued growth. We recently finished our major expansion of our existing engineer filter plant in Klasterec in the Czech Republic.
We are nearing completion of the start up of our air filtration manufacturing line in Brazil. And we should... that should be a production later this fall. In India, we're expanding our existing filtration plant. This expansion essentially represents the tripling of the current facility and is necessary to support the continued growth of our customers in India.
And finally, the expansion of our disk drive filter plant in Rayong, Thailand is proceeding on schedule. And we expect to have additional manufacturing capacity available later this year.
Now before we open the call up to your questions, I'd like to offer a few summary comments. I hope what has happened into our fiscal '08 results is the strength of the business model we have pursued over the past 20 plus years. The essence of this business model is our relentless focus on growing our company through extensive geographic and end market diversification. We have determined that this diversification has reduced the negative impact of any one end market or regional economic cycle.
It allows us the opportunity combined with effective execution to do two things. The first is obviously to serve our customers. The second is to continue to deliver record financial results for our shareholders.
Looking forward, we will continue to grow and further diversify it within our targeted filter markets. We expect that the combination of our diversified portfolio of filtration businesses combined with our effective execution will allow us to deliver yet another record year of sales and earnings in fiscal '09.
As Tom mentioned, our EPS guidance for fiscal '09 is between $2.30 and $2.40 per share, which is both a new record and up between 8% and 13% over the year we just completed. Achieving this will result in our 20th consecutive earnings record. That is our target.
And finally, before we move to Q&A, I would like to remind you that we will be at the New York Stock Exchange tomorrow to do two things. The first is to host an analyst day and the second is to ring the closing bell to celebrate achieving our first $2 billon year in revenues.
Our analyst day will be webcast on the Investors page of our website. We will also provide a link on that page to view the bell ringing ceremony. Regarding that ceremony, earlier this year, we decided to have some fun with this impending milestone and we created a guess the date we hit $2 billion in sales event. Approximately 6000 of our fellow employees around the world submitted guesses.
Kim Webster is one of our 150 employees who guessed the correct date, which was June 30th. Kim is a senior buyer from our Leicester, UK plant and with his wife, Deborah he will represent our company and our achievement by ringing the closing bell tomorrow afternoon. Please tune into see it.

Nicole, that concludes our prepared remarks. Now I'd like to open up it up to the questions.
Question And Answer
Operator
Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Eli Lustgarten with Longbow Securities. Please go ahead.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities
Good morning.
Thomas R. VerHage - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Good morning, Eli.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities
I have a couple of quick questions on the outlook. One, in the guidance you talked about foreign currency exchange rates not changing. Can you give us some idea, what kind of foreign currency assumptions you have built into your guidance at this point, assuming rates don't change?
Rich Sheffer - Investor Relations
Eli, this is Rich Sheffer. What we are expecting is assuming that the dollar stays about where it is now, where it's been trading the last few weeks, it's going to still be a little bit of a tailwind in the first half of the year and somewhere around mid-year at these rates it would flip over and create a headwind in the second half. So, overall right now the total impact could be a slight headwind for the full year.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities
And that means that the... you have to fully replace the $0.16 of earnings that you reported this year from currency or will we be able to generate a little bit of that... we would not fully have to replace it?
Rich Sheffer - Investor Relations
The thought is whatever the impact is going to be, compared to last year it's baked into the guidance. So yes, we would replace it.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities
Yes, but so... the assumption doesn't have any of the $0.16 in it at all?
Thomas R. VerHage - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Hi Eli, this is Tom. That is correct.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities
Okay. Because it's an impressive gain without the foreign currency that where I am driving to. You mentioned 3%, 3.5% pricing. Is that pretty well evenly distributed across these businesses or is it skewed in any one action by either an engines or industrial products?
Thomas R. VerHage - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Hi. Eli, this is Tom. It really varies not only between engine and industrial, but within engine and industrial. So it's hard to be specific without getting into each individual product line, but short answer is it really varies.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities
Yes, and this is will go from like zero to 7% or 8%, that kind of magnitude?
Thomas R. VerHage - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Even more, the upper end is even more, Eli.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities
Okay, so... you are viewing [ph] that. And finally, when looking at your guidance, probably the number of the biggest risk is probably the truck recovery which the base of how you do the recovery, pre-buy will be next year. And whether it even occur because of the July fiscal year, it could not even occur in 2000... in your fiscal 2009 just on a timing basis. And I think you cited that. If we did not see upturn until almost your fiscal 2010, would that be lower end of your guidance be flooding by that, is that critical to your lower end of the guidance?
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Eli, this is Bill. North American heavy truck represents 3% of our overall sales. So even if it didn't happen like or we talked about in our guidance, based on with the industry forecast are, it's really a very small part of our company and it's really part of that whole diversification story that we've talked about as we... 20 years ago that would have been a big deal for Donaldson as you know because you've followed us for a long time. Now it's not that big a deal, 3% of our revenues for fiscal '09.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities

Alright. You feel pretty comfortable no matter as long as this will depend on your...
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Right. I mean it's an important... we have... what we want to have is lots of 3% or 4% segments so it's an important segment. But if we're not, we are not writing that up and down as a company like we used to.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities
And one of that question, are there any new developments in platforms or something that would make the 2010 emission then... the subsequent 2011 emissions for a construction act on the AK4 [ph] engine, a significant market for Donaldson directly?
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Eli, this is Bill again. I think that's baked into our guidance. We are working on those programs now for both the on and off-road and that's part of what we are using our new PowerCore technology is to lock up as many those as we can.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities
So there is no contract and new awards you talked about that you referred 2010 emissions and is that part of your--
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
They are related to the emission regulation as you pointed out so it's not just emission control devices, but it's new generation air and liquid filters as well.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities
Okay, thank you.
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Sure, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets
Hi guys.
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning, Jeff.
Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets
Just wanted to dig into some of the segments to understand a little bit better, some of the moving pieces and I think this plays into the guidance little bit. But your off-road is just, if you strip out the FX, it's just been growing exceptionally not the parse, still good growth in this quarter but after three quarters at 20% plus, it slowed to 10%. I just wanted to know, wanted to understand within that, what might be driving that if it's a specific region or sub-vertical? And then also special apps, I think you mentioned some of that slower growth in disk drive. That also slowed pretty materially in the fourth quarter, and I just want to understand that dynamic as well?
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Jeff, Bill. I'll start with your second question on the special apps. I think part of that is it had a very strong finish last year. So it's a tough comparable quarter-over-quarter. As I noted that they had a... year-over-year, they had a very good year.
In terms of our guidance going forward, I think, would be may be just... a lot of that's driven by the PC market and we're using published data to factor into our forecast in terms of what's seen out there.
On the off-road, I think as I mentioned, the part of the off-road are off-road business that's the weakest is the smaller equipment that's mostly related to residential. We do not see that improving anytime soon. We still see strong conditions for the larger equipment which is used for heavy construction and mining. So it's a mixture of the two. And on top of that, you have the ag business which has grown quite a bit. We see that maintaining sort of a high level, but probably not growing much beyond that, and our defense business, which we had a great quarter.
So it's... there are some pluses and minuses and there the weakest part is that smaller equipment related to residential construction.
Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets
Okay. And then just overall, you commented at the beginning that you definitely see lower organic growth in fiscal '09. I think your main comment around that was some slower growth in Europe and what specifically have you seen near term in terms of a change in momentum in Europe in general that would facilitate that comment?

William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
I think what we... Jeff, Bill again. I think what we are doing there is we are... as we are reading in the paper about the calling down the GDP growth rates in the UK and the Germany and other parts of Europe and that's what's making us cautious. We had a strong finish to our business in Europe so that... but I think it's that we are seeing at least reports of weakness in the general sectors in the Western Europe and we are factoring that into our guidance for next year.
Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets
Okay. And then finally on the price increases, have you already announced all of your price increase that would get you to that 3% or do you have to announce more and may be just give us a sense of what the feedback you've been getting in terms of push back being able to realize that, any kind of demand instruction around some of these more substantial price increases?
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Jeff, Bill again. Nobody, whether as a consumer or in a business likes the word price increase, so there is... you are not welcomed with open arms when you come in for those types of discussions. I think the thing is that everybody now understands that this isn't the temporary situation and it's here to stay.
So, generally our initial focus is trying to figure out with our customers ways of offsetting the impact of price increases and as Tom mentioned, through, whether it's cost reductions or process improvements to mitigate the impact and then try and negotiate for the recovery of whatever is left. We do that as we incur the cost on an actual basis. So the 3.5% that Tom mentioned is our projection for the year. In some cases, depending on the products, if there is a lot of steel for example, we've already raised prices, we're working that. In other cases, where the materials are different, we have not and we're already doing that based on the actual cost that we've incurred and so we'll be doing that throughout the balance in this new fiscal year.
Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets
But would you say, what you've already announced, you're getting that the realization you need to get to this 3.5%?
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
No, we haven't. We haven't done all the pricing actions that would total up to the 3.5%. Because we probably haven't seen all of that impact, some of that's based on an anticipated impact to the fiscal '09. And as I mentioned, we don't ask for the price increase until we actually incur it.
Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets
Okay. Perfect, thanks guys.
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Maczka with BB&T Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Kevin Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets
Bill, Tom, good morning.
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning, Kevin.
Thomas R. VerHage - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Good morning, Kevin.
Kevin Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets
I have a question on some of the operating costs and some of the things that may be one-time in nature may be not, things like IT spending, the four plants that you're expanding or launching this year. Are some of those costs one-time in nature that may not recur in '09 and the third bucket I guess is R&D, I'm assuming that will recur next year. But if you can just comment on those three items, is there anything big there that won't repeat to the same extent in '09?
Thomas R. VerHage - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Kevin, this is Tom. I guess first of all, keep in mind, we've provided the guidance of 21% operating expenses as a percent of sales for next year. As we look at, I think you're primarily interested in the fourth quarter '07 to '08. First, '07 was just a very low quarter from an operating expenses standpoint, I believe 20.1%.

But a couple of things, Kevin I did mention a reclassification of some R&D expenses from cost of sales to operating expenses. And that created about a half a point impact in the quarter. Now, that has no impact for the year because that was an adjustment from the first three quarters to the fourth quarter, no impact for the year, but that did have an impact in the fourth quarter and of course we don't anticipate for that to increase.
There was a little bit of a mix issue, both if you think about the very high sales in our Industrial segment versus the Engine segment. Industrial runs a little higher operating expenses and a little higher gross margin than the Engine segment. So mix is going to really vary quarter-to-quarter.
The product development expenses were up year-over-year. That was about just two-tenths of a point and that will very likely continue in the future as we focus on a lot of the product development initiatives that Bill mentioned.
IT infrastructure cost, I think we had a bit of a blip in the fourth quarter. That was about a half of a point of the increase. So I would expect that to be a more normal level of spend in F '09. And then as in any quarter there is... there were some small one-time items that came up, none of them individually at all significant, but that had a couple of tenths of a point impact as well. So I hope that answers your question, Kevin.
Kevin Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets
Okay. And then on the expansion projects, Bill, you mentioned the four plants that are either very closed to completion or will be completed later this year. I guess once those are complete give us an update on how you feel about your capacity at that point, is maybe the plan to have another phase necessary of further expansions beyond that?
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Good question. I think it's unlikely that we'll have four projects underway at the same time if we look at like 6 or 9 months from now. Just because of I think we... this is a sort of unusual period where we had four at the same time. But typically Kevin, we are always going to have probably 1 or 2 or 3 underway, adding capacity in different parts of the world.
How do we feel about our capacity situation right now? I think we're in pretty good shape. We have some plants that we haven't announced yet, so I can't disclose it for additional capacity. But that's more of... is part of that normal process that I mentioned, where we have to add some every year. And it's a consequence approach, so it's a good thing.
Kevin Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets
Okay. And just one more if I could, Tom, can you just help me reconcile, you said 3.5 percentage points of prices baked into your revenue guidance. But did you say organic volume growth would be negative and so my question is if that's true, with very little foreign exchange impact, how do we get to the 9% to 11% on the top line?
Thomas R. VerHage - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Kevin, Tom again. I don't think anybody said that organic growth would be negative. So if you take our sales guidance and back off the 3.5% for selling price increases, the remainder would essentially be organic growth.
Kevin Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets
Okay, got it. Thanks for the clarification.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Drab with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Brian Drab - William Blair
Good morning.
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning, Brian.
Brian Drab - William Blair
Congratulations on a great year in a tough environment.
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you.
Brian Drab - William Blair
I think most of my questions have been answered at this point. But just a follow-up question on the operating expenses. You mentioned that the IT expense in the fourth quarter was a little bit of a blip, and I was just wondering if you could give us some more color on that, and also talk a little bit about the warehouse management system at your Rensselaer operation, to whether your expenses came in inline with expectations and if that project is done?

Thomas R. VerHage - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes Brain, Tom here. I'll take the last one first. For the distribution expenses at our U.S. facility in Indiana, we came in very close to the guidance we provided last quarter. The incremental expenses there in the fourth quarter were about $1.9 million, so for the second half of the year that totaled up to about $7.6 million. And we think we have that pretty much behind us now. So we aren't expecting any of those incremental expenses to go forward in the future.
And then on the IT expenses, we had a couple of systems initiatives wrap up in the fourth quarter and at the conclusion of those implementation there is a bit of a blip in spending. So again, customer care systems wrapping up ERP modules and things like that came up in the fourth quarter and that caused the increase in spending.
Brian Drab - William Blair
Okay, great. That's all I have. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charlie Brady with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst
Good morning this is actually Tom Brickman [ph] standing in for Charlie Brady.
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning, Tom.
Unidentified Analyst
Just a couple of questions. You mentioned that the gross margin, you had some impacts from the... you said some recovery of previously incurred product development cost. Can you go in a detail about that a little bit, please?
Thomas R. VerHage - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Tom, this is Thomas VerHage. That was a relatively small impact about four-tenths of a point and that happens from time to time where we feel a loud costs that we previously incurred. We covered them from customers in a quarter later than when we actually incurred the costs.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. And you've mentioned a little bit about how it's a small percentage of your sales but first half '09 translation product sales. I guess you were talking about how the trucks... on-road trucks are only about 3% of your sales, but can you just talk about expectations for translational products in general first half '09?
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
First half of what? Tom, this is Bill, first half of our fiscal '09?
Unidentified Analyst
Yes.
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Pretty flat and then in the next calendar year in advance of the emission regulations in 2010 that we anticipate that another pre-buy or at least a volume increase for whatever reasons but we probably most are dealers pre-buy. So I think I said 30% to 35% calendar year '09 over calendar '08. So that would affect a second half of our fiscal '09.
Unidentified Analyst
Got you. Okay, yes. In the special applications products, you also mentioned this again. You were saying what's causing the slowdown in growth just to going into more detail about that?
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Tom, Bill again. I think it's just based on what we see with the industry forecasts for hard drive shipments, hard disk drive shipments.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. Yes, and finally the... did you have a gross margin percentage that was for the commodity costs? Did you break that out just for the quarter?
Thomas R. VerHage - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes Tom, Tom VerHage. Actually I am glad you asked. That impact for the quarter was about 1% and as we mentioned in the press release, and I mentioned in my comments, that is almost entirely due to our optional election of the LIFO method of accounting, because all of those... when we purchase those commodities at those increased costs, that goes into our income statement immediately, rather than capitalizing that in inventory. So had we been on FIFO, we would have reported $5 million more for additional pre-tax income in the quarter than we did by being under LIFO method here in the U.S.

Unidentified Analyst
Okay. And okay, so going forward you said we've already put through price increases going offset the steel, cost pressures you've seen. But as far as other commodity cost, I mean I guess in the near future maybe in the next quarter or so, you may still see the pressures but after that the price hike should flow through. I guess just wondering about how quickly the price hikes will flow through?
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Tom, it is Bill Cook. On a gradual basis and again as I... on a as incurred basis, so as we... as it affect us, we go to our customers and start negotiating for price increases for any part that we can't mitigate through cost reductions. So it's happening now and it's going to happen through, at least the first half of the fiscal year, new fiscal year.
Unidentified Analyst
I got you. Okay, thank you.
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line Andrew Obin with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Andrew Obin - Merrill Lynch
Hi guys, good morning.
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning, Andrew.
Andrew Obin - Merrill Lynch
Just a couple of small questions. What percentage of off-highway equipment is ag equipment. Could you comment on that?
Rich Sheffer - Investor Relations
Andrew, this is Rich. Ag makes up between 20% and 25% of our off-road equipment.
Andrew Obin - Merrill Lynch
Has the mix shifted as ag has been growing, has the mix shifted or have you had enough international growth on the construction side that the mix has remained fairly comparable in the past couple of years?
Rich Sheffer - Investor Relations
Yes, given the strength in a lot of our off-road end markets, we've seen maybe 1% or 2%, but still stand in within that band. So basically all the bolts have been lifting.
Andrew Obin - Merrill Lynch
And the second question I have is just as I said it's a small question, but you noted a relatively flat production I guess in trucks in Europe and is that based on an industry forecast or is that based on specific conversations you guys had with your customers in Europe?
Rich Sheffer - Investor Relations
Andrew, Rich again, just based on our internal forecast, we take into account both fee the published forecast and our conversations with our customers specifically. So we are looking for single-digit growth in the truck business in Europe in fiscal '09.
Andrew Obin - Merrill Lynch
Okay.
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Andrew, this is Bill. We always start with your reports and then factor in what we hear from our customers as well.
Andrew Obin - Merrill Lynch
Great, need to know when I ask you guys for industry color. No, but I appreciate it. Thank you very much.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Stone with Kayne Anderson Investment. Please go ahead.
Craig Stone - Kayne Anderson Rudnick
Have you seen any competition for the second fit of PowerCore applications? If you haven't, why not and are the OEMs building any language into the warranties about PowerCore?
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
This is Bill. On the PowerCore, what we had anticipated initially when we launched the first generation that when it was successful because we intended for it to be successful that there wouldn't be people trying to copy it. We have lot in intellectual property around it and we defend that aggressively but our best defense with PowerCore is to replace our cells with new technology and that's what we've done with the generation2 or the Gen2. So, we're trying to see some people trying to get into the market on a replacement with the Gen1 and now we've raised the bar again with our Gen2.

In terms of the question about the OEs, the OEs like our PowerCore because they're very interested in protecting the replacement parts and that's an important part of their business. So, it allows them and us through them to lock up that replacement parts business. So, they are very positive. I am not sure if I answered your question. But were you talking about warranty specifically?
Craig Stone - Kayne Anderson Rudnick
I am asking if the OEMs require PowerCore as replacement filters in order to maintain the warranty.
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Okay. The OEMs both... today nothing else will fit generally and deliver the performance. So, I guess in the sense in order to protect the warranty they have to gap these filter that's going to work. The answer is yes. But I'm not sure there is specific warranty language that requires the PowerCore.
Craig Stone - Kayne Anderson Rudnick
Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up question from the line of Kevin Maczka with BB&T Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Kevin Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets
I just had a question on the gas turbine business. It was such a huge year this year, so you've got tough comps obviously, but Bill you talked about some new PowerCore products coming soon. You're in the middle of an upcycle. There is still strength in your international power gen and oil and gas markets. I'm just wondering if you could give a little bit more color on what you are seeing that would dictate a 5% to 10% top line.
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
I think Kevin, the issue there is, there are other not related to Donaldson. But there are other supplier constraints for the turbine manufacturers that are limiting how many turbines they can manufacture. And so that the market is as you're suggesting is marketing conditions are stronger in that but there is a capacity constraint in the production of turbines.
Kevin Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets
Okay. And can you just talk a little bit on your... is there a notable mix there between power gen and oil and gas and maybe any other end market?
William M. Cook - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes, Kevin I am not... a notable mix between the two. Nothing has really changed over the last year between the two.
Kevin Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets
Okay. Okay, that's all I had. Thank you.
