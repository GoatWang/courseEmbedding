Detecting localized trace species in air using radar resonance-enhanced multi-photon ionization



Dogariu, Arthur
						; Miles, Richard B.
February 2011 - Applied Optics


A microwave-scattering-based resonance-enhanced multi-photon ionization technique is used to detect molecular species such as NO, CO, Xe, and Ar in pure form, and for standoff detection of trace species in atmospheric pressure air. In this paper,the spectra, dynamics, and the detection limits of trace species in air are studied. We demonstrate 10 m scale standoff detection of NO, and show that the system has a linear response down to the parts in 10{sup 9} NO levels in ambient air.

Versatile radar measurement of the electron loss rate in air



Dogariu, Arthur
						; Shneider, Mikhail N.
						; Miles, Richard B.
November 2013 - Applied Physics Letters


We present an experimental method that makes possible in-situ measurements of the electron loss rate in arbitrary gas mixtures. A weakly ionized plasma is induced via resonant multiphoton ionization of trace amounts of nitric oxide seeded into the gas, and homodyne microwave scattering detection is used to study the dynamics of the electron loss mechanisms. Using this approach, the attachment rate for electrons to molecular oxygen in room temperature, atmospheric pressure air is determined. The measured 0.76 × 10{sup 8} s{sup −1} attachment rate is in very good agreement with predictions based on literature data.

Femtosecond laser electronic excitation tagging for quantitative velocity imaging in air



Michael, James B.
						; Edwards, Matthew R.
						; Dogariu, Arthur
						; ... September 2011 - Applied Optics


Time-accurate velocity measurements in unseeded air are made by tagging nitrogen with a femtosecond-duration laser pulse and monitoring the displacement of the molecules with a time-delayed, fast-gated camera. Centimeter-long lines are written through the focal region of a {approx}1 mJ, 810 nm laser and are produced by nonlinear excitation and dissociation of nitrogen. Negligible heating is associated with this interaction. The emission arises from recombining nitrogen atoms and lasts for tens of microseconds in natural air. It falls into the 560 to 660 nm spectral region and consists of multiple spectral lines associated with first positive nitrogen transitions. The feasibilitymore » of this concept is demonstrated with lines written across a free jet, yielding instantaneous and averaged velocity profiles. The use of high-intensity femtosecond pulses for flow tagging allows the accurate determination of velocity profiles with a single laser system and camera.« less

Laser induced avalanche ionization in gases or gas mixtures with resonantly enhanced multiphoton ionization or femtosecond laser pulse pre-ionization



Shneider, Mikhail N.
						; Miles, Richard B.
August 2012 - Physics of Plasmas


The paper discusses the requirements for avalanche ionization in gas or gas mixtures initiated by REMPI or femtosecond-laser pre-ionization. Numerical examples of dependencies on partial composition for Ar:Xe gas mixture with REMPI of argon and subsequent classic avalanche ionization of Xe are presented.

Simultaneous resonant enhanced multiphoton ionization and electron avalanche ionization in gas mixtures



Shneider, Mikhail N.
						; Zhang Zhili
						; Miles, Richard B.
July 2008 - Journal of Applied Physics


Resonant enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) and electron avalanche ionization (EAI) are measured simultaneously in Ar:Xe mixtures at different partial pressures of mixture components. A simple theory for combined REMPI+EAI in gas mixture is developed. It is shown that the REMPI electrons seed the avalanche process, and thus the avalanche process amplifies the REMPI signal. Possible applications are discussed.

Numerical study of boundary layer separation control using magnetogasdynamic plasma actuators



Kalra, Chiranjeev S.
						; Shneider, Mikhail N.
						; Miles, Richard B.
October 2009 - Physics of Fluids (1994)


In this study, an efficient, time dependent, two-dimensional Navier-Stokes numerical code for shockwave boundary layer interaction in air is developed. Nonthermal surface plasma actuation is evaluated for effective shockwave induced boundary layer separation control within supersonic inlets. Specifically, high speed magnetogasdynamic plasma actuators are of interest. In these, localized ionization is produced close to the wall surface and then the flow is accelerated using strong magnetic fields. To replicate the experiments done at large boundary layer thickness, the code is divided into time independent and time dependent regimes to significantly reduce computation time. Computational results are in good agreement withmore » experiments in terms of the flow structure as shown by Schlieren imaging, acetone planar laser scattering, and the static pressure profile on the test section wall.« less

Plasma induced by resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization in inert gas



Shneider, Mikhail N.
						; Zhang Zhili
						; Miles, Richard B.
December 2007 - Journal of Applied Physics


We present a detailed model for the evolution of resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) produced plasma during and after the ionizing laser pulse in inert gas (argon, as an example) at arbitrary pressures. Our theory includes the complete process of the REMPI plasma generation and losses, together with the changing gas thermodynamic parameters. The model shows that the plasma expansion follows a classical ambipolar diffusion and that gas heating results in a weak shock or acoustic wave. The gas becomes involved in the motion not only from the pressure gradient due to the heating, but also from the momentum transfermore » from the charged particles to gas atoms. The time dependence of the total number of electrons computed in theory matches closely with the results of coherent microwave scattering experiments.« less

Coherent Microwave Rayleigh Scattering from Resonance-Enhanced Multiphoton Ionization in Argon



Zhang Zhili
						; Shneider, Mikhail N.
						; Miles, Richard B.
June 2007 - Physical Review Letters


Multiphoton ionization and electron recombination processes are studied in argon using coherent microwave Rayleigh scattering from a localized, resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization produced plasma. A time dependent one-dimensional plasma dynamic model is developed to predict the time evolution of the microwave scattering from the plasma. Experimental results of the argon ionization spectrum and electron recombination rates are in good agreement with the model predictions.

Microwave diagnostics of laser-induced avalanche ionization in air



Zhang Zhili
						; Shneider, Mikhail N.
						; Miles, Richard B.
October 2006 - Journal of Applied Physics


This work presents a simplified model of microwave scattering during the avalanche ionization stage of laser breakdown and corresponding experimental results of microwave scattering from laser breakdown in room air. The model assumes and measurements confirm that the breakdown regime can be viewed as a point dipole scatterer of the microwave radiation and thus directly related to the time evolving number of electrons. The delay between the laser pulse and the rise of the microwave scattering signal is a direct measure of the avalanche ionization process.

Effects of a conducting sphere moving through a gradient magnetic field.



Miles, Richard B.
						; Kalra, Chiranjeev S.
						; Shneider, Mikhail
						; ... April 2010


We examine several conducting spheres moving through a magnetic field gradient. An analytical approximation is derived and an experiment is conducted to verify the analytical solution. The experiment is simulated as well to produce a numerical result. Both the low and high magnetic Reynolds number regimes are studied. Deformation of the sphere is noted in the high Reynolds number case. It is suggested that this deformation effect could be useful for designing or enhancing present protection systems against space debris.

Product Description:

Linda Blair stars as a 14-year-old girl who is sent to a state home for troubled girls after running away from her abusive family multiple times. The facility proves to be just as bad, and she suffers at the hands of the other girls. This raw, made-for-TV film has gathered a reputation over the years, mostly due to a graphic (for network television in 1974) rape scene which is often cut when the film airs.
