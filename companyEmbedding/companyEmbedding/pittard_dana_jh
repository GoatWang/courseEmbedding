Pittard was reprimanded by the Army for his “excessive involvement” in awarding a $492,000 contract and for “creating the perception of preferential treatment.” (Tony Gutierrez/AP)   By Craig Whitlock  By Craig Whitlock   June 21, 2015  Follow @craigmwhitlock     A key Army commander in the U.S. war against the Islamic State has been reprimanded by the Pentagon for steering a defense contract to a firm run by two of his former classmates at West Point, becoming the latest high-ranking officer to land in trouble for personal misconduct. Maj. Gen. Dana J.H. Pittard, who as the Army’s deputy commander for operations in the Middle East oversaw the training of Iraqi forces, was formally reprimanded in February after a three-year investigation by the Army’s inspector general, according to documents obtained by The Washington Post under the Freedom of Information Act.  An Army review board is considering whether to strip him of his rank as a two-star general before he is allowed to retire this year.  Pittard, long considered a rising star in the Army, returned to the United States in April from his headquarters in Kuwait. The Army has not previously disclosed Pittard’s departure, and an official Army Web site still lists him as its deputy commander in the Middle East. An Army spokeswoman said that he completed his assignment and that his return was not related to his misconduct.  The U.S. military has been tarred by a series of ethical breaches committed by generals and admirals in recent years. Although Pentagon officials have vowed to crack down, the armed forces often seek to keep such cases out of the limelight to protect the reputations of their top brass. Last year, for example, military officials said the commander of Special Operations forces in Central and South America had retired for “health and personal reasons.” In fact, it was uncovered in June after a review of documents that the commander, Army Brig. Gen. Sean P. Mulholland, had been disciplined for repeatedly becoming intoxicated in public and getting into altercations. Similarly, the Navy has withheld details of misconduct committed by admirals in a corruption and bribery scandal involving an Asian defense contractor. In February, the Navy announced that it had censured three admirals, but it has refused to release public records documenting their actions or to identify other officers who have been subjected to administrative action. The investigation into Pittard began in 2011 after an anonymous whistleblower alleged that the general had “abused his authority by awarding lucrative renewable energy contracts to his friends” while serving as the commander of Fort Bliss in Texas, the documents show.  The tip prompted separate probes by the Army’s inspector general and its Criminal Investigation Command. The FBI also became involved, culminating in the federal conviction of one of Pittard’s former West Point classmates on wire-fraud charges in September.  Pittard was not accused of financial gain but was reprimanded by the Army for his “excessive involvement” in awarding the $492,000 contract and for “creating the perception of preferential treatment,” according to his reprimand. The contract was an initial step in a $250 million project to make Fort Bliss, one of the Army’s largest installations, self-sufficient in energy usage. Pittard declined to be interviewed for this article. In a statement, he described his actions as a result of his determination to move quickly on the energy project, a high priority for the Army. “I invited a measure of risk with the contracting process,” he wrote. “Throughout my 34 years of service as an Army leader, I have always operated with an understanding that some risk is acceptable in taking action that will benefit our force.” “If my example deters other senior Army leaders from taking bold risk in the future, that is unfortunate,” he added. The Army declined to comment in detail. In a statement, Cynthia O. Smith, an Army spokeswoman, said the misconduct findings and Pittard’s reprimand “called into question his suitability for continued service and resulted in his request for retirement, effectively ending his career in the Army.” Pittard is a decorated combat veteran who served multiple tours in Iraq. As a military aide to President Bill Clinton, he was entrusted with the “nuclear football,” the briefcase containing codes for launching a nuclear attack.  In 2012, he made headlines for a blog post in which he lambasted soldiers who commit suicide, calling it “an absolutely selfish act.” He later apologized, saying he had been frustrated by the recent suicides of two soldiers under his command. A native of El Paso, Pittard returned home in July 2010 to take one of the Army’s plum assignments: commander of Fort Bliss, which covers a territory bigger than Rhode Island and has about 30,000 active-duty soldiers. Prior to his arrival, Fort Bliss had drawn scrutiny from federal investigators for contracting irregularities. Pittard pledged to clean up what he called “low-level corruption” in the contracting office. “We’ve got to make sure there is no cronyism. There are some gross examples of where we have paid way too much for certain things,” he said in a December 2010 interview with El Paso Inc., a business newspaper. “. . . The idea of the ‘sweet deal’ that bordered on cronyism, we are just not going to put up with it anymore.” Within a few months, however, several members of Pittard’s staff grew concerned about his handling of a short-term contract to help manage the giant energy-efficiency project, according to a report by the Army’s inspector general.  Several Army officers, including Pittard’s staff lawyer, told investigators that the general went to unusual lengths to push a no-bid contract for a joint venture run by two of his former classmates from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.  Staffers said Pittard overrode their objections about the contract, including the lack of competitive bids. They said he met in private with his classmates before they were awarded the deal and intervened afterward to make sure they were paid. “This is not good and downright illegal. These guys know it, and they continue to push the envelope because of their personal relationship with MG Pittard,” one unnamed colonel on the general’s staff wrote in a 2012 e-mail.  Another colonel responded: “All I can do is talk to him about it. I’ve advised him in the past concerning risks associated with meetings like this.” Pittard told the inspector general he just wanted the energy project to move swiftly and didn’t care who got the contract. He said he wasn’t personally close with his two former classmates and didn’t even recall attending West Point with one of them — Thomas Gregory Harris — until his fellow alumnus introduced himself. Harris, a retired Army colonel, was convicted by a federal jury and sentenced to two years in prison. In a deposition taken for Harris’s trial, Pittard testified that he had been interviewed by the FBI in May 2013 and that the agents gave no indication that he was suspected of wrongdoing.  A Justice Department spokesman in El Paso said that the criminal investigation was closed and that Harris was the only defendant. An attorney for Harris called the investigation an overreaction and blasted the Army for reprimanding Pittard.  “He didn’t do anything wrong in this case. Nobody did anything wrong,” said Joel Androphy, a Houston lawyer. “Pittard has done very good stuff for our country, and he doesn’t deserve to be sanctioned by the United States.” Former congressman Pete Gallego (D), whose district covered much of West Texas, contacted The Post on behalf of Pittard to say that the general was “getting a raw deal.” “It’s really disheartening to watch, because to me Pittard is one of the best things to ever happen to Fort Bliss,” Gallego added. In an official reprimand, the Army leadership admonished Pittard for showing “a gross lack of good judgment.” “Senior leaders must be acutely aware of the pitfalls of associating with government contractors,” wrote Gen. Daniel B. Allyn, the Army’s vice chief of staff.          world national-security  Get 2016 Olympics updates by email Our best news and analysis from Rio, delivered to your inbox. post_newsletter333 magnet-olympics2016 false after3th false          Please provide a valid email address.

Career[edit]




Pittard addressing soldiers of the First Armored Division, in a formation before a Post Run at Fort Bliss, on May 14, 2013.


Pittard received his commission as an Armor officer in 1981. His first operational assignment was with the 1st Infantry Division (Mechanized) at Fort Riley, Kansas in 1982.[8] He served as a Tank Platoon Leader and Tank Company Executive Officer in 2-63 Armor; then as a Scout Platoon Leader and Battalion S1 in 3-37 Armor. In 1984, he served as an Admissions Officer at West Point; and in 1985 was assigned to Bad Kissingen, Germany, as the Squadron S4 for 2nd Squadron, 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment (ACR).
In October 1986, Pittard commanded E Troop, 2nd Squadron, 11th ACR until May 1988. He next commanded Fox Company, 40th Armor (Berlin Brigade) from June 1988 until March 1990. In April 1990, he commanded D Company, 1-37 Armor at Vilseck, Germany, and led his unit in combat in Iraq during Operation Desert Storm. Upon returning to Germany, he served as an Assistant S3 in 3rd Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division. He next served at Fort Hood, Texas as the Assistant G3, Chief of Plans and Exercises for 2nd Armored Division; the S3 for 1-67 Armor; and then as the S3, 2nd Brigade, 4th Infantry Division.
Pittard served as a Military Aide to President Bill Clinton from November 1996 until January 1999. In June 1999, he assumed command of 1-32 Armor/1-14 Cavalry at Fort Lewis, Washington as a part of the Army's first Stryker Brigade until June 2001. Pittard took command of 3rd Brigade, 1st Infantry Division in July 2002 and led the unit on deployments to Kosovo (2002–2003) and to Iraq (2004–2005). In July 2005, Pittard was assigned as the Assistant Division Commander for Maneuver, 24th Infantry Division later to transition to the 1st Infantry Division. In July 2006, he deployed to Operation Iraqi Freedom where he assumed command of the Iraq Assistance Group, while still serving as the Assistant Division Commander for Maneuver of the 1st Infantry Division. He was the commander of Iraq Assistance Group in 2006 through June 30, 2007, and transferred command to Brigadier General James C. Yarbrough. On August 8, 2007, he assumed command of Fort Irwin, CA.[6] On December 18, 2008, Pittard announced his plans to leave Fort Irwin sometime in March 2009.[9] He became the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Training at TRADOC in March 2009.
On July 9, 2010, General Pittard assumed command of Fort Bliss, Texas.
On May 24, 2013, Maj. General Pittard relinquished command to Maj. General Sean MacFarland. Pittard was then the Deputy Commanding General of Operations (DCG-O) for ARCENT til 2015.[1]
The 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard) conducted Pittard's General Officer Retirement Ceremony on September 30, 2015, at Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall, Military District of Washington.[10]
Suicide prevention[edit]
During the period Pittard commanded the post, Fort Bliss earned the LivingWorks Community of Excellence Award for effective suicide prevention and intervention programs in July 2012.[11][12][13] According to Department of Defense statistics, Fort Bliss had the Army's lowest suicide rate in 2012 while Pittard was commanding general.[14][15][7]
Pittard was criticized for his personal blog statement that he was "personally fed up with soldiers who are choosing to take their own lives so that others can clean up their mess."[16] This statement, while seen as self-centered and callous, had been triggered by a soldier who had committed suicide in the presence of his two daughters.[17]
Several of the suicide prevention reforms instituted by Pittard at Fort Bliss have propagated to other Army installations.[7][18]
Awards and decorations[edit]
The Distinguished Service Medal,[10] the Defense Superior Service Medal, the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star (2nd Award), the Bronze Star with valor device, the Meritorious Service Medal (6th Award), the Army Commendation Medal, the Army Achievement Medal (3rd Award), the Ranger Tab, the Parachutist Badge, the Air Assault Badge and the General Douglas MacArthur Leadership Award. He also wears the Order of St George, the Order of St Barbara, and the Order of the de Fleury Medal.
Criticism[edit]
Major General Pittard was formally reprimanded in February 2015 for steering a defense contract to a firm run by two of his former West Point classmates, after a three-year investigation by the U.S. Army Inspector General, according to documents obtained by The Washington Post, under the Freedom of Information Act. An Army review board considered whether to demote him before his retirement. Major General Pittard, long considered a rising star in the Army, was recalled to the United States, in April 2015, from his headquarters in Kuwait.[19]
Pittard maintains that he did not do "anything legally, morally, or ethically wrong." He told the El Paso Times that the charges against him were "unsubstantiated" during the investigation, but that the process had no mechanism for him to rebut the charges which were based on an anonymous tip.[1][20]
Post-Army career[edit]
Pittard serves as a vice-president of a manufacturing company. A tri-athlete, he is writing a memoir about one of his Iraq tours.[7]

Suicide prevention[edit]
During the period Pittard commanded the post, Fort Bliss earned the LivingWorks Community of Excellence Award for effective suicide prevention and intervention programs in July 2012.[11][12][13] According to Department of Defense statistics, Fort Bliss had the Army's lowest suicide rate in 2012 while Pittard was commanding general.[14][15][7]
Pittard was criticized for his personal blog statement that he was "personally fed up with soldiers who are choosing to take their own lives so that others can clean up their mess."[16] This statement, while seen as self-centered and callous, had been triggered by a soldier who had committed suicide in the presence of his two daughters.[17]
Several of the suicide prevention reforms instituted by Pittard at Fort Bliss have propagated to other Army installations.[7][18]
Awards and decorations[edit]
The Distinguished Service Medal,[10] the Defense Superior Service Medal, the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star (2nd Award), the Bronze Star with valor device, the Meritorious Service Medal (6th Award), the Army Commendation Medal, the Army Achievement Medal (3rd Award), the Ranger Tab, the Parachutist Badge, the Air Assault Badge and the General Douglas MacArthur Leadership Award. He also wears the Order of St George, the Order of St Barbara, and the Order of the de Fleury Medal.
Criticism[edit]
Major General Pittard was formally reprimanded in February 2015 for steering a defense contract to a firm run by two of his former West Point classmates, after a three-year investigation by the U.S. Army Inspector General, according to documents obtained by The Washington Post, under the Freedom of Information Act. An Army review board considered whether to demote him before his retirement. Major General Pittard, long considered a rising star in the Army, was recalled to the United States, in April 2015, from his headquarters in Kuwait.[19]
Pittard maintains that he did not do "anything legally, morally, or ethically wrong." He told the El Paso Times that the charges against him were "unsubstantiated" during the investigation, but that the process had no mechanism for him to rebut the charges which were based on an anonymous tip.[1][20]
Post-Army career[edit]
Pittard serves as a vice-president of a manufacturing company. A tri-athlete, he is writing a memoir about one of his Iraq tours.[7]

Army Reprimanded a Top General Involved in ISIS Fight

WASHINGTON —  The Army has reprimanded a once highly regarded general involved in the war against the Islamic State because he guided a defense contract to a company run by his former classmates at West Point, a move that effectively ends his military career, military officials said Monday.Maj. Gen. Dana J. H. Pittard, the Army’s former deputy commander for operations in the Middle East, was formally reprimanded in February after an investigation, “which called into question his suitability for continued services and resulted in his request for retirement,” Cynthia Smith, an Army spokeswoman, said in an email.An Army review board is considering whether he will be stripped of his rank as a two-star general before he is allowed to retire, Ms. Smith said.The reprimand is a huge dent in the career of a general once believed to represent the future of the Army. A former military assistant to President Bill Clinton, General Pittard had years of combat experience in Iraq and was long viewed as someone who could rise to the level of Army chief of staff.

From July 2013 to April 2015, General Pittard was the deputy commanding general for Army Central, based in the Middle East. He returned to the United States in April after the reprimand, which was first reported by The Washington Post.

The Post, citing documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, said the investigation into General Pittard began in 2011 after an anonymous whistle-blower alleged that he had abused his authority by awarding lucrative renewable-energy contracts to his friends while serving as the commander of Fort Bliss in Texas.

One of General Pittard’s former West Point classmates was convicted on wire-fraud charges in September, and while General Pittard was not accused of financial gain, he was reprimanded for his “excessive involvement” in awarding the $492,000 contract.Ms. Smith, the Army spokeswoman, said General Pittard had been removed from his position in the Middle East as part of a normal rotation and not because of the misconduct.General Pittard is now serving as special assistant to the commanding general at the United States Army Training and Doctrine Command, where he will remain until the secretary of the Army decides on his retirement request and whether to strip him of his rank.

Pittard was criticized for his personal blog statement that he was "personally fed up with soldiers who are choosing to take their own lives so that others can clean up their mess."[16] This statement, while seen as self-centered and callous, had been triggered by a soldier who had committed suicide in the presence of his two daughters.[17]
Several of the suicide prevention reforms instituted by Pittard at Fort Bliss have propagated to other Army installations.[7][18]
Awards and decorations[edit]
The Distinguished Service Medal,[10] the Defense Superior Service Medal, the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star (2nd Award), the Bronze Star with valor device, the Meritorious Service Medal (6th Award), the Army Commendation Medal, the Army Achievement Medal (3rd Award), the Ranger Tab, the Parachutist Badge, the Air Assault Badge and the General Douglas MacArthur Leadership Award. He also wears the Order of St George, the Order of St Barbara, and the Order of the de Fleury Medal.
Criticism[edit]
Major General Pittard was formally reprimanded in February 2015 for steering a defense contract to a firm run by two of his former West Point classmates, after a three-year investigation by the U.S. Army Inspector General, according to documents obtained by The Washington Post, under the Freedom of Information Act. An Army review board considered whether to demote him before his retirement. Major General Pittard, long considered a rising star in the Army, was recalled to the United States, in April 2015, from his headquarters in Kuwait.[19]
Pittard maintains that he did not do "anything legally, morally, or ethically wrong." He told the El Paso Times that the charges against him were "unsubstantiated" during the investigation, but that the process had no mechanism for him to rebut the charges which were based on an anonymous tip.[1][20]
Post-Army career[edit]
Pittard serves as a vice-president of a manufacturing company. A tri-athlete, he is writing a memoir about one of his Iraq tours.[7]

Pittard was criticized for his personal blog statement that he was "personally fed up with soldiers who are choosing to take their own lives so that others can clean up their mess."[16] This statement, while seen as self-centered and callous, had been triggered by a soldier who had committed suicide in the presence of his two daughters.[17]

Criticism[edit]
Major General Pittard was formally reprimanded in February 2015 for steering a defense contract to a firm run by two of his former West Point classmates, after a three-year investigation by the U.S. Army Inspector General, according to documents obtained by The Washington Post, under the Freedom of Information Act. An Army review board considered whether to demote him before his retirement. Major General Pittard, long considered a rising star in the Army, was recalled to the United States, in April 2015, from his headquarters in Kuwait.[19]
Pittard maintains that he did not do "anything legally, morally, or ethically wrong." He told the El Paso Times that the charges against him were "unsubstantiated" during the investigation, but that the process had no mechanism for him to rebut the charges which were based on an anonymous tip.[1][20]
Post-Army career[edit]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

 The two-star general tapped to lead the advise-and-assist mission in Iraq is a disciplined leader who earned praise for running a tight ship at the Army's second-largest installation. 
 But decades before Maj. Gen. Dana J.H. Pittard assumed command of the 1st Armored Division out of Fort Bliss in his hometown of El Paso, Texas, he was just a 10-year-old boy captivated by a magazine article about Dwight D. Eisenhower. 
 Sign up for breaking news alerts from NBC News 
 Pittard has recalled leafing through the pages of National Geographic in 1969 and stumbling on an article about Eisenhower, the legendary Army general and 34th president. 
 "I wasn't a studious National Geographic type person," Pittard told the El Paso Times in May 2013. "The reason I was looking at National Geographic, I was looking for scantily clad natives. I was a kid." 
 And yet a photo of Eisenhower struck a nerve in young Pittard and helped inspire him to join the military.

 "I wanted to be like that; I guess it was delusions of grandeur," Pittard told the newspaper. 
 Pittard went on to serve a distinguished career in the Army for more than three decades. 
 In 2012, Pittard got into hot water for comments about soldier suicides that many critics deemed insensitive. 
 After attending the memorial service for a soldier who committed suicide in front of his twin 6-year-old daughters, Pittard wrote on his official blog that he was "fed up with soldiers who are choosing to take their own lives so that others can clean up their mess." 
 He soon retracted his comments, according to the Army Times, and was later honored for suicide prevention and intervention initiatives at Fort Bliss, which had the Army's lowest suicide rate in 2012, according to Department of Defense data. 
 After relinquishing control of Fort Bliss in 2013, he became the deputy commander for the Third U.S. Army in Kuwait, where his duties included overseeing the American military operation in Jordan. 
 He will now serve in Iraq with the title of joint forces land component commander, where he is tasked with overseeing the 300 U.S. troops dispatched to offer training and intelligence support to the Iraqi military, which has failed to halt the militants' advance toward Baghdad. 
 The troops are elite members drawn from U.S. Special Operations forces. They will be experts on operations, intelligence and aviation, and will work directly with the Iraqi security forces leadership. 
 The U.S. advisers will assess the security situation on the ground, including the strength of the Iraqi military and of the Sunni insurgents, known as ISIS. They will be continually feeding that intelligence to U.S. Central Command and use it to determine how many additional Special Forces troops to send and where to deploy them.

The 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard) conducted Pittard's General Officer Retirement Ceremony on September 30, 2015, at Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall, Military District of Washington.[10]
Suicide prevention[edit]
During the period Pittard commanded the post, Fort Bliss earned the LivingWorks Community of Excellence Award for effective suicide prevention and intervention programs in July 2012.[11][12][13] According to Department of Defense statistics, Fort Bliss had the Army's lowest suicide rate in 2012 while Pittard was commanding general.[14][15][7]
Pittard was criticized for his personal blog statement that he was "personally fed up with soldiers who are choosing to take their own lives so that others can clean up their mess."[16] This statement, while seen as self-centered and callous, had been triggered by a soldier who had committed suicide in the presence of his two daughters.[17]
Several of the suicide prevention reforms instituted by Pittard at Fort Bliss have propagated to other Army installations.[7][18]
Awards and decorations[edit]
The Distinguished Service Medal,[10] the Defense Superior Service Medal, the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star (2nd Award), the Bronze Star with valor device, the Meritorious Service Medal (6th Award), the Army Commendation Medal, the Army Achievement Medal (3rd Award), the Ranger Tab, the Parachutist Badge, the Air Assault Badge and the General Douglas MacArthur Leadership Award. He also wears the Order of St George, the Order of St Barbara, and the Order of the de Fleury Medal.
Criticism[edit]
Major General Pittard was formally reprimanded in February 2015 for steering a defense contract to a firm run by two of his former West Point classmates, after a three-year investigation by the U.S. Army Inspector General, according to documents obtained by The Washington Post, under the Freedom of Information Act. An Army review board considered whether to demote him before his retirement. Major General Pittard, long considered a rising star in the Army, was recalled to the United States, in April 2015, from his headquarters in Kuwait.[19]
Pittard maintains that he did not do "anything legally, morally, or ethically wrong." He told the El Paso Times that the charges against him were "unsubstantiated" during the investigation, but that the process had no mechanism for him to rebut the charges which were based on an anonymous tip.[1][20]
Post-Army career[edit]
Pittard serves as a vice-president of a manufacturing company. A tri-athlete, he is writing a memoir about one of his Iraq tours.[7]

Early life and education[edit]
Pittard was born in Japan while his father was stationed there, as a soldier in the US Army.[7] A graduate of Eastwood High School, El Paso, Texas, Pittard had previously lived at Fort Bliss as a boy, a station he was later to command. Pittard graduated from the United States Military Academy, Armor Officer Basic Course, Infantry Officer Advance Course, and the Command and General Staff College (CGSC). He holds a master's degree in Military Arts and Science from the United States Army School of Advanced Military Studies (SAMS) at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. He also has completed a National Security Fellowship at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.
Career[edit]




Pittard addressing soldiers of the First Armored Division, in a formation before a Post Run at Fort Bliss, on May 14, 2013.


Pittard received his commission as an Armor officer in 1981. His first operational assignment was with the 1st Infantry Division (Mechanized) at Fort Riley, Kansas in 1982.[8] He served as a Tank Platoon Leader and Tank Company Executive Officer in 2-63 Armor; then as a Scout Platoon Leader and Battalion S1 in 3-37 Armor. In 1984, he served as an Admissions Officer at West Point; and in 1985 was assigned to Bad Kissingen, Germany, as the Squadron S4 for 2nd Squadron, 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment (ACR).
In October 1986, Pittard commanded E Troop, 2nd Squadron, 11th ACR until May 1988. He next commanded Fox Company, 40th Armor (Berlin Brigade) from June 1988 until March 1990. In April 1990, he commanded D Company, 1-37 Armor at Vilseck, Germany, and led his unit in combat in Iraq during Operation Desert Storm. Upon returning to Germany, he served as an Assistant S3 in 3rd Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division. He next served at Fort Hood, Texas as the Assistant G3, Chief of Plans and Exercises for 2nd Armored Division; the S3 for 1-67 Armor; and then as the S3, 2nd Brigade, 4th Infantry Division.
Pittard served as a Military Aide to President Bill Clinton from November 1996 until January 1999. In June 1999, he assumed command of 1-32 Armor/1-14 Cavalry at Fort Lewis, Washington as a part of the Army's first Stryker Brigade until June 2001. Pittard took command of 3rd Brigade, 1st Infantry Division in July 2002 and led the unit on deployments to Kosovo (2002–2003) and to Iraq (2004–2005). In July 2005, Pittard was assigned as the Assistant Division Commander for Maneuver, 24th Infantry Division later to transition to the 1st Infantry Division. In July 2006, he deployed to Operation Iraqi Freedom where he assumed command of the Iraq Assistance Group, while still serving as the Assistant Division Commander for Maneuver of the 1st Infantry Division. He was the commander of Iraq Assistance Group in 2006 through June 30, 2007, and transferred command to Brigadier General James C. Yarbrough. On August 8, 2007, he assumed command of Fort Irwin, CA.[6] On December 18, 2008, Pittard announced his plans to leave Fort Irwin sometime in March 2009.[9] He became the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Training at TRADOC in March 2009.
On July 9, 2010, General Pittard assumed command of Fort Bliss, Texas.
On May 24, 2013, Maj. General Pittard relinquished command to Maj. General Sean MacFarland. Pittard was then the Deputy Commanding General of Operations (DCG-O) for ARCENT til 2015.[1]
The 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard) conducted Pittard's General Officer Retirement Ceremony on September 30, 2015, at Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall, Military District of Washington.[10]
Suicide prevention[edit]
During the period Pittard commanded the post, Fort Bliss earned the LivingWorks Community of Excellence Award for effective suicide prevention and intervention programs in July 2012.[11][12][13] According to Department of Defense statistics, Fort Bliss had the Army's lowest suicide rate in 2012 while Pittard was commanding general.[14][15][7]
Pittard was criticized for his personal blog statement that he was "personally fed up with soldiers who are choosing to take their own lives so that others can clean up their mess."[16] This statement, while seen as self-centered and callous, had been triggered by a soldier who had committed suicide in the presence of his two daughters.[17]
Several of the suicide prevention reforms instituted by Pittard at Fort Bliss have propagated to other Army installations.[7][18]
Awards and decorations[edit]
The Distinguished Service Medal,[10] the Defense Superior Service Medal, the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star (2nd Award), the Bronze Star with valor device, the Meritorious Service Medal (6th Award), the Army Commendation Medal, the Army Achievement Medal (3rd Award), the Ranger Tab, the Parachutist Badge, the Air Assault Badge and the General Douglas MacArthur Leadership Award. He also wears the Order of St George, the Order of St Barbara, and the Order of the de Fleury Medal.
Criticism[edit]
Major General Pittard was formally reprimanded in February 2015 for steering a defense contract to a firm run by two of his former West Point classmates, after a three-year investigation by the U.S. Army Inspector General, according to documents obtained by The Washington Post, under the Freedom of Information Act. An Army review board considered whether to demote him before his retirement. Major General Pittard, long considered a rising star in the Army, was recalled to the United States, in April 2015, from his headquarters in Kuwait.[19]
Pittard maintains that he did not do "anything legally, morally, or ethically wrong." He told the El Paso Times that the charges against him were "unsubstantiated" during the investigation, but that the process had no mechanism for him to rebut the charges which were based on an anonymous tip.[1][20]
Post-Army career[edit]
Pittard serves as a vice-president of a manufacturing company. A tri-athlete, he is writing a memoir about one of his Iraq tours.[7]
