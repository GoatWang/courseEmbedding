Sprague Resources LP Announces Strategic Acquisition Of Two Refined Product Terminals On Long Island






GlobeNewswire



Mar 16, 2017 6:00 AM EDT













 


















































 PORTSMOUTH, N.H., March 16, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sprague Resources LP ("Sprague") (NYSE:SRLP) announced today that its operating subsidiary, Sprague Operating Resources LLC, has signed a definitive agreement to purchase the Lawrence and Inwood, NY refined product terminal assets of Carbo Industries, Inc. and Carbo Realty, L.L.C. ("Carbo").  Sprague will pay total consideration of approximately $70 million, plus payments for inventory and other customary items.  The consideration is comprised of approximately $30 million of SRLP units to be issued at closing, $10 million in cash paid at closing and the balance in cash, paid ratably over ten years. The Carbo terminals are located in Inwood and Lawrence, NY, with a combined gasoline, ethanol and distillate storage capacity of 157,000 barrels.  The terminals are supplied primarily by pipeline, and also have the ability to accept product deliveries by barge and truck.  Conveniently located next to the region's major transportation networks, Carbo provides the storage, blending and additive injection capabilities to serve major branded gasoline marketers as well as unbranded gasoline/distillate marketers focused on the New York City and Long Island markets, in addition to functioning as a key pillar of Sprague's extensive service to New York's governmental/municipal transportation fuel users and heating oil retailers.  The Carbo transaction is expected to be accretive to distributable cash flow and generate approximately $8 to $10 million of adjusted EBITDA annually.  "I am excited to announce our fourth acquisition of 2017," said David Glendon, President and CEO of Sprague.  "The Carbo facilities have long been an integral component of our distribution network and we're thrilled to convert our position from tenant to owner in this critical location, further solidifying our status as one of New York's premier refined products terminal operators and marketers.  I'm also pleased that Cliff Hochhauser, who has been central to Carbo's success, will be joining Sprague and continuing to lead operations at these facilities."

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Sprague Resources LP Announces Strategic Acquisition of Two Refined Product Terminals on Long Island
Acquisition will expand gasoline handling and marketing capabilities and further diversify cash flows



















March 16, 2017 06:00 ET

 | Source: Sprague Resources LP






PORTSMOUTH, N.H., March  16, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sprague Resources LP (“Sprague”) (NYSE:SRLP) announced today that its operating subsidiary, Sprague Operating Resources LLC, has signed a definitive agreement to purchase the Lawrence and Inwood, NY refined product terminal assets of Carbo Industries, Inc. and Carbo Realty, L.L.C. (“Carbo”).  Sprague will pay total consideration of approximately $70 million, plus payments for inventory and other customary items.  The consideration is comprised of approximately $30 million of SRLP units to be issued at closing, $10 million in cash paid at closing and the balance in cash, paid ratably over ten years. The Carbo terminals are located in Inwood and Lawrence, NY, with a combined gasoline, ethanol and distillate storage capacity of 157,000 barrels.  The terminals are supplied primarily by pipeline, and also have the ability to accept product deliveries by barge and truck.  Conveniently located next to the region’s major transportation networks, Carbo provides the storage, blending and additive injection capabilities to serve major branded gasoline marketers as well as unbranded gasoline/distillate marketers focused on the New York City and Long Island markets, in addition to functioning as a key pillar of Sprague’s extensive service to New York’s governmental/municipal transportation fuel users and heating oil retailers.  The Carbo transaction is expected to be accretive to distributable cash flow and generate approximately $8 to $10 million of adjusted EBITDA annually.  “I am excited to announce our fourth acquisition of 2017,” said David Glendon, President and CEO of Sprague.  “The Carbo facilities have long been an integral component of our distribution network and we’re thrilled to convert our position from tenant to owner in this critical location, further solidifying our status as one of New York’s premier refined products terminal operators and marketers.  I’m also pleased that Cliff Hochhauser, who has been central to Carbo’s success, will be joining Sprague and continuing to lead operations at these facilities.”      “While the Carbo terminals’ total combined storage capacity will rank among the smallest in our network, their expected combined annual throughput will be higher than any single Sprague-owned facility.  We look forward to this acquisition nearly tripling our gasoline throughput business, expanding the portfolio of branded gasoline suppliers we serve, and diversifying Sprague’s seasonal cash flows to mitigate the impact of weather on our operating results,” said Mr. Glendon. Sprague intends to fund the transaction with borrowings from its senior secured credit facility; closing is expected to occur in the second quarter. “As we work to close this acquisition and welcome Carbo employees, Sprague’s financial position remains very strong.  Coverage is more than sufficient to meet our stated cash distribution growth goals, our credit facility has ample liquidity available to fund meaningful near term acquisition growth, and we expect Sprague’s permanent leverage ratio will remain within our long term target range between 2.5 and 3.5 times,” concluded David Glendon. Sprague has updated its investor relations website with slides containing additional information regarding the pending acquisition.  The presentation can be accessed from Sprague’s website at http://www.spragueenergy.com/investor-relations. About Sprague Resources LPSprague Resources LP is engaged in the purchase, storage, distribution and sale of refined petroleum products and natural gas. The company also provides storage and handling services for a broad range of materials.  More information concerning Sprague can be found at www.spragueenergy.com. Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release may include forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties and other factors that are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond management’s control. Although Sprague believes that the assumptions underlying these statements are reasonable, investors are cautioned that such forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and involve risks that may affect our business prospects and performance causing actual results to differ from those discussed in the foregoing release. A number of important factors could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements, including the parties’ ability to consummate the transaction; the conditions to the completion of the transaction, including the receipt of certain consents required in connection with the transaction which may not be obtained on the terms expected or on the anticipated schedule; the parties’ ability to meet expectations regarding the timing, completion and accounting and tax treatments of the transaction; the possibility that the parties may be unable to achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies within the expected time-frames or at all or be unable to successfully integrate Carbo's operations into those of Sprague; the possibility that the integration of Carbo into Sprague may be more difficult, time consuming or costly than expected; resulting increases in operating costs, customer loss and business disruption (including, without limitation, difficulties in maintaining relationships with employees, customers or suppliers); and, the ability of Sprague Resources GP LLC to retain certain key employees of Carbo.  Other applicable risks and uncertainties related to our business have been described more fully in Sprague Resources LP’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on March 10, 2017, and in subsequent Form 10-Q and Form 8-K filings, and other documents filed with the SEC.  Sprague undertakes no obligation and does not intend to update any forward-looking statements to reflect new information or future events.  You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this press release. Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresAdjusted EBITDA and permanent leverage ratio are measures not defined by United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).  We define adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (which Sprague refers to as "EBITDA") adjusted for unrealized hedging gains and losses, in each case with respect to refined products and natural gas inventory, prepaid forward contracts and natural gas transportation contracts. Sprague's permanent leverage ratio is calculated by dividing the aggregate of its acquisition facility borrowings, capital lease obligations, debentures and other debt by the consolidated trailing twelve-month adjusted EBITDA, as defined by the Credit Agreement.  Sprague’s management uses certain non-GAAP financial measurements to evaluate its results of operations, including adjusted EBITDA and our permanent leverage ratio. Adjusted EBITDA is one of the supplemental financial measures used by management to describe its operations and economic performance to investors, trade suppliers, research analysts and commercial banks to assess economic results of its operations; the market value of its inventory and natural gas transportation contracts for financial reporting to lenders, as well as for borrowing base purposes; and, repeatable operating performance that is not distorted by non-recurring items or market volatility.  Management believes the permanent leverage ratio is helpful to investors in assessing the Partnership's overall debt profile and is used by management to evaluate its ability to finance capital expenditures and acquisitions. Sprague believes that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that are used by its management and that these measures are useful to investors because they aid in comparing its operating performance with that of other companies with similar operations. Sprague's calculations of non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other businesses because they may be defined differently by other companies. You can find additional disclosures on our use of these non-GAAP measures, as well as reconciliations between GAAP and these non-GAAP measures, in Sprague's "Non-GAAP Measures Quarterly Supplement" located in the Investor Relations section of Sprague’s website at www.spragueenergy.com.Investor Contact:

        	7.28.2017
        


Recap: Gains in oil prices were extended for the third straight session, with oil futures trading close to a two-month high. Traders are beginning to broaden their focus, not only to encompass the U.S. stockpile situation and OPEC output cuts, but geopolitical risk as well. Coming into view are strikes in Venezuela  that are now into their second day, sanctions against Iran, and heightened tensions with North Korea. On the other side, is the U.S. rig count, which, if oil prices rise, so will the rig count.
September WTI settled up 29 cents, or 0.6% at $49.04 a barrel, while September Brent settled at $51.49, up 52 cents, or 1.02%.
RBOB was clearly the largest percentage gainer on the day, gaining 1.7%, finishing at their highest level since May 24. August RBOB rose 2.7 cents, or 1.7%, to $1.645 a gallon, while August heating oil added under a penny to $1.603 a gallon.
Fundamental News:  Kuwait joined the UAE in promising to produce less oil after Saudi Arabia called on fellow OPEC producers to cut more supply to help cut the global oversupply.  Kuwait Petroleum Corp has agreed with customers in the US to reduce contractual sales volumes of oil for 2017.  This came a day after UAE Minister of Energy, Suhail Al Mazrouei said Abu Dhabi National Oil Co would cut shipments of Murban, Das and Upper Zakum crudes by 10% starting in September.
Royal Dutch Shell Chief Executive, Ben van Beurden, said the company is preparing for “lower forever” oil prices.  He said that with oil prices around $50/barrel and forecasts of only a modest recovery by the end of the decade, Shell was not planning to stop its cost cutting drive.   He stated that the company was getting fit for oil prices of $40/barrel.  Shell oil and gas production in the second quarter fell to 3.495 million bpd of oil equivalent from 3.752 million bpd of oil equivalent in the first quarter.  Separately, he said the world’s oil consumption could peak as early as the end of the net decade as electric vehicles become more popular.  On Wednesday, Britain announced plans to ban diesel and gasoline vehicles by 2040, following a similar move by France.  He said under the company’s most aggressive scenario of battery-powered vehicles replacing traditional internal combustion engines, consumption of oil will peak in the early 2030s.  He added that with a high use of biofuels, demand could peak by the late 2020s.  However, he stated that oil will still be needed for decades to come as it is likely to remain the main fuel for planes, ships and heavy trucks.   
Goldman Sachs Equity Research said recent inventory draws have been favorable and suggest the market is beginning to rebalance.  It said $45-$50/barrel WTI price signal needed to effectively constrain shale and restrain OPEC production. 
US shale producers have started to cut their 2017 capital spending budgets.  Anadarko Petroleum Corp, ConocoPhillips, Whiting Petroleum Corp and Hess Corp cut a combined $750 million from their capex plans. 
Gasoline stocks held in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp terminal in the week ending July 27th increased by 6.93% on the week but fell by 32.71% on the year to 864,000 tons, while gasoil stocks fell by 0.49% on the week and by 12.95% on the year to 2.817 million tons.


Early Market Call - as of 9:00 AM EDT
WTI - Sep $ 49.24, up 20 cents
RBOB - Aug $1.6582, up 1.34 cents
HO - Aug $1.6149, up 1.09 cents

On Thursday, July 27th – settlement day for the August Contract – the front-month NYMEX Natural Gas Futures Contracts opened at $2.919, slightly below Wednesday’s closing price of $2.924.  Trading evenly as markets opened, a modest rise near 10:00AM soon surged higher as prices reacted to news of a bullish storage injection.  Recording the intraday high of $2.998 at 10:30AM, choppy trading ensued into the early afternoon as the contract toed the $2.960 mark.  August settled at $2.969 to finish higher on Thursday, while the more actively traded September contract closed five cents higher at $2.967.
The EIA Natural Gas Storage Report published on Thursday showed a 17 BCF injection to storage for the week ended July 21st – below the market estimate of 22 BCF.  Total working gas in storage was reported as 2,990 BCF; 9.2% below this time last year and 3.9% above the five-year average.
This morning in Globex, WTI Crude was up five cents; Natural Gas was up slightly; Heating Oil was up one cent; and, Gasoline was up one cent.   Additionally, cash prices were higher in New York and New England.

 Key Facts History Leadership Citizenship Sustainability Safety and the Environment Careers 


Key Facts  Founded in 1870 Corporate headquarters: Portsmouth, New Hampshire
     Additional offices in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Quebec, Canada.   Full-time employees: 600 Owns and/or controls 19 refined products and materials handling terminals
     Extensive network of throughputs or exchanges at additional third-party facilities   





History Sprague's predecessor was founded in 1870 by Charles H. Sprague, who initially focused the company on meeting the explosive demand for coal, which was being fueled by the industrial age. During World War I, the privately held company became the major supplier of coal to America's European allies. To facilitate the transportation of millions of tons of coal across the Atlantic, the Sprague Steamship Company was founded. By World War II, the company was operating eleven terminals and a fleet of 27 vessels transporting coal and other products throughout the world. Its role as a worldwide coal supplier was solidified in 1942, when the US Government selected Sprague to manage the wartime coal shipment program.   
Following the war, Sprague enjoyed an era of rapid growth as residual fuel oil became a major fuel source and component of the energy business. Sprague seized this growth opportunity by entering the oil business and building its first industrial oil terminal adjacent to its Portsmouth coal facility. The Sprague family entered the industrial oil business with a major commitment; building terminals, acquiring tankers, contracting with suppliers, handling the product, and entering new markets. In 1959, the company expanded its oil marketing activities by entering the distillate oil market.
 By the late 1960s, the company separated into two operations: coal and oil. This division was quickly followed by the sale of its entire coal operation to Westmoreland Coal Company. Having consolidated its focus on the oil business, the Sprague family sold its interest in the company to Royal Dutch Shell's Asiatic Petroleum subsidiary in 1970. Two years later, Shell sold Sprague to Axel Johnson Inc., a member of the Axel Johnson Group of Stockholm, Sweden. That move proved fortuitous because it provided the resources for Sprague to prosper during the energy crises of the 1970s. Spurred by recent oil supply crises, the company came full circle in 1982 when Sprague joined forces once again with Westmoreland Coal Company. Through an exclusive marketing arrangement with Westmoreland, coal again became a major energy component of Sprague's total energy business, and reinforced its position as a major industrial fuel supplier.  Supported by a growing network of terminals, Sprague launched a full-time materials handling marketing effort in 1986. The following year marked a shift in the company's business from being primarily an industrial fuel distributor to focus on commercial and wholesale fuels as well. To aggressively support this new, broader direction, the company made a number of significant acquisitions.   The 1990s saw further expansion into the natural gas marketplace, gasoline wholesaling and terminal business, as well as entry into the aviation fuel market. In 1999, Sprague moved its corporate offices to a state-of-the-art facility located at Two International Drive, Suite 200, Pease International Tradeport in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Sprague began 2001 by acquiring RAD Energy, a leading fuel distributor servicing metro New York and New Jersey. RAD not only expanded Sprague’s footprint, but it also brought to Sprague several innovative, field-tested fuel management programs that could be utilized across the Sprague footprint. In 2005, Sprague expanded its footprint in Maine with the acquisition of Merrill Marine Terminal Services, Inc. in Portland, Maine. This provided Sprague with another sizeable operation in New England - adding approximately 600,000 tons of annual materials handling capacity.   Sprague also continues to expand its Materials Handling business. Built initially around coal handling in the turn of the century, Sprague is now focused on supporting customers’ evolving requirements, such as offloading large wind turbine blades and components. 
Traditionally, Sprague's Natural Gas business has served large commercial and industrial market segments. The acquisition of Houston Energy Services (HESCO) in 2006 expanded Sprague's natural gas offerings geographically and positioned the company to grow its small commercial market segment.  
In 2007, Sprague acquired 50% of Kildair Service Ltd, a Canadian-based terminal and export cargo business. In 2012, Sprague successfully completed the acquisition of the remaining 50% and is actively expanding the Materials Handling aspects of the Montreal-located facility.

We believe that superior safety performance is achieved when employees maintain a high level of motivation and willingness to succeed and have the ability and opportunity to effect safe practices. To reinforce the importance of safety at Sprague, employees participate in safety meetings and training to refresh and renew each individual’s expertise. Sprague employs a number of best practices related to safety such as tool box meetings, job safety analyses and incident reviews to share lessons learned throughout the system and review our actions in a thoughtful manner. An injury-free work place is no accident, and we work to achieve that goal through providing the right tools and training each and every day.
