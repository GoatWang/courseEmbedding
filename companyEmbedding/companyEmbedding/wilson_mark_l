Wilson, Mark L
Owner


















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Minnesota:













Does Wilson, Mark L carry a valid contracting license?



Licenses are required for all residential building contractors and residential remodelers who contract with a homeowner to construct or improve dwellings by offering more than one special skill. Owners working on their own property must also be licensed if they build or remodel for the sole purpose of speculation or resale.











How important is contractor licensing in Minnesota?



Contractors acting as sole proprietors, or qualifying persons for a construction related business entity, must pass a two part exam. The first section tests building code compliance knowledge. Section two tests a candidate's understanding of Minnesota business and law.











Your liability risk when hiring Wilson, Mark L



Licensed contractors in Minnesota must carry both active workers' compensation and general liability insurance policies. Request a copy of the insurance certificate for each before any work begins. 











Financial recourse when hiring Wilson, Mark L



The purpose of the Minnesota Contractor Recovery Fund is to compensate consumers who have suffered losses due to a licensed contractor's fraudulent, deceptive, or dishonest practices, conversion of funds, or failure to perform. All licensed contractors are required to pay a fee to the fund. The total amount that can be paid out against any one licensed contractor is $75,000. If multiple claims are filed against the same contractor, they are prorated. In these situations, you may not be able to recover your entire loss. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Minnesota, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

Research Interests & Projects
                        



Dr. Wilson is an ecologist and epidemiologist with broad research interests in infectious
                                    diseases, including the analysis of transmission dynamics, the evolution of vector-host-parasite
                                    systems, and the determinants of human risk. Most projects address environmental and
                                    social variation in time and space as it impacts on vector and reservoir populations
                                    and pathogen transmission patterns. Recent efforts have been directed at various "emerging"
                                    diseases including malaria and schistosomiasis in Africa, leishmaniasis in the Middle
                                    East, and dengue fever in South America. In addition to standard field, lab, and statistical
                                    techniques, he has been using satellite image data and GIS to undertaken spatial analyses
                                    of environmental change and the ecology of risk. Spatial analytic tools are also being
                                    applied to non-infectious disease processes.

Mark Wilson Project First Sale System Review – Is It a Scam



Tweet
What is the Project First Sale system?
Project First Sale is a video-oriented internet marketing training and software program by one Mark Wilson.  Through the use of his course and its accompanying software, Mark claims that he can teach the everyday person — one with no make money online experience or technical knowledge — how to generate thousands of dollars per day on autopilot and 100% free just by following his simple, 3-step blueprint and by working just 5 hours a week.  Mr. Wilson goes on to claim that once implemented, you could begin seeing results in as few as 24 hours.  All that you need to get started is a computer and an internet connection.  Even though he doesn’t reveal it on the sales page, Project First Sale is about making money from video marketing.
Is the Project First Sale system a scam?
Unfortunately, the Project First Sale system and its software is a scam.  To begin with, the videos it creates are what I would call low-quality, to put it kindly.  Mark recommends creating videos no longer than 30 seconds — not enough time to engage the view to compel them to click your link.  He also doesn’t teach you how to write effective content that would make the viewer want to check out your stuff.  As if this isn’t bad enough, Project First Sale doesn’t teach you effective optimization and keyword research, so that your stuff will even get found.  The worse part, though, has got to be the up-sells.  You’re greeted by no fewer than 9 when you log in and several of the tabs (like the “resources, traffic, and upgrades” tabs point back to the same up-sells!
My Personal Recommendation
Instead of putting your trust into an obviously bad actor (Mark Wilson) and a program that teaches flawed techniques that was designed to do nothing more than to take advantage of the unsuspecting, novice marketer leaving them with nothing to show for it (Project First Sale), I recommend you check out Google Sniper 3.0 (new for 2015) by George Brown.  It’s a comprehensive program that teaches a legitimate business model that has become standard for generating consistent, reliable income as quickly as possible.  More importantly, it’s taught by a real-life marketer with years of experience that practices what he preaches, uses real examples, and provides really good customer service.  Click the link below to learn more.
