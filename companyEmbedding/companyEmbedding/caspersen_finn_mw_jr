Finn Michael Westby Caspersen, Sr. (October 27, 1941 – September 7, 2009) was an American financier and philanthropist. A graduate of Brown University and Harvard Law School, he followed his father, Olaus Caspersen, a Norwegian immigrant to the United States, as chairman and chief executive of Beneficial Corporation, one of the largest consumer finance companies in the United States. After an $8.6 billion acquisition of Beneficial by Household International in 1998, Caspersen ran Knickerbocker Management, a private financial firm overseeing the assets of trusts and foundations.
As a philanthropist, Caspersen donated tens of millions of dollars to the Peddie School, Brown, Harvard, and Drew University, while overseeing the Hodson Trust, which benefitted four institutions in Maryland. He described education as his "particular love" and regarded it as "an investment in the future—an investment in human capital."[1] Buildings and endowed professorships have been named in his honor. Caspersen's philanthropy extended to rowing and equestrian sports, and service to the United States Equestrian Team Foundation, Princeton National Rowing Association, and the National Rowing Foundation.
Caspersen was an influential donor to Republican candidates at the state and national level. In the 1980s, he was a major supporter of former New Jersey governor Thomas Kean. He served as a town commissioner in Jupiter Island, Florida, an exclusive upper-class enclave, for four years, resigning a few weeks before his suicide in September 2009.
News reports linked Caspersen with financial problems and accusations of alleged large-scale tax evasion that were discovered in the course of federal investigations into offshore tax shelters managed by financial firms UBS and LGT Bank, and used by wealthy American clients. Near the end of his life, Caspersen was subjected to an IRS audit with a possible focus on alleged offshore accounts.[2][3] An attorney for Caspersen’s estate claimed that in 2013 the IRS effectively exonerated Caspersen posthumously—with no penalties or fines for offshore accounts or anything else.[3]

Biography[edit]
Early life and education[edit]
Finn Michael Westby Caspersen was born on October 27, 1941 in New York City.[4] He was one of two sons of Olaus Westby Caspersen (1896–1971), a Norwegian immigrant, and Freda Resika (1909–1991), an American-born Eastern European Jew thought to be of Russian or Polish descent.[5] Olaus's widowed mother and siblings had emigrated to the United States earlier, leaving Olaus in Norway to complete his education.[5] Olaus came to the United States in 1912 at age 16, settling in Weehawken, New Jersey.[2][5]
Finn Caspersen's mother, Freda, was a non-practicing Jew, and his father thought that his sons needed a religious upbringing. Finn attended a congregational church near the family home in his youth.[5] He later reflected that "being Protestant was important. There was a kind of anti-Catholicism in the family."[5] The family moved to homes in Andover, New Jersey, and Venice, Florida. Caspersen frequently visited Norway as a child, vacationing there during summers after 1947.[5]
Caspersen attended private schools until the ninth grade.[5] He attended the Peddie School, a private preparatory school in Hightstown, New Jersey, and was graduated in 1959.[6] Caspersen received a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree from Brown University in 1963 and a law degree (LL.B.) from Harvard Law School in 1966.[7][8]
Business career[edit]
In 1972, Caspersen joined the legal department at Beneficial Corporation, a large American consumer finance firm. Four years later, he was named the firm's chief executive officer. Beneficial had been established in 1914 in Elizabeth, New Jersey, by Clarence Hodson. Caspersen's father, Olaus, joined Beneficial in 1920 and served as Hodson's secretary for several years.[2][9] In 1929, Hodson and Caspersen reorganized the firm as Beneficial Finance Corporation and transformed it into one of the largest consumer loan providers in the United States.[2][10][11][12] Freda Caspersen was one of the company's directors.[12]
Under the younger Caspersen's leadership, Beneficial expanded into credit finance and offered credit cards through its People's Bank and Trust subsidiary.[11] It purchased Parliament Leasing in 1977, and First Texas Financial Corp., a savings and loan firm, in 1978.[11][13] In 1977, Beneficial entered the reinsurance business through subsidiaries, but these endeavors led to significant financial losses in the 1980s. Beneficial later downsized its reinsurance holdings and restructured to emphasize its second mortgage business.[11][14][15] According to Charles "Sandy" Hance, former senior vice president and general counsel of Beneficial, Caspersen was a "pioneer in second mortgages, which later evolved into home equity loans", and that he "saw this trend developing at a very early stage".[16]
Caspersen purchased Harbour Island in Tampa, Florida, from a Beneficial subsidiary in 1979, and in 1983 began to re-develop the island into an upscale residential and commercial development similar to the Inner Harbor in Baltimore, Maryland.[17] Beneficial purchased the 177-acre man-made island, formerly known as Seddon Island.[17][18][19] Before it was developed, local newspapers described the Harbour Island as "an industrial wasteland inhabited by wild pigs" and the only structures as rusted railroad tracks and an unused phosphate facility.[17][19] When the first phases were complete, the island opened with events hosted by former U.S. president Gerald Ford.[20] After seven years of dwindling business, Beneficial converted the development into office space, and renamed it Knights Point in 1995.[21]
Caspersen ran Beneficial for 22 years before its 1998 acquisition by Household International for $8.6 billion.[9][22] At the time of the acquisition, Beneficial had 25,000 employees and operated 1,650 branch offices throughout the United States.[16] Caspersen was paid $24 million in severance and other payments.[10] His next business endeavor was Knickerbocker Management, which he founded in 1998 with a few partners. Knickerbocker, a private investment firm that oversaw approximately $1 billion in assets of trusts and foundations, had offices in Gladstone, New Jersey and Hobe Sound, Florida.[22][23]
Political activities[edit]
Caspersen became an influential donor to state and federal Republican party candidates, including former New Jersey governors Thomas Kean and Christine Todd Whitman, and Kean's son Thomas Kean Jr., a state senator and candidate for United States Senator.[2] Caspersen was a major supporter of Kean's two campaigns for governor in 1981 and 1985.[22] When Kean was inaugurated in 1982, Caspersen, an avid equestrian, dressed in period costume and drove the incoming governor and his wife, as well as outgoing governor Brendan Byrne, to an inauguration party in a four-horse carriage. One writer described the scene as "something out of 'a Currier & Ives print'".[2][9] In 1998, Whitman appointed Caspersen to chair a 15-member advisory panel to recommend future development for Ellis Island, and to a public-private partnership to foster business in the state.[22] According to Vanity Fair contributor William D. Cohan, left-wing magazine Mother Jones found that "Caspersen and his wife donated $602,250 to political campaigns, making them the eighth-largest political donors in the U.S." during the 2000 election cycle.[2][10][24]
In 2005, Caspersen sought a seat on the town commission in Jupiter Island, Florida; his platform focused on conservation, limiting development, and burying utility cables.[2][25] He served a four-year term, and ran unopposed for re-election in 2009. He surprised his fellow commission members and neighbors by suddenly resigning on August 4, 2009, claiming that he anticipated moving from the community.[2]
Personal life[edit]




S. W. Bowne Hall at Drew University houses the Caspersen School of Graduate Studies.


In 1967, Caspersen married Barbara Warden Morris, the daughter of Samuel Wheeler Morris, Jr. (1918–1995) and Eleanor May Jones (1919–2011), one of Philadelphia's socially prominent Main Line families.[2][26] They were married for 42 years. Caspersen met his wife when she was an undergraduate student at Wellesley College.[2] She later obtained a masters and doctoral degree from Drew University, submitting a masters thesis on Henry David Thoreau's Walden,[27] and a doctoral dissertation on the works of Willa Cather.[28] For several years, Barbara Caspersen has served on the university's board of trustees and currently serves in an emeritus capacity.[29][30] The Caspersens had two homes in New Jersey—in Andover and Bernardsville in areas described as "in New Jersey horse country", a 6,500-square-foot waterfront estate Westerly, Rhode Island, and a residence in Jupiter Island, Florida.[2] The couple had four sons, Finn M. W. Caspersen Jr.,[31] Erik M. W. Caspersen,[32] Samuel M. W. Caspersen,[33] and Andrew W. W. Caspersen. All four of his sons were graduated from Harvard Law School. Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and Harvard alumnus Daniel Golden, in a book criticizing the role of privilege and wealth at elite colleges, attributed their admission to the prestigious law school to their father's generosity.[34] Caspersen served as an officer in the United States Coast Guard.[16][35] He was a member of the Knickerbocker Club, an exclusive, upper-class, men-only social club on New York City's Upper East Side.[9]
Caspersen was a talented equestrian in carriage driving, winning three national championships and representing the United States at three world championships.[10] In 1985, he won the four-in-hand carriage driving competition at the Royal Windsor Horse Show in the United Kingdom and later was an honorary lifetime officer of the show.[35][36][37] According to Sports Illustrated, Caspersen, described as "portly and patrician, tall and splendidly erect, with a lot of beef in his jowls" recalled being asked by Queen Elizabeth II at the awards ceremony about his role in driving his team of Holsteiners: "I told her it was to lower the carriage's center of gravity, ... She looked at my midriff and said I was well suited for the job."[36]
He was the father of Andrew Caspersen and three other sons.[38]
Death and aftermath[edit]
Finn Caspersen died on September 7, 2009 in the Shelter Harbor community of Westerly, Rhode Island, from an apparent gunshot wound to the head.[10][22] The cause of death was ruled a suicide. A blued-steel .38-calibre, five-shot Smith & Wesson revolver belonging to Caspersen was found near his body.[2] According to law enforcement sources investigating the suicide, Caspersen left a note stating that he "was tired, diminished and in constant pain, and that he did not want to be a burden to his loving family".[2]
Caspersen had been battling kidney cancer before his death, and reportedly pursued regular chemotherapy treatment. Several sources described his health as deteriorating and the cancer severe.[2][9] Others indicated that his medical condition led to depression, describing an uncertainty that left him "sort of horrified about his medical outcome".[2] Bernard Davidoff, an internist from New Jersey apparently familiar with Caspersen's medical care, advised police that Caspersen "suffered from severe depression and was taking antidepressant meds, heart meds, liver meds, kidney meds and diabetes meds".[2] It was also reported that medical issues and chemotherapy treatments "had severely hobbled him in recent years".[2]
A memorial service held on September 15, 2009 at St. Peter's Episcopal Church in Morristown, New Jersey, was attended by 900 friends and relatives.[39] Caspersen was eulogized by former New Jersey governor and Drew University president Thomas Kean.[2]
In the weeks after his death, reports emerged that Caspersen had listed his Westerly, Rhode Island, home for sale for $10.9 million, was facing financial and legal difficulties.[2] Caspersen had begun to step back from various philanthropic efforts and institutional boards at Harvard, Peddie, and the Hodson Trust.[9] Eight days after his death in 2009, a New York Times article cited an anonymous source, to report that Caspersen was being investigated by the Internal Revenue Service and was suspected of owing as much as $100 million in back taxes and fines, and facing possible imprisonment.[2][9] The New York Times article reported that Caspersen was caught up in a broader federal investigation into tax havens and offshore bank accounts used by wealthy Americans to avoid paying taxes in Switzerland and Liechtenstein. It was reported that his name was turned over to federal investigators by Swiss banking giant UBS earlier in the year, and in connection to Liechtenstein Global Trust (LGT), a private bank controlled by Liechtenstein’s royal family.[2][9]
In 2015 an attorney for Caspersen’s estate stated Caspersen’s tax returns for 2005-2008 had been audited, in an investigation that did not conclude until 2013. The attorney, Denis Conlon, stated that the net result of the four-year audit was a $7,000 refund from the government for overpayment in one year, $14,000 of additional tax due for another year (in which Caspersen had over $2.7 million of income), no refunds or additional taxes dues for the other two years, and no fines or penalties imposed for alleged offshore accounts or other conduct.[3]
Philanthropy[edit]
Equestrian and rowing[edit]
Caspersen served as a board member, president, and chairman of the United States Equestrian Team from 1982 to 2002. He was considered "the man who put American combined driving on the international map". During his 20-year tenure, American riders and drivers earned 71 medals, including 25 gold, in the Olympics, World Championships, and Pan American Games.[2][37][40] Caspersen helped the U.S. Equestrian Team establish a permanent home at Hamilton Farm, the former estate of U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady in Bedminster, New Jersey.[41][42] The Hamilton Farm property was owned by Beneficial and was located next to the corporation's headquarters. Beneficial deeded the property to the team at Caspersen's urging.[37][42]
Caspersen supported rowing, and was involved with the Princeton National Rowing Association (PNRA) and Princeton International Regatta Association (PIRA).[22][43] In 1998, he provided funding to build a boathouse to benefit the rowing programs of Peddie and the nearby Lawrenceville School on the north shore of Mercer Lake in West Windsor, New Jersey. Located at the Mercer Lake Race Course—site of the 1988, 1992, 2004 and 2008 United States Olympic Rowing Team Trials—the facility is used for training, racing, camps, clinics and administration by Peddie, Lawrenceville, the Hun School, high schools in Mercer County, New Jersey, USRowing, the US National Team, and the Mercer Junior Rowing Club, as well as PNRA and PIRA.[43][44]
Education[edit]




The Caspersen Student Center at Harvard Law School


Throughout his life, Caspersen was closely involved with the management of several universities and schools, serving on the directing boards of the Peddie School, Brown, and the Dean's Advisory Board at Harvard Law School.[2][16] In a 2008 interview, he stated that he believed education was "investment in the future—an investment in human capital. I've been active in a range of other things, but education's always been my particular love".[45]
Caspersen endowed two professorships at Harvard Law School—the Beneficial Professorship of Law, and the Finn M.W. Caspersen and Household International Professorship of Law.[1][46] In 2003, he was chairman of Harvard Law School's capital campaign, which he helped jump-start by pledging $30 million—the largest single donation in the school's history. The campaign ultimately raised $476,475,707.[9][10][45][47] The law school honored Caspersen by naming a special collections room in its Library after him.[1][48] In April 2012, Harvard dedicated part of a 250,000-square-foot multipurpose construction project, which housed student organizations, journals, and social activities, to Caspersen, calling it the Caspersen Student Center.[49][50] Critics attacked Harvard's decision to name the facilities after Caspersen after his alleged tax evasion was made public.[51]
Barbara Caspersen has served as trustee (currently as an emeritus trustee) of Drew University and as both chairwoman and vice-chairwoman of the liberal arts college's board.[52] In 1999, the Caspersens provided a $5 million gift for expanding graduate education programs at Drew. In honor of their service to the university, Drew renamed its graduate school as the Caspersen School of Graduate Studies.[53][54] The university's Rose Memorial Library houses a collection of books, manuscripts, artifacts and papers of Nebraska-born author Willa Cather (1873–1947) assembled from items given by several donors—including significant contributions by Caspersen and his wife. It is regarded as one of the best collection of Cather's papers assembled in the United States.[55][56][57]
Caspersen donated funds to build a four-level annex, named in honor of his parents, to Brown University's historic John Carter Brown Library, dedicated in 1991.[58][59] Caspersen also served as a trustee of the Peddie School starting in 1970, and as the board's chairman starting in 1976. In 1998, he and philanthropist Walter H. Annenberg each donated $10 million to the school.[6][22][60] The Caspersen Campus Center, which opened in 1996, and Caspersen History House, dedicated in 2006, were named in his honor.[61]
From 1976 until a few weeks before his death, Caspersen ran the Hodson Trust, established by Beneficial founder Clarence Hodson to award grants to four colleges in Maryland: Hood College, The Johns Hopkins University, St. John’s College, and Washington College. Under the first 25 years of Caspersen's stewardship, the trust donated over $118 million to the four institutions.[62][63] Caspersen was awarded honorary degrees for his service to education; Washington College conferred an honorary Doctor of Humanities degree in 1981 and Hood College awarded Caspersen with an honorary Doctor of Laws degree in 1983.[63][64]

Finn Michael Westby Caspersen, Sr. (October 27, 1941 – September 7, 2009) was an American financier and philanthropist. A graduate of Brown University and Harvard Law School, he followed his father, Olaus Caspersen, a Norwegian immigrant to the United States, as chairman and chief executive of Beneficial Corporation, one of the largest consumer finance companies in the United States. After an $8.6 billion acquisition of Beneficial by Household International in 1998, Caspersen ran Knickerbocker Management, a private financial firm overseeing the assets of trusts and foundations.
As a philanthropist, Caspersen donated tens of millions of dollars to the Peddie School, Brown, Harvard, and Drew University, while overseeing the Hodson Trust, which benefitted four institutions in Maryland. He described education as his "particular love" and regarded it as "an investment in the future—an investment in human capital."[1] Buildings and endowed professorships have been named in his honor. Caspersen's philanthropy extended to rowing and equestrian sports, and service to the United States Equestrian Team Foundation, Princeton National Rowing Association, and the National Rowing Foundation.
Caspersen was an influential donor to Republican candidates at the state and national level. In the 1980s, he was a major supporter of former New Jersey governor Thomas Kean. He served as a town commissioner in Jupiter Island, Florida, an exclusive upper-class enclave, for four years, resigning a few weeks before his suicide in September 2009.
News reports linked Caspersen with financial problems and accusations of alleged large-scale tax evasion that were discovered in the course of federal investigations into offshore tax shelters managed by financial firms UBS and LGT Bank, and used by wealthy American clients. Near the end of his life, Caspersen was subjected to an IRS audit with a possible focus on alleged offshore accounts.[2][3] An attorney for Caspersen’s estate claimed that in 2013 the IRS effectively exonerated Caspersen posthumously—with no penalties or fines for offshore accounts or anything else.[3]

Biography[edit]
Early life and education[edit]
Finn Michael Westby Caspersen was born on October 27, 1941 in New York City.[4] He was one of two sons of Olaus Westby Caspersen (1896–1971), a Norwegian immigrant, and Freda Resika (1909–1991), an American-born Eastern European Jew thought to be of Russian or Polish descent.[5] Olaus's widowed mother and siblings had emigrated to the United States earlier, leaving Olaus in Norway to complete his education.[5] Olaus came to the United States in 1912 at age 16, settling in Weehawken, New Jersey.[2][5]
Finn Caspersen's mother, Freda, was a non-practicing Jew, and his father thought that his sons needed a religious upbringing. Finn attended a congregational church near the family home in his youth.[5] He later reflected that "being Protestant was important. There was a kind of anti-Catholicism in the family."[5] The family moved to homes in Andover, New Jersey, and Venice, Florida. Caspersen frequently visited Norway as a child, vacationing there during summers after 1947.[5]
Caspersen attended private schools until the ninth grade.[5] He attended the Peddie School, a private preparatory school in Hightstown, New Jersey, and was graduated in 1959.[6] Caspersen received a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree from Brown University in 1963 and a law degree (LL.B.) from Harvard Law School in 1966.[7][8]
Business career[edit]
In 1972, Caspersen joined the legal department at Beneficial Corporation, a large American consumer finance firm. Four years later, he was named the firm's chief executive officer. Beneficial had been established in 1914 in Elizabeth, New Jersey, by Clarence Hodson. Caspersen's father, Olaus, joined Beneficial in 1920 and served as Hodson's secretary for several years.[2][9] In 1929, Hodson and Caspersen reorganized the firm as Beneficial Finance Corporation and transformed it into one of the largest consumer loan providers in the United States.[2][10][11][12] Freda Caspersen was one of the company's directors.[12]
Under the younger Caspersen's leadership, Beneficial expanded into credit finance and offered credit cards through its People's Bank and Trust subsidiary.[11] It purchased Parliament Leasing in 1977, and First Texas Financial Corp., a savings and loan firm, in 1978.[11][13] In 1977, Beneficial entered the reinsurance business through subsidiaries, but these endeavors led to significant financial losses in the 1980s. Beneficial later downsized its reinsurance holdings and restructured to emphasize its second mortgage business.[11][14][15] According to Charles "Sandy" Hance, former senior vice president and general counsel of Beneficial, Caspersen was a "pioneer in second mortgages, which later evolved into home equity loans", and that he "saw this trend developing at a very early stage".[16]
Caspersen purchased Harbour Island in Tampa, Florida, from a Beneficial subsidiary in 1979, and in 1983 began to re-develop the island into an upscale residential and commercial development similar to the Inner Harbor in Baltimore, Maryland.[17] Beneficial purchased the 177-acre man-made island, formerly known as Seddon Island.[17][18][19] Before it was developed, local newspapers described the Harbour Island as "an industrial wasteland inhabited by wild pigs" and the only structures as rusted railroad tracks and an unused phosphate facility.[17][19] When the first phases were complete, the island opened with events hosted by former U.S. president Gerald Ford.[20] After seven years of dwindling business, Beneficial converted the development into office space, and renamed it Knights Point in 1995.[21]
Caspersen ran Beneficial for 22 years before its 1998 acquisition by Household International for $8.6 billion.[9][22] At the time of the acquisition, Beneficial had 25,000 employees and operated 1,650 branch offices throughout the United States.[16] Caspersen was paid $24 million in severance and other payments.[10] His next business endeavor was Knickerbocker Management, which he founded in 1998 with a few partners. Knickerbocker, a private investment firm that oversaw approximately $1 billion in assets of trusts and foundations, had offices in Gladstone, New Jersey and Hobe Sound, Florida.[22][23]
Political activities[edit]
Caspersen became an influential donor to state and federal Republican party candidates, including former New Jersey governors Thomas Kean and Christine Todd Whitman, and Kean's son Thomas Kean Jr., a state senator and candidate for United States Senator.[2] Caspersen was a major supporter of Kean's two campaigns for governor in 1981 and 1985.[22] When Kean was inaugurated in 1982, Caspersen, an avid equestrian, dressed in period costume and drove the incoming governor and his wife, as well as outgoing governor Brendan Byrne, to an inauguration party in a four-horse carriage. One writer described the scene as "something out of 'a Currier & Ives print'".[2][9] In 1998, Whitman appointed Caspersen to chair a 15-member advisory panel to recommend future development for Ellis Island, and to a public-private partnership to foster business in the state.[22] According to Vanity Fair contributor William D. Cohan, left-wing magazine Mother Jones found that "Caspersen and his wife donated $602,250 to political campaigns, making them the eighth-largest political donors in the U.S." during the 2000 election cycle.[2][10][24]
In 2005, Caspersen sought a seat on the town commission in Jupiter Island, Florida; his platform focused on conservation, limiting development, and burying utility cables.[2][25] He served a four-year term, and ran unopposed for re-election in 2009. He surprised his fellow commission members and neighbors by suddenly resigning on August 4, 2009, claiming that he anticipated moving from the community.[2]
Personal life[edit]




S. W. Bowne Hall at Drew University houses the Caspersen School of Graduate Studies.


In 1967, Caspersen married Barbara Warden Morris, the daughter of Samuel Wheeler Morris, Jr. (1918–1995) and Eleanor May Jones (1919–2011), one of Philadelphia's socially prominent Main Line families.[2][26] They were married for 42 years. Caspersen met his wife when she was an undergraduate student at Wellesley College.[2] She later obtained a masters and doctoral degree from Drew University, submitting a masters thesis on Henry David Thoreau's Walden,[27] and a doctoral dissertation on the works of Willa Cather.[28] For several years, Barbara Caspersen has served on the university's board of trustees and currently serves in an emeritus capacity.[29][30] The Caspersens had two homes in New Jersey—in Andover and Bernardsville in areas described as "in New Jersey horse country", a 6,500-square-foot waterfront estate Westerly, Rhode Island, and a residence in Jupiter Island, Florida.[2] The couple had four sons, Finn M. W. Caspersen Jr.,[31] Erik M. W. Caspersen,[32] Samuel M. W. Caspersen,[33] and Andrew W. W. Caspersen. All four of his sons were graduated from Harvard Law School. Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and Harvard alumnus Daniel Golden, in a book criticizing the role of privilege and wealth at elite colleges, attributed their admission to the prestigious law school to their father's generosity.[34] Caspersen served as an officer in the United States Coast Guard.[16][35] He was a member of the Knickerbocker Club, an exclusive, upper-class, men-only social club on New York City's Upper East Side.[9]
Caspersen was a talented equestrian in carriage driving, winning three national championships and representing the United States at three world championships.[10] In 1985, he won the four-in-hand carriage driving competition at the Royal Windsor Horse Show in the United Kingdom and later was an honorary lifetime officer of the show.[35][36][37] According to Sports Illustrated, Caspersen, described as "portly and patrician, tall and splendidly erect, with a lot of beef in his jowls" recalled being asked by Queen Elizabeth II at the awards ceremony about his role in driving his team of Holsteiners: "I told her it was to lower the carriage's center of gravity, ... She looked at my midriff and said I was well suited for the job."[36]
He was the father of Andrew Caspersen and three other sons.[38]
Death and aftermath[edit]
Finn Caspersen died on September 7, 2009 in the Shelter Harbor community of Westerly, Rhode Island, from an apparent gunshot wound to the head.[10][22] The cause of death was ruled a suicide. A blued-steel .38-calibre, five-shot Smith & Wesson revolver belonging to Caspersen was found near his body.[2] According to law enforcement sources investigating the suicide, Caspersen left a note stating that he "was tired, diminished and in constant pain, and that he did not want to be a burden to his loving family".[2]
Caspersen had been battling kidney cancer before his death, and reportedly pursued regular chemotherapy treatment. Several sources described his health as deteriorating and the cancer severe.[2][9] Others indicated that his medical condition led to depression, describing an uncertainty that left him "sort of horrified about his medical outcome".[2] Bernard Davidoff, an internist from New Jersey apparently familiar with Caspersen's medical care, advised police that Caspersen "suffered from severe depression and was taking antidepressant meds, heart meds, liver meds, kidney meds and diabetes meds".[2] It was also reported that medical issues and chemotherapy treatments "had severely hobbled him in recent years".[2]
A memorial service held on September 15, 2009 at St. Peter's Episcopal Church in Morristown, New Jersey, was attended by 900 friends and relatives.[39] Caspersen was eulogized by former New Jersey governor and Drew University president Thomas Kean.[2]
In the weeks after his death, reports emerged that Caspersen had listed his Westerly, Rhode Island, home for sale for $10.9 million, was facing financial and legal difficulties.[2] Caspersen had begun to step back from various philanthropic efforts and institutional boards at Harvard, Peddie, and the Hodson Trust.[9] Eight days after his death in 2009, a New York Times article cited an anonymous source, to report that Caspersen was being investigated by the Internal Revenue Service and was suspected of owing as much as $100 million in back taxes and fines, and facing possible imprisonment.[2][9] The New York Times article reported that Caspersen was caught up in a broader federal investigation into tax havens and offshore bank accounts used by wealthy Americans to avoid paying taxes in Switzerland and Liechtenstein. It was reported that his name was turned over to federal investigators by Swiss banking giant UBS earlier in the year, and in connection to Liechtenstein Global Trust (LGT), a private bank controlled by Liechtenstein’s royal family.[2][9]
In 2015 an attorney for Caspersen’s estate stated Caspersen’s tax returns for 2005-2008 had been audited, in an investigation that did not conclude until 2013. The attorney, Denis Conlon, stated that the net result of the four-year audit was a $7,000 refund from the government for overpayment in one year, $14,000 of additional tax due for another year (in which Caspersen had over $2.7 million of income), no refunds or additional taxes dues for the other two years, and no fines or penalties imposed for alleged offshore accounts or other conduct.[3]
Philanthropy[edit]
Equestrian and rowing[edit]
Caspersen served as a board member, president, and chairman of the United States Equestrian Team from 1982 to 2002. He was considered "the man who put American combined driving on the international map". During his 20-year tenure, American riders and drivers earned 71 medals, including 25 gold, in the Olympics, World Championships, and Pan American Games.[2][37][40] Caspersen helped the U.S. Equestrian Team establish a permanent home at Hamilton Farm, the former estate of U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady in Bedminster, New Jersey.[41][42] The Hamilton Farm property was owned by Beneficial and was located next to the corporation's headquarters. Beneficial deeded the property to the team at Caspersen's urging.[37][42]
Caspersen supported rowing, and was involved with the Princeton National Rowing Association (PNRA) and Princeton International Regatta Association (PIRA).[22][43] In 1998, he provided funding to build a boathouse to benefit the rowing programs of Peddie and the nearby Lawrenceville School on the north shore of Mercer Lake in West Windsor, New Jersey. Located at the Mercer Lake Race Course—site of the 1988, 1992, 2004 and 2008 United States Olympic Rowing Team Trials—the facility is used for training, racing, camps, clinics and administration by Peddie, Lawrenceville, the Hun School, high schools in Mercer County, New Jersey, USRowing, the US National Team, and the Mercer Junior Rowing Club, as well as PNRA and PIRA.[43][44]
Education[edit]




The Caspersen Student Center at Harvard Law School


Throughout his life, Caspersen was closely involved with the management of several universities and schools, serving on the directing boards of the Peddie School, Brown, and the Dean's Advisory Board at Harvard Law School.[2][16] In a 2008 interview, he stated that he believed education was "investment in the future—an investment in human capital. I've been active in a range of other things, but education's always been my particular love".[45]
Caspersen endowed two professorships at Harvard Law School—the Beneficial Professorship of Law, and the Finn M.W. Caspersen and Household International Professorship of Law.[1][46] In 2003, he was chairman of Harvard Law School's capital campaign, which he helped jump-start by pledging $30 million—the largest single donation in the school's history. The campaign ultimately raised $476,475,707.[9][10][45][47] The law school honored Caspersen by naming a special collections room in its Library after him.[1][48] In April 2012, Harvard dedicated part of a 250,000-square-foot multipurpose construction project, which housed student organizations, journals, and social activities, to Caspersen, calling it the Caspersen Student Center.[49][50] Critics attacked Harvard's decision to name the facilities after Caspersen after his alleged tax evasion was made public.[51]
Barbara Caspersen has served as trustee (currently as an emeritus trustee) of Drew University and as both chairwoman and vice-chairwoman of the liberal arts college's board.[52] In 1999, the Caspersens provided a $5 million gift for expanding graduate education programs at Drew. In honor of their service to the university, Drew renamed its graduate school as the Caspersen School of Graduate Studies.[53][54] The university's Rose Memorial Library houses a collection of books, manuscripts, artifacts and papers of Nebraska-born author Willa Cather (1873–1947) assembled from items given by several donors—including significant contributions by Caspersen and his wife. It is regarded as one of the best collection of Cather's papers assembled in the United States.[55][56][57]
Caspersen donated funds to build a four-level annex, named in honor of his parents, to Brown University's historic John Carter Brown Library, dedicated in 1991.[58][59] Caspersen also served as a trustee of the Peddie School starting in 1970, and as the board's chairman starting in 1976. In 1998, he and philanthropist Walter H. Annenberg each donated $10 million to the school.[6][22][60] The Caspersen Campus Center, which opened in 1996, and Caspersen History House, dedicated in 2006, were named in his honor.[61]
From 1976 until a few weeks before his death, Caspersen ran the Hodson Trust, established by Beneficial founder Clarence Hodson to award grants to four colleges in Maryland: Hood College, The Johns Hopkins University, St. John’s College, and Washington College. Under the first 25 years of Caspersen's stewardship, the trust donated over $118 million to the four institutions.[62][63] Caspersen was awarded honorary degrees for his service to education; Washington College conferred an honorary Doctor of Humanities degree in 1981 and Hood College awarded Caspersen with an honorary Doctor of Laws degree in 1983.[63][64]

Finn Michael Westby Caspersen, Sr. (October 27, 1941 – September 7, 2009) was an American financier and philanthropist. A graduate of Brown University and Harvard Law School, he followed his father, Olaus Caspersen, a Norwegian immigrant to the United States, as chairman and chief executive of Beneficial Corporation, one of the largest consumer finance companies in the United States. After an $8.6 billion acquisition of Beneficial by Household International in 1998, Caspersen ran Knickerbocker Management, a private financial firm overseeing the assets of trusts and foundations.
As a philanthropist, Caspersen donated tens of millions of dollars to the Peddie School, Brown, Harvard, and Drew University, while overseeing the Hodson Trust, which benefitted four institutions in Maryland. He described education as his "particular love" and regarded it as "an investment in the future—an investment in human capital."[1] Buildings and endowed professorships have been named in his honor. Caspersen's philanthropy extended to rowing and equestrian sports, and service to the United States Equestrian Team Foundation, Princeton National Rowing Association, and the National Rowing Foundation.
Caspersen was an influential donor to Republican candidates at the state and national level. In the 1980s, he was a major supporter of former New Jersey governor Thomas Kean. He served as a town commissioner in Jupiter Island, Florida, an exclusive upper-class enclave, for four years, resigning a few weeks before his suicide in September 2009.
News reports linked Caspersen with financial problems and accusations of alleged large-scale tax evasion that were discovered in the course of federal investigations into offshore tax shelters managed by financial firms UBS and LGT Bank, and used by wealthy American clients. Near the end of his life, Caspersen was subjected to an IRS audit with a possible focus on alleged offshore accounts.[2][3] An attorney for Caspersen’s estate claimed that in 2013 the IRS effectively exonerated Caspersen posthumously—with no penalties or fines for offshore accounts or anything else.[3]

Biography[edit]
Early life and education[edit]
Finn Michael Westby Caspersen was born on October 27, 1941 in New York City.[4] He was one of two sons of Olaus Westby Caspersen (1896–1971), a Norwegian immigrant, and Freda Resika (1909–1991), an American-born Eastern European Jew thought to be of Russian or Polish descent.[5] Olaus's widowed mother and siblings had emigrated to the United States earlier, leaving Olaus in Norway to complete his education.[5] Olaus came to the United States in 1912 at age 16, settling in Weehawken, New Jersey.[2][5]
Finn Caspersen's mother, Freda, was a non-practicing Jew, and his father thought that his sons needed a religious upbringing. Finn attended a congregational church near the family home in his youth.[5] He later reflected that "being Protestant was important. There was a kind of anti-Catholicism in the family."[5] The family moved to homes in Andover, New Jersey, and Venice, Florida. Caspersen frequently visited Norway as a child, vacationing there during summers after 1947.[5]
Caspersen attended private schools until the ninth grade.[5] He attended the Peddie School, a private preparatory school in Hightstown, New Jersey, and was graduated in 1959.[6] Caspersen received a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree from Brown University in 1963 and a law degree (LL.B.) from Harvard Law School in 1966.[7][8]
Business career[edit]
In 1972, Caspersen joined the legal department at Beneficial Corporation, a large American consumer finance firm. Four years later, he was named the firm's chief executive officer. Beneficial had been established in 1914 in Elizabeth, New Jersey, by Clarence Hodson. Caspersen's father, Olaus, joined Beneficial in 1920 and served as Hodson's secretary for several years.[2][9] In 1929, Hodson and Caspersen reorganized the firm as Beneficial Finance Corporation and transformed it into one of the largest consumer loan providers in the United States.[2][10][11][12] Freda Caspersen was one of the company's directors.[12]
Under the younger Caspersen's leadership, Beneficial expanded into credit finance and offered credit cards through its People's Bank and Trust subsidiary.[11] It purchased Parliament Leasing in 1977, and First Texas Financial Corp., a savings and loan firm, in 1978.[11][13] In 1977, Beneficial entered the reinsurance business through subsidiaries, but these endeavors led to significant financial losses in the 1980s. Beneficial later downsized its reinsurance holdings and restructured to emphasize its second mortgage business.[11][14][15] According to Charles "Sandy" Hance, former senior vice president and general counsel of Beneficial, Caspersen was a "pioneer in second mortgages, which later evolved into home equity loans", and that he "saw this trend developing at a very early stage".[16]
Caspersen purchased Harbour Island in Tampa, Florida, from a Beneficial subsidiary in 1979, and in 1983 began to re-develop the island into an upscale residential and commercial development similar to the Inner Harbor in Baltimore, Maryland.[17] Beneficial purchased the 177-acre man-made island, formerly known as Seddon Island.[17][18][19] Before it was developed, local newspapers described the Harbour Island as "an industrial wasteland inhabited by wild pigs" and the only structures as rusted railroad tracks and an unused phosphate facility.[17][19] When the first phases were complete, the island opened with events hosted by former U.S. president Gerald Ford.[20] After seven years of dwindling business, Beneficial converted the development into office space, and renamed it Knights Point in 1995.[21]
Caspersen ran Beneficial for 22 years before its 1998 acquisition by Household International for $8.6 billion.[9][22] At the time of the acquisition, Beneficial had 25,000 employees and operated 1,650 branch offices throughout the United States.[16] Caspersen was paid $24 million in severance and other payments.[10] His next business endeavor was Knickerbocker Management, which he founded in 1998 with a few partners. Knickerbocker, a private investment firm that oversaw approximately $1 billion in assets of trusts and foundations, had offices in Gladstone, New Jersey and Hobe Sound, Florida.[22][23]
Political activities[edit]
Caspersen became an influential donor to state and federal Republican party candidates, including former New Jersey governors Thomas Kean and Christine Todd Whitman, and Kean's son Thomas Kean Jr., a state senator and candidate for United States Senator.[2] Caspersen was a major supporter of Kean's two campaigns for governor in 1981 and 1985.[22] When Kean was inaugurated in 1982, Caspersen, an avid equestrian, dressed in period costume and drove the incoming governor and his wife, as well as outgoing governor Brendan Byrne, to an inauguration party in a four-horse carriage. One writer described the scene as "something out of 'a Currier & Ives print'".[2][9] In 1998, Whitman appointed Caspersen to chair a 15-member advisory panel to recommend future development for Ellis Island, and to a public-private partnership to foster business in the state.[22] According to Vanity Fair contributor William D. Cohan, left-wing magazine Mother Jones found that "Caspersen and his wife donated $602,250 to political campaigns, making them the eighth-largest political donors in the U.S." during the 2000 election cycle.[2][10][24]
In 2005, Caspersen sought a seat on the town commission in Jupiter Island, Florida; his platform focused on conservation, limiting development, and burying utility cables.[2][25] He served a four-year term, and ran unopposed for re-election in 2009. He surprised his fellow commission members and neighbors by suddenly resigning on August 4, 2009, claiming that he anticipated moving from the community.[2]
Personal life[edit]




S. W. Bowne Hall at Drew University houses the Caspersen School of Graduate Studies.


In 1967, Caspersen married Barbara Warden Morris, the daughter of Samuel Wheeler Morris, Jr. (1918–1995) and Eleanor May Jones (1919–2011), one of Philadelphia's socially prominent Main Line families.[2][26] They were married for 42 years. Caspersen met his wife when she was an undergraduate student at Wellesley College.[2] She later obtained a masters and doctoral degree from Drew University, submitting a masters thesis on Henry David Thoreau's Walden,[27] and a doctoral dissertation on the works of Willa Cather.[28] For several years, Barbara Caspersen has served on the university's board of trustees and currently serves in an emeritus capacity.[29][30] The Caspersens had two homes in New Jersey—in Andover and Bernardsville in areas described as "in New Jersey horse country", a 6,500-square-foot waterfront estate Westerly, Rhode Island, and a residence in Jupiter Island, Florida.[2] The couple had four sons, Finn M. W. Caspersen Jr.,[31] Erik M. W. Caspersen,[32] Samuel M. W. Caspersen,[33] and Andrew W. W. Caspersen. All four of his sons were graduated from Harvard Law School. Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and Harvard alumnus Daniel Golden, in a book criticizing the role of privilege and wealth at elite colleges, attributed their admission to the prestigious law school to their father's generosity.[34] Caspersen served as an officer in the United States Coast Guard.[16][35] He was a member of the Knickerbocker Club, an exclusive, upper-class, men-only social club on New York City's Upper East Side.[9]
Caspersen was a talented equestrian in carriage driving, winning three national championships and representing the United States at three world championships.[10] In 1985, he won the four-in-hand carriage driving competition at the Royal Windsor Horse Show in the United Kingdom and later was an honorary lifetime officer of the show.[35][36][37] According to Sports Illustrated, Caspersen, described as "portly and patrician, tall and splendidly erect, with a lot of beef in his jowls" recalled being asked by Queen Elizabeth II at the awards ceremony about his role in driving his team of Holsteiners: "I told her it was to lower the carriage's center of gravity, ... She looked at my midriff and said I was well suited for the job."[36]
He was the father of Andrew Caspersen and three other sons.[38]
Death and aftermath[edit]
Finn Caspersen died on September 7, 2009 in the Shelter Harbor community of Westerly, Rhode Island, from an apparent gunshot wound to the head.[10][22] The cause of death was ruled a suicide. A blued-steel .38-calibre, five-shot Smith & Wesson revolver belonging to Caspersen was found near his body.[2] According to law enforcement sources investigating the suicide, Caspersen left a note stating that he "was tired, diminished and in constant pain, and that he did not want to be a burden to his loving family".[2]
Caspersen had been battling kidney cancer before his death, and reportedly pursued regular chemotherapy treatment. Several sources described his health as deteriorating and the cancer severe.[2][9] Others indicated that his medical condition led to depression, describing an uncertainty that left him "sort of horrified about his medical outcome".[2] Bernard Davidoff, an internist from New Jersey apparently familiar with Caspersen's medical care, advised police that Caspersen "suffered from severe depression and was taking antidepressant meds, heart meds, liver meds, kidney meds and diabetes meds".[2] It was also reported that medical issues and chemotherapy treatments "had severely hobbled him in recent years".[2]
A memorial service held on September 15, 2009 at St. Peter's Episcopal Church in Morristown, New Jersey, was attended by 900 friends and relatives.[39] Caspersen was eulogized by former New Jersey governor and Drew University president Thomas Kean.[2]
In the weeks after his death, reports emerged that Caspersen had listed his Westerly, Rhode Island, home for sale for $10.9 million, was facing financial and legal difficulties.[2] Caspersen had begun to step back from various philanthropic efforts and institutional boards at Harvard, Peddie, and the Hodson Trust.[9] Eight days after his death in 2009, a New York Times article cited an anonymous source, to report that Caspersen was being investigated by the Internal Revenue Service and was suspected of owing as much as $100 million in back taxes and fines, and facing possible imprisonment.[2][9] The New York Times article reported that Caspersen was caught up in a broader federal investigation into tax havens and offshore bank accounts used by wealthy Americans to avoid paying taxes in Switzerland and Liechtenstein. It was reported that his name was turned over to federal investigators by Swiss banking giant UBS earlier in the year, and in connection to Liechtenstein Global Trust (LGT), a private bank controlled by Liechtenstein’s royal family.[2][9]
In 2015 an attorney for Caspersen’s estate stated Caspersen’s tax returns for 2005-2008 had been audited, in an investigation that did not conclude until 2013. The attorney, Denis Conlon, stated that the net result of the four-year audit was a $7,000 refund from the government for overpayment in one year, $14,000 of additional tax due for another year (in which Caspersen had over $2.7 million of income), no refunds or additional taxes dues for the other two years, and no fines or penalties imposed for alleged offshore accounts or other conduct.[3]
Philanthropy[edit]
Equestrian and rowing[edit]
Caspersen served as a board member, president, and chairman of the United States Equestrian Team from 1982 to 2002. He was considered "the man who put American combined driving on the international map". During his 20-year tenure, American riders and drivers earned 71 medals, including 25 gold, in the Olympics, World Championships, and Pan American Games.[2][37][40] Caspersen helped the U.S. Equestrian Team establish a permanent home at Hamilton Farm, the former estate of U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady in Bedminster, New Jersey.[41][42] The Hamilton Farm property was owned by Beneficial and was located next to the corporation's headquarters. Beneficial deeded the property to the team at Caspersen's urging.[37][42]
Caspersen supported rowing, and was involved with the Princeton National Rowing Association (PNRA) and Princeton International Regatta Association (PIRA).[22][43] In 1998, he provided funding to build a boathouse to benefit the rowing programs of Peddie and the nearby Lawrenceville School on the north shore of Mercer Lake in West Windsor, New Jersey. Located at the Mercer Lake Race Course—site of the 1988, 1992, 2004 and 2008 United States Olympic Rowing Team Trials—the facility is used for training, racing, camps, clinics and administration by Peddie, Lawrenceville, the Hun School, high schools in Mercer County, New Jersey, USRowing, the US National Team, and the Mercer Junior Rowing Club, as well as PNRA and PIRA.[43][44]
Education[edit]




The Caspersen Student Center at Harvard Law School


Throughout his life, Caspersen was closely involved with the management of several universities and schools, serving on the directing boards of the Peddie School, Brown, and the Dean's Advisory Board at Harvard Law School.[2][16] In a 2008 interview, he stated that he believed education was "investment in the future—an investment in human capital. I've been active in a range of other things, but education's always been my particular love".[45]
Caspersen endowed two professorships at Harvard Law School—the Beneficial Professorship of Law, and the Finn M.W. Caspersen and Household International Professorship of Law.[1][46] In 2003, he was chairman of Harvard Law School's capital campaign, which he helped jump-start by pledging $30 million—the largest single donation in the school's history. The campaign ultimately raised $476,475,707.[9][10][45][47] The law school honored Caspersen by naming a special collections room in its Library after him.[1][48] In April 2012, Harvard dedicated part of a 250,000-square-foot multipurpose construction project, which housed student organizations, journals, and social activities, to Caspersen, calling it the Caspersen Student Center.[49][50] Critics attacked Harvard's decision to name the facilities after Caspersen after his alleged tax evasion was made public.[51]
Barbara Caspersen has served as trustee (currently as an emeritus trustee) of Drew University and as both chairwoman and vice-chairwoman of the liberal arts college's board.[52] In 1999, the Caspersens provided a $5 million gift for expanding graduate education programs at Drew. In honor of their service to the university, Drew renamed its graduate school as the Caspersen School of Graduate Studies.[53][54] The university's Rose Memorial Library houses a collection of books, manuscripts, artifacts and papers of Nebraska-born author Willa Cather (1873–1947) assembled from items given by several donors—including significant contributions by Caspersen and his wife. It is regarded as one of the best collection of Cather's papers assembled in the United States.[55][56][57]
Caspersen donated funds to build a four-level annex, named in honor of his parents, to Brown University's historic John Carter Brown Library, dedicated in 1991.[58][59] Caspersen also served as a trustee of the Peddie School starting in 1970, and as the board's chairman starting in 1976. In 1998, he and philanthropist Walter H. Annenberg each donated $10 million to the school.[6][22][60] The Caspersen Campus Center, which opened in 1996, and Caspersen History House, dedicated in 2006, were named in his honor.[61]
From 1976 until a few weeks before his death, Caspersen ran the Hodson Trust, established by Beneficial founder Clarence Hodson to award grants to four colleges in Maryland: Hood College, The Johns Hopkins University, St. John’s College, and Washington College. Under the first 25 years of Caspersen's stewardship, the trust donated over $118 million to the four institutions.[62][63] Caspersen was awarded honorary degrees for his service to education; Washington College conferred an honorary Doctor of Humanities degree in 1981 and Hood College awarded Caspersen with an honorary Doctor of Laws degree in 1983.[63][64]

Suicide Victim May Have Hidden Millions Abroad

By LYNNLEY BROWNINGSEPT. 15, 2009

He seemed, in many ways, like a man from another time, a Gatsbyesque figure who glided through a world of old money, private clubs and pedigree horses, his family name emblazoned on Ivy League halls.Then, in an instant, he was gone —  his privileged life ended, by his own hand, with a single gunshot to the head.No one can know exactly what Finn M. W. Caspersen, a prominent philanthropist and the heir to the Beneficial Corporation fortune, was thinking when he decided to take his life on Labor Day.   Although Mr. Caspersen, 67, was battling kidney cancer, his suicide shocked his family and friends.But Mr. Caspersen, a patron of Harvard and Princeton who gave away tens of millions of dollars to charity, apparently harbored a secret: He was suspected of dodging many millions in federal taxes. The authorities, it seemed, were closing in.

At the time of his death, investigators were building a case against Mr. Caspersen on suspicion of using secret offshore bank accounts to evade taxes. Continue reading the main story

The authorities  had asserted  he might have owed  as much as $100 million in back taxes and fines or, possibly, even have faced prison, according to a person briefed on the investigation, who was granted anonymity because of the delicacy  of the case and the events surrounding Mr. Caspersen’s death.Whispers of some sort of tax trouble went through the crowd at Mr. Caspersen’s funeral on Tuesday. About 800 people attended the service in Morristown, N.J.“He made everything right for so many people, and that is why this is such a tragedy,” Susan Wachter, a friend and former Beneficial board member, said of Mr. Caspersen’s death.Mr. Caspersen’s widow, Barbara, declined to comment as did other family members.  But friends and business associates struggled to come to terms with the suicide of a man many characterized as larger than life.“I’m shocked by his death,” said Philip Richter, a former managing director at Knickerbocker, Mr. Caspersen’s private investment firm.The precise nature of the tax investigation was unclear. What is known is that Mr. Caspersen, a longtime fixture in New Jersey political circles, had been swept up in a broad, federal crackdown on the use of offshore bank accounts by wealthy Americans. UBS, the big Swiss bank, divulged the names of nearly 300 of its American clients  in February and agreed to hand over several thousand more last month.One wealthy UBS client, Igor Olenicoff, hid an estimated $200 million in Switzerland and Liechtenstein. In 2008, he pleaded guilty to a single federal tax felony and paid $52 million in back taxes and penalties. More recently, several other UBS clients, among them a Florida yacht broker, admitted to tax evasion.

As the inquiries continue,  the names of more well-to-do people are likely to come to light. Those who have hidden money offshore face a difficult choice: They have a week  to turn themselves over to the Internal Revenue Service or gamble that they will not  be caught. The I.R.S. is offering amnesty to those who disclose their offshore holdings by Sept. 23. After that, offenders could face criminal prosecution.

The Caspersen case centers on bank accounts  in Liechtenstein, which, like Switzerland, is a leading offshore haven. The I.R.S. learned that Mr. Caspersen held an account at LGT,  the private bank controlled with Liechtenstein’s royal family, according to the person close to the investigation.  Liechtenstein pledged last December to disclose the names of some wealthy Americans with bank accounts there, but it was unclear if Mr. Caspersen’s name was among them or how the I.R.S. learned of any account in his name.The questions are unlikely to end with Mr. Caspersen’s death. His family was associated with Beneficial, the consumer lending giant, for most of the 20th century. Mr. Caspersen ran the company for 20 years before selling it to Household International in 1998 for $8.6 billion.That year Mr. Caspersen established Knickerbocker, which he named after the men-only Knickerbocker Club, on the Upper East Side, to which he belonged. At that time, Knickerbocker oversaw about $1 billion,  most of which represented the Caspersen fortune.

According to the person familiar with the investigation, federal authorities recently placed liens on the personal trusts of Mr. Caspersen’s four sons, Finn M. W. Caspersen Jr., Erik M. W. Caspersen; Samuel M. W. Caspersen; and Andrew W. W.  Caspersen.Like Mr. Caspersen, his sons are graduates of Harvard Law School, where the Caspersen Room houses rare books, documents and artwork. Last year, Mr. Caspersen pledged $30 million to Harvard Law, the largest single donation in the school’s history.Henry  Christensen III,   a lawyer for Mr. Caspersen’s sons, declined to comment.People who knew Mr. Caspersen characterized him as larger than life. Lawrence E. Bathgate II, a New Jersey lawyer who is a former national Republican Party finance chairman, came to know Mr. Caspersen when Thomas  H. Kean first ran for governor in 1981.  He said the governor’s backers wanted to make a splash when he won but were hampered by restrictions on how much they could raise for inaugural events.Nonetheless, Mr. Caspersen made one black-tie party memorable by arranging for an antique wooden carriage, led by four matched horses, to bring the departing  governor and the incoming governor to the party at the governor’s mansion on a cold winter night in 1982. The footman was in period costume, as was the man who held four reins by the hand.Mr. Caspersen, an accomplished equestrian, was the driver, Mr. Bathgate said.“I was talking to Governor Kean about it a couple of days ago, and we both agreed he was a throwback to a gentlemen of a prior time,” Mr. Bathgate said.

Mr. Caspersen’s health and financial situation apparently weighed on him in recent months.Gerald L. Holm, a longtime friend and business associate, said Mr. Caspersen had mentioned that he was being audited by the I.R.S. but that he had not gone into  details.Mr. Holm said that Mr. Caspersen was “like a second father to me.”He said, “Finn was never the type who was going to give his innermost secrets to anybody.”Others said Mr. Caspersen’s health had worsened in recent months. On Labor Day afternoon, Mr. Caspersen’s despair apparently overtook him, and he shot himself to death on the grounds of the Shelter Harbor Golf Club in Westerly, R.I., the seaside community where he had a summer home, according to the local police. Mr. Caspersen was a founder of the club.Shortly before his death, Mr. Caspersen placed his estate and nearby land in Westerly on the market for  $10.9 million and began to step back from various philanthropic efforts.He unexpectedly resigned from the Dean’s Advisory Council at Harvard Law School  —  he was in the class of 1966  —  and quit as chairman of the board of the Peddie School, the prep school in Hightstown, N.J., from which he graduated in 1959.He also resigned from the town commission in Jupiter Island, Fla., where he lived, and quietly stepped down as the chairman of the Hodson Trust, a foundation  that has awarded $210 million in scholarships and was established by Clarence Hodson, the founder of Beneficial Loan Society, later the Beneficial Corporation. But friends said Mr. Caspersen never spoke of his troubles. His friend William B. Warren was a guest in Mr. Caspersen’s Rhode Island house only days before he took his life. “He was cheerful,” Mr. Warren said.

 Correction: September 18, 2009  
An article on Wednesday about questions surrounding the suicide of Finn M. W. Caspersen, a New Jersey philanthropist who was under investigation for tax evasion, misstated the relationship between Mr. Caspersen and Clarence Hodson, the founder of what became the Beneficial Corporation and the namesake of the Hodson Trust, two organizations that Mr. Caspersen ran for many years. Mr. Caspersen’s grandfather was Mr. Hodson’s secretary, but the families were not related; Mr. Hodson was not Mr. Caspersen’s ancestor.

            Financier Finn Casperson dead in apparent suicide                    
Kim LaCapria



Ex-CEO of Beneficial Corp. Finn H.W. Casperson was found dead in an apparent suicide behind an office building in Westerly, Rhode Island.
Casperson, 67, was discovered dead of what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound on September 7th, after police were asked to “check on” him. Casperson came from a wealthy family and moved with powerful people, and he was known for his political influence, fundraising and philanthropy.
Family members, including his son, Bedminster Township Committeeman Finn M.W. Caspersen Jr., declined to comment on the death of Casperson, Sr. or the circumstances surrounding his demise. In addition to philanthropic ventures, Casperson was an accomplished equestrian, and fellow movers and shakers have commented to press on his legacy:
“Finn was always a gentleman and always made his resources available,” said Rhode Island state Senator Dennis Algiere, who represents the seaside region, just across the state line from Connecticut. “He was a very charitable individual. He donated a lot of time and money to various organizations in our community over the years.”
“I don’t think you could find someone more philanthropic or caring,” said Tucker Johnson, an equestrian and a friend of Caspersen’s, according to a statement on an equestrian Web site.

February 2010: William D. Cohan on the Caspersen Suicide | Vanity FairVanity FairSign InSocietyThe Shot Heard ’Round the ClubsThe mystery of Finn M. W. Caspersen still haunts the high-Wasp enclaves of Florida’s Jupiter Island, the Rhode Island shore town of Westerly, and New Jersey horse country: What led the well-connected, immensely wealthy 67-year-old philanthropist to such a shocking act? The author searches out the shadows in an outwardly impeccable life.by William D. CohanJanuary 2010EmailFacebookTwitterCaspersen at Brown University, his alma mater. By George Simian.It was the shot heard ‘round the world for the Wasp Old Guard of New Jersey horse country, the Rhode Island shore, and Jupiter Island, Florida. On Labor Day morning last year, while the rest of the country was wondering whether to spend the final day of summer lying on the beach or firing up the grill, Finn M. W. Caspersen, the immensely wealthy 67-year-old former chairman and C.E.O. of the Beneficial Corporation, had other things on his mind.He said good-bye to Barbara, his wife of 42 years, around 10 a.m., at their 6,500-square-foot waterfront estate, on three acres on a peninsula in Westerly, Rhode Island. Then he drove his green, four-door 2007 Mercedes the mile or so to the office he shared with Fred Whittemore, a retired Morgan Stanley partner, and Robert McCormack, a former Morgan Stanley colleague of Whittemore’s and a founder of Trident Capital, a venture-capital firm. Caspersen, Whittemore, and McCormack were all wealthy and semi-retired, and they occupied their time with making sure their money was well invested. The Westerly office was more or less their clubhouse. “We used to laugh we had the office in order to have a place for phone calls without having to upset our wives,” Whittemore says. The small gray shingled building was next to the relatively new, $41 million Shelter Harbor Golf Club, which the three men, along with four other founding partners, had conceived and built.Oddly, Caspersen had not the slightest interest in golf and never played. His passions ran instead to the more esoteric sports of Olympic-level horse jumping, four-in-hand horse-drawn-carriage driving, and competitive rowing. (The Princeton National Rowing Association’s Finn M. W. Caspersen Rowing Center is named for him, thanks to his generous donation.) During Caspersen’s 20-year reign as the driving force behind the U.S. Equestrian Team, from 1982 to 2002, American riders and drivers earned 71 medals, including 25 gold, in the Olympics, World Championships, and Pan American Games.Caspersen was also a major contributor to any number of prominent New Jersey politicians, mostly Republicans, including former governors Thomas Kean and Christie Todd Whitman and also Kean’s son Thomas Kean Jr., currently a state senator. In 2000, Caspersen and his wife donated $602,250 to political campaigns, making them the eighth-largest political donors in the U.S. that year, according to Mother Jones magazine. Finn had also opened his considerable checkbook to such institutions as the Peddie prep school (whose wealthy alumni include former U.S. ambassador to the Court of St. James’s Walter Annenberg and Finn himself), Drew University, and Harvard Law School, to which he gave $30 million, making him the single largest donor to the school.He was also an ardent conservationist, and when the opportunity arose to buy some 288 acres of undeveloped land in Westerly from Narragansett Electric, at the turn of the millennium, Caspersen and his partners pounced on it, in order to prevent a developer from building 270 homes there. They paid $2.9 million for the parcel. “We did it in Wall Street fashion,” Whittemore recalls. “We put together an L.L.C. [and] we got the government to pat them [Narragansett Electric] on the fanny to reduce the price by about a million.” Then they signed up around 320 members—who paid between $100,000 and $175,000 each—and donated a conservation easement to the Weekapaug Foundation for Conservation. (Whittemore and McCormack were founders and important financial backers of the foundation, and Caspersen was its chairman until shortly before his death.) Whittemore says the club founders took a $750,000 tax deduction and signed an agreement not to develop homes around the golf course. They also took out a loan of around $5 million from a local bank to add to the money they had raised to build the course, a clubhouse, and other buildings. They hired Michael Hurdzan, of Hurdzan/Fry Environmental Golf Design, to design the course. He is the only golf-course architect in America with a doctorate in plant science. “We did it with an environmental bent,” explains Richard Anthony, who worked for Caspersen to get the club off the ground. The clubhouse opened in July 2004, and the 18-hole course was completed in early 2005.Around 11 a.m. on Labor Day, Whittemore saw Caspersen at their office, where Whittemore was meeting with an architect he had hired to renovate a building. A few days before, Caspersen had sent five or six suits to the cleaners and asked Whittemore to sign a document that made him a trustee of Caspersen’s living will.“He was very cheery in his usual way,” Whittemore says of Caspersen, whom he would often see at his desk, looking at his computer screen. He was “obsessed with all the details he could find out on the computer,” as are so many people, Whittemore remembers. Unbeknownst to Whittemore, Caspersen had brought with him to the office a blued-steel .38-caliber, five-shot Smith & Wesson revolver, which he usually kept in a suitcase in a closet in the master bedroom of his house. Caspersen had an impressive collection of antique guns, but the Smith & Wesson revolver wasn’t one of them.Soon, Whittemore left the office with the architect. By 12:45,  Caspersen had also left, after sending his wife a text message to say he would be coming home after stopping by the reservoir near the golf course, which, he explained, “they are talking about enlarging.” Two or three days earlier Caspersen had asked the golf club’s general manager, Gerard O’Callaghan, for the keys to the lock on the fence surrounding the reservoir. Then, at 1:54, Finn texted his wife, “At reservoir. Love you. Am going home.”Unsettled, Barbara Caspersen noticed that the revolver was missing. She tried her husband’s cell phone, but got no answer. She called 911 and told the police that her husband’s car was at the Post Road office and urged the officers to go there. The police got no answer from Finn’s cell phone either. When they arrived at the office building, they saw his Mercedes parked in the driveway and drew their service weapons. The Mercedes was unlocked, and nothing unusual was inside. By this time, Barbara had arrived at the building and expressed concern “about where [her husband] was and his state of mind,” according to Edward St. Clair, captain in the Westerly Police Department. She explained he was on medication for an increasingly life-threatening array of health problems. (Later, after talking to Dr. Bernard Davidoff, an internist from Morristown, New Jersey, the police established that Caspersen had “suffered from severe depression and was taking antidepressant meds, heart meds, liver meds, kidney meds and diabetes meds.”) They entered the building and checked the office: Caspersen wasn’t there.The canine unit was summoned to see if a scent could be picked up. The officers began to fan out from the office toward the golf course. They figured Caspersen could not have gotten too far on foot, since his various ailments and chemotherapy treatments for cancer had severely hobbled him in recent years. “He couldn’t stand up for very long,” Whittemore says. “He couldn’t walk very far.” When he would have dinner at the shingle-style clubhouse or go there to visit the extensive wine cellar, he would be dropped off at the front entrance rather than walk from the parked car.As the police were making their way to the edge of the golf course by the reservoir, they saw Gerard O’Callaghan motioning to them to come to a small pump house. When O’Callaghan had heard that Caspersen was missing, he remembered about the reservoir-fence key and went looking for him by the water. “We immediately went over and saw Finn Caspersen lying on the ground area next to a large green generator,” Patrolman Christian Fiore recalls in the police report. It was 3:01 p.m.Caspersen was wearing a white checked dress shirt, a blue-and-red vest, gray dress pants with pink-and-blue suspenders, and brown penny loafers with no socks. According to the police report, there was “severe trauma” to the back of his head. His upper torso was lying on rocks and against an aluminum ladder; his left arm, with a closed fist, lay across his chest, and his right arm was extended outward, also with a closed fist.The Smith & Wesson revolver was under his right foot.One shot had been fired, leaving four bullets in the gun. The detectives determined that Caspersen had been sitting on the ground when he shot himself in the head. “On his person,” St. Clair says, the police found his BlackBerry, his driver’s license, and $360 in cash. There was a handwritten note in the pocket of his dress shirt. According to the police, the note said that Caspersen “was tired, diminished and in constant pain, and that he did not want to be a burden to his loving family.”Beneficial Corporation C.O.O.

Back at the office, the police offered Barbara their condolences as well as any services she might need, which she declined. Later that day, at her house, she told police that her husband had been dealing with many medical and personal problems.A member of the Westerly Ambulance Corps pronounced Caspersen dead at 3:23 p.m. His body was taken to the medical examiner’s office at 5:45 p.m. After an autopsy, the cause of death was determined to have been “a gunshot wound to the head and the manner of death was suicide, self-inflicted,” according to St. Clair. But many other mysteries about Caspersen’s death remain decidedly unresolved.One of the secrets that Finn Caspersen kept from his friends was that he was born Jewish. Proudly Norwegian, Caspersen’s father, Olaus Westby Caspersen, emigrated from Risør, Norway, in 1912, and settled in Weehawken, New Jersey. Olaus’s wife, Freda Resika Caspersen, was born in the United States, the daughter of Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe. Together, they had two sons, Finn and John, who became a doctor.Olaus first supported himself and his family by working at a series of odd jobs—in a stable, in a grocery store—then served in the military during World War I and became a naturalized American citizen in 1920.After the war, Olaus went to night school to earn a B.A. from Pace College while working as a stenographer at a company owned by the Rockefellers. In 1920, hoping to set his career on a higher trajectory, he joined the Beneficial Loan Society to work for “Colonel” Clarence Hodson, who had founded the business in Elizabeth, New Jersey, in 1914. The firm made small loans to consumers and growing businesses. (Around 1960 it invented what would become known as the subprime mortgage.)Freda was not religious, but Olaus thought it important for the family to have a religious affiliation, so Finn and his brother were raised Protestant. “Being Protestant was important,” Caspersen once said in an interview in The Promise Fulfilled, a book about Norwegian immigrants to the United States that he helped underwrite. “There was a kind of anti-Catholicism in the family.”By 1929, Hodson and Olaus had formed Beneficial Finance Corporation by consolidating three separate businesses into one. Business boomed. In 1935, Olaus’s salary—published in The New York Times—was $31,950. He would spend 42 years at Beneficial, 18 as president. Along with being a successful businessman, he was a philanthropist. Among other activities, he was on the board of the Peddie School, to which he gave a science building (since replaced by a new one made possible by Walter Annenberg’s $100 million donation, which Finn Caspersen helped to make happen).The Caspersens eventually moved to Andover, New Jersey, and Venice, Florida. Finn went to the Peddie School, then Brown University and Harvard Law School. During this period he met Barbara Warden Morris, an undergraduate at Wellesley College. They were married in 1967.In 1972, Caspersen started in the law department at Beneficial, then moved over to the business side “and climbed up the [corporate] ladder,” he once said. By then Beneficial had grown to 1,772 offices in 49 states and three foreign countries, with total assets of nearly $2 billion. In 1976, he became C.E.O. after the previous one died. “It was a combination of luck and ability,” he said. He was 34 years old.In 1979, Caspersen purchased the 177-acre Harbour Island, in downtown Tampa, Florida, and began to transform it into an upscale residential community. When he broke ground on the project, in 1983, he invited former president Gerald Ford to hit a golf ball across Garrison Channel to downtown Tampa to show potential property owners just how close the island was to the business district. A grateful local newspaper once referred to him as “Prince Caspersen.”In 1998, Caspersen sold Beneficial to Household International for Household stock worth $8.6 billion. The stock deal made Caspersen fabulously wealthy. He and his family walked away with almost $300 million in assets. In addition, Caspersen controlled another $700 million through various trusts that had owned Beneficial stock. To invest and diversify the $1 billion, he formed and devoted himself full-time to Knickerbocker Management—named after the high-Wasp all-male temple the Knickerbocker Club, on Fifth Avenue, of which he was a member.Mourners at Caspersen’s memorial service at Morristown’s St. Peter’s Episcopal Church. By Kevin Coughlin/The Star-Ledger.
Eight days after Caspersen committed suicide and a year to the day after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy and the molten lava of the financial crisis spewed across the globe, some 900 of Caspersen’s friends and relatives filed on a cloudless afternoon into the stately St. Peter’s Episcopal Church, in Morristown, New Jersey, in the heart of the state’s ritzy and underappreciated horse country. (The Caspersens had had homes in the area, in both Andover and Bernardsville. A Bernardsville resident recalled that the house there was “quite a palace.”)By this time, the hyper-efficient Barbara had already cleaned out her husband’s office in Hobe Sound, Florida, across the bridge from their Jupiter Island home. The family had also apparently orchestrated a Finn Caspersen media strategy—to wit, after the initial reverential stories, no one should speak to the press. At the memorial service the four sons (rowers and Harvard Law School grads all)—Finn M. W. junior, Samuel M. W., Erik M. W., and Andrew W. W.—spoke and Tom Kean gave the eulogy. In his 12-minute talk, Kean recalled, “When Finn wanted to help you, he could get other people to come along. He had a wonderful decisive quality, so if he was onto a project or a person, he got other people to come along; he could motivate others, and that’s a wonderful, wonderful quality.”Caspersen with Princess Anne at an International Equestrian Federation meeting in Tampa, mid-1990s. By Nancy Jaffer.
And then, Kean recalled, there was the time he was in London with Caspersen. In the name of all things equestrian, Caspersen urged Kean to “ride with” him to Windsor Castle because “he had some friends out there.” Clearly still quite astonished at the memory, Kean remarked, “Who do I meet in Windsor? Well, his friend Prince Philip and his wife, the Queen of England. And we ended, as you remember, Barbara, going to chapel with the Queen, or the Queen Mother, the next morning. Finn had incredible friends.”Kean could also have mentioned that, in 1982, Caspersen had driven him, his wife, and the Byrnes (Brendan Byrne was the outgoing governor) to an inauguration party in a four-horse carriage. Finn was in full period costume, including black tie and top hat. It was something out of “a Currier & Ives print,” recalls Lawrence Bathgate II, a New Jersey attorney and the Kean inaugural co-chair.Other friends and acquaintances shared memories online, the most revealing of which, perhaps, came from a retired marketing consultant, Charlie Leck, who had known Finn through the horse world and served with him on the board of the New York Coaching Club.“Though Finn was enormously successful in many ways and had achieved great wealth and prominence, he wasn’t a bold and confident character,” wrote Leck. “He was always hesitant in conversation and seemed nervous about engaging with people he didn’t know well. He liked his cocktails a great deal and talking with him became easier as he loosened himself up; however, very few people were ever going to get to know him very deeply. He had built up a strong defense system over the years and he was only going to let you glance at the surfaces of his character.”Barbara Caspersen, following the memorial service for
her husband, on September 15, in Morristown, New Jersey. By Kevin Coughlin/The Star-Ledger.After the memorial service, wearing an elegant black jacket, a double strand of pearls, and gold earrings, Barbara accepted condolences from the many mourners, who had lined up to pay their respects. At one point, she pulled Fred Whittemore aside and pointed to her husband’s ashes, which were in the middle of the church. “That’s the end of the living will,” she said. Whittemore, like nearly everyone else, wondered what had gone so terribly wrong with their friend to cause him to end his life in such a sudden and inexplicable way.In truth, the signs of Caspersen’s deep financial, emotional, and physical troubles had been building for months, if not years. First, there was his deteriorating health. He had “severe” kidney cancer, according to Whittemore, and had to go for regular chemotherapy treatments. Caspersen told him, “I have either 10 months to live or 10 years, and I don’t know which.” Whittemore recalls that the treatments left Caspersen severely weakened. “When he went to a party, he couldn’t stand up,” Whittemore says, “and he would go sit on the sidelines, and someone would come over and talk to him, and we’d all go do that while Barbara worked the room the way active wives do.” The uncertainty about his health led to depression, and he would sometimes nod off in the middle of conversations. “Finn was really sort of horrified about his medical outcome,” Whittemore recalls.Caspersen in groom’s livery, with his four-in-hand rig and competition driver Bill Long, in 1988.

Last summer, Caspersen resigned his position as chairman of the Weekapaug Foundation, and the Caspersens put their Westerly estate and nearby land on the market for $10.9 million. “One of Southern New England’s finest waterfront compounds,” boasted the real-estate literature about the estate. Caspersen also sold his interest in the Westerly office building.Caspersen resigned from the Hodson Trust (created to benefit four Maryland colleges) and as chairman of the board of Peddie. He also left his position as chairman of the Dean’s Advisory Board at Harvard Law School. And there were rumors the Caspersens were selling their big house in New Jersey and moving into a condominium, which is also said to be on the market.Caspersen’s recent withdrawal from Jupiter Island also caught people’s attention. Jupiter Island, a barrier island north of Palm Beach, might be the most exclusive enclave of all. It has one of the highest per capita incomes of any place in the United States. Oil-and-mineral heir Joseph Reed and his socialite wife, Permelia, had bought most of the property on Jupiter Island in 1934 for a song and turned it into what Meryl Gordon, in her 2008 book, Mrs. Astor Regrets, called “an exclusive wasp retreat.” Permelia, a source says, would send a black sweater to a resident she had tired of, with the following note attached: “Perhaps you can use this back North.” Gordon also wrote that Ms. Reed “was famous as a social arbiter and for being shamelessly anti-Semitic.”One of the newer Jupiter Island residents denies there is any remaining overt anti-Semitism on the island, but adds, “If you were Jewish and you cared about being Jewish, why would you ever move up here [from Palm Beach]?”There are only some 450 homes on the island. Among the past and present residents are George H. W. Bush, former publisher and former Mets owner Nelson Doubleday, and Tiger Woods, who paid $44.5 million for a 12-acre site that runs from the Intracoastal Waterway to the Atlantic Ocean. In September 1998, the Caspersens paid $2.5 million for a home on one acre, overlooking the exclusive Jupiter Island Club and with views, farther east, to the Atlantic Ocean. In 2005, Caspersen won a seat on the Jupiter Island Town Commission, and he showed that he cared particularly about limiting development on the island and conservation, and burying phone and cable wires.In March 2009, Caspersen ran unopposed for re-election, but barely five months later he changed his mind. On August 4, the Caspersens sent an e-mail to many of the residents of Jupiter Island informing them that they had decided to put their home and their guesthouse on the market. “We have reached a point in our lives where it makes sense to ‘downsize’ and to lessen our responsibilities for managing and caring for so many properties in so many states,” their message said.That same day, there was a three-and-a-half-hour meeting of the Jupiter Island Town Commission. Caspersen, who participated by phone, spoke up to say that “as some of you may know” he had put his house on the market “for personal reasons” and that he did not feel it was “appropriate” to continue serving on the board, since he was clearly now just a “short-term” resident. “So at the end of this meeting, I will tender my resignation immediately.” He did not elaborate other than to say, “I regret deeply having to do this—but circumstances require it.” His fellow commissioners were stunned, including Anne O’Laughlin Scott, who said, “I am speechless. I am so sorry this is happening.” Caspersen responded, “As am I.”Two days after Caspersen’s death, George Andreassi, a reporter at The Stuart News/Port St. Lucie News, wrote a story quoting Jupiter Island resident Nathaniel Reed (son of Joseph and Permelia) as saying that Caspersen had serious financial problems. “He was not well, and then [experienced] this unbelievable financial situation,” he said. “Obviously the combination must have been of critical importance in his decision. A suicide of a friend is totally devastating. The financial distress of a friend is equally disturbing.” This was a shocking twist to many people. What was Reed talking about? How could a hugely wealthy philanthropist have had financial problems? Reed is “king of the island because his mom built the place, but I didn’t know that Nathaniel and Finn were even close,” says one resident. “That surprised me like hell. One’s the old money without money [Reed] and the other is new money with money.” Or so people had thought.Caspersen and his wife at Shelter Harbor Golf Club in 2007. From The Star-Ledger.
Nowadays, Reed, who is finishing up a book about the island, isn’t talking so much about Caspersen. “Mrs. Caspersen, dear lady, has asked everybody not to be quoted on Finn,” he says. In the days after her husband’s death, she made a beeline for the Knickerbocker building in Hobe Sound to clean out her husband’s office as quickly as she could. Some employees at the office didn’t even know Caspersen had been ill. Caspersen’s office furniture and other effects were put up for sale, and much of the staff was let go. At one point, a visitor noticed that there was a large portrait of Caspersen in his office—“Who goes into their office every day and [has] a portrait of themselves on the wall?” this person wonders—and then was amazed when one of the remaining employees looked at the portrait and said, “I’m still mad at you!” Adds the visitor, “It’s a weird scene over there.”The day after the memorial service, The New York Times weighed in. Citing an unnamed source, reporter Lynnley Browning wrote that Caspersen “was suspected of dodging many millions in federal taxes” and “the authorities, it seemed, were closing in.” She wrote that they “asserted he might have owed as much as $100 million in back taxes and fines or, possibly, even have faced prison” and that the Internal Revenue Service had “learned” that Caspersen “held an account at LGT,” a private bank controlled by Liechtenstein’s royal family. She noted that Liechtenstein had agreed in December 2008 to disclose the names of wealthy Americans with accounts at LGT, “but it was unclear if Mr. Caspersen’s name was among them.”The financial pressure on Caspersen had no doubt ratcheted up exponentially in February 2009, when U.S. federal prosecutors entered into a “deferred prosecution agreement” with UBS, the giant Swiss bank, whereby UBS agreed to pay a $780 million fine. From 2000 to 2007 the bank had “participated in a scheme to defraud the United States” and the I.R.S. by “actively assisting” American clients to create and then conceal offshore accounts. After further negotiations, UBS agreed to turn over to the I.R.S. the names of 4,450 well-heeled Americans who were suspected of using the offshore bank accounts to avoid paying billions of dollars of taxes to the I.R.S. The U.S. government had hoped to get information on more than 50,000 secret Swiss bank accounts, but agreed to the lower number as part of the settlement with UBS.In March, the I.R.S. offered amnesty from criminal prosecution to Americans with offshore accounts who had not properly been paying taxes. To take advantage of the amnesty program, taxpayers had to come forward voluntarily, tell all, and agree to pay back taxes plus interest, plus a penalty (in an effort to encourage tax evaders to “get right” with the I.R.S., Commissioner Doug Shulman said). The I.R.S. coffers are expected to swell by billions of dollars in otherwise uncollected taxes as a result of the UBS deal.The UBS agreement “sent a shock wave around the world,” Shulman later observed. “It has showed we are serious about piercing the veil of bank secrecy.” The original I.R.S. deadline to obtain the amnesty was September 23, 2009, 16 days after Caspersen committed suicide. That date was later extended to October 15.The money-management firm Boxwood Strategic Advisors observed that since Caspersen’s tax basis in Beneficial stock was so low—his father had helped to nurture and grow the business 78 years before it was sold—any sale of the Household stock or HSBC stock that Caspersen received after the acquisition would have been subject to gargantuan capital-gains taxes. It is possible that in order to minimize those, he might have sought offshore tax advice and considered offshore tax havens.Whittemore, for one, says Caspersen was “very aware” of the September 23 amnesty deadline and he made numerous decisions based upon what could be looming problems for him with the government, “some subtle and foolish, some thoughtful.” Whittemore was not surprised that Caspersen would have sought advice about minimizing the taxes that needed to be paid. “I don’t know how he avoided the I.R.S. for so many years and then got in trouble,” Whittemore says. Caspersen’s tax problems “had been under discussion and brewing for some time, I’m told.” Whittemore believes the dispute with the I.R.S. was about “the way he accounted for some of the profits from the sale of the company” and not “one of these tax residency things.” (The I.R.S. will not comment.)Whittemore, who is now helping to plan Morgan Stanley’s 75th-anniversary celebration, which will take place this year, recounted another apparent reversal of fortune Caspersen had experienced in the years after he sold Beneficial. Evidently, he says, Caspersen took several hundred million dollars and gave it to Goldman Sachs’s private-wealth-management group to invest. “He used to tell me Goldman is wonderful for dinners and lunches, but they lost $100 million for him,” Whittemore recalls, adding that Caspersen took the remaining money away from Goldman and gave it to James Allwin, a former Morgan Stanley partner, who had formed Aetos Capital, an independent money-management firm, in 1999. (Goldman Sachs declined to comment on its relationship with Caspersen.) After Caspersen’s death, Whittemore, who owns a little piece of Aetos, inquired whether Caspersen’s family was still an Aetos customer, and he was told it was. “So I just don’t know exactly how bad the situation is,” Whittemore says.Others are wondering as well, but Barbara Caspersen and her four sons are not talking publicly. Records kept by Martin County, Florida, show that on September 25, 2009, the Jupiter Island house was “sold” to Barbara for $100. (Former Lehman Brothers C.E.O. Richard Fuld did a similar thing with his Jupiter Island house—transferring its title to his wife, Kathy, for $100—in November 2008.) A number of her neighbors would not be surprised to see Barbara move full-time to Jupiter Island, if for no other reason than that Florida’s bankruptcy laws protect a residence from being part of a bankruptcy proceeding—meaning that she could keep the house and live in it and creditors could not get hold of it. In 2004, a New Jersey newspaper noted that the Caspersens had “taken up legal residence in tax-friendly Florida.”Were the matter of Caspersen’s alleged unpaid taxes stands with the I.R.S. or the Justice Department is unknown. According to The New York Times, liens have been placed on the trusts of the four Caspersen sons, who together have hired attorney Henry Christensen III—of Astor-family litigation fame—to represent them. (Christensen did not respond to numerous requests to be interviewed.) The question has even been raised by the St. Petersburg Times about whether the I.R.S. might seek to claw back Caspersen’s $30 million gift to Harvard Law School.Those who have depended on Caspersen’s largesse in the past, such as Baird Tipson, the president of Washington College, in Chestertown, Maryland—one of the four colleges that are annual beneficiaries of the Hodson Trust—feel distraught over his death. Tipson was moved to post a eulogy of sorts on Washington College’s Facebook page. “Everywhere I look, I see buildings that could not have been built, students who could not have studied here, and programs that could not have flourished without Finn Caspersen’s help,” Tipson wrote.He too remains at a loss to explain the unexpected turn Caspersen’s life took. Was it his health problems, his financial problems, or a combination of them both, plus other things? “Anyone reading about the difficulties with the I.R.S. would have to assume that that had something to do with his decision,” he says. “But my guess is that most of us are more complicated than that. You mentioned the cancer—there may be other things we don’t know about that kind of preyed on him, and I think when people get into a state where they’re willing to do something like that it’s not necessarily rational. He may have just felt like: everything is piling up on me and there’s no way out. But how can anyone know?”ShareEmailFacebookTwitterYOU MIGHT LIKE“I Want to F*cking Kill All the Leakers”: Scaramucci Explodes in Unhinged Late-Night RantVanity FairWhy the Scariest Nuclear Threat May Be Coming from Inside the White HouseVanity FairMichiko Kakutani, the Legendary Book Critic and the Most Feared Woman in Publishing, Is Stepping Down from The New York TimesVanity FairThe Military Is Officially Ignoring Trump’s Transgender OrderVanity FairScaramucci-Priebus Blood Feud Explodes in CNN MeltdownVanity FairLetter to a MAGA Nation: It’s Time to Let Go of Donald TrumpVanity FairAround the WebPowered by ZergnetRELATEDSEEK“I Want to F*cking Kill All the Leakers”: Scaramucci Explodes in Unhinged Late-Night RantBY BESS LEVINWhy the Scariest Nuclear Threat May Be Coming from Inside the White HouseBY MICHAEL LEWISSEEK

Andrew Caspersen violated a circle of trust that included colleagues, a Princeton classmate and even his wealthy family when he raised tens of millions of dollars for what authorities have called a fraudulent investment scheme that has rattled Wall Street.Among the victims to emerge from Mr. Caspersen’s alleged scheme are members of his own family, who invested more than $3 million, according to a person with direct knowledge of the events who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Another was a college classmate, James McIntyre, an executive at the hedge fund Moore Capital, who personally invested $400,000. Mr. McIntyre then recommended that a charitable trust affiliated with Moore Capital put in $25 million of its money.A former Blackstone Group managing director, Mr. Caspersen was well respected on Wall Street. He came from a world of privilege, attending Groton, Princeton and then Harvard Law School — credentials that allowed him to move easily within the world of high finance.

Mr. Caspersen’s charmed life was thrown into turmoil on the afternoon of March 26, when he, his wife, their two young children and his in-laws were returning from a vacation in Florida. Continue reading the main story

Waiting for Mr. Caspersen, 39, at La Guardia Airport were federal agents with an arrest warrant.Federal prosecutors in Manhattan charged him in a criminal complaint with securities and wire fraud in what they called a “brazen” scheme to defraud investors of up to $95 million.Mr. Caspersen’s circle extended beyond the corridors of Wall Street. Even Kimba M. Wood, the federal judge initially assigned to a related civil fraud lawsuit filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission against Mr. Caspersen, has had to recuse herself from the litigation because of unspecified family connections to the former Wall Street executive.

Events began to spiral out of control for Mr. Caspersen months before his arrest in a case that has now thrust his family, friends and acquaintances into the spotlight unwittingly.Federal prosecutors contend in a criminal complaint that Mr. Caspersen blew more than half of the $25 million that he took in from the Moore Charitable Foundation — founded by the billionaire Louis M. Bacon to promote conservation — on losing options in a personal brokerage account.But the authorities also said that in November, Mr. Caspersen used some of the money to cover his tracks after making separate unauthorized wire transfers of $8.1 million and $770,000.Mr. Caspersen worked as a partner at Park Hill Group, a division of PJT Partners, until he was fired last week. It was there that he was said to be able to exploit a client billing system that allowed him to siphon money into his own personal account.These transfers represent fees paid by two clients of Park Hill that Mr. Caspersen had diverted to a bank account that he controlled instead of having that money sent to Park Hill, said a person with direct knowledge of the situation. The invoices that the clients received had indicated that the money was being directed to what appeared to be a bank account held by Park Hill.

Mr. Caspersen, however, had taken advantage of the firm’s payment process that allowed him to personally send out invoices to clients, said the person with direct knowledge of the situation.The Park Hill clients were unaware of what Mr. Caspersen did and his employers learned of the improper wire transfers only about a week before his arrest because they appeared legitimate.No client money went missing and it was not clear what Mr. Caspersen may have done with the money that was misdirected to the bank accounts he controlled. 



                Document            

                Fraud Charges for Financial Executive            

                The S.E.C. said that Andrew Caspersen, a partner at Park Hill, solicited $95 million to invest in a shell company.            








                    OPEN Document                




It could not be determined when Mr. Caspersen sent the invoices to his clients.Park Hill is now reviewing its procedures that allow some executives to send invoices directly to clients, said the person with direct knowledge of the situation. The person added that Mr. Caspersen took advantage of the firm’s policies that were intended to foster a close relationship between clients and the executives working on their business matters.Park Hill, which said last week that it was “stunned” to discover the charges, is cooperating with the authorities. The firm held off on terminating Mr. Caspersen until he was arrested, at request of the authorities.Much remains unknown about Mr. Caspersen’s possible motivation and the details of his scheme, which the authorities said began in July, when he incorporated an investment vehicle called Irving Place III SPV L.L.C. in Delaware.The Irving Place investment vehicle had a name similar to a legitimate investment vehicle that Park Hill and Mr. Caspersen had raised several hundreds of millions dollars for last year — a confusing situation that he exploited when approaching friends and family for money.The unauthorized wire transfers suggest that Mr. Caspersen had incurred money woes, even though his family’s wealth was considerable and both he and his wife had well-paying jobs.

Last year, Mr. Caspersen earned a $3.68 million salary from Park Hill. His wife, Christina, also a Princeton graduate, is an investor relations representative for Anheuser-Busch InBev. Earlier this year, she went on an extended leave of absence from the brewing behemoth, before her husband’s arrest.The couple bought a multimillion-dollar home in Bronxville, N.Y., in 2015, not far from his in-laws’ home. They also own a co-op apartment in Manhattan.A review of court documents does not reveal any outstanding judgments or liens against Mr. Caspersen or his known assets.














A child of privilege, Mr. Caspersen was a beneficiary of family trusts and businesses that his father, Finn M. W. Caspersen, a noted financier and philanthropist, left behind.The elder Mr. Caspersen was chairman and chief executive of Beneficial Corporation, a consumer finance company, for nearly two decades before selling it for $8.6 billion to Household International.Mr. Caspersen’s father killed himself in 2009 at the age of 67; he was at the time suffering from kidney cancer. A year before his death, he pledged $30 million to Harvard Law School, which later named its student center in the family’s honor. Mr. Caspersen and all four of his sons, including Andrew, also graduated from Harvard Law.Soon after Mr. Caspersen’s death, The New York Times and other news organizations reported that his name had surfaced in connection with a federal investigation into the misuse of offshore bank accounts to avoid taxes. The Internal Revenue Service began an audit of some of offshore accounts tied to his name.But neither Mr. Caspersen nor any of his family members were charged by federal authorities with wrongdoing. Last year, a tax lawyer retained by the Caspersen family conducted a review of the I.R.S. audit and said in a letter, which was reviewed by The Times, that the investigation was completed in 2013 and did not impose any penalties for failing to report holdings in a foreign bank account.

A representative for the Caspersen family provided a copy of the letter to dispel any impression that the elder Caspersen had killed himself under a cloud of suspicion.The letter said the I.R.S. reviewed tax filings by Mr. Caspersen and his wife, Barbara, for a five-year period beginning in 2005. The only blemish tax officials found was an underpayment of taxes in 2008 for which the I.R.S. assessed a penalty of nearly $14,000 that was paid by Mr. Caspersen’s estate.Like their father, all of Mr. Caspersen’s sons, including Andrew, the youngest, pursued careers in finance. Finn Jr. is the chief operating officer and general counsel of Peapack-Gladstone Bank in New Jersey and Erik Caspersen is a former executive with Polygon Investment Partners. Sam, a former Sullivan & Cromwell lawyer, is now a managing director of Brock Capital Group, a boutique investment bank.
