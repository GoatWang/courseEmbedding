JAKE DANNA STEVENS / STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER  Joseph F. Saporito Jr. is sworn in during his formal investiture ceremony as a U.S. magistrate judge for the Middle District of Pennsylvania on Thursday in the William J. Nealon Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse in Scranton.






	Near the conclusion of the ceremony that made him the Middle District of Pennsylvania’s newest U.S. magistrate judge, Joseph F. Saporito Jr. recalled the best advice he ever received from his father and mentor, the late attorney Joseph Saporito Sr.

	It passed from father to son when Judge Saporito became a lawyer almost 30 years ago, and the judge called it appropriate not only for the position he now holds but also in life.

	“It consists of five simple words that sum up the code of conduct for judges: Just do the right thing. I promise you that is just what I intend to do. ... I don’t know if Lou Gehrig said it first but I know he said it best when he said, ‘Today I feel like the luckiest man on the face of the Earth,’ ” Judge Saporito said.

	More than 100 people, including active and senior members of the U.S. District Court bench, watched in an ornate courtroom at the William J. Nealon Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse on Thursday as Judge Saporito received his judicial oath during a formal investiture. The ceremony was streamed to dozens more in a second courtroom across the hall.

	The crowd rose in a standing ovation after Chief Judge Christopher C. Conner performed the swearing-in. Judge Saporito’s wife, Giovanna, and children Sarah and Joseph III then helped him don his black robe.

	Judge Saporito, a Jenkins Twp. resident who practiced law for 29 years before a panel of district judges chose him for the position in November, replaces retired U.S. Magistrate Judge Thomas M. Blewitt. He officially started Feb. 12 and serves on the bench at the federal courthouse on South Main Street in Wilkes-Barre.

	Attorney Samuel A. Falcone Jr., the judge’s brother-in-law and former partner of 22 years at the Saporito, Saporito & Falcone law firm in Pittston, joined Judge Saporito’s children and brother, Carlo, in making remarks at the ceremony.

	He described the new judge as an even-tempered, well-respected, passionate student of the law for whom no case was too big or too small.

	“As a judge, he will never, ever forget what it’s like to practice, and I’m sure that over time he will earn a reputation as a fair, hardworking judge who will always ensure, if not guarantee, a level playing field,” Mr. Falcone said.

	Noting the large number of his family members and friends in attendance, Judge Saporito joked if he were a newspaper writer covering the ceremony, the headline on the story would read, “Greater Pittston invades Scranton.”

	He said the Middle District court has always been led by men and women with an impeccable reputation for fairness and pledged to do everything he can to fulfill the court’s vote of confidence in him.

	“I will do my absolute best to dispense justice in the exemplary traditions of this court in a fair, balanced and just manner,” he said.

other and enhance this tribute for future generations.

                



Candle will be lit for the limited time of one month
