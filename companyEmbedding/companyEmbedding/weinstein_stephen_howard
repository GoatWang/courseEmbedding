Risks to achieving Target Price / Valuation: QTS Realty Trust – QTS Balancing investments across C1-C3 spectrum. With peers such as Dupont-Fabros more specialized in C1 wholesale leasing and Equinix and CoreSite largely concentrating on network-dense colocation, the QTS strategy spans both segments while also layering managed services.””
