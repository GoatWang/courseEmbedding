                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Canadian Capital Auto Receivables Asset Trust III

Feb 01, 2013, 08:04 ET
		  		  															
						 from   RBC 











 
















































 

 




















 



TORONTO, Feb. 1, 2013 /CNW/ - The purchase by Royal Bank of Canada
 ("RBC") of Ally Financial Inc.'s ("AFI") Canadian auto finance
 business, including Ally Credit Canada Limited ("ACCL") was completed
 today. Attached is a press release issued by RBC providing additional details regarding the completed
 transaction.


In connection with the purchase transaction, RBC has advised Canadian
 Capital Auto Receivables Asset Trust III ("CCARAT III") that it will be
 carrying out a number of corporate reorganizations. As a result,
 effective as of today, RBC has assumed the obligations of ACCL as
 seller and servicer of all securitized receivables in which CCARAT III
 currently has an interest, and as financial services agent of CCARAT
 III. AFI's obligations under the performance guarantee it previously
 provided in connection with the outstanding securitization transaction
 will continue to apply to RBC's obligations as seller and servicer.


The rating agencies that rate the notes issued by CCARAT III have
 confirmed that the assumption of ACCL's obligations as seller, servicer
 and financial services agent by RBC will not result in a downgrade or
 withdrawal of any of their ratings.
