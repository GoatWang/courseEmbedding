Foresters enters Canadian asset management business

by
            
                

Andrew Rickard


            
            March 2, 2016  01:37 p.m.
        



Foresters Life Insurance Company has entered into an agreement to purchase Aegon Capital Management (ACM) and Aegon Fund Management (AFM) from Proj Fox Acquisitions Inc., an intermediate holding company established for the July 2015 acquisition of Transamerica Life Canada (now ivari) and its Canadian affiliates.
The deal was announced on March 4, and pending regulatory approval the transaction is expected to close in May 2016. As a result of the purchase, Foresters will acquire approximately CAD $10 billion in Canadian fixed income and equity assets bringing its total amount of funds under management to CAD $44 billion. ACM will continue to manage ivari's corporate assets.
"The strategic acquisition of Aegon Capital Management will enable us to enter the Canadian asset management market," says Forester’s president and CEO Tony Garcia. "We also see strong synergies between our Canadian life and annuity products and services and AFM's product offerings in the retail space through their imaxx mutual funds™. On the institutional side of the business, we see substantial growth opportunities for us, given ACM's solid track record in this space."
Foresters did not disclose how much it paid for the two businesses.

Foresters Asset Management Overview
Foresters Asset Management Group is an experienced and trusted global asset management organization, ranked as the 28th largest asset manager worldwide, managing assets in excess of US $500 billion and employing 1,300 investment-related professionals, as at December 31, 2009. In Canada, Foresters Asset Management Inc. manages over $7.4 billion CAD, as at June 30, 2011, for both institutional and retail clients.  We work in partnership with our affiliated companies, Transamerica Life Canada and Foresters Financial Investment Management Company of Canada Inc.
Invest in Good Company
Foresters Asset Management manages both Canadian fixed-income and equity portfolios. The portfolio management team employs a prudent and disciplined approach to managing assets, with the aim of providing stable investment returns, through the forensic analysis of securities.
Competitive Advantage
Foresters Asset Management focuses on four elements in managing portfolios to meet clients’ goals: People, Process, Portfolios, and Performance. We believe that with this focus, the client’s needs are at the forefront and guide all investment actions.
People
The key to success at Foresters Asset Management are the people who make up our investment team. The investment world is highly competitive and the strength and size of the investment talent available to us is crucial to our success, as a company. This is exemplified as we adopt a team approach to research and analysis in both fixed income and equity and encourage the development of talent from within. At any given time, investment team members are at different experience levels and have experience in different areas of investment management. This results in an investment team which is both well-rounded and experienced.
Process
Foresters Asset Management’s key strength is security selection. Rigorous internal research and modeling ensures that each investment decision is supported by objective information. It also allows the team to understand, define and analyze the risk of every security selected. Therefore, risk is controlled at the security level. This, in turn, helps provide clients with incremental returns and low volatility. Our disciplined process has remained consistent and has been tried and tested through both good and challenging times.
Portfolio
Foresters Asset Management’s original mandate was to manage the asset and liabilities of its affiliate, Transamerica Life Canada. This approach has been adopted for our other client portfolios. Each portfolio is considered within the context of its own unique mandate and the needs of its clients and all decision making is dictated by these needs. Careful planning of portfolio construction and oversight are coupled with ongoing corporate governance to ensure stability and maintain compliance within the portfolios. Foresters Asset Management takes its role and responsibilities as a Portfolio Manger very seriously, to earn and sustain the trust of our clients and to be as transparent as possible.
Performance
Foresters Asset Management’s investment process is designed to deliver consistent incremental and repeatable performance across both asset classes and investment disciplines. This is achieved through Foresters Asset Management’s forensic analysis of companies, which minimises risk and enhances returns for our investors, over the long term.

Equity Strategy Composites
Fiduciary’s objective is to buy durable businesses at value prices in order to achieve superior investment results over a three- to five-year time horizon. The essential tenets to our investment philosophy are:

We utilize a business owner’s approach to investing and thoroughly investigate the economics of the business and the qualities of management of each company.
Our approach is contrarian in nature as we invest in companies that have stumbled or are temporarily out of favor with the market, and hence improperly priced.
Our goal is to invest in durable business franchises that are selling at a discount to their intrinsic value.
We believe our investment process of purchasing good companies at low valuations will achieve superior risk-adjusted returns over a three- to five-year time horizon.

   Toronto-based life insurer The Independent Order of Foresters has completed its acquisition of Aegon Capital Management Inc. (ACM) and Aegon Fund Management Inc. (AFM), solidifying Foresters' expansion into asset management, the company announced on Thursday.  Under the terms of the acquisition, which was announced in March, Foresters has acquired 100% of the shares of both Aegon companies from Proj Fox Acquisition Inc., an intermediate holding company owned by Bermuda-based life reinsurance company Wilton Re Ltd.  Effective Thursday, ACM, which oversees more than $10 billion in institutional investments, will become Foresters Asset Management Inc. AFM, which offers six mutual funds to Canadian investors under the imaxxFunds banner, will become Foresters Financial Investment Management Co. of Canada Inc.  The names of the imaxxFunds have not changed as a result of the acquisition.  "This is an exciting time for Foresters Financial and an important move to strengthen not only our Canadian product offerings but also the overall growth of our investment business," said Bill Lipkus, president and CEO of Foresters Financial Holding Co. Inc., in a statement.  Under the terms of the transaction, Foresters is also taking on the responsibility of managing the investments backing the segregated products, general account and corporate assets of ivari (previously Transamerica Life Canada), which were previously managed by ACM.  In a statement, ivari said the sale does not impact investment options within ivari universal life products or segregated funds, and no changes to mandates or managers are expected at this time.  As of Dec. 31, 2015, the entities included in the transaction had funds under management totalling approximately $44 billion. Foresters said the ownership transition would continue over the next six months.  Photo copyright: Bloomberg
