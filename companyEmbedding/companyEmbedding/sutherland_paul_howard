 Educational Background



MBA 


Lake Superior State University

                  Lake Superior State University is a small public university in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. It is Michigan's smallest public university with an enrollment around 3,000 students. Due to its proximity to the border, notably the twin city of Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, LSSU has many Canadian students and maintains a close relationship with its international neighbor. In a sign of its unique situation, LSSU has both the Canadian and United States flags on its campus, and both Canadian and American national anthems are sung at athletic events.

LSSU is known for its academic programs such as fisheries and wildlife management, engineering, chemistry and the environmental sciences, teacher education, nursing, geology, business management, fire science, and criminal justice. It is one of the two universities in Michigan that offers an environmental health accredited curriculum (EHAC), alongside Central Michigan University. In addition, students attend for LSSU's degrees in English and creative writing, forensic sciences, recreation management, and legal studies.

Financial & Investment Management Group Ltd.


                  Financial & Investment Management Group's (FIM Group) strategies are based on the premise that an investment's price is more volatile than its underlying, real fundamental value. The firm believes that returns, over time, can be increased and risks reduced by avoiding investments which are over-priced and favoring investments that are under-priced. Investment strategies may include long-term and short-term purchases depending on the client's individual needs. Asset allocation is a favored strategy and investments may include long and short-term investment, money market funds, mutual funds, stocks,bonds or other investment vehicles.FIM Group's employs an active, quantitative investment selection process. The firm believes that fixed income investments have a high degree of risk-adjusted quantifiable predictability. FIM Group seeks to identify and compare each income investment's expected return over time. Their goal is to add value by actively managing fixed income investments for total returns from interest, dividends and capital gains and by having such managed portfolios contain the firm's top risk-adjusted selections at all times.
