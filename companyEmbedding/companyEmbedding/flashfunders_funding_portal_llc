Cost and complexity are out of control

What is FlashFunders?
FlashFunders connects global investors with groundbreaking companies raising capital through its equity crowdfunding platform, enabling everyone to own a piece of a company they believe in for as little as $50. Offering investment options for the crowd, international and accredited consumers, FlashFunders provides investors access to a whole new asset class and the opportunity to empower innovation.  FlashFunders is comprised of entities specifically created to assist you in making your offering both successful and compliant.  FinTech Clearing, LLC, member FINRA/SIPC, is a registered broker dealer that facilitates Reg D and Reg A+ offerings and offering deposit accounts.  FlashFunders Funding Portal, member FINRA, is a registered funding portal that facilitates Reg CF offerings.  FlashFunders Shareholder Services, LLC is an SEC registered Transfer Agent that allows investor holdings to be recorded and transferred electronically.  FlashFunders, Inc. is a technology company focused on making the online interaction between companies and investors intuitive and efficient.  This unique combination of expertise, regulatory registrations and technological know-how empowers FlashFunders to offer tools that connect companies and investors in entirely new ways.  *FlashFunders, Inc. does not actually participate in securities offerings or activities
How is FlashFunders different from traditional crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter and Indiegogo?
On FlashFunders, consumers purchase securities (including but not limited to equity, debt, and revenue participation notes) in privately held companies.  Crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter and Indiegogo allow people to donate money to campaigns in exchange for rewards. Once the backer receives the reward, the transaction is finished. The backer does not share in the company's potential upside success and the company does not give up any portion of equity ownership to the crowd.  On FlashFunders, investors purchase securities in private companies. They do not receive rewards, they receive stock or another type of investment in private companies. If the company becomes successful, shareholders have the potential to receive a return on their initial investment.
What are the risks and rewards of investing in early-stage companies?
When you make an investment in an early-stage venture involving equity, you own a piece of that company until it makes an 'exit'. Getting purchased by another company, selling shares on a public stock market (known as an initial public offering, or IPO), or bankruptcy are common exit scenarios.  That makes company investing one of the most potentially rewarding, and most risky, ways to invest your money. Some companies grow to become icons of an era, like Google, Facebook, or Apple. But for every superstar, there are numerous respectable but quiet exits, and many failures.  That's why due diligence is so important. Investors need to be as well-educated and confident in their decisions as possible. Losing some or all of your investment is a very real possibility.
How much may I legally invest on FlashFunders?
FlashFunders follows SEC rules in determining how much investors can invest in each offering.  The SEC defines people who make over $200,000, or have a net worth over $1 million, as accredited investors. Accredited investors do not have investment limits if they participate in a Reg D or Reg A+ offering. For Reg A+ offerings (Tier II), unaccredited investors may invest up to 10% of the greater of their net worth or their annual income per offering.  For Reg CF offerings, the SEC limits how much investors may invest in private companies in a given year. Reg CF investors may invest the greater of $2,000, or 5% of the lesser of their annual income or net worth, if the investor's net worth or annual income is less than $100,000. A Reg CF investor may invest 10% of the lesser of their annual income or net worth if both their annual income and net worth are equal to or more than $100,000. There is a $100,000 aggregate investment limit across all issuers.
Why is there a difference between Reg A+, Reg CF and Reg D investors?
The SEC has only recently allowed crowd investors to get access to private investments thanks to Reg A+ and Reg CF of the 2012 JOBS Act, which also allowed companies to solicit accredited investors publicly through changes to Reg D.  Before the Jumpstart Our Business companies (JOBS) Act of 2012, private companies who wanted to raise capital had to solicit investments via private channels. The JOBS Act quickly allowed privately held companies to solicit investments on public platforms like the internet.  But only accredited investors had access to those investments until the SEC formalized rules for a portions of the law called Title III (Reg CF) and Title IV (Reg A+). Title III & TItle IV allow people of any income to invest in companies.
What rights do investors get on FlashFunders?
All companies fundraising on FlashFunders set their own investment terms according to their offering.  All investors receive securities (including but not limited to equity, debt, and revenue participation notes) on FlashFunders, and all investors have the same access to opportunities as institutional investors. Larger shareholders may receive certain preferential rights such as pro rata rights, voting rights, conversion rights, a liquidation preference over common stock, and direct access to company founders. Shareholders investing lesser amounts still receive securities at the same price as large investors, but their investment rights may be limited given the smaller size of their investment.

Who can invest?
FinTech Clearing, LLC is a FINRA-registered broker dealer and FlashFunders Funding Portal is a FINRA-registered funding portal with the ability to facilitate investments from any individual over the age of 18 in the U.S., and from international investors.  There are four regulatory exemptions investors invest through. Investors who invest via Regulation CF invest through our funding portal. Investors who invest via Regulation D, Regulation A+, and Regulation S (if they reside internationally) invest through our broker dealer.
What is the difference between Reg A+, Reg CF and Reg D investors?
Anyone can purchase securities (including but not limited to equity, debt, and revenue participation notes) in private companies on FlashFunders. Investors in the U.S. fall under three categories, with different investment limits and requirements for reporting to comply with SEC rules. Reg CF Investors will conduct transactions through FlashFunders Funding Portal; Reg A+ & Reg D investors will conduct transactions through FinTech Clearing, LLC.  Reg A+ & Reg CF investors can invest as little as $50, and up to any amount according to their individual limits. All investors may invest smaller amounts under Reg A+ and Reg CF, but if they want to invest above their stated limits, they will have to verify their accreditation through the platform and participate in a Reg D investment.  Reg A+, Reg CF and Reg D investors purchase securities of a company at the same price, but there are differences in their investment limits, rights as stockholders, and how they are categorized by the SEC.
Is there a minimum platform investment?
FlashFunders accepts any investment $50 and above through Reg A+ and Reg CF offerings.  However, a company may set a minimum investment higher if it chooses. Only accredited investors may invest in Reg D offerings, which may have different minimums – please review the offering documents specific to a given listing for more detail. [International investors are responsible for all banking and wire fees associated with transferring funds into the offering deposit account and/or escrow.]
Why are the investors called Reg A+, Reg CF and Reg D?
Reg A+ refers to Title IV (Regulation A+) and Reg CF refers to Title III (Regulation Crowdfunding) of the 2012 JOBS Act, which both allow the general public to invest in private companies for the first time starting May 16, 2016. Reg D refers to Title II (506c) of the 2012 JOBS Act, which allows companies to sell private stock to investors who verify their accreditation status.
Why are there investor limits?
Because Reg A+ and Reg CF allow early stage investing by non-accredited investors, the SEC put limits in place to protect the general public from investing more than they can afford to lose in early stage companies, due to the high risk and long horizon of the investment type.
Can I invest in more than one company under Reg CF?
You may invest in multiple companies on FlashFunders as long as your total amount of investments does not exceed your annual investment limit.
Does FlashFunders charge fees to investors?
FlashFunders does not charge any fees to investors; however, fees such as success, processing and service fees are assessed to issuers, which impacts the total proceeds available for use as described in the offering materials.
Are investments from entities accepted on the platform?
Only investors investing in Reg D and Reg A+ offerings are eligible to invest as an entities on the platform. Investors making investments in Reg CF offerings must be individuals.



Benefits and Risks


What are the benefits of investing in private companies?


What are the risks of early-stage investing?


What are the risks of investing in notes & debt securities (including Convertible Notes & Revenue Participation Notes)?


What are the risks of investing in equity securities (Preferred Stock & Common Stock)?





What are the benefits of investing in private companies?
There are more high value companies staying private longer. Traditionally, only angel investors and venture capitalists had access to invest in these private companies, but now they're publicly available on FlashFunders.  It's not just about a potential financial return on investment. It's about becoming part of a company that may change the world. Think about all the companies that have fundamentally changed our culture. Early stage venture capital investing means investing in ideas, entrepreneurs, and innovation. It means changing the way the world works, influencing people's lives, and becoming an inextricable part of that story.  On FlashFunders, anyone can have access to those opportunities on an open, transparent online market.  Without early-stage investing, the world would be a very different place. Great ideas need you.
What are the risks of early-stage investing?
In investing, the greater risks can yield the greatest gains, but investors should be aware than they can lose some or all of their investments. Less than 10% of companies make it to a subsequent round of funding.  We're an open marketplace, and we believe that companies from anywhere in the world and from any sector, deserve an opportunity to be on our platform. Although FinTech Clearing and/or FlashFunders Funding Portal conduct a limited proprietary review of all offerings, your due diligence is vital. Investors should be familiar with and willing to accept the high risk associated with private investments.                     Private Stock with No Public Market: Private stocks are securities with no public market for resale. The investments are private and illiquid, so you can't convert them to cash easily. You should be willing to hold that investment indefinitely.  Need to Do Due Diligence: Any securities offered on FlashFunders are offered directly by the companies themselves, and those companies are solely responsible for the contents of any materials made available to prospective investors on the FlashFunders website. FlashFunders only reviews a company's self-verifications that it is free of “bad actors.” FlashFunders also conducts corporate status checks using public databases, verifies the identities of key founders, and conducts anti-money laundering compliance checks.  Investors are responsible for conducting research on a potential investment, including understanding the company's exit strategy. An exit strategy is how a company intends to “cash out” their shareholders' investments. However, there is no guarantee of when or whether that exit strategy will happen.  Difficulty in Valuing Private Companies: It's incredibly difficult to value early-stage companies. They're just starting out, so the company's value generally can't be based on its assets, book value, or historical results of operations. You shouldn't consider the offering's valuation or share price a formal indication of the company's worth. Use your judgment to decide the worth of the shares you buy.  Risk of Total Loss: Many companies fail - that's why due diligence is so important. It's up to you to judge if an early-stage company has the potential to succeed. FlashFunders does not recommend or endorse any of the materials that companies post on the FlashFunders website, and does not conduct diligence on the business plan, disclosures, risks, prospects, or other investment considerations of any company. You may lose some or all of your investment, and you need to be in a financial position to be able to bear that loss.
What are the risks of investing in notes & debt securities (including Convertible Notes & Revenue Participation Notes)?
 Investing in private companies through any type of 'note' includes the risk of total loss and is extremely speculative. Since notes are debt securities, there is an obligation by the company to pay back principal and interest to the investor. However, if the company encounters financial difficulties, there could be missed payments or total loss of the investment to the investor. Revenue Participation Notes (RPNs) are a specific form of Note that bear an annual interest rate but also have an added feature of revenue participation whereby the investor can receive a percentage of sales if the amount is greater than the annual interest rate. RPNs allow investors to have upside benefits in a situation where a company has significant revenue growth. However, as is the case with many early stage businesses, revenue forecasts may not be met and investors in RPNs may not reap the benefits of any revenue participation. The expectation of revenue participation in an RPN is highly speculative and is not guaranteed. Notes typically have maturity dates which means that investors may no longer hold the security past a specified date if the company has performed all obligations specified in the note. If a company is liquidated, noteholders would receive their capital back prior to any equity investors (preferred or common shareholders). However, investors may, depending on the company's financial circumstances, be returned some, all or none of their invested capital and/or accrued interest. 
What are the risks of investing in equity securities (Preferred Stock & Common Stock)?
 Investing in private companies through any type of 'stock' or equity security includes the risk of total loss and is extremely speculative. When an investor makes an equity investment in a private company, an investor has the opportunity to share in the benefits of a company's potential business success. However, there is no guarantee or obligation by the company to provide any returns, cash flows or dividends to the investor unless otherwise specified. Equity investors may lose their entire investment or may not have a chance for a return for many years. Some equity investments take over a decade to see any returns. If a company is liquidated, equity investors typically only receive their capital after all noteholders are paid their capital first, with preferred shareholders then receiving priority over common shareholders. However, investors may, depending on the company's financial circumstances, be returned some, all or none of their invested capital.   *Investors should always review the disclosures and risks specific to a given offering and its securities structure, which can be found in a company's offering materials.

How do I find a company?
Log in to the FlashFunders portal and go to the "Browse Companies" page. On this page, you can browse a variety of companies.
What do I need for the investment process?
When you open an account on FlashFunders, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth and other information that will allow FinTech Clearing and/or FlashFunders Funding Portal to verify your identity. We may also ask to see your driver's license or other identifying documents. Federal law requires financial institutions such as broker dealers and funding portals to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each person who opens an account.  Reg A+ investors must self-certify that their investment amount per offering falls within the investment limits required by SEC rules, i.e. 10% of the greater of net worth or annual income.  Reg CF investors will be asked to report income or net worth, and any company investments made in the past year. FlashFunders will automatically calculate your annual investment limit.  Reg D investors must verify their income or net worth in one of two ways. The easier way is to provide the contact information for an accountant, lawyer, or financial advisor, who completes a simple electronic form confirming that you qualify. Or, you can upload documents, such as financial statements or tax returns, and FinTech Clearing may do a soft pull of your credit report to verify your net worth.
How is ownership percentage calculated?
Ownership percentage is calculated on a fully-diluted basis assuming the maximum number of securities are sold.
How do I increase my investment in a specific company?
The easiest way to increase your investment is by canceling your original investment in your dashboard and then reinvesting at the higher amount on the offering page.
If I change my mind, can I cancel my investment and receive a refund?
Yes. For Reg CF offerings, an investor may cancel an investment for any reason until 48 hours prior to the deadline identified in the issuer's offering materials. Once the round is within 48 hours of ending, you will not be able to cancel for any reason. After an investment is cancelled, you will receive a full refund of your investment
How long does it take for me to receive my refund?
If you sent your investment via wire transfer, you will receive your investment refund within 1-3 business days. If you sent your investment via ACH transfer or check, you will receive your refund in the form of an ACH transfer or check within 5-7 business days.
How do I know when my transaction is complete?
FlashFunders will notify investors when the target offering amount has been met.  If a company reaches the target offering amount in a Reg CF offering prior to the deadline identified in its offering materials, it may close the offering early if it provides notice about the new offering deadline. This must be at least five business days prior to such new offering deadline (absent a material change that would require an extension of the offering and reconfirmation of the investment commitment).  If an investor does not cancel an investment commitment in a Reg CF offering before the 48-hour period prior to the offering deadline, the funds will be released to the company upon closing of the offering and the investor will receive securities in exchange for his or her investment.
What is a successful close?
A successful close is when the company has reached either its target raise amount or its maximum raise amount.
What happens if an offering fails to close?
All investment funds are transferred into an offering deposit account and/or escrow account until closing. If a company does not close, all investments will be refunded from these accounts and back to the investors.

Can investors invest in the same company again?


How is communication managed?


Does FlashFunders issue stock certificates to investors?


What happens to my share of ownership if the company issues new shares in future financing rounds?


What happens if a business fails?


How are returns distributed to investors?





Can investors invest in the same company again?
Yes. Currently, the platform does not offer this ability as a built-in option, but a repeat investment can be facilitated by contacting investors@flashfunders.com.
How is communication managed?
FlashFunders Shareholders Services will manage all investor-relations communication between investors and companies after closing.
Does FlashFunders issue stock certificates to investors?
Where offerings on FlashFunders utilize FlashFunders Shareholder Services, investments in those offerings are held in book entry format. This means the shares are recorded electronically, and the company will not send a paper stock certificate once the deal closes.  The shares will be accessible via the Investor dashboard in the investors' FlashFunders account, and inquiries regarding the shares and communications with the Company for Reg CF investors can be directed to FlashFunders Shareholder Services: contact@ffshareholderservices.com.
What happens to my share of ownership if the company issues new shares in future financing rounds?
As is the case with any equity financing round, companies will naturally be diluting the equity ownership of existing investors. That means your proportion of ownership will be reduced, unless you own FlashSeed Preferred stock and exercise your right to maintain proportionate ownership.
What happens if a business fails?
As with any investment, there is an inherent risk that the company in which you invest may fail. If that is the case, and there is a liquidation event, holders of FlashSeed Preferred and Flash CF Preferred Stock will have a liquidation preference over common stock holders of the company. However, in many cases, there are no assets left to distribute, and the entirety of the investment may be lost.
How are returns distributed to investors?
All distributions will be managed by the company itself. However, as Transfer Agent, FlashFunders Shareholders Services provides information to the company to facilitate any distributions.

Business, Startups, Technology 




Are you a wannabe investor, or an aspiring entrepreneur?
There are now more ways than ever to get those valuable connections to make you and others money. The online crowdfunding world is a network of forward thinking companies and people who want to help them succeed.
In the second installment of our Future Finance series, focused on modern investment and millennial-friendly financing, we’re looking at the particular niche of equity crowdfunding.
In 2012, the total global crowdfunding industry estimated fundraising volume was $2.7 billion. In 2015, this had grown to $34 billion. The industry is booming and growing each year, so it’s about time we picked it apart for you.
In this article, we’re going to look at two key areas:

How you can become an investor through crowdfunding opportunities including platforms available to help you along your journey.
How you can raise investment for your startup through crowdfunding platforms, with expert advice from FlashFunders’s Evan Markiles.


What is crowdfunding?

You probably already know, but let’s clarify it for ourselves.
Crowdfunding is the act of sourcing a large amount of money from many small contributions. Simple.
In many ways, crowdfunding isn’t a new concept. On a local level, building societies and credit unions have been crowdfunding their operations ever since the Germans invented the concept back in the 19th Century.
Think, Bailey Brothers’ Building and Loans rather than the nasty Mr Potter who tries to shut it down.

Of course, in the modern age of the internet, is isn’t only communities located in the same place who are able to come together to fund things. The internet is awash with communities or people with similar interests. Never mind the countless people who see a good idea and recognize the money making potential of it.
This leads us to the emerging world of equity crowdfunding. Unlike previous crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter or Indiegogo where you might kick in $25 to help a film come to production with your name in the credits, equity crowdfunding means you own a part of the business.
You’re a real investor.
This provides you with a greater incentive to invest a larger amount of money. Which, in turn, increases the chances of companies raising the total amounts of money they feel they need to take that next step in their business journey.
You could be someone who is looking to kick in $1,000 here or there, or you could be an established angel investor already who is looking to broaden your net. With equity crowdfunding platforms, you can be an investor doing deals without having to have pockets a mile deep.
The crowdfunding we’re seeing now is a result of both legislative and technological changes. Obama’s The JOBS Act changed the scene by opening up investing opportunities. Prior to this, rulings by the SEC meant that only accredited investors could purchase equity in private companies. To be an accredited investor you needed a net worth in excess of $1m and an annual income of above $200k or $300k with your spouse.
The changes to this investment firewall, originally intended to protect people from repeating many of the mistakes of the Great Depression, mean that your regular Joe (or Joan) can now get in on the act.
And this is how we end up with companies like FlashFunders and the emergence of crowdfunding as a serious investment channel.
Should I start investing through crowdfunding sites?
Before I start convincing you to pour your life savings into an investment opportunity, let me remind you that I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. If you want to act on the stellar information I’m giving you, I recommend you speak with a professional. That said…
If you want high risk with high reward, then you can try out equity crowdfunding as an option.
Admittedly, you’re not going to get rich investing small drops at a time in crowdfunding, and you’d be exposing yourself to much greater risk than keeping it in the bank or in a savings package. But, if you’re feeling a bit financially healthy and open to a bit of risk, you could take advantage of the technological shifts in your own way.
It’s worth mentioning that you can offset some of that risk by spreading your bets. Like a VC might have multiple investments all ongoing in the knowledge that if one fails they still have more equity elsewhere. Diversifying your portfolio reduces your exposure to risk and increases your chance of stumbling on a diamond in the rough.
Equity crowdfunding tends to be based on purchasing equity in particular small companies which you believe in and reckon could turn your small amount of money into a larger amount of money. Unlike regular investing, where you hope your money stays safe and grows gently year by year, you’re throwing your money into the deep end and hoping it learns how to swim.

I’m being alarmist, but you need to make sure you know what you’re getting into with crowdfunding so that you can make the right decisions and land that green.
You could receive perks and gifts for investing as part of a slick media campaign on behalf of the company, but these shiny trinkets should not distract your eyes away from the boring financials. You might often be investing in interesting products or things which appeal to you, but check that this isn’t the only reason you’re investing.
Let’s run through a couple of considerations you’ll want to make when deciding whether to invest into an equity crowdfunding round.
How to judge whether a crowdfunding opportunity is a good investment
As with any pursuit, start with the basics.
Do you just like their product or is there a market for it? What are their financial projections? Is there a VC or an angel leading the round?
The last point is an interesting one, and one presented by Sramana Mitra in his critique of the topic. Many investors in crowdfunding campaigns might be first time investors or people who haven’t led a round before. This doesn’t mean they’re amateurs or that they don’t know what they are looking for, but it is indicative of a potential lack of experience.
If the fundraising round is being led by an angel investor or a venture capitalist, then you can be more confident that a professional level of due diligence has been performed.
Topping up a VC funding round with crowdfunding is a useful way for startups to generate more money with a couple of added benefits. Firstly, it gives the startup a way to raise more money while still being able to focus on their business operations. Secondly, as we’ll expand on later, it creates a sea of evangelists for the business.
One example of a company which topped up its funding through crowdfunding and went on to generate huge rewards for investors was Cruise Automation which raised through Angel List as part of a syndicate led by Zach Coelius, where many small investors took part. Involved VCs in the company included Spark Capital and Sam Altman, and all parties were presumably very happy when General Motors acquired Cruise in March 2016 for a cool billion dollars.
Crowdfund investors will have made their decision to invest on the back of seeing prominent VC involvement, a neat concept, and presumably a solid business plan. Moreover, a specialized company like that in such a globally massive market is always a good contender for an exit. Which is worth bearing in mind.
We asked Evan Markiles, Head of Business Operations at FlashFunders, what key things new investors should be looking for before they take the plunge and commit their money to a project:
First, always remember that any sort of investment in an equity crowdfunding offering is an extremely risky and speculative investment, and the time horizon for seeing returns, if any, is very long. Therefore, you should only invest as much as you are comfortable losing on that investment.
This is your investment 101. Do not risk your food budget on an investment opportunity. It would be like donating your tuition money to a candidate who promises to abolish tuition, only for that candidate to lose. It’s well meaning and that risk taking quality is to be admired, but it might not pay off in the long run.

Another factor to consider when thinking about Evan’s point is the emphasis on the horizon for returns. Even if your investment goes well and starts to greatly appreciate in value, it’s not like you can just withdraw your funds. You’re tied in. Perhaps you could sell your stake, but that’s a tricky option to depend on. Unlike micro investing, which we looked at in the previous Future Finance installment, you don’t really have the flexibility to manage your money once it’s in. Liquidity is certainly not the name of the game.
You’re in this investment for the long run. Remember that as you consider your options.
Second, do your due diligence. Potential investors should not only review all materials on a company’s offering page, but really dive into the company’s SEC Form C filing, which will provide information about the company’s operating history, business plan, and any risk factors. But don’t necessarily stop there: google the company, check out their social media presence, read any press about the company. Feel free to even contact the company or its founders to inquire about the business.
This is where you remind yourself that you’re not just a user at a computer. You’re a real investor now, remember! Do the leg work and reach out to the founders. If you take up an hour of their time and then chip in a large sum of money, then that hour has been massively worth it for them. Excellent ROI.
Startups are friendly. Reach out to them as you dig deep into their operations.
If you want a helping hand in understanding how to approach your due diligence, you can use this Process Street template embedded below. Simply click I want this for my business to add the template to your Process Street account.

Should I crowdfund my start up?
Perhaps you’re not looking to be an investor.
Perhaps you have a startup or have an idea you’ve always wanted to kickstart? (pun intended)
Is crowdfunding the right option for you? It’s difficult to say.
One advantage of crowdfunding is it removes the need for what the French philosopher Pierre Bourdieu calls social capital. If you’re ingratiated into the Silicon Valley startup scene then you likely have high levels of social capital, and you can leverage that to access financial capital.
But not all great ideas are born in Silicon Valley. Great ideas happen everywhere, all over the world. Crowdfunding your venture allows you to bypass those connections and networks to try to gain funding wherever you’re based and whatever your social capital.
(Maybe you can approach Andreessen Horowitz later, anyway!)
Moreover, different concepts are more or less likely to capture people’s imagination. A business centered around a concept which solves an obviously identifiable problem and is relatively unique will likely attract interest as part of a crowdfunding campaign. However, it’s probably a little more difficult for a company who offer insurance services and believe their business model means they can undercut their competition.
One of those is engaging, the other not so much. The latter might be a great business opportunity and still suited to crowdfunding, but it could be a little harder to sell to an insurance-layperson.
Elon Musk somehow capturing both Fredo and Vito Corleone. “You come to me on the day of my rocket’s landing…”
Evan gives us his breakdown on what helps a startup to have a successful equity crowdfunding round. According to Evan, companies suited to equity crowdfunding generally share a couple of key characteristics:
1. A very large user/customer base, as these people already use and love your product, and will be excited to become part of the company as an investor. You also already have their contact information, so reaching out to them via a newsletter would be a really cost-effective way of acquiring investors.
2. A successful Kickstarter or Indiegogo campaign in the past, as it will show that there is a market for your product, you will have a big list of potential investors to go back to, and you have experience reaching out to the crowd and using the internet and social media to raise funds.
3. A good supply of capital to pay for a marketing budget. It’s no secret that almost all successful and “viral” Kickstarter campaigns actually have a ton of marketing dollars behind them. It costs money to make a great video pitch, and to buy Facebook ads.
The general theme emerging is that you shouldn’t simply rely on investors within the platform you choose. They may help and get involved, but your chances of success are boosted if you can drive potential investors en masse to the opportunity you’re presenting to them.
Step 1. Build a big user base, whether through the growth of your product or an earlier crowdsourced seed investment funding round. Step 2. Leverage that user base to cream off the investors who will help you move forward.
But remember the advice we gave above to potential investors: make sure your company is in a good position to be invested into, you have your financials properly displayed, and you’re willing to engage with those who have shown an interest in you!
5 equity crowdfunding sites you can use to raise or invest
FlashFunders
FlashFunders is the company of Evan Markiles and offers a full service equity crowdfunding package. We asked Evan what his priorities are for the company:
At FF, our first focus was always being compliant and having a robust regulatory framework. While we are a FINRA Funding Portal (FlashFunders Funding Portal, LLC), we also conduct 506c and Reg A+ offerings through our clearing broker dealer license (FinTech Clearing, LLC). Thus, issuers and investors can be confident that we’re doing things the right way from a compliance perspective. This framework also allows an issuer to travel with us as they grow. They may start with us doing an equity crowdfunding round, and then a few months later conduct a 506c Series A round, and a year later a Reg A+ offering, all on the same platform.
Sounds good! FlashFunders provide a clear line of development for companies looking to raise funds within their platform. This assistance in the natural progression from seed to Series A is good for startups and good for investors. It shows there is space for forward movement without having to distract focus away from the business operations.
We also focus on providing a soup to nuts, end to end solution. We provide all the tools to manage your incoming investors, track your marketing analytics, and conduct the entire round in a compliance manner, as we’re conducting our backend compliance procedures on all investors.
One of the benefits to investors is this interactive aspect where you can monitor the performance of the companies you have a stake in directly from within the platform.
FlashFunders is a true equity crowdfunding site as there are no obligations in regards to being an Accredited Investor; anyone over the age of 18 in the continental US can jump aboard.
AngelList
AngelList is one of the big players in the world of equity crowdfunding. They were pretty much first on the scene and continue to offer their services.
AngelList is known for being one of the largest social networks for startups and has a huge number of companies and investors within its platform as a result. As an investor, AngelList offers three membership levels. The first is the most flexible and requires minimum investments of $1,000. The next step up gives you the opportunity to treat your AngelList investments like an index fund, but requires big bucks: $100,000. The final premium version gives you the benefits of both membership forms with a dedicated AngelList representative.
Whether you choose to crowdfund through AngelList or not, you should probably become a member for the social network value and access to other forms of investment, like accelerator programs.
Gust
Okay, so, this is sailing a little close to the wind (geddit?) in terms of being equity crowdfunding or not.
Gust is one of the largest networks of angel investors and was founded by the now legendary David S. Rose. The O.G. Angel.
Generally, to get involved as an investor it’s best to become a member of one of the angel investment groups within the platform and invest alongside them. This allows you to draw upon the collective wisdom of the group when deciding whether or not to invest. But for investors, Gust is a little more big league than regular crowdfunding suggests.
For startups, you can simply make your profile and work from there. Gust acquired rival Fundacity in 2016, so one would expect their startup portal to improve in light of this purchase, as well as their presence within Europe and Latin America.
Circle Up
Circle Up has a different focus to some other crowdfunding sites. It isn’t a social network, nor is it investor led. Circle Up provide more of a curated experience for investors.
The platform focuses on onboarding consumer brands and working out what their investment needs are. From there, the startups are matched with potentially well suited investors and introductions are made.
This provides a degree of vetting while also adding value into the startup’s pitch. The team at Circle Up will assist in reviewing materials and providing coaching to make sure each startup is representing itself well and professionally. This kind of approach is good for inexperienced startups who are often uncertain about what they need to provide or how best to convey the message.
As an added bonus, Circle Up sell themselves on a range of added bonus services for companies post-raise, with partner offers from Amazon and others.
Fundable
Picking up Fundable as our next platform brings us back into the proper world of crowdfunding. A world of small donations and social media campaigns.
Fundable is part of the ever expanding Startups.co network which includes Zirtual for virtual assistants, and Launchrock for landing pages.
Fundable operates much like Kickstarter or Indiegogo, where you can start a campaign and raise funds from the network. The minimum commitment from investors is $1,000 and no money changes hands through the platform itself. As with some other platforms, Accredited Investors are the only ones with full access to browse company materials in depth.
Honorable mentions
There are new sites opening up in the field of equity crowdfunding all the time. The market for these sites is large and growing. As we’ve seen already, Fundacity was acquired by Gust and Fundable by Startups.co.
There’s definitely activity.
Notable others not included in the list include: Equity Net, Crowdfunder, WeFunder, SeedInvest, and Republic.
Given that the equity crowdfunding explosion occurred in 2012 with Obama’s JOBS Act, the industry is still somewhat in its infancy. Evan suggests that we could continue to see the market change over the next few years as new elements of legislation are making their way through congress. The Fix Crowdfunding Act bill aims to increase the amount of money a company can receive from true crowdfunding in one year from $1m to $5m.
These kinds of legislative changes could further increase the scope of this industry. In our next Future Finance article, we’re going to look at cryptocurrencies and the role they’re playing in funding and investment. Given their advances, it may serve the government well to remove the barriers on regular out-in-the-open investing. The stories of a financial Wild West with Gibraltarian saloons and Singaporean cattle ranches should start the banks and the regulators hoping this town is big enough for the two of them.
Mining Bitcoin ain’t easy, but it’s honest work
To crowdfund or not to crowdfund… wait, what was the question?
I know, we’ve meandered a little through different elements and areas of crowdfunding.
Even covering at least one platform which is barely within the crowdfunding category! But that’s part of the problem. The distinction between what qualifies as crowdfunding and what is small time angel activity has become blurred. It’s both the problem and the core concept. We’re all angels now.
The key takeaways from this article are:
If you can afford to invest $1,000, there are plenty of sites which allow you to pump that money into the company of your choice.
If you are a startup with a large user base, it is worth looking at leveraging that base to drive your funding round; there are plenty of sites to help you.
But it all comes with risk. There are no guarantees you’ll raise the money you want to raise, and there are no guarantees you’ll see returns on your investments. Whether you’re brave enough is up to you.
Have you invested through equity crowdfunding sites? Or, maybe you’ve crowdfunded for your startup? Let us know in the comments below what your experiences have been and we might reach out to you to find out more!

Adam,
I have a crowdfunding campaign (on GoGetFunding) for my first forthcoming book on tea with illustrations by fine artist and editorial cartoonist, John Cox. Do you drink tea? 😉
Have you heard about the crowdfunding site, FundedBy.Me? It is pretty big in Scandinavia.

Tesloop Introduction


Tesloop is creating the world’s first sustainable transportation network. This effort is driven by a community of individuals who are passionate about creating a better way to travel. Over the last few years, unprecedented advances have been achieved in vehicle technology. Due to the advent of an electric car platform, the along with new driver assistance features, and general design improvements, travel by car can now be vastly safer, more comfortable and more economical than ever before.
Our mission Tesloop is to enable our community of travelers to create an amazing travel experience on a sustainable transportation platform, offered in a cloud services model.
Here’s how it works:
Passenger Membership - 
Passengers can book seats in shared cars along Tesloop’s scheduled city-to-city routes. (Just like you would on an airline). For less than the price of gas, passengers are driven in safe & sustainable vehicles with friendly service and healthy & satisfying amenities. Current routes include LA - Las Vegas, OC - Las Vegas. and soon Palm Springs. Routes in the near future will include: LA - San Diego, LA - Santa Barbara, LA - Mt. View, San Mateo - Reno and more.
Passenger Membership is currently targeted at those who travel between Southern California and Las Vegas or Palm Springs at least 3 times a year, and is offered at a discounted price of $9.95/month for the first year (regular price is $9.95 per route or network wide for $49.95). 
Current travel rates between cities is $15 + 15 cents per mile.
LA -> Las Vegas: $57
LA - Palm Springs: $33
LA - Santa Barbara: $26
LA - Mt. View: $68
Pilot Club Membership - 
Members who are interested in driving the Tesloop experience can apply to join the Pilots Club. After a standard online background check that verifies driving record and insurability, Pilot candidates can enroll in a short and free certification process. The Tesloop Pilot’s certification provides training on vehicle operations, proper use of the Auto-Pilot features, and general Tesloop procedures that promote the amazing travel experience.
Once certified, Pilots are eligible to travel at no cost on all Tesloop scheduled routes in the drivers seat.  Pilots can also book passage for their friends & family discount rates.  By driving and booking they earn credits towards use of the Tesla Fleet for personal travel.  For example, a Pilot driving two round trips between LA and Vegas over a month and booking two friends would receive 2 days of personal Tesla usage.
Tesloop is seeking founding Pilots who are enthusiastic about promoting sustainable travel, by educating others and enabling an amazing experience for all passengers. Currently the Pilots club is by invitation only, however. those interested may sign up to receive an application when the program opens to the public.
