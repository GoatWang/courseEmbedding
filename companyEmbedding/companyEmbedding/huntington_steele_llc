    HUNTINGTON STEELE BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLAN DISCLOSURE   
 Huntington Steele has developed a Business Continuity Plan on how we will 
      respond to events that significantly disrupt our business. Since the timing and impact of disasters and disruptions is unpredictable, we will have to be flexible in responding to actual events as they occur. With that in mind, we are providing you with this information on our business continuity plan.
 Contacting Us – If after a significant business disruption you cannot contact us as you usually do at (206) 204-0320, and you have checked our website at www.huntingtonsteele.com, you should call our managing directors directly. Patsy Huntington’s cell phone is (425) 985-4042 and Jen Steele’s cell phone is (206) 321-1873. If you cannot access us through any of those means, you should contact our custodians to obtain account information and prompt access to your funds and securities. Northern Trust can be reached at (312) 557-3048 or at www.northerntrust.com. Fidelity Investments can be reached at (415) 445-7909 or at www.fidelity.com.
 Our Business Continuity Plan – We plan to quickly recover and resume business operations after a significant business disruption and respond by safeguarding our employees and property, making a financial and operational assessment, protecting the firm’s books and records, and allowing our customers to transact business. In short, our business continuity plan is designed to permit our firm to resume operations as quickly as possible, given the scope and severity of the significant business disruption. 

      Our business continuity plan addresses: data back up and recovery; all mission critical systems; financial and operational assessments; alternative communications with customers, employees, and regulators; alternate physical location of employees; critical supplier, contractor, bank and counter-party impact; regulatory reporting; and assuring our customers prompt access to their funds and securities if we are unable to continue our business. 
      
     
 For more information – If you have questions about our business continuity planning, you can contact us at: (206) 204-0320.
