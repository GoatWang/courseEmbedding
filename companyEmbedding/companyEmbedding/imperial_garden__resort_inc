About Us
Imperial's Garden is a family owned and operated produce company located in Wapato, Washington since 1985. The Imperial’s began their farming journey in the Philippines growing rice and tobacco. In 1983, Mamerto and Antipolo Imperial immigrated to Wapato from Sta. Maria, Ilocos Sur with four of their children, Melchor, Marcelo, Manuel, and Virginia. They began working on relatives' farms before starting their own farming business in 1985 with 40 acres of land. In 1990, Marlo, the oldest son, joined the family business. After the passing of Mamerto and Antipolo, the siblings knew the importance of advancing the business to continue their parents' legacy.Imperial’s Garden is located at 4817 Lateral A. Rd. Wapato, WA and the family farms around 1000 acres. They grow a large variety of produce, from asparagus in the early spring, corn in July, and squash/pumpkins in the fall, for the community and wholesale buyers.​

Wine and Dine in Sunny Beach 
If you’re looking to refuel with excellent food and drink, you won’t be short on choice in Sunny Beach. For an authentic taste of the region, dip into one of the Bulgarian restaurants in the town – you’ll have the opportunity to sample everything from Shopska salad to 'Tarator', a deliciously cooling soup that will be all too welcome after all that sunshine. Head uphill and away from the tourist spots to find spicy kavarma stew and roasted lamb to linger on the palate. Aside from Bulgarian delicacies, there are numerous restaurants serving up everything from Indian dishes to British classics.
Top Nightlife in Sunny Beach 
If you haven’t forgotten your dancing shoes, there are some great things to do in Sunny Beach after the sunshine fades. Numerous Irish pubs line the streets, serving up great live music and an obligatory pint of Guinness, while beach bars transform into bustling bars serving up exotic cocktails. If you’ve got the stamina, head down the main strip and spend your night in one of the great nightclubs in Sunny Beach. Those embarking on an epic night out should consider a short stay in Varna, where you’ll find a unique blend of old-school charm with thriving modern culture.


Family Fun in Sunny Beach 
The main attraction of holidays to Sunny Beach is of course the beach itself and you’ll certainly enjoy the 8km stretch of pristine sands that occupies the area. With a line of sun-loungers and a wealth of water sports to enjoy, there are plenty of things to do here – the Sunny Day Resort nearby even boasts a child’s playground and games room for little ones looking to expend their energy. Adventure-seekers will be in their element too, with numerous activities to indulge in. Head to the bowling alley to enjoy a competitive family game of ten pin or shimmy into your wetsuit to take part in everything from water-skiing to jet-skiing. For those feeling especially brave there is the option to try your hand at parachuting, giving you a unique perspective on Bulgaria’s beautiful surroundings. After your day of relaxing on the beach, you’ll be able to choose from a variety of restaurants scattered around the resort in the evening. From traditional Bulgarian cuisine to British favourites, you’re sure to find something to enjoy. If it is nightlife you’re looking for, you’ll be pleased that Sunny Beach holidays come packed with bars and pubs for you to enjoy. Be sure to try one of the cocktails while you’re there and if you’ve remembered to pack your dancing shoes, head to the nearby nightclubs to keep on boogying until the sun comes up. For those looking for family-orientated entertainment, it is well worth heading to the nearby resort of Golden Sands.
It’s no doubt that one of the greatest Sunny Beach attractions for little ones can be found in the Aqua Park. With no better way to enjoy the Bulgarian sunshine than spending the day frolicking in the water, the entire family will enjoy the selection of rides and slides at this haven. Whether you rise to the challenge of the thrill-inducing high slides or float away with the lazy river, you’ll certainly be able to keep the kids captivated for hours.
Couples adventures to Sunny Beach 
If you’d rather indulge in the sunny beach attractions that promote peace and tranquillity, there is nothing more idyllic than a sunset cruise. Take a boat from the port at Sunny Beach and sail off into the fading sunshine as you sit back, enjoy your spectacular surroundings and linger over a glass of champagne. Regular day cruises can also be found that journey to the old town of Nessebar, where you’ll find plenty of opportunity to stroll around and enjoy the stunning architecture.
Action and Adventure in Sunny Beach 
Many of the action-packed things to do in Sunny Beach can be found on the beach itself, with a great range of water sports available to try. Pedalos and banana boats are available for those looking to catch a glimpse of the land from the water, while back on the sands there is always a game of volleyball to join in. If you’ve got a penchant for a wetsuit, you’ll love taking part in everything from jet-skiing to paragliding, as well as scuba-diving which proves particularly popular.

With its historic landmarks, exotic beaches and superb range of day trips and sports on offer, Bulgaria is the perfect holiday destination. Whether you’re looking for a relaxing holiday in the sun or an adventurous experience, you will find it in Bulgaria.
Take in the azure ocean and golden sands of Varna or experience the fascinating culture of Sofia, Bulgaria's capital city. Why not head to the port of Sveti Vlas Village, hire a yacht for the day and let your worries float away as you boat around the Black Sea.
Once you are back on land, visit Nessebar, a prominent seaside destination that combines old world beauty with modern glamorous beaches. A UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1983, Nessebar is a beautiful city to visit for a day or an entire trip.
If you can pull yourself away from the coastline, make your way into the heart of Bulgaria to Central Balkan National Park. Situated in the Balkan Mountains, the park contains rare and endangered animals to see as you trek over the countryside.

Top Attractions





Bulgaria is a vibrant and fascinating country that is becoming more and more popular for couples, families and groups going on holiday. The country has so much to offer in terms of sweeping landscapes, mountains, coastlines and vibrant culture and cuisine. It is the perfect location for your next budget holiday in the sun.
For those looking for a touch of ancient history and culture, Nessebar has much to offer. The town has many ancient ruins dating back to the 11th century. Its cobbled streets will lead you through the town's amazing architecture and history.
View Bulgaria's largest monastery, Rila Monastery, when you travel deep in to the Rilska River Valley. Established in the 10th century, the secluded religious structure is a blast from the past. 
If you want to be rejuvenated on your holiday, visit the St. Konstantin mineral springs. The beautiful baths come from deep springs and are always between 40 – 60oc, the perfect temperature for pure relaxation.

Wine and Dine





Bulgarian cuisine mixes Slavic, Greek and Turkish traditional foods. Yet, the country also has more modern influences helping to give Bulgaria its own distinct tastes.
Soups are popular in Bulgaria and eating at a traditional restaurant, you will find plenty of delicious soups on the menu. Many of the recipes have been passed down by generations, though more modern, chic Bulgarian restaurants are coming up with their own ideas.
When the Bulgarian beaches get too warm, you should cool down with a tarator soup. The yoghurt and cucumber recipe is a way to chill before heading back into the surf. If you are looking for a meaty dinner the meshana skara mix grill is a fulfilling combination of flavours.
Bulgarians love their cheeses and will eat slices of gorgeous white cheese during meals. To drink, try the boza, a traditional fermented malt drink made from maize and wheat.

For Families





The old town of Nessebar offers families a wealth of history on a Bulgarian holiday. Of course, there is the fantastic beach, but the town is more than 3,000 years old and its ancient buildings have helped it achieve UNESCO World Heritage Site certification. Roman baths, historical churches and much more are available for an educational family trip.
After packing in the historical sites, head to the Central Balkan National Park for a chance to see endangered wildlife. The park is a fantastic day trip for families and its mountains provide your legs a challenging walk.
If you want more water fun than you can get at the beaches, Bulgaria has two major water parks the kids will love. Aqua Paradise and Action Aquapark. Both have plenty of great pools and slides to enjoy on a family day out.

Action and Adventure





One of Bulgaria's coolest places to visit is Buzludzha, a futuristic building built in the Central Balkan Mountains. Built in 1974, the structure was dedicated to Bulgaria's Communist Party, although it wasn't opened until 1981. The UFO-like building was abandoned after the fall of communism and today lays in ruin.
The Rila Mountains offer great trekking and a chance to see the seven Rila Lakes. Beautiful to view, the lakes are easy to access when hiking, so pack those trekking boots for a day in the mountains. Bulgaria is a very mountainous country and there are over 40 mountains in Bulgaria to take some stunning photos of and climb or hike over.
Thanks to the mountains, winter time is perfect for skiing. Bulgaria offers great skiing for less than many western European countries. Bansko is one of the most popular places to ski and whether you are an expert or a novice, you will be heading down the slopes in no time.

Life's a Beach





Finding a blissful beach on your summer holiday to Bulgaria isn't difficult. One of Bulgaria's best beaches is Golden Sands. Backed by a forest covered hillside, the slopes give way to a beautiful beach that meets the Black Sea. The Bulgarian coastline offers miles of crisp white beach sands, perfect for topping up that tan, but don't forget you sun cream.
Visitors to Nessebar will find Sunny Beach not far away. The shoreline provides guests with wide open sands that welcome visitors from all over the world. The beach gets rather busy, and when it does, the local bars and restaurants offer a retreat from the crowds. Nessebar combines history and beach life well; and is a great destination during a Bulgarian break.
Albena is another beautiful Bulgarian beach and tourists flock to the five-kilometre-long shoreline. The crystal clear waters are perfect for water sports or just splashing about as you relax on your Bulgarian beach break.

Nightlife





Nightlife begins and ends with the country's capital Sofia. Parties happen at all times of night as Bulgaria's alcohol licensing laws allow it to be served whenever. Clubs and bars may stay open until the sun comes up, giving you the chance to dance the night away. If you are hungry after finishing at a Sofia disco, plenty of local restaurants stay open until the wee hours serving breakfast.
Varna is another Bulgarian nightlife hotspot where you can stay up late and relieve your hangover with a hot coffee and warm Black Sea swim. The city is absolutely vibrant once the sun goes down and many of the local bars and clubs will have DJs spinning throughout the evening.
If you prefer a quieter evening out in Bulgaria, there are a number of great restaurants in both Sofia and Varna. Have a nightcap at a quiet pub or sip a coffee at an outside café as you watch the world go by.

For Couples





Nessebar is a must see town when going to Bulgaria as a couple. The cobbled streets of the old town, the quaint atmosphere at dusk and the little cafés and bars ooze romance. Enjoy an evening out at one of the fine restaurants in the old town followed by a morning at the beach for a truly romantic holiday.
If you find yourself in the countryside, you will see kilometres of golden fields as sunflowers grow across the country. Running from Serbia to the Black Sea, the view of field upon field of golden flowers is the perfect backdrop to a picnic or trek through the Bulgarian countryside.
Head into Sofia for a laidback experience as the often overlooked capital is full of great historical buildings and churches to view. When you have tired of walking, head to a romantic spot on the Iskar River to watch the sunset.

Culture





From ancient times to communism, Bulgaria is full of culture. Thracian Tomb is located in northeastern Bulgaria and dates back to the 3rd century BC. The site's carvings are extremely unique and provide visitors with a glimpse into Europe's ancient past.
Perperikon is a Thracian sanctuary that wasn't discovered until 2000. Considered the largest megalithic structure in southeastern Europe, Perperikon overlooks Gorna Krepost in the Rhodope Mountains.
While in the Rhodope Mountains a visit to Shiroka Laka is a cultural experience like no other. The old architecture is a true view into the lives and history of the Rhodopian people. You can experience traditional food and music in the village as you take in a world very different than Sofia or Varna.
Once back in Sofia, the National Palace of Culture is a must-see. Built during communist rule, the building is a chance to see a time that is quickly becoming forgotten in Bulgaria.

PRELIMINARY PROSPECTUS
 
[ ] American Depositary Shares 
 
Representing [  ] Ordinary
Shares
 

 
IMPERIAL GARDEN & RESORT, INC.
 
 This is an initial
public offering of our American depositary shares, or ADSs. Each ADS represents      of our ordinary
shares, par value US$0.01 per share. Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our ADSs or our ordinary shares.
We expect the initial public offering price will be in the range of $5 to $ per ADS. We have reserved the symbol “MNSI”
for purposes of listing our ADSs on the Nasdaq Stock Market and plan to apply to list our ADSs on that exchange. If the application
is approved, trading of our ADSs on the Nasdaq Stock Market is expected to begin within five days after the date of the initial
issuance of the ADSs pursuant to this prospectus. 
 
Investing in our ADSs
involves a high degree of risk, including the risk of losing your entire investment. See “Risk Factors” beginning on
page 13 to read about factors you should consider before buying our ADSs.
 
We are an “emerging
growth company” as defined under the federal securities laws and will be subject to reduced public company reporting requirements.
Please read the disclosures beginning on page 8 of this prospectus for more information.

The Underwriter is selling our ADSs in
this offering on a best efforts basis. The Underwriter is not required to sell any specific number or dollar amount of ADSs but
will use its best efforts to sell the ADSs offered. One of the conditions to our obligation to sell any securities through the
Underwriter is that, upon the closing of the offering, the ADSs would qualify for listing on the NASDAQ market.
 
 We do not intend to close this
offering unless we sell at least a minimum number of ADS, at the price per ADS set forth above, to result in sufficient
proceeds to list our ADSs on NASDAQ. The offering shall terminate on the earlier of (i) any time after the minimum offering
amount of our ADSs is raised, or (ii) one hundred and twenty (120) days from the effective date of this prospectus, or the
expiration date. If we can successfully raise the minimum offering amount within the offering period, the proceeds from the
offering will be released to us after deducting certain escrow fees. The proceeds from the sale of the ADSs in this offering
will be payable to “        ” and will be deposited in a separate (limited to
funds received on behalf of us) non-interest bearing trust bank account until the minimum offering amount is raised. We
expect that delivery of the ADSs will be made to investors through the book-entry facilities of the Depository Trust Company.
We are selling the ADSs offered hereby on an “all or none” basis up to the minimum offering amount. Therefore if
we do not raise the aggregate offering amount of $15,000,000 within one hundred and twenty (120) days at a minimum price of
$5 per ADS, we will not conduct a closing of this offering and will promptly refund investors with all amounts previously
deposited by them in escrow, without interest or deduction. 
 
Neither the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission nor any state securities commission or any other regulatory body has approved or disapproved of these securities,
or determined if this prospectus is truthful or complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.
 
 The Underwriter expects to deliver
the ADSs against payments in U.S. dollars to purchasers on or about____________, 2017.

PROSPECTUS SUMMARY
 
The following summary is qualified in
its entirety by, and should be read in conjunction with, the more detailed information and financial statements appearing elsewhere
in this prospectus. In addition to this summary, we urge you to read the entire prospectus carefully, especially the risks of investing
in our ADSs discussed under “Risk Factors,” before deciding whether to buy our ADSs. This prospectus contains information
from a report commissioned by us dated June, 2015, as updated from time to time, by the Cuningham Group (“Cuningham”),
an independent architectural design firm.
 
Our Mission
 
We seek to provide premium services to
customers in the hospitality and entertainment businesses. Building on our current golf operation, we intend to expand our services
to include leisure vacations, business travel, retail and dining segments. Our goal is to operate one of the largest resorts in
Taiwan.
 
Our Business
 
 We were incorporated in the British
Virgin Islands on September 23, 2016. We are a development stage company, and we currently manage and operate a golf course known
as the Royal Country Club, located in Taiwan on a parcel of land of which Yao-Teh International Recreation Co., Ltd., (“Yao-Teh”)
and Ta-Teh-Fu Co., Ltd. (“Ta-Teh-Fu”), two of our Subsidiaries, are the current record owners. Occupying approximately
197.7 acres of land, the Royal Country Club features a renovated18-hole golf course designed by Robert T. Jones, a world-class
golf architect, a snack bar providing indigenous Hakka food, various amenities, such as locker and shower rooms, and a retail
store that offers golf equipment and accessories. A majority of our current income is derived from the management and operations
of the Royal Country Club. 
 
 We aim to construct, develop and operate
the “Royal Country Club Spa & Resort,” a premier resort, which we intend to complete in two phases, Phase I and
Phase II. Phase I will include construction of a premium hotel that will feature a full service hot spring spa and outdoor swimming
pools, as well as a courtyard garden and a river view that will house water falls, restaurants and bars. Further, we envision,
although we do not guarantee, that during Phase I, we will also complete the construction and development of a natural hot spring
spa, which will be connected to the main hotel area by a bridge. We intend, although cannot guarantee, to finish Phase I by the
end of 2018 and expect to be fully operational in the third quarter of 2020. We have applied for the necessary licenses to start
the planned construction. However, we anticipate that it may take up to eighteen (18) months from February 2016 to obtain such
licenses. According to our current business plan, we anticipate to spend approximately $50 million to complete Phase I and approximately
$150 million for the completion of Phase II. 
 
During Phase II, we anticipate constructing
and developing a second hotel, three upscale restaurants, pools and water slides, a Japanese garden, a multi-purpose center for
weddings and conferences and a shopping and entertainment village and other venues or facilities for recreational purposes. The
garden will be designed and arranged to recreate a scene reflecting Japan in the 17th century.
We believe that this Japanese garden will be the largest garden in the world, occupying approximately 281.7 acers of land.
 
On September 11, 2015, the Company and
InterContinental Hotels Group (Shanghai) Ltd. (“IHG”) entered into a binding letter of intent, pursuant to which during
the pre-commencement period, IHG has agreed to provide technical services to us, including a review of the hotel building plan
for Phase I and Phase II in accordance with IHG’s Holiday Inn Standards. We have paid the first installment of the pre-commencement
management fee and IHG has been providing assistance and guidance on our hotel plans. After the completion of land reclassification,
we anticipate entering into a formal management contract with IHG, under which IHG will provide hotel management services in exchange
for a set of fees, including incentive management fees, business planning application cost, revenue & channel management for
hire service fee, licensing fee and system fund contributions.

We expect that upon the completion of the two phases described
above, we will begin to generate higher revenues.

Upon completion of the first two phases discussed above, we
plan to:
 

 3 
 
 


 
·
Expand clientele for the Royal Country Club Spa & Resort by undergoing a marketing effort for our additional amenities. We intend to focus on marketing to people of different age groups and gender.



 
·
Provide more services and expand sources of income. We intend to increase sources of revenue from (1) hotel rooms, conference centers and wedding venues, (2) charging nature park admission fees, (3) charging admission fees for the floral garden, and (4) providing dining service at the restaurants and bars.



 
·
Form Strategic Partnerships. In addition to the collaboration with IHG, we anticipate developing strategic partnerships on a selective basis. For example, we have had discussions with several established entertainment companies that have extensive experience in our target markets and have indicated interest in jointly developing the resort.



 
·
Leverage Relationships. We are the first to develop and operate a golf resort featuring hot spring spas and natural habitation in Taiwan. We will continue creating unique or special features to attract customers and increase our market share in the hospitality industry. In order to do so, we intend to continue to leverage our development expertise, existing platform and business model and our access to international strategic partners with the end in view of developing a resort that is superior to others located in our geographical area.



 
·
Continue innovation. We intend to leverage our in-house expertise in conjunction with the knowledge and experience of our hotel management partners and consultants to develop innovations in resort entertainment activities and amenities.

Summary of Financial Operations
 
We had accumulated
deficits of $72,509,297 and $71,036,558 as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The net losses attributable to
shareholders of our ordinary shares were $1,472,739 and $1,602,793 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
As of June 30, 2016, we had $1,137,094 in current assets and $79,679,679 in current liabilities. Accordingly, our negative working
capital position as of June 30, 2016 was $78,542,585.
 

 5 
 
 
 As of June 30, 2016, we had line of
credit of $1,898,821, long-term bank loans totaling $4,210,170, and notes payable amounting to $10,423,340. The long-term bank
loans and notes payable are overdue and currently under negotiation with the lenders. As of June 30, 2016, we had liabilities
owed to related parties of an aggregate of $48,715,690, including $2,910,615 owed to the shareholders of the Company. Based on
the cash flow statement for the six months ended June 30, 2016, we estimate that we are using our funds at a rate of approximately
$57,883/ month. We anticipate that at such burning rate, our current capital is likely to last two months without further funding.

 
Our independent auditor has issued a going
concern opinion, which means there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve (12) months.
The financial statements included in the Registration Statement of which this prospectus is a part do not include any adjustments
that might result from the uncertainty about our ability to continue in business.
 
Our Strategy
 
We plan to shift our business emphasis
from the existing golf-centered model to a tourism-focused model. We believe that upon the completion of Phase I, as described
above, we will be able to attract a broader range of visitors to our resort. As a part of our marketing strategy, we anticipate
designing campaigns and marketing materials that target both domestic and international visitors. If we are successful in developing
and operating the Royal Country Club Spa & Resort, we intend to apply the same management and operations model to other chain
resorts that we may build and operate in the future.
 
Competition
 
In the hospitality and recreation industry,
we are facing and expect to continue facing extensive competition from competitors of a similar scale in the same or similar industries
and sectors. We have to keep innovating and upgrading our products and services to maintain our existing clientele and attract
new customers to the Royal Country Club and the planned Royal Country Club Spa & Resort. For instances, currently the snack
bar at the Royal Country Club provides delicious Hakka food to our golf customers. When the contemplated Royal Country Club Spa
& Resort opens, the customers will be able to enjoy the view of the largest garden in Taiwan while playing golf therein. Although
our current and future services and products provided at the Royal Country Club and to be provided at the planned Royal Country
Club Spa & Resort are and will be special as compared to the services at traditional golf courses and hotels, we may not have
effective measures to prevent others imitating our services and products. We will be likely to lose customers to other competing
golf venues and hotels if those competitors offer similar or more services and products at lower prices.
 
Competitive Strengths
 
Our Competitive Strengths in the Golf Business
 
We believe the Royal Country Club is one of the leading golf
venues in Taiwan. Our strengths in this sector include:
 

·Established scenic golf course and country club. We have completed significant renovation of our
18-hole golf course, which was designed by a world renowned golf architect. The golf course offers a challenging golf experience
and provides what we believe to be a scenic setting.

·Brand effect. We believe that the name of Royal Country Club will add value to the Royal Country
Club Spa & Resort.

·Special experience of indigenous culture, Hakka. Miaoli is the county where a lot of Hakka people
reside. Currently, visitors of the Royal Country Club have an opportunity to participate in Hakka activities, such as participating
in Hakka holiday ceremonies, visiting architecture of Hakka styles and tasting Hakka dishes. In the future, guests of our contemplated
hotels will be able to visit Hakka places of interest in one trip to Miaoli while staying at our hotels.

·Experienced management team and committed and motivated staff. Our senior management team has an
average of approximately 20 years of experience in construction, real estate development and golf management industries and significant
expertise in operating complex and themed golf courses. In addition, we have a team of skilled and committed employees.
 

 6 
 
 
Our Competitive Strengths in the Resort
Business
 
Upon completion of the two construction
phases, the entire resort will feature premium hotels and high-quality country club amenities, hot spring spas, scenic hiking trails
and Japanese gardens, in addition to the golf course. In that respect, we believe that our competitive strengths include:
 

·Upon completion of Phase II, we will be the only and the largest golf club in a garden in Taiwan.

·We have rare underground hot spring in a resort.

·We have engaged with IHG as strategic partner, a renowned international hospitality management
company with experience in Asian markets. We believe IHG’s rich experience in resort and hotel management will provide superior
services to our consumers.

·We will build the only leisure resort with natural habitation in Miaoli.

·We have convenient access to Zhongshan high-way, high speed rail and other public transportation.

·Favorable Trends. We believe the recent vacation trends favor our core value, “quality first”.
Nowadays visitors, particularly visitors from mainland China, are paying more attention to the free-styled vacation over the traditional
group tour designed by tour agencies. Additionally, tourists from mainland China tend to stay in one place to know more about it.
We believe that these trends will continue and that we are well positioned to take advantage of them.

·First mover advantage. We will be among one of few resorts that operate a golf course, natural
hot spring spas, nature parks, country clubhouses, and retail facilities in Taiwan. With our management team’s substantial
experience, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on our first-mover advantage and enhance our brand recognition.

Implications of Being an Emerging
Growth Company
 
As a company with less than $1.0 billion
in revenue during our last fiscal year, we qualify as an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our
Business Startups Act, or the JOBS Act. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage
of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (or the “Securities
Act”), for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of
certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.
 
An emerging growth company may also take
advantage of reduced reporting requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies. These provisions include, but are
not limited to:
 

·we may present only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations;

·not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as
amended, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;

·reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports, proxy statements and registration
statements; and

·exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of
any golden parachute payments not previously approved.
 
We may take advantage of these provisions
until the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common equity securities
pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act. However, if certain events occur prior to the end of
such five-year period, including if we become a “large accelerated filer,” our annual gross revenues exceed $1.0 billion
or we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt in any three-year period, we will cease to be an emerging growth company
prior to the end of such five-year period.
 
We have elected to take advantage of certain
of the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in this prospectus and, as long as we continue to qualify
as an emerging growth company, we may elect to take advantage of this and other reduced burdens in future filings. As a result,
the information that we provide to our stockholders may be different than you might receive from other public reporting companies
in which you hold equity interests.
 
We are also a “smaller reporting
company,” as defined under SEC Regulation S-K. As such, we also are exempt from the auditor attestation requirements of Section
404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and also are subject to less extensive disclosure requirements regarding executive compensation in
our periodic reports and proxy statements. We will continue to be deemed a smaller reporting company until our public float exceeds
$75 million on the last day of our second fiscal quarter in the preceding fiscal year.

RISK FACTORS
 
Investing in our ADSs involves a high
degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below with all of the other information included in this prospectus
before deciding to invest in our ADSs. We believe the risks and uncertainties described below represent all the material risks
known to us that are related to our business and this offering. If any of the following risks actually occur, they may harm our
business, financial condition and results of operations. In this event, the market price of our ADSs could decline and you could
lose some or all of your investment.
 
Risks Relating to Our Early Stage
Development and Our Operations in General
 
We are in the early stages
of our planned expansion, and as such, we are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. The operating history of the golf
course that we currently operate and manage may not serve as an adequate basis to judge our future operating results upon the completion
of our contemplated Royal Country Club Spa & Resort.
 
While Yao-Teh has been operating our golf
course since 1988, our planned expansion entails the construction, development and operations of two hotels and other recreational
facilities. However, we have not had any direct experience in operating hotels, retail stores, gardens, conference centers, wedding
venues, nature hot spring spas and other recreational facilities. As a result, you should consider our business and prospects in
light of the risks, expenses and challenges attendant to the operations of a new business. These risks and challenges include:
 

·the uncertainties associated with our ability to continue our growth while trying to achieve and
maintain our profitability;

·our ability to establish our competitive position in the high end hotel segment of the lodging
industry in Taiwan;

·our ability to offer innovative products to attract recurring and new customers;

·implementing our planned strategy and modifying it from time to time to respond effectively to
competition and changes in customer preferences and needs;

·increasing awareness of our brand in the resort business and continuing to develop customer loyalty;
and

·attracting, training, retaining and motivating skilled and devoted personnel.
 
In addition, we have encountered and will
continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by early-stage companies, and those risks and difficulties
may be heightened in a rapidly developing market such as Taiwan. Some of the risks relate to our ability to:
 

·complete our construction projects within their anticipated time schedules and budgets;

·attract new and retain existing customers and obtain qualified employees;

·operate, support, expand and develop our new and existing projects and facilities;

·maintain effective control of our operating costs and expenses;

·raise additional capital, as required;

·develop and maintain internal personnel, systems and procedures to assure compliance with the extensive
regulatory requirements applicable to the hospitality business as well as regulatory compliance as a public company;

·respond to changes in our regulatory environment; and

·respond to competitive market conditions.
 
If we are unable to complete any of these
tasks, we may be unable to complete all of the Royal Country Club Spa & Resort that are currently under development, operate
our golf business in the manner we contemplate and generate revenues from such projects in the amounts and by the times we anticipate.
If any of these events were to occur, it would cause a material adverse effect on our business and prospects, financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows.
 

 13 
 
 
We have incurred losses in
the past and may incur losses in the future.
 
We incurred net losses of $3,763,596 and
$3,158,693 during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We had a total deficit of $65,574,965 and $64,263,619
as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We expect our costs to increase as we start expanding our business and operations
in the hospitality and entertainment industries. For instance, we estimate that the completion of the Royal Country Club Spa &
Resort requires an investment of approximately $200 million, which will be raised in the form of equity and/or debt. Also the operations
of the Royal Country Club may be impacted by the construction of the Royal Country Club Spa & Resort and therefore negatively
influenced the revenue and profits of the golf operations. As a result, we may incur larger losses in the future. We do not think
it is reasonable to expect the Company to make substantial profits during the construction and initial operation of the Royal Country
Club Spa & Resort. We cannot assure you that we will achieve or sustain profitability in the future.
 
Failure to comply with privacy
regulations and maintain the integrity of internal or customer data could result in faulty business decisions or harm to our reputation
and subject us to additional costs, fines or lawsuits.
 
Certain information regarding our customers,
including personally identifiable information and credit card numbers, is collected and maintained for a period of time for various
business purposes, including maintaining records of customer preferences to enhance our customer service quality, the efficiency
of billing and the effects of our marketing and promotional efforts. Additionally, we maintain personally identifiable information
about our employees. The integrity and protection of our customer, employee and company data is critical to our business. Our customers
expect that we adequately protect their personal information.
 
The regulations applicable to cyber security
and privacy are increasingly demanding. Privacy regulation is an evolving area and may subject us to various compliance requirements.
Compliance with applicable privacy regulations may increase our operating costs or adversely impact our ability to serve our customers
and market our golf course and ancillary services to our customers. Theft, loss, misappropriation, fraudulent or unlawful use of
customer, employee or company data, including cyberattacks, could harm our reputation, resulting in loss of customers, business
disruption or increased costs, including remedial costs, lawsuits or fines. In addition, non-compliance with applicable privacy
regulations by us (or in some circumstances, non-compliance by third parties engaged by us) could result in fines or restrictions
on our use or transfer of data. Any of these matters could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 
The highly concentrated ownership
and voting power of the Company may impact shareholders’ interests in the Company.
 
As of the date hereof, Mr. Lo owned approximately
99.83% of our ordinary shares and the voting power of the Company. It is anticipated that Mr. Lo will continue to own a majority
of the ordinary shares of the Company and correspondingly, will have the majority of the voting power of the Company. As such,
you may not be able to influence the strategies, management or policies of the Company as you could at a company where the equity
ownership is widely distributed.
 
Risks Relating to the Completion and
Operation of the Royal Country Club Spa & Resort
 
We could encounter problems
that substantially increase the costs to develop our Royal Country Club Spa & Resort and delay or prevent the opening of one
or more of our contemplated facilities.
 
The current estimated budget for the Phase
I and Phase II of the Royal Country Club Spa and Resort is based on preliminary projections, initial conceptual design and schedule
estimates that we have prepared with the assistance of our independent architecture and design consultants. As of the date of this
prospectus, the estimated cost to complete the construction and development of the Royal Country Club Spa and Resort is approximately
US$200 million, consisting primarily of construction costs, design fees, professional service fees, consulting and management contract
fees and the initial operating costs. However, completion of the resort, as envisioned, is subject to significant development and
construction risks, which could have a material adverse impact on our timetables, cost budgets and our ability to complete the
projects. These risks include the following:
 

·changes to plans and specifications;
 

·engineering problems, including defective plans and specifications;
 

·shortages of, and price increases in, energy, materials and skilled and unskilled labor, and inflation in key supply markets;
 

·delays in obtaining or failure to obtain necessary permits, licenses and approvals;
 

 14 
 
 

·changes in laws and regulations, or in the interpretation and enforcement of laws and regulations, applicable to leisure, residential,
real estate development or construction projects and tourists’ permits for people from mainland China;
 

·labor disputes or work stoppages;
 

·disputes with and defaults by contractors and subcontractors;
 

·environmental, health and safety issues, including site accidents;
 

·weather interferences;
 

·fires, typhoons and other natural disasters;
 

·geological, construction, excavation, regulatory and equipment problems; and
 

·other unanticipated circumstances or cost increases.
 
The occurrence of any of these development
and construction risks could increase the total costs, cause delays, prevent the construction or opening of any of our contemplated
facilities or otherwise affect the design and features of the planned Royal Country Club Spa & Resort.
 
We may be required to incur
significant additional indebtedness or other equity or equity-linked securities in order to complete construction and development
of the Royal Country Club Spa & Resort. Our ability to obtain additional financing may be limited, which could delay or prevent
the opening or completion of our Royal Country Club Spa & Resort.
 
We think that it is highly likely that
we will require additional funding to complete the construction and development of the Royal Country Club Spa & Resort, as
well as to fund initial operating activities and to service existing debt payments. We estimate that we would need approximately
$150 million to complete the construction and start the initial operations of the entire Royal Country Club Spa & Resort as
contemplated in addition to the funds raised in this offering assuming that we succeed in raising the maximum amount of capital
through this offering. If delays and cost overruns are significant, the additional funding required could be substantial, which
we will need to obtain either through equity issuances or debt financing. The raising of additional debt by us, if required, could
result in the imposition of operating and financing covenants, or liens on our assets, that could significantly restrict our operations.
In addition, the sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our shareholders’ interest in the Company.
 
Further, our ability to obtain required
capital on acceptable terms, when required, is subject to a variety of uncertainties, including:
 

·limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, including as a result of prospective lenders’
evaluations of our creditworthiness and pursuant to restrictions imposed by our existing and anticipated credit facilities;
 

·limitations on our ability to raise capital from the credit markets if the credit markets decline
due to any large scale defaults originating from overleveraged Chinese companies in Taiwan and China;
 

·investors’ and lenders’ perception of, and demand for, debt and equity securities of
leisure and hospitality companies, as well as competing offerings of financing and investment opportunities in Taiwan by our competitors;
 

·whether it is necessary to provide credit support or other assurances for our Subsidiaries, Yao-Teh
and Ta-Teh-Fu;
 

·conditions of the U.S., Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, and other capital markets in which we may seek
to raise additional funds;
 

·our future results of operations, financial condition and cash flows;
 

·Taiwan and Chinese regulations on transferring funds between Taiwan and China; and
 

·economic, political and other conditions in Taiwan, China and the great Asian region.
 

 15 
 
 
As such, we cannot assure you that the
necessary financing, if and when required by us, will be available in the future in the amounts or on terms acceptable to us, or
at all. If we fail to raise additional funds in such amounts and at such times as we may need, we may be forced to reduce our expenditures
and stay at a level that can be supported by our cash flow and delay the development of the Royal Country Club Spa & Resort.
Without necessary capital, we may not be able to:
 

·develop and complete any new projects contemplated by our Board of Directors;
 

·acquire necessary rights, assets or businesses;
 

·expand our operations in Taiwan;
 

·hire, train and retain employees for the resort to be constructed;
 

·market our services and products; or
 

·respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated funding requirements.
 
Even if the Royal Country Club
Spa & Resort is completed as planned, it may not be financially successful, which would limit our cash flow and would adversely
affect our operations.
 
Even if all of the planned facilities contemplated
within the Royal Country Club Spa & Resort are completed as planned, no assurance can be given that its operations will be
financially successful or generate the cash flows that we require to sustain its operation. We may not attract the level of patronage
that we anticipate. If we are unable to attract sufficient business, it would limit our cash flow and adversely affect our operations,
our financial condition and our ability to service payments under any of our loan facilities.
 
Our future resort operating
results are subject to conditions affecting the lodging industry in general and our return-driven development model is subject
to certain risks.
 
Our operating results of the contemplated
resort are subject to conditions typically affecting the lodging industry, which include:
 

·changes and volatility in general economic conditions;

·our ability to maintain or increase sales to existing customers and attract new customers;

·competition from other hotels and full-service resorts;

·natural disasters or travelers’ fears of exposure to contagious diseases and social unrest;

·seasonality of our business;

·changes in travel patterns or in the desirability of particular locations, such as Miaoli;

·increases in operating costs and expenses due to inflation and other factors;

·local market conditions such as an oversupply of, or a reduction in demand for, hotel rooms;

·the quality and performance of the future managers and other employees of our planned hotels;

·the availability and cost of capital to allow us to fund construction and renovation of, and make
other investments in, our hotels, entertainment facilities and ancillary equipment; and

·the possibility that our leased properties may be subject to challenges as to their compliance
with the relevant government regulations.
 
In addition, our return-driven
development model is subject to the following risks:
 

·we may not be able to control our costs effectively as anticipated; and

·lack of resort operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and results
of operations of the planned resort.
 
Changes in any of the conditions typically
affecting the lodging industry in general, and the materialization of any risks applicable to our return-driven development model
could adversely affect our occupancy rates, average daily rates and revenues generated per available room (“Rev PAR”),
or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
 
We expect to incur significant
pre-opening expenses at the development stage and generate relatively low revenues at the ramp-up stage, which may have a significant
negative impact on our financial performance.
 
We mainly utilize a build-and-operate model,
under which the operation of our hotel goes through three stages: development, ramp-up and mature operations. During the development
stage, hotels and the accommodations generally incur pre-opening expenses. During the ramp-up stage, when the occupancy rate is
still relatively low, revenues generated by hotels may be insufficient to cover their operating costs, which are relatively fixed
in nature. As a result, our contemplated hotels may not achieve profitability until they reach mature operations. This may have
a significant negative impact on our financial performance during the development and ramp-up stages.
 

 16 
 
 
Our business is sensitive to
global or regional economic crises. A severe or prolonged downturn in the global, Taiwanese, or Asian economy could cause a sharp
reduction of expenditure on our planned resort and therefore materially and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.
 
The recent 2015 economic recession in China
has been challenging. Uncertainty in credit availability, rising unemployment and slow recovery from sluggish corporate operating
and earning performance in certain major economies have continued in 2016. Capital market volatility remains at high levels, as
a result of investors’ continued concerns about the systemic impact of potential long-term and wide-spread recession, geopolitical
issues, the availability and cost of credit, and the housing and mortgage markets. The weak economic outlook has negatively affected
business and consumer confidence and contributed to slow recoveries and low growth rates in most industries around the world.
 
Our contemplated resort is located in Miaoli
where the local economy heavily depends upon tourism, including international visitors from China, South Korea, Japan, United States
and other Southeastern Asian countries. Although there have been signs of recovery since the global financial debacle in 2007 originated
in United States, there are still great uncertainties regarding economic conditions and the demand for luxurious hotels and golf
courses in our targeted markets, such as Taiwan and China. Such uncertainties may adversely impact our results of operations of
the planned resort. Continued turbulence in the international markets may also adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition,
including our ability to access capital markets to meet our liquidity needs and fund the construction and development of our contemplated
resort.
 
We have not entered into any
construction contracts or negotiated with any construction companies regarding the construction of the Royal Country Club Spa &
Resort, which may increase the risk of delay.
 
We have not entered into any construction
contracts or negotiated with any construction companies regarding the construction of the Royal Country Club Spa & Resort,
which may increase the risk of delay. We currently have not made any plans regarding hiring construction companies, such other
engaging with a general contractor that will be responsible for finding subcontractors or directly with separate contractors that
will build different parts of the Royal Country Club Spa & Resort. If we did not find competent and diligent construction companies
for a reasonable price or found such companies after an extended period of time longer than we expected, it would increase the
risks of delaying the construction and operation of the Royal Country Club Spa & Resort.
 
Our contractors may face difficulties
in finding sufficient labor at acceptable cost, which could cause delays and increase construction costs of the Royal Country Club
Spa & Resort.
 
The contractors we intend to retain to
construct our Royal Country Club Spa & Resort may face difficulties in finding qualified construction laborers and managers,
as many projects commence construction in Taiwan and as substantial construction activities continue in China. Immigration and
labor regulations and political tension in Taiwan may cause our contractors to be unable to obtain sufficient laborers from China
to make up any gaps in available labor in Taiwan and to reduce costs of construction, which could cause delays and increase construction
costs of our projects.
 
We may encounter common risks
associated with construction of hotel buildings and facilities of similar scales.
 
We expect to be exposed to general risks
associated with construction of buildings and facilities for resorts, including but not limited to failure to obtain, or not obtaining
in a timely manner, the necessary government licenses, permits and approvals, construction delays, budget overruns and construction
contract disputes. In addition, we might experience increased holding costs as a result of delays. We have not yet entered into
all of the definitive contracts necessary for the construction and development of the resort, such as construction contracts and
recreational facility management contracts. We cannot assure you that we will be able to enter into definitive contracts with contractors
and consulting companies with sufficient skills, financial strength and experience on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.
We have not, and may not be able to, obtain guaranteed maximum price or fixed contract price terms on the construction contracts
for the resort, which could cause us to bear greater risks of cost overruns and construction delays. If we are unable to enter
into satisfactory construction contracts for the Royal Country Club Spa & Resort or are unable to closely control the construction
costs and timetable for the projects, our business, financial condition and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.
 

 17 
 
 
Our insurance coverage may
not be adequate to cover all losses that we may suffer from our planned Royal Country Club Spa & Resort. In addition, our insurance
costs may increase and we may not be able to obtain the same insurance coverage in the future.
 
We plan to purchase insurance policies
providing coverage for construction risks that we believe we may be subject to regarding the construction of the Royal Country
Club Spa & Resort. The insurance policies that we expect to purchase will include the life insurance for the construction workers
and executive officers, construction materials as well as buildings and fixtures under construction. However, this insurance coverage
may exclude certain types of loss and damage, such as loss or damage resulting from acts of terrorism or liability for death or
illness caused by contagious or infectious diseases. If loss or damage of those types were to occur, we could suffer significant
uninsured losses. Further, the cost of coverage may in the future become so high that we may be unable to maintain the insurance
policies we deem necessary for the construction and operations of our projects on commercially practicable terms, or at all, or
we may need reduce our policy limits or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage. We cannot assure you that any such insurance
policies we may obtain will be adequate to protect us from material losses.
 
Construction at our projects
is subject to hazards that may cause personal injury or loss of life, thereby subjecting us to liabilities and possible losses,
which may not be covered by our contemplated insurance policies.
 
The construction of large scale properties
such as our Royal Country Club Spa & Resort can be dangerous. Construction workers at our projects are subject to hazards that
may cause personal injury or loss of life, thereby subjecting the contractors and us to liabilities, possible losses, delays in
completion of the projects and negative publicity. We believe that we and our contractors take safety precautions that are consistent
with the industry practice, but these safety precautions may not be adequate to prevent serious personal injury or loss of life,
damage to property or delays. If any accidents occur during the construction of our projects, we may be subject to delays, including
delays imposed by regulators, liabilities and possible losses, which may not be covered by our insurance, and therefore our business,
prospects and reputation may be materially and adversely affected.
 
We need the Development Permit,
Construction License and Operation License to develop and operate the Royal Country Club Spa & Resort. If we do not obtain
the appropriate licenses and permits, we would not be able to construct and use the facilities as contemplated and therefore would
not be able to open and operate the resort as planned.
 
We are required to comply with real property
and zoning law to ensure that we can build and operate the Royal Country Club Spa & Resort as intended. According to the letter
issued from Chang Chen-Bin Architecture Firm dated October 3, 2016, we need to file our Development Plan of the Royal Country Club
Spa & Resort, the Land and Water Reservation Plan and the Environmental Impact Report with the Miaoli County to obtain the
Development Permit for our contemplated resort.
 
Chang Chen-Bin Architecture Firm plans
to file the Development Plan by December 31, 2016 and estimates that it may take approximately eight months to get the Development
Permit. The risks involved in obtaining the Development Permit are that the review process by a committee from the Miaoli County
may take longer than what the architecture firm has expected. If, for any reason, the Royal Country Club Spa & Resort operates
without the proper licenses and permits, it would be subject to fines ranging from 3% to 30% of the contract price and be further
required to obtain the necessary licenses and permits.
 
Upon obtaining the Development Permit,
Chang Chen-Bin Architecture Firm will apply for the Construction License to allow us to begin building the resort while Yi-Cheng
Huang, the Company’s consultant, simultaneously assists us in reclassifying our land as a special golf district for entertainment
purposes. The land reclassification allows construction on our land and the Construction License allows us to begin construction.
As explained below, our consultant estimates that it may take up to eighteen months from February 2016 to reclassify the land.
Failure to obtain any of the Development Permit, land reclassification or the Construction License would prevent us from constructing
any part of the resort as contemplated.
 
Once the resort is completed, Chang Chen-Bin
Architecture Firm will, on behalf of the Company, apply for the Operation License which will allow us to operate the resort as
currently contemplated.
 
We cannot assure you that we will be able
to obtain the Development Permit, Construction License and Operation License or obtain such permits and licenses in a timely manner.
If we did not successfully obtain any of the licenses or permits described herein in a timely manner, we would have to make abrupt
changes to our business plan and development strategy which would negatively impact our business and operations.
 

 18 
 
 
The simultaneous planning,
constructing and developing our Royal Country Club Spa & Resort and operating the golf course may strain our management time
and resources, which could lead to delays, increased costs and other inefficiencies in the development of the resort or operation
of the golf course.
 
The planning, designing and construction
of Phase I and Phase II of the Royal Country Club Spa & Resort will proceed simultaneously with our operation of the golf course.
This construction timetable enables us to maintain certain cash flow and revenue while the Royal Country Club Spa & Resort
is being constructed, however, this would entail a significant amount of time and resources from members of our management, which
may divert their attention from overseeing the day-to-day operations of the golf course.
 
We will need to recruit a substantial
number of new employees before each of our projects can open and competition may limit our ability to attract qualified management
and personnel.
 
We require extensive operational management
and staff to open and operate the resort. Accordingly, we need to undertake a major recruiting program before the opening of the
hotels and other comprising the Royal Country Club Spa & Resort. The pool of experienced hospitality and other skilled personnel
in Taiwan is limited. Many of our new personnel will occupy sensitive positions requiring qualifications sufficient to meet high
standards in the hospitality industry or will be required to possess other skills which entail substantial training and experience.
Moreover, competition to recruit and retain qualified hospitality and other personnel is likely to intensify further as competition
increases in the hospitality market in Taiwan. Other major resort hotels, such as a Renaissance hotel of the Marriott family in
Taipei, are expected to open in Taiwan at or around the same time as our resort. We cannot assure you that we will be able to attract
and retain a sufficient number of qualified individuals to operate our recreational and entertainment facilities or that costs
to recruit and retain such personnel will not increase. Our inability to attract and retain qualified employees and senior management
personnel could have a material adverse effect on our future business operations.
 
Our business depends substantially
on the continuing efforts of our senior management and IHG’s expertise, and our business may be severely disrupted if we
lose any of their services or if their other responsibilities cause them to be unable to devote sufficient time and attention to
the Company.
 
We place substantial reliance on the project
development and hospitality industry experience and knowledge of the Taiwan and Great Asia markets possessed by members of our
senior management team, including Chairman Mr. Fun-Ming Lo, and IHG, which agrees to provide hotel management, technical support
and operational services to our hotel to be completed first. The loss of the services of one or more of these members of our senior
management team could hinder our ability to effectively manage our current business and implement our growth and development strategies
as planned. Finding suitable replacements for Mr. Fun-Ming Lo or other members of our senior management could be difficult if
not impossible, and competition for personnel of similar experience could be intense.
 
We plan to, with assistance from IHG, start
recruiting hotel management and operation teams in the fourth quarter of 2017. We or IHG may fail to employ suitable or competent
talents to operate and manage any of our contemplated hotels and recreational facilities. The unsuccessful or less than satisfactory
operations of any of our planned business lines would exert adverse effect on the financial performance of our entire Company.
 
The lodging industry in Taiwan
is highly competitive and growing rapidly in the past few years, and if we are unable to compete successfully, our financial condition
and results of operations may be harmed.
 
The lodging industry in Taiwan is intensively
competitive in 2015 as the supply for lodging exceeded the demand according to a news article published on Win Shang News, one
of the real estate industry publications in China. In the past three years since 2013, more than one hundred brand new hotels have
been constructed per year in Taiwan. Many of the existing hotels in our targeted markets may be more fully developed and have more
revenue to finance ongoing operations than us. Upon opening of our hotels, we will compete primarily with other high end hotels
as well as full-service resorts where the competition is mainly based on location, room rates, entertainment facilities, brand
recognition, the quality of the accommodations and service levels. In addition, we may face competition from new entrants in the
upscale hotel segment and the golf resort segment in Taiwan. Furthermore, we compete with all other hotels for guests primarily
from Taiwan, China and Southeast Asian countries. Our typical business customers and leisure travelers may change their travel,
spending and consumption patterns and choose hotels in different segments. New and existing competitors may offer more competitive
rates, more comprehensive accommodation packages, greater convenience, services or amenities or superior facilities, which could
result in a decrease in occupancy and average daily rates of our hotel rooms. Any of these factors may have an adverse effect on
our competitive position, results of operations and financial condition.
 

 19 
 
 
Our financial and operating
performance may be adversely affected by epidemics, natural disasters and other catastrophes.
 
Our financial and operating performance
may be adversely affected by epidemics, natural disasters and other catastrophes, particularly in the location where we plan to
operate the resort.
 
Our business could be materially and adversely
affected by the outbreak of swine influenza, avian influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (“SARS”), or other
epidemics. In 2009, reports surfaced regarding occurrences of swine influenza and fears of a global pandemic. Cases of swine influenza
were later confirmed in numerous countries, including Taiwan and China. In early 2003, several economies in Asia, including Taiwan,
were affected by the outbreak of SARS. Taiwan adopted certain hygiene measures, including quarantining visitors from places where
any of the contagious diseases described above were rampant. Those restrictive measures adversely affected the performance of the
tourism and hospitality industries during that period. Any prolonged recurrence of such contagious disease or other adverse public
health developments in Taiwan or our targeted markets may have a material and adverse effect on our business operations. For example,
if any of our employees or customers was suspected of having contracted any contagious disease while he or she has worked or stayed
in our hotels, we might have been under certain circumstances required to quarantine our employees or customers that were affected
and the affected areas of our premises. Losses caused by epidemics, natural disasters and other catastrophes, including earthquakes
or typhoons, are either uninsurable or too expensive to justify insuring against in Taiwan. In the event of an uninsured loss or
a loss in excess of insured limits occurs, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a hotel or recreational
facility, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the hotel or facility. In that event, we might nevertheless remain obligated
for any financial commitments related thereto.
 
Similarly, wars (including the potential
of war), terrorist activity (including threats of terrorist activity), social unrest and heightened travel security measures instituted
in response, travel-related accidents, as well as geopolitical uncertainty and international conflict, will affect travel and may
in turn have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, we may not be adequately prepared
in contingency planning or recovery capability in relation to a major incident or crisis, and as a result, our operational continuity
may be adversely and materially affected, which in turn may harm our reputation.
 
If we are unable to access
funds to maintain our hotels’ condition and appearance as planned, the attractiveness of our hotels and our reputation could
suffer and our hotel occupancy rates may decline.
 
In order to maintain outstanding conditions
and appearance of our planned hotels, ongoing renovations and other leasehold improvements, including periodic replacement of furniture,
fixtures and equipment, will be required. Such investments and expenditures require ongoing funding and, to the extent we cannot
fund these expenditures from our existing cash or cash flow generated from operations, we must borrow or raise capital through
financing. We may not be able to access capital or willing to spend available capital when other higher prioritized projects require
the investment. If we fail to make investments necessary to maintain or improve the properties that we plan to build, our resort’s
attractiveness and reputation could deteriorate; we could lose our market share to our competitors and our hotel occupancy rates
and Rev PAR may decline.
 
Interruption or failure of
our information systems could impair our ability to effectively provide our services that are planned to be provided at the Royal
Country Club Spa & Resort, which could damage our reputation.
 
Our ability to provide consistent and high-quality
services and monitor our operations on a real-time basis for our resort, including the hotels, restaurants, golf course, conference
centers and other facilities, depends on the establishment and operations of our information technology systems, such as our web
property management, central reservation and customer relationship management systems. Any damage to or failure of our systems
could interrupt our inventory management, affect the manner of our services in terms of efficiency, consistency and quality, and
reduce our customer satisfaction.
 

 20 
 
 
Our technology platform will play a central
role in our management of inventory, revenues and loyalty programs. Furthermore, we will rely on our website and call center to
facilitate customer reservations. Our systems will be vulnerable to damages or interruptions as a result of power loss or telecommunications
failures and operations relying on the system such as reservation and billing will have to be conducted off-line or manually. Computer
viruses, fires, floods, earthquakes, interruptions in access to our toll-free numbers, hacking or other attempts to harm our systems,
and other similar events will potentially interfere with our normal business operations. Some of our systems will not be fully
redundant, and our disaster recovery plan does not account for all possible scenarios. Furthermore, our systems and technologies,
including our website and database, could contain undetected errors or “bugs” that could adversely affect their performance,
or could become outdated and we may not be able to replace or introduce upgraded systems as quickly as our competitors or within
budgeted costs for such upgrades. If we experience system failures, our quality of services, customer satisfaction, and operational
efficiency could be severely harmed, which could also adversely affect our reputation.
 
If the value of our products
and services or image thereof diminishes, it could have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
 
We plan to offer two hotels, amenities
and entertainment facilities that are designed to target elite customers. Our success in establishing, maintaining and enhancing
our brand and image depends, to a large extent, on our ability to satisfy customer needs by further developing and maintaining
our innovative and distinctive products and maintaining consistent premium quality of services across our resort, as well as our
ability to respond to competitive pressures. If we were unable to do so, our occupancy rates might have declined, which could in
turn have adversely affected our results of operations. Our business might have also been adversely affected if our public image
or reputation were to be diminished by the insufficient or ineffective operations of any part of our resort, whether due to unsatisfactory
service, accidents or otherwise. If the value of our products or image was diminished or our products did not appeal to customers,
our results of operations might have been materially and adversely affected.
 
We are subject to various hospitality,
construction, hygiene, safety and environmental laws and regulations that may subject us to liability.
 
Our contemplated resort business is subject
to various compliance and operational requirements under Taiwanese laws. For example, See “Regulation — Regulations
on Hotel Operations.” Furthermore, new regulations may be adopted in the future to increase our compliance efforts at significant
costs. If certain of our hotels were not in full compliance with all of the applicable requirements, such as environmental, health
and safety laws, we might have been subject to potentially significant monetary damages and fines or the suspension of operations
and development activities of the Company.
 
The growth of third-party online
and other hotel reservation intermediaries and travel consolidators may adversely affect our margins and profitability.
 
IHG or other hotel management teams may
have some of our hotel rooms booked through third-party online and other hotel reservation intermediaries and consolidators to
whom we pay commissions for such services. They may be able to negotiate higher commissions, reduced room rates, or other significant
concessions from us. We believe that such intermediaries and consolidators would attempt to develop and increase customer loyalty
toward their reservation systems rather than ours. As a result, the growth and increasing importance of these travel intermediaries
and consolidators may adversely affect our ability to control the supply and pricing of our room inventory, which would in turn
adversely affect our margins and profitability.
 
Risks Relating to Our Golf Operations
 
Economic recessions or downturns
could negatively affect our golf business, financial condition and results of the golf operations.
 
A substantial portion of our revenue is
derived from discretionary or leisure spending by golfers and such spending can be particularly sensitive to changes in general
economic conditions. An economic downturn in Taiwan could result in slower business activities, increased unemployment, concerns
about inflation and energy costs and lower consumer confidence. Any such downturn is likely to result in reduced spending on leisure
activities, such as golfing. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely
affected by such an economic downturn. With reduced number of golfers on our golf course during an economic downturn, we may be
unable to increase our fees, which may contribute to decreased revenues and financial losses.
 

 21 
 
 
We may not be able to attract
and retain golfers to utilize our golf properties when we start construction of the Royal Country Club Spa & Resort, which
could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
The level of attractiveness of our golf
course to the market is critically important to our success. Our success heavily depends on our ability to retain existing players
and attract new customers to our golf properties. Changes in consumer tastes and preferences, particularly those affecting the
popularity of golf, dining options and other social trends, could adversely affect our business. In addition, the contemplated
Phase I and Phase II construction could dissuade our clients because transporting construction resources and the construction itself
may generate the noise, untidy environment and interruption to the golf activities although Phase I construction will be conducted
away from the golf course and the golf course will be closed during the Phase II construction period.
 
Certain factors beyond our
control may change consumer spending patterns, particularly in the area of discretionary expenditures for leisure and recreation,
resulting in potential reduced demand for our golf services.
 
Certain factors beyond our control may
change consumer spending patterns, particularly in the area of discretionary expenditures for leisure and recreation, resulting
in potential reduced demand for our golf services. These factors include:
 

·natural disasters, such as earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, typhoons, wild fires and floods;

·outbreaks of pandemic or contagious diseases, such as avian or swine flu; and

·terrorist activities or threats and heightened travel security measures instituted in response to these events.
 
These factors and other global, national
and regional conditions may adversely affect individual golf properties, or certain regions or industries as a whole. Any one or
more of these factors could limit or reduce the demand for our services and in turn could harm our business and results of operations.
 
Unusual weather patterns and
extreme weather conditions as well as seasonality could adversely affect the demand for our golf services or impact our business
and results of operations and our ADS price.
 
Our operations of the golf course are susceptible
to seasonal and severe weather patterns. Extreme weather conditions, such as heavy rains, extremely high temperature and droughts,
could reduce our revenues by interrupting or interfering activities on our premises, which could negatively impact our business
and operations. Our golf course business usually declines during winters when the daytime is short and temperature is low. With
respect to seasonality, April under which the Strawberry Season falls accounts for a higher percentage of our revenues than other
months of the year.
 
Particularly, our golf course is sensitive
to availability of water. A significantly large quantity of water is needed to maintain the condition of turf grass at a satisfactory
level to entertain golfers. Despite of access to natural lakes, our ability to irrigate our golf course could be adversely impacted
by a drought or water shortage caused by human, such as government imposed water restrictions. A severe drought over an extensive
duration could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
 
Competition in the golf industry
could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
 
We will operate in a significantly competitive
industry and will compete primarily on the basis of reputation, featured facilities, location, quality and breadth of product offerings
and pricing. As a result, competition for market share in the golf industry is intensive. To succeed, we must have a strong position
respecting the market share of golfing and develop new golfers in the Taiwan market. The number of golf properties in our geographic
region may exceed the demand thereof, which could significantly impact our ability to attract and retain golfers.
 
Increases in our cost of goods,
water, utilities and taxes could reduce our operating margins and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Increases in operating costs due to inflation
and other factors may not be directly offset by increased revenue. We anticipate that our operating costs will include labor, cost
of goods, water, utilities and taxes. Many, and in some cases all, of the factors affecting these costs will be beyond our control.
If we are not able to pass along increased costs to our customers in the form of higher prices or others, our operating margins
would suffer, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 

 22 
 
 
The prices of utilities are volatile and
shortages of utilities occur sometimes. In particular, our golf properties may be subject to restrictions regarding the use of
water for irrigation. Significant increases in the costs of our utilities or any shortages could interrupt or curtail our operations
and lower our operating margins, which would have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
We are in the process of amending
our licenses and permits for the formal golf operation, the denial of or delay of obtaining any of which would cause disruptive
impact on our current business operation and therefore harm our business and result of operations.
 
We received the Development Permit and
five Construction Licenses to build a 36-hole golf course and three Operation Licenses for the 18-hole golf course which has been
in operation since its establishment. Due to policy changes and ownership disputes over certain lots of land inside the territory
of the planned 36-hole golf course, we had to switch from the original plan of a 36-hole golf course to the plan of an 18-hole
golf course. As a result of the change of plan, we applied and obtained the new Development Permit for the 18-hole golf course,
which had been completed as part of the planned 36-hole golf course. We are currently in the process of amending the Construction
License and the Land and Water Reservation Plan in order to reclassify the land as golf special district for entertainment purposes.
After reclassification of the land, we will apply for the Operation License from the Miaoli County to operate the 18-hole golf
course on a full scale.
 
Presently we are operating the golf course
on a test basis, and as such, we are not permitted to host golf tournaments. Yi-Cheng Huang, a consultant who is in charge of obtaining
all the licenses and permits for the 18-hole golf course, estimates that it would take approximately 18 months from February 2016
to reclassify the land. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain all the license and permits to operate the existing
golf course on a full scale. Failure to obtain or obtain in a timely fashion all necessary licenses and permits will prevent or
delay the process of operating our golf course with all of its functionality.
 
The construction of Phase I
of the Royal Country Club Spa &Resort may interrupt the regular operation of the golf course and therefore is likely to cause
adverse impact on the operation results of the golf course.
 
The management of our Company plans to
construct the hotel and other facilities for Phase I of Royal Country Club Spa &Resort during which the golf course remains
in operation. Although the construction site of Phase I is located to the north of the golf course and does not have any overlapping
area with the golf course, there is possibility that the construction will cause disruptive or interruptive impact to golfing activities
on the Royal Country Club. The noise, extra traffic, dust, dirt and waste caused by the construction project will likely have adverse
impact on our golfing activities. We cannot guarantee that the construction of Phase I will not harm our operation results of the
golf course during the period thereof.
 
Accidents or injuries at our
golf properties or in connection with our operations may subject as to liability, and accidents or injuries could negatively impact
our reputation and play at our golf properties, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
There are risks of accidents or injuries
on our golf properties or in connection with our operations and activities, including but not limited to injuries caused by slips
and falls on our premises. If accidents or injuries occur on our golf properties, we may be held liable for costs related to the
injuries. Although Yao-Teh has purchased liability insurance against injuries caused by accidents occurred on the golf course,
property insurance against damages to the properties on the premises and insurance against terrorist attacks for the year ended
June 2017, there can be no assurance that the coverage will be sufficient to pay off all or any of its liabilities during the insured
period or Yao-Teh will obtain any such insurance at a reasonable price after the insured period. Our business, financial condition
and results of operations could be harmed to the extent that claims and associated expenses resulting from accidents or injuries
exceed our current insurance coverage if there is any.
 

 23 
 
 
Our operations will subject
us to environmental regulations, which create uncertainty regarding our future environmental expenses and liabilities.
 
Our golf properties are regulated by certain
environmental laws. We may be required to incur costs to comply with these laws, such as laws related to water resources, discharges
to air, water and land; the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, and, possibly, the cleanup of properties affected
by regulated materials. Pursuant to the environmental requirements, we may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or
toxic substances on or chemical releases from our golf properties. Environmental laws may impose on us the clean-up responsibility
and liability without regard to whether the relevant entity knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants. We may use certain
substances and generate certain wastes that may be deemed hazardous or toxic pursuant to such laws, and in the future we may incur
costs related to cleaning up contamination resulting from historical uses of our golf properties and for our treatment, storage
or disposal of wastes on any of our golf properties when they were owned by other preceding entities. The costs of investigation,
remediation or renewal of regulated materials may be substantial and the presence of any such substances, or the failure to remediate
any golf property properly, may impair our ability to use our golf properties. We may be required to incur costs to remediate potential
environmental hazards, mitigate environmental risks in the future, or comply with other environmental requirements.
 
Our insurance on the golf business
may not be adequate to cover all the losses that we may suffer from our golf operations.
 
We currently have property insurance on
the golfing machinery and equipment, accidental fire insurance on our real property and fixtures and accident insurance on all
of our personal and real property. If we incur losses or damages for which we are held liable for amounts exceeding the limits
of our insurance coverage, or for claims outside the scope of our insurance coverage, our business and results of operations could
be materially and adversely affected. For example, certain casualty events, such as labor strikes, nuclear events, acts of war,
loss of income due to cancellation of golf reservations, deterioration or corrosion of the golf course land, insect or animal damages
and pollution may not be covered under our policies. As a result, certain acts and events could expose us to significant uninsured
losses. In addition to the damages caused directly by a casualty loss such as acts of war or terrorism, we may suffer a disruption
of our business as a result of these events or be subject to claims by third parties who may be injured or harmed. While we intend
to obtain business interruption insurance and general liability insurance, such insurance may not be available on commercially
reasonable terms, or at all, and, in any event, may not be adequate to cover all losses that may result from such events.
 
Our costs and expenses may
remain constant or increase even if our revenues decline, which would adversely affect our net margins and results of operations.
 
A significant portion of our operating
costs, including leases and employee base salaries, is fixed. Accordingly, a decrease in revenues could result in a disproportionately
higher decrease in our earnings because our operating costs and expenses are unlikely to decrease proportionately. For example,
winter time before the Chinese New Year generally accounts for a lower portion of our annual revenues than other time of the year,
but our expenses do not vary as significantly with changes in occupancy and revenues as we need to continue to pay equipment leases
and employee salaries, make regular repairs, maintenance and renovations and invest in other improvements throughout the year to
maintain the attractiveness of our contemplated hotels. Furthermore, our property development and renovation costs may increase
as a result of an increase in the cost of materials. However, we have limited ability to pass the increased portion of the costs
to customers through golf admission fee or membership fee increases. Therefore, our costs and expenses may remain constant or increase
even if our revenues decline, which would adversely affect our net margins and results of operations.
 
Risks Relating to Doing Business Outside
of the United States
 
Because our headquarters are
located outside of the U.S. and our business will be conducted outside of the U.S., we are subject to the risks of doing business
internationally, including periodic foreign economic downturns and political instability, which may adversely affect our revenue
and cost of doing business in Taiwan.
 

 24 
 
 
Foreign economic downturns may affect our
results of operations in the future. Additionally, other facts relating to the operation of our business outside of the U.S. may
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including:
 

·international economic and political changes;

·the imposition of governmental controls or changes in government regulations, including tax laws,
regulations and treaties;

·changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements regarding golf properties
and resort properties;

·compliance with U.S. and international laws involving international operations, including the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act and export control laws;

·difficulties in achieving headcount reductions due to unionized labor and works councils;

·restrictions on transfers of funds and assets between jurisdictions; and

·China- Taiwan geo-political instability.
 
As we continue to operate our business
globally, our success will depend in part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these risks. The impact of any one
or more of these factors could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
We face substantial political
risks associated with doing business in Taiwan, particularly due to domestic political events and the rigid relationship between
the R.O.C. and the P.R.C. that could negatively affect our operations and the value of your investment.
 
Our principal executive office and substantially
all of our assets are located in Taiwan and substantially all of our revenues are derived from our operations in Taiwan. Accordingly,
our business, financial condition and results of operations and the market price of our ADSs may be affected by changes in governmental
policies, taxation, inflation or interest rates, social instability and diplomatic and social developments in or affecting Taiwan.
 
For example, in 2006, a mass movement formed
calling for the resignation of the president of Taiwan over a series of alleged corruption scandals and staged dramatic protests.
In addition, Taiwan has a unique international political status. Since 1949, Taiwan and mainland China, or P.R.C., have been separately
governed by different political parties. The P.R.C. claims that it is the sole government in China, including Taiwan, while some
political parties in R.O.C. claim R.O.C.’s independence or R.O.C. as the only legitimate government of China, including Taiwan
and China. There was a time when the two governments prohibited all and any of trades, transactions and trips crossing the Taiwan
Strait. Although significant economic and cultural relations have been established in the recent years between the R.O.C. and the
P.R.C., relations have often been strained. The P.R.C. government has refused to renounce the use of military force to regain control
over Taiwan. Furthermore, the P.R.C. government has passed an Anti-Secession Law in March, 2005, which has authorized the government
to use all necessary measures, including non-peaceful means, against Taiwan’s independence movement in the event of such
declaration. In February of 2006, the then president of Taiwan ceased all activities in the country’s National Unification
Council, a committee established to assist Taiwan in its efforts to reunite with the P.R.C. Such cessation is commonly viewed as
having a detrimental effect on the relations between the two sides. Some of past development of the relationship between the R.O.C.
and the P.R.C. has depressed the market prices of the securities of several Taiwanese companies. The recent situation of no dialogue
between Taiwan and mainland China is followed by an approximate 30% decline of arrivals from mainland China to Taiwan in 2016.1
Such unstable relationship between the R.O.C. and the P.R.C. could materially and adversely affect our financial condition
and results of operations, as well as the market price and the liquidity of our securities.

Sees 30% Decline in Tourists from China: Here’s the Impact, Forbes, Jul.

Adverse changes in the political
and economic policies of China could have a material and adverse effect on the overall economic growth of China, which could adversely
affect our competitive position.
 
Chinese economy differs from the economies
of most developed countries in many respects, including the level of governmental involvement, the growth rate, control of foreign
exchange rates and the methods of allocating resources. For instance, the P.R.C. government exercises significant control over
its economic growth through the allocation of resources, control of incurrence and payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations,
establishment of monetary policy and provision of preferential treatment to particular industries. Changes in any of these policies,
laws and regulations could adversely affect the overall economy in the P.R.C., including the golf industry in which we operate
and the hospitality industry into which we plan to enter. While the Chinese economy has grown significantly in the past thirty
years, the growth has not been consistent. Recently, Chinese economy is going through a significant downturn, which has had negative
effects on other economies in the world.
 
Approximately 40% of our customers are
from the P.R.C. Accordingly, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects are subject to economic, political
and legal developments in China. Although the Chinese economy is no longer a planned economy, the Chinese government continues
to exercise significant control over its economic growth through direct allocation of resources, monetary and tax policies, restrictions
on foreign investment in certain industries, limitations on foreign currency exchanges, and restrictions on the development of
specific industries or markets.
 
In response to the economic downturn, the
P.R.C. government has adopted certain policies to stimulate the economic growth in China. If the Chinese policies fail to achieve
any of the goals and any aspect of the policies limits the growth of our industries or otherwise negatively affects our businesses,
our growth rate, strategy or results of operations could be adversely affected.
 
We cannot assure you that any of the various
monetary policies and economic stimulus actions adopted by the Chinese government will be effective to bring back the Chinese economy
on a fast growth track as it was.
 
We may be exposed to liabilities
under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and Chinese anti-corruption law.
 
We are subject to the FCPA, and other laws
that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments, foreign government officials and political parties
by U.S. persons as defined by the statute for purposes of obtaining or retaining businesses. We are also subject to Chinese anti-corruption
law, which strictly prohibits bribes to government officials. We may have agreements with third parties who may make sales in China
and U.S., during the process of which we may be exposed to corruption. Activities in Taiwan create the risk of unauthorized payments
or offers of payments by an employee, consultant or agent of the Company, because these parties are not always subject to our control.
 
Although we believe to date we have complied
in all material aspects with the provisions of the FCPA and Chinese anti-corruption law, our existing safeguards and any future
improvements may prove to be less than effective and any of our employees, consultants or agents may engage in corruptive conduct
for which we might be held responsible. Violations of the FCPA or Chinese anti-corruption law may result in severe criminal or
civil sanctions against the Company and individuals and therefore could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial
condition. In addition, the Taiwanese government may seek to hold us liable as a successor for FCPA violations committed by companies
in which we invest or which we acquire.
 
If we become directly subject
to the recent scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity involving U.S.-listed Chinese companies, we may have to expend significant
resources to investigate and resolve the matters. Any unfavorable results from the investigations could harm our business operations,
this offering and our reputation.
 
Recently, U.S. public companies that have
substantially all of their operations in China, have been subjects of intense scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity by investors,
financial commentators and regulatory agencies, such as the SEC. Much of the scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity has centered
on financial and accounting irregularities, lack of effective internal control over financial accountings, inadequate corporate
governance and ineffective implementation thereof and, in many cases, allegations of fraud. As a result of enhanced scrutiny, criticism
and negative publicity, the publicly traded stocks of many U.S. listed Chinese companies have sharply decreased in value and, in
some cases, have become virtually worthless or illiquid. Many of these companies are now subject to shareholder lawsuits and SEC
enforcement actions and are conducting internal and external investigations into the allegations. It is not clear what effects
the sector-wide investigations will have on our Company, our business and this offering. If we become a subject of any unfavorable
allegations, whether such allegations are proven to be true or untrue, we will have to expend significant resources to investigate
such allegations and defend the Company. If such allegations were not proven to be groundless, the Company and our business operations
would be severely hampered and the price of your stock of the Company could decline substantially. If such allegations were proven
to be groundless, the investigation might have significantly distracted our management’s attention.
 

 26 
 
 
International operations expose
us to currency exchange and repatriation risks, and we cannot predict the effect of future exchange rate fluctuations on our business
and operating results.
 
We have substantially all business operations
in Taiwan. We have exposure to currency fluctuations because our sales and purchases are denominated in New Taiwan Dollars. We
cannot assure you that the effect of currency exchange fluctuations will not materially affect our revenues and net income in the
future.
 
If Taiwan’s transportation
infrastructure does not adequately support the development of Taiwan’s hospitality industry, visitation to Taiwan may not
increase as currently expected, which may cause our projects to be unsuccessful.
 
Taiwan is an island and separated by Taiwan
Strait, a strait of 180 kilometers (111.85 miles) in width, from China. Therefore air transportation plays a critical role in its
external relations. There are many civilian airports in Taiwan, two of which are international, Taoyuan International Airport (“TPE”)
and Kaohsiung International Airport (“KHH”), serving approximately 97 international air routes with coverage of China,
United States, Japan, Singapore, Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia and Hong Kong. Three main railway lines in Taiwan, West Line,
East Line and South Circle Line, together with branch railway lines, form a complete circle on the island. Numerous long distance
buses and local bus lines serve the need for ground transportation.
 
To support Taiwan’s planned transformation
into a mass-market tourism destination, the frequency of bus, plane and ferry services to Taiwan must increase significantly. In
addition, Taiwan’s internal road system is prone to congestion and collapses or landslides under severe weather conditions
and therefore must be substantially improved to support projected increases in traffic. While various projects are under development
to improve Taiwan’s internal and external transportation links, these projects may not be approved, financed or constructed
in time to handle the projected increase in demand for transportation or at all, which could impede the expected increase in visitation
to Taiwan and cause our Royal Country Club Spa & Resort to be not as successful as expected.
 
Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness
 
Our current, projected and
potential future indebtedness could impair our financial condition, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our
significant leverage.
 
We expect to incur, based on current budgets
and estimates, secured or unsecured long-term indebtedness, including a portion of approximately US$ 150,000,000 primarily for
the development and construction of Phase II of the Royal Country Club Spa & Resort.
 
Our significant indebtedness
could have important consequences to you. For example, it could:
 

·increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;
 

·impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital needs, capital
expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate purposes;
 

·require us to divert a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal
and interest on our debt, which would reduce the funds available to us for our operations or investment in operations;
 

 27 
 
 

·limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our golf and hospitality businesses
and the industries thereof;
 

·subject us to higher interest expense in the event of increases in interest rates to the extent
a portion of our debt will bear interest at variable rates;
 

·cause us to incur additional expenses by hedging interest rate exposures of our debt and exposure
to hedging counterparties’ failure to pay under such hedging arrangements, which would reduce the funds available for our
operations; and
 

·in the event we or one of our subsidiaries were to default over secured indebtedness, result in
the loss of all or a substantial portion of our and our Subsidiaries’ assets, in which our lenders would take security interest.
 
Servicing the debt of our Subsidiaries
requires a significant amount of cash, and our subsidiaries may not generate a sufficient level of cash flow from their businesses
to make scheduled payments on their debt.
 
On July 9, 1991, Yao-Teh entered a
four-year loan agreement with Taiwan Business Bank to borrow an amount of NTD$380,620,000 (approximately $11,607,807) to
purchase land for the development and construction of the Royal Country Club. In turn Taiwan Business Bank held a mortgage on
Yao-Teh’s land to secure its loan. The loan went into default on July 8, 1995. On June 24, 2013, Yao-Teh entered into a
five-year repayment schedule with Taiwan Business Bank to repay the principal and interest of the loan in an amount of
$8,357,622. As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, Yao-Teh’s remaining loan balance with Taiwan Business Bank were
$1,438,166 and $1,698,149 respectively. In addition, Yao-Teh had three defaulted loans with aggregate unpaid outstanding
balances of $2,772,004 and $2,987,782 as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. With respect to notes payable,
Yao-Teh had two notes outstanding due to two individuals in an aggregate amount of $29,761,666 as of December 31, 2015. One
of the individual lenders held liens on the golf course to secure its loan, which is overdue and currently under
negotiation.
 
On December 23, 2011, Ta-Teh-Fu renewed
its five-year term loan balance with Taiwan Cooperative Bank and converted it into revolving line of credit subject to annual renewal,
which is secured by twenty-six parcels of land owned by Ta-Teh-Fu in aggregate of 1.41 acre and guaranteed by Shu-Hui Chou, the
sole managing members of Ta-Teh-Fu and Ms. Chou’s brother. As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, Ta-Teh-Fu had outstanding
balances against Taiwan Cooperative Bank in amounts of $1,898,821 and $1,949,985, respectively.
 
Each of our Subsidiaries’ ability
to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance their indebtedness depends on our Subsidiaries’
future performance, which is subject to certain economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our Subsidiaries
may not generate enough cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service their debt and make necessary capital expenditures.
If they are unable to generate such cash flow, our subsidiaries may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling
the secured assets, restructuring debt, incurring additional indebtedness or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that
may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our Subsidiaries’ ability to refinance their indebtedness will also depend on the financial
markets and their financial condition at such time. Our Subsidiaries may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage
in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our Subsidiaries’ debt obligations and a material
adverse effect on the value of our ADSs.
 
Default of any loans that are
secured by any of our Subsidiaries’ land could materially and adversely affect our operations, development plans and our
financial condition.
 
If there is a default under one of our
Subsidiaries’ secured debt facilities, the holder of the debt on which we defaulted may cause all amounts outstanding with
respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately as the terms of the loan permit. Further, if we are unable to repay, refinance
or restructure our indebtedness at our Subsidiaries that own or operate our properties, the lenders with those secured debt facilities
could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness. In that event, the change of the ownership or control of such
land will adversely impact or disrupt our business operations.
 
Our ability to continue as
a company depends on the availability of future financing and the success of our future operations.
 
Our auditor has issued a going concern
opinion on our Combined Financial Statements for the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, which is premised on our ability to
recover the Company’s assets and satisfy the liabilities in the ordinary course of business. This basis presumes that funds
will be available to finance ongoing research, development, operations, expansions and capital expenditures and permit the realization
of assets and payments of liabilities in the ordinary course of operations for the foreseeable future.
 
The ability of the Company to continue
as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to successfully secure sources of financing and attain profitable operations.
However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining the necessary financing on reasonable terms and operating
profitable businesses.
 
We have accumulated a large
amount of debts owed to its shareholders, which are due upon demand.
 
Our two Subsidiaries, Yao-Teh and Ta-Teh-Fu,
have advanced funds from certain shareholders for working capital purposes. Both Subsidiaries have not entered into any written
agreement with these shareholders in respect of the advances, which as of December 31, 2015, were $44,612,575. The advances are
due upon demand by the shareholders although they bear no interest. We would face financial hardship if any of the shareholders
who advanced funds to us demanded repayments of a substantial amount at the same time or within a short period of time. In order
to repay the advances if demanded, we may divert part of our working capital to pay off the debts due and as a result, our financial
operations will be substantially interrupted due to lack of operating capital.
 

 28 
 
 
The terms of our and our Subsidiaries’
indebtedness may restrict our current and future operations and harm our ability to complete our projects and grow our business
operations to compete successfully against our competitors.
 
We may enter into security documents that
contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on the operations of the
golf course and/or the resort contemplated. The common covenants in security documents generally restrict or limit, among other
things, our and our Subsidiaries’ ability to:
 

·incur additional debt, including guarantees;
 

·create security or liens that are senior to the security or encumbrances created thereby;
 

·dispose of assets without proper consents;
 

·make certain acquisitions and investments;
 

·pay dividends, including to our shareholders and ADS holders, during the construction of the Royal
Country Club Spa & Resort;
 

·make other restricted payments or apply revenues earned in one part of our operations to fund development
costs or operating losses in another part of our operations;
 

·enter into sale and leaseback transactions;
 

·engage in new businesses;
 

·issue preferred stock; and
 

·enter into transactions with shareholders and affiliates.
 
In addition, the covenants may include
some of the following financial covenants, including requirements that we satisfy certain tests or ratios such as maximum capital
expenditures test, a maximum leverage ratio, minimum interest and debt service coverage ratios. These covenants described herein
may restrict our ability to operate and restrict our ability to incur additional debt or equity financing and impede our growth.
 
Risks Related to This Offering
 
There has been no public market
for our ordinary shares or ADSs prior to this offering, and you may not be able to resell our ADSs at or above the price you will
have paid, or at all.
 
Prior to this initial public offering,
there has been no public market for our ordinary shares or ADSs. We have applied to have our ADSs listed on the NASDAQ Market.
Our ordinary shares will not be listed or quoted for trading on any exchange. If an active trading market for our ADSs does not
develop after this offering, the market price and liquidity of our ADSs will be materially and adversely affected.
 
The initial public offering price for our
ADSs will be determined by negotiations between us and the Underwriter and may bear no relationship to the market price for our
ADSs after the initial public offering. We cannot assure you that an active trading market for our ADSs will develop or that the
market price of our ADSs will not decline below the initial public offering price.
 
We will incur increased costs
as a result of becoming a public company, which may adversely affect our profitability.
 
Our profitability may be affected as a
result of our becoming a public company. We anticipate incurring a significantly greater amount of legal, accounting and other
expenses than we did as a private company, including costs associated with our public company reporting requirements and investor
relations activities, independent registered public accounting firm fees, registrar and transfer agent fees, incremental director
and officer liability insurance costs, and director compensation. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as new rules subsequently
implemented by the SEC and the NASDAQ Global Market, has required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies.
We expect these new rules and regulations to increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs and to make certain
corporate activities more time-consuming and costly. We are currently evaluating and monitoring developments with respect to these
new rules, and cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs, which may adversely
affect our profitability.
 

 29 
 
 
If we fail to maintain an effective
system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud.
 
Upon completion of this initial public
offering, we will become a public company in the United States and subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act (“Section 404”) will require that we include a report from management on our internal control over financial
reporting in our annual report on Form 20-F beginning with our annual report for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. In addition,
our independent registered public accounting firm must report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
Our management or our independent registered public accounting firm may conclude that our internal controls are not effective.
Moreover, even if our management concludes that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, our independent registered
public accounting firm may issue a report that is qualified if it is not satisfied with our internal controls or the level at which
our controls are documented, designed, operated or reviewed, or if it interprets the relevant requirements differently from us.
Either of these possible outcomes could result in an adverse reaction in the financial marketplace due to a loss of investor confidence
in the reliability of our reporting processes, which could materially and adversely affect the trading price of our ADSs.
 
In addition, our reporting obligations
as a public company will place a significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources and systems in the foreseeable
future. Prior to this offering, we have been a private company with limited accounting personnel and other resources with which
to address our internal control over financial reporting. We prepared financial statements under accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) as of and for the two years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.
We may identify control deficiencies as a result of the assessment process we will undertake in compliance with Section 404. We
plan to remedy any identified control deficiencies before the deadline imposed by the requirements of Section 404, but we may be
unable to do so. Our failure to establish and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could result
in the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial reporting processes, which in turn could harm our business
and negatively impact the trading price of our ADSs.
 
The market price for our ADSs
may be volatile.
 
The market price for our ADSs may be volatile
and subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors including the following:
 

·actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results;

·changes in financial estimates by securities research analysts;

·conditions and restrictions in the golf and lodging industries;

·changes in the economic performance or market valuations of other lodging companies;

·announcements by us or our competitors of new products, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint
ventures or capital commitments;

·addition or departure of key personnel;

·fluctuations of exchange rates between the New Taiwan Dollars (“NTD”) and U.S.
dollar or other foreign currencies;

·potential litigation or administrative investigations;

·release of lock-up or other transfer restrictions on our outstanding ADSs or ordinary shares or
sales of additional ADSs; and

·general economic conditions in Taiwan and political tension between Taiwan and China .
 
In addition, the securities market has
from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are not related to the operating performance of particular
companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our ADSs.
 

 30 
 
 
Because the initial public
offering price is substantially higher than our net tangible book value per share, you will incur immediate and substantial dilution.
 
The initial public offering price per ADS
is substantially higher than the net tangible book value per ADS prior to the offering. Accordingly, if you purchase our ADSs in
this offering, you will incur immediate dilution of approximately $ in the net tangible book value per ADS from the price you pay
for our ADSs, representing the difference between:
 

·the assumed initial public offering price of $______per ADS (the midpoint of the estimated initial
public offering price range set forth on the front cover of this prospectus), and
 

·the pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per ADS of $_______as of December 31, 2015.
 
If we issue additional ADSs in the future,
you may experience further dilution. In addition, you may experience further dilution to the extent that ordinary shares are issued
upon the exercise of the Underwriter Warrants. You may find additional information in the section entitled “Dilution”
in this prospectus.
 
We may need additional capital,
and the sale of additional ADSs or other equity securities could result in additional dilution to our ADS holders and the incurrence
of additional indebtedness could increase our debt obligations.
 
We can give no assurance that our current
cash and cash equivalents, anticipated cash flow from operations and the proceeds from this offering will be sufficient to meet
our anticipated cash needs for the foreseeable future. We may require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions
or other future developments, including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue. If our resources are insufficient
to satisfy our capital requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain a credit facility. The
sale of additional equity and equity-linked securities could result in additional dilution to our shareholders. The incurrence
of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in operating and financing covenants that would
restrict our operations. We cannot assure you that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all,
particularly in the aftermath of global economic crisis.
 
Future sales or issuances,
or perceived future sales or issuances, of substantial amounts of our ordinary shares or ADSs could adversely affect the price
of our ADSs.
 
If our existing shareholders sell, or are
perceived as intending to sell, substantial amounts of our ordinary shares or ADSs, following this offering, the market price of
our ADSs could fall. Such sales, or perceived potential sales, by our existing shareholders might make it more difficult for us
to issue new equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and place we deem appropriate. The ADSs offered in this
offering will be eligible for immediate resale in the public market without restrictions, and shares held by our existing shareholders
may also be sold in the public market in the future subject to the restrictions contained in Rule 144 and Rule 701 under the Securities
Act and the applicable lock-up agreements. If any existing shareholder or shareholders sell a substantial amount of ordinary shares
after the expiration of the lock-up period, the prevailing market price for our ADSs could be adversely affected. See “Shares
Eligible for Future Sale” and “Underwriting” for additional information regarding resale restrictions.
 
You may not have the same voting
rights as the holders of our ordinary shares and may not receive voting materials in time to be able to exercise your right to
vote.
 
Except as described in this prospectus
and in the deposit agreement, holders of our ADSs will not be able to exercise voting rights attaching to the shares evidenced
by our ADSs on an individual basis. Holders of our ADSs will appoint the depositary or its nominee as their representative to exercise
the voting rights attaching to the shares represented by the ADSs. You may not receive voting materials in time to instruct the
depositary to vote, and it is possible that you, or persons who hold their ADSs through brokers, dealers or other third parties,
will not have the opportunity to exercise a right to vote.
 
You may not be able to participate
in rights offerings and may experience dilution of your holdings as a result.
 
We may from time to time distribute rights
to our shareholders, including rights to acquire our securities. Under the deposit agreement for the ADSs, the depositary will
not offer those rights to ADS holders unless both the rights and the underlying securities to be distributed to ADS holders are
either registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or exempt from registration under the Securities Act with respect
to all holders of ADSs. We are under no obligation to file a registration statement with respect to any such rights or underlying
securities or to endeavor to cause such a registration statement to be declared effective. In addition, we may not be able to take
advantage of any exemptions from registration under the Securities Act. Accordingly, holders of our ADSs may be unable to participate
in our rights offerings and may experience dilution in their holdings as a result.
 

 31 
 
 
You may be subject to limitations
on transfer of your ADSs.
 
Your ADSs are transferable on the books
of the depositary. However, the depositary may close its transfer books at any time or from time to time when it deems expedient
in connection with the performance of its duties. In addition, the depositary may refuse to deliver, transfer or register transfers
of ADSs generally when our books or the books of the depositary are closed, or at any time if we or the depositary deem it advisable
to do so because of any requirement of law or of any government or governmental body, or under any provision of the deposit agreement,
or for any other reason.
 
As a foreign private issuer,
we are permitted to, and we will, rely on exemptions from certain NASDAQ corporate governance standards applicable to U.S. issuers,
including the requirement regarding the implementation of a nominating committee. This may afford less protection to holders of
our ordinary shares and ADSs.
 
The NASDAQ Marketplace Rules in general
require listed companies to have, among other things, a nominating committee consisting solely of independent directors. As a foreign
private issuer, we are permitted to, and we will, follow home country corporate governance practices instead of certain requirements
of the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules, including, among others, the implementation of a nominating committee. The corporate governance
practice in our home country, the British Virgin Islands, does not require the implementation of a nominating committee. We currently
intend to rely upon the relevant home country exemption in lieu of the nominating committee. As a result, the level of independent
oversight over management of our company may afford less protection to holders of our ordinary shares and ADSs.
 
You may face difficulties in
protecting your interests, and your ability to protect your rights through the U.S. federal courts may be limited, because we are
incorporated under British Virgin Islands law, conduct substantially all of our operations in Taiwan and the majority of our officers
reside outside the United States.
 
We are incorporated in the British Virgin
Islands, and conduct substantially all of our operations in Taiwan through our wholly owned subsidiaries in Taiwan. Most of our
officers reside outside the United States and some or all of the assets of those persons are located outside of the United States.
As a result, it may be difficult if not impossible for you to bring an action against us or against these individuals in the British
Virgin Islands or in Taiwan in the event that you believe that your rights have been infringed under the securities laws or otherwise.
Even if you are successful in bringing an action of this kind outside the British Virgin Islands or Taiwan, the laws of the British
Virgin Islands and of Taiwan may render you unable to effect service of process upon, or to enforce a judgment against our assets
or the assets of our directors and officers. There is no statutory recognition in the British Virgin Islands of judgments obtained
in the United States, although the courts of the British Virgin Islands will generally recognize and enforce a non-penal judgment
of a foreign court of competent jurisdiction without retrial on the merits. A judgment of a court of another jurisdiction may be
reciprocally recognized or enforced if the jurisdiction has a treaty with Taiwan or if judgments of the Taiwanese courts have been
recognized before in that jurisdiction, subject to the satisfaction of other requirements. For more information regarding the relevant
laws of the British Virgin Islands and Taiwan, see “Enforceability of Civil Liabilities.”
 
 Our corporate affairs are
governed by our memorandum and articles of association and by the BVI Business Companies Act (as amended) (the “BVI
Act”) and the common law of the British Virgin Islands. The rights of shareholders to take legal action against our
directors and us, actions by minority shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors to us under British
Virgin Islands law are to a large extent governed by the common law of the British Virgin Islands. The common law of the
British Virgin Islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the British Virgin Islands as well
as from English common law, which has persuasive, but not binding, authority on a court in the British Virgin Islands. The
rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under British Virgin Islands law are not
as clearly established as they would be under statutes or judicial precedents in the United States. In particular, the
British Virgin Islands has a less developed body of securities laws as compared to the United States, and provides
significantly less protection to investors. Moreover, British Virgin Islands companies may not have standing to initiate
a shareholder derivative action before the federal courts of the United States. 
 

 32 
 
 
As a result of all of the above, our public
shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests through actions against our management, directors or major
shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction in the United States.
 
Our management will have considerable
discretion as to the use of the net proceeds from this offering.
 
Our management will have considerable discretion
in the application of the net proceeds received by us. You will not have the opportunity, as part of your investment decision,
to assess whether proceeds are being used appropriately. You must rely on the judgment of our management regarding the application
of the net proceeds of this offering. The net proceeds received by us may be used for corporate purposes that do not improve our
efforts to maintain profitability or increase our share price. The net proceeds from this offering may be placed in investments
that do not produce income or that lose value.

SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS
 
This prospectus contains forward-looking
statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including statements based on our current expectations, assumptions, estimates
and projections about us, our industry and the regulatory environment in which we and companies integral to our ecosystem operate.
The forward-looking statements are contained principally in the sections entitled “Prospectus Summary,” “Risk
Factors,” “Use of Proceeds,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations” and “Business.” These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors
that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by the
forward-looking statements. In some cases, these forward-looking statements can be identified by words or phrases such as “may,”
“will,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “aim,” “estimate,” “intend,”
“plan,” “believe,” “potential,” “continue,” “is/are likely to” or other
similar expressions. The forward-looking statements included in this prospectus relate to, among others:
 

·our growth strategies;
 

·our future business development, financial condition and results of operations;
 

·competition in our industry;
 

·fluctuations in general economic and business conditions in Taiwan;
 

·expected changes in our revenues and certain cost and expense items and our operating margins;
 

·the regulatory environment in which we and companies integral to our business operate;
 

·our proposed use of proceeds from this offering; and
 

·assumptions underlying or related to any of the foregoing.
 
The global economy and Taiwan may not grow
at the rates projected by market data, or at all. The failure of these industries or markets to grow at the projected rates may
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and the market price of our ADSs.
If any one or more of the assumptions underlying the market data turns out to be incorrect, actual results may differ from the
projections based on these assumptions. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.
 
The forward-looking statements made in
this prospectus relate only to events or information as of the date on which the statements are made in this prospectus. We undertake
no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statements
are made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. You should read this prospectus and the documents that we have referred
to in this prospectus and have filed as exhibits to the registration statement, of which this prospectus is a part, completely
and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect.

USE OF PROCEEDS
 
We estimate that we will receive net proceeds
from this Offering of approximately US$[ ] million, after deducting underwriting discounts and the estimated offering expenses
payable by us. These estimates are based upon an assumed initial public offering price of US$[ ] per ADS, the midpoint of the price
range shown on the front cover page of this prospectus. A US$1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed initial public offering price
of US$[ ] per ADS would increase (decrease) the net proceeds to us from this Offering by US$[ ], assuming the number of ADSs offered
by us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the same and after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts
and commissions and estimated expenses payable by us.
 
We plan to use the net proceeds of this
Offering for business development purposes, which may include but not limited to investment in the development and construction
of Phase I of the Royal Country Club Spa & Resort, the early-stage operation thereof, capital expenditures thereof, sales and

We need raise additional funds in the form
of either equity or debt, the proceeds of which will be used towards the completion of the construction and development of the
entire Royal Country Club Spa & Resort as contemplated. We estimate that we will be in need of approximately $150,000,000 to
construct the second phase of the Royal Country Club Spa & Resort and start initial operations thereof, assuming that we are
able to raise the maximum amount as set forth in the table of “Calculation of Registration Fee.” As of the date, we
have not decided on the specific types and sources of financing we will pursue in order to raise additional funds to complete the
construction and development of the second phase of the Royal Country Club Spa & Resort.
 
The foregoing represents our current intention
based upon our present plans and business conditions to use and allocate the net proceeds of this offering. Our management, however,
will have significant flexibility and discretion to apply the net proceeds of this offering. If an unforeseen event occurs or business
conditions change, we may use the proceeds of this offering differently than as described in this prospectus.
 
Pending any use described above, we plan
to invest the net proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing, fixed-income instruments or on-demand deposits at various credit institutions.
We currently do not anticipate applying any portion of the proceeds of this offering to retire any of our existing and outstanding
debts.
 
In using the proceeds of this offering,
we are permitted under Taiwan laws and regulations as an offshore holding company to provide funding to our wholly foreign-owned
subsidiary in Taiwan only through loans or capital contributions and to our combined variable interest entity only through loans,
subject to the approval of government authorities and limit on the amount of capital contributions and loans. Subject to satisfaction
of applicable government registration and approval requirements, we may extend inter-company loans to our wholly foreign-owned
subsidiary in Taiwan or make additional capital contributions to our wholly-foreign-owned subsidiary to fund its capital expenditures
or working capital. For an increase of registered capital of our wholly foreign-owned subsidiary, we need to obtain approval from
the Ministry of Economic Affairs or its local counterparts, which will decide within 90 days after receiving the application. If
we provide funding to our wholly foreign-owned subsidiary through loans, the total amount of such loans may not exceed the difference
between the entity’s total investment as approved by the foreign investment authorities and its registered capital. Such
loans must be registered with State Administration of Foreign Exchange (“SAFE”) or its local branches, which usually
takes up to 20 working days to complete. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these government registrations or
approvals on a timely basis, if at all.

DIVIDEND POLICY
 
Our Board of Directors has discretion on
whether to distribute dividends, subject to certain restrictions under British Virgin Islands law, namely that our company may
only pay dividends out of profits, and provided that immediately following payment of such dividend, the value of the Company’s
assets would exceed its liabilities and our company is able to pay its debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business.
Even if our Board of Directors decides to pay dividends, the form, frequency and amount will depend upon our future operations
and earnings, capital requirements and surplus, general financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors that the
Board of Directors may deem relevant.
 
We do not have any present plan to pay
any cash dividends on our ordinary shares and ADSs in the foreseeable future after this Offering. We currently intend to retain
most, if not all, of our available funds and any future earnings to operate and expand our business.
 
We are a holding company incorporated in
the British Virgin Islands. We may rely on dividends from our Subsidiaries in Taiwan to provide liquidity, including any payment
of dividends to our shareholders. Taiwan regulations may restrict the ability of our Subsidiaries to pay dividends to us. See “Regulation—
Regulations on Dividend Distribution” and “Taxation—Republic of China Taxation.”
 
We do not expect to pay dividends in the
foreseeable future. If we pay any dividends, we will pay our ADS holders to the same extent as holders of our ordinary shares,
subject to the terms of the deposit agreement, including the fees and expenses payable thereunder. See “Description of American
Depositary Shares.” Cash dividends on our ordinary shares, if any, will be paid in U.S. dollars.

CAPITALIZATION
 
The following table sets forth our capitalization,
including all of the Subsidiaries’ capitalization, as of June 30, 2016:
 

•on an actual basis;
 

•on an as adjusted basis to reflect the sale of [ ] ordinary shares in the form of ADSs by us in
this Offering at an assumed initial public offering price of US$[ ] per ADS, the mid-point of the estimated range of the initial
public offering price shown on the front cover of this prospectus, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us.
 
The adjusted information below is illustrative
only and our capitalization following the completion of this Offering is subject to adjustment based on the initial public offering
price of our ADSs and other terms of this Offering determined at pricing. You should read this table together with our combined
financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus and the information under “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

DILUTION
 
If you invest in our ADSs, your interest
will be diluted to the extent of the difference between the initial public offering price per ADS and our net tangible book value
per ADS after this offering. Dilution results from the fact that the initial public offering price per ordinary share is substantially
in excess of the book value per ordinary share attributable to the existing shareholders for our presently outstanding ordinary
shares.
 
Our net tangible book value on a combined
basis as of June 30, 2016 was approximately US$[ ] million, or US$[ ] per ordinary share as of that date and US$[ ] per ADS. Net
tangible book value represents the amount of our total combined tangible assets, less the amount of our total combined liabilities.
Dilution is determined by subtracting net tangible book value per ordinary share, after giving effect to the additional proceeds
we will receive from this Offering, from the assumed initial public offering price of US$[ ]per ordinary share, which is the midpoint
of the estimated initial public offering price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus adjusted to reflect the ADS-to-ordinary
share ratio, and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.
 
Without taking into account any other changes
in net tangible book value after June 30, 2016, other than to give effect to our sale of the ADSs offered in this offering at the
assumed initial public offering price of US$[ ] per ADS, the midpoint of the estimated range of the initial public offering price,
after deduction of the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, our as adjusted net
tangible book value as of June 30, 2016 would have been US$[ ] million, or US$[ ]per ordinary share and US$[ ] per ADS. This represents
an immediate increase in net tangible book value of US$[ ] per ordinary share and US$[ ] per ADS to the existing shareholders and
an immediate dilution in net tangible book value of US$[ ] per ordinary share and US$[ ] per ADS to investors purchasing ADSs in
this Offering. The following table illustrates such dilution:

A $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed
public offering price of US$[ ] per ADS would, after giving effect to this Offering, increase (decrease) our as adjusted net tangible
book value by US$[ ] , the as adjusted net tangible book value per ordinary share and per ADS by $[ ] per ordinary share and US$[
] per ADS and the dilution in as adjusted net tangible book value per ordinary share and per ADS to new investors in this Offering
by US$[ ] per ordinary share and US$[ ]per ADS, assuming no change to the number of ADSs offered by us as set forth on the cover
page of this prospectus, and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses.
 
The following table summarizes, on an as
adjusted basis as of ** , 2016, the differences between existing shareholder and the new investors with respect to the number of
ordinary shares (in the form of ADSs or ordinary shares) purchased from us, the total consideration paid and the average price
per ordinary share and per ADS paid before deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses.

EXCHANGE RATE INFORMATION
 
Certain of our revenues and expenses are
denominated in NTD. This prospectus contains translations of NTD amounts into U.S. dollars at specific rates. Unless otherwise
noted, all translations from NTD to U.S. dollars and from U.S. dollars to NTD in this prospectus were made at a rate of NTD [ ]
to US$1.00, the exchange rate set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the Federal Reserve Board (the “Noon Buying
Rate”) on October [ ], 2016. We make no representation that any NTD or U.S. dollar amounts could have been, or could
be, converted into U.S. dollars or NTD, as the case may be, at any particular rate, at the rates stated below, or at all. The Taiwan
government imposes control over its foreign currency reserves in part through direct regulation of the conversion of NTD into foreign
exchange and through restrictions on foreign trade. On [to be updated], the Noon Buying Rate was NTD[ ] to US$1.00.
 
The following table sets forth information
concerning exchange rates between the NTD and the U.S. dollar for the periods indicated. These rates are provided solely for your
convenience and are not necessarily the exchange rates that we used in this prospectus or will use in the preparation of our periodic
reports or any other information to be provided to you. The exchange rate refers to the exchange rate as set forth in the H.10
statistical release of the Federal Reserve Board.

ENFORCEABILITY OF CIVIL
LIABILITIES
 
We are incorporated in the British Virgin
Islands to take advantage of certain benefits associated with being a British Virgin Islands exempted company, such as:
 

•political and economic stability;
 

•an effective judicial system;
 

•a favorable tax system;
 

•the absence of exchange controls or currency restrictions; and
 

•the availability of professional and support services.
 
However, certain disadvantages accompany
incorporation in the British Virgin Islands. These disadvantages include, but are not limited to:
 

•the British Virgin Islands has a less developed body of securities laws as compared to the United States and these securities
laws provide significantly less protection to investors as compared to the United States; and
 

•British Virgin Islands companies may not have standing to sue before the federal courts of the United States.
 
Our constitutional documents do not contain
provisions requiring that disputes, including those arising under the securities laws of the United States, between us, our officers,
directors and shareholders, be arbitrated.
 
Substantially all of our operations are
conducted in Taiwan, and substantially all of our assets are located in Taiwan. A majority of our directors and executive officers
are nationals or residents of jurisdictions other than the United States and most of their assets are located outside the United
States. As a result, it may be difficult for a shareholder to effect service of process within the United States upon these individuals,
or to bring an action against us or against these individuals in the United States, in the event that you believe that your rights
have been infringed under the securities laws of the United States or any state in the United States.
 
We have appointed Maples Corporate Services
(BVI) Limited, as our agent in the British Virgin Islands upon whom process may be served in any action brought against us under
the securities laws of the United States.
 

 42 
 
 

Maples and Calder, our legal counsel as
to British Virgin Islands law, and Sha Hung Law Firm, our legal counsel as to Taiwanese law, have advised us, respectively, that
there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of the British Virgin Islands and Taiwan, respectively, would:
 

•recognize or enforce judgments of United States courts obtained against us or our directors or officers predicated upon the
civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state in the United States; or
 

•certain original actions brought in each respective jurisdiction against us or our directors or officers predicated upon the
securities laws of the United States or any state in the United States.
 
There is uncertainty with regard to British
Virgin Islands law as to whether a judgment obtained from the United States courts under civil liability provisions of the securities
laws will be determined by the courts of the British Virgin Islands as penal or punitive in nature. If such a determination is
made, the courts of the British Virgin Islands will not recognize or enforce the judgment against a British Virgin Islands company.
Because the courts of the British Virgin Islands have yet to rule on whether such judgments are penal or punitive in nature, it
is uncertain whether they would be enforceable in the British Virgin Islands. Maples and Calder has advised us that although there
is no statutory enforcement in the British Virgin Islands of judgments obtained in the federal or state courts of the United States,
a judgment obtained in such jurisdiction will be recognized and enforced in the courts of the British Virgin Islands at common
law, without any re-examination of the merits of the underlying dispute, by an action commenced on the foreign judgment debt in
the court of the British Virgin Islands, provided such judgment:
 

•is given by a foreign court of competent jurisdiction;
 

•imposes on the judgment debtor a liability to pay a liquidated sum for which the judgment has been given;
 

•is final and there was no fraud on the part of the person in whose favor judgment was given or on the part of the court;
 

•is not in respect of taxes, a fine or a penalty or similar fiscal revenue obligations; and
 

•was not obtained in a manner and is not of a kind the enforcement of which is contrary to natural justice or the public policy
of the British Virgin Islands.
 
Sha Hung Law Firm has further advised us
that the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments are provided for under the Civil Law of Taiwan. Taiwan courts may recognize
and enforce foreign judgments in accordance with the requirements of Section 402 of the Civil Procedure of Taiwan and Article 4
Section 1 of the Enforcement Act of Taiwan based either on treaties between Taiwan and the country where the judgment is made or
on principles of reciprocity between jurisdictions. Taiwan does not have any treaties or other form of reciprocity with the United
States or the British Virgin Islands that provide for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments. In addition,
according to the Section 401 of the Civil Procedure of Taiwan Law, courts in Taiwan will not enforce a foreign judgment against
us or our directors and officers if they decide that the judgment violates the basic principles of Taiwan Law or national sovereignty,
security or public interest. As a result, it is uncertain whether and on what basis a Taiwan court would enforce a judgment rendered
by a court in the United States or the British Virgin Islands. Under the Civil Law, foreign shareholders may originate actions
based on Civil law against us in Taiwan, if they can establish sufficient nexus to Taiwan for a Taiwan court to have jurisdiction,
and meet other procedural requirements, including, among others, the plaintiff must have a direct interest in the case, and there
must be a concrete claim, a factual basis and a cause for the suit. However, it would be difficult for foreign shareholders to
establish sufficient nexus to Taiwan by virtue only of holding our ADSs or ordinary shares.

Corporate Structure
 
We own 100% of the issued and outstanding
shares of HUANG JIA Country CLUB and Recreation Inc. (“Huang Jia”), a company incorporated on March 3, 2015 in Republic
of Seychelles, which, in turn, owns 99.6% of the issued and outstanding shares in Yao-Teh, a company that was incorporated in May
1988 under the laws of Taiwan, R.O.C. and is in the business of developing, constructing, and operating golf course facilities.
In addition, Huang Jia owns all of the issued and outstanding shares of Ta-Teh-Fu. Ta-Teh-Fu was incorporated in June 2001 under
the laws of Taiwan, R.O.C. and is in the businesses of leasing golf carts and machinery and equipment to clients, including Yao-Teh.
 
On August 12, 2016, the sole owner and
member of Ta-Teh-Fu sold all her membership interest in Ta-Teh-Fu to Huang Jia under the terms set forth in a Membership Interest
Purchase Agreement. On August 23, 2016, Huang Jia purchased 99.6% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Yao-Teh
from three shareholders of Yao-Teh, pursuant to that certain Share Purchase Agreement. On October 12, 2016, all shareholders of
Huang Jia exchanged all their shares in Huang Jia for ordinary shares of the Company pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement.

MANAGEMENT’S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
You should read the following discussion
together with our combined financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus. This discussion contains
forward-looking statements about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those we currently
anticipate as a result of many factors, including those we describe under “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this prospectus.
See “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”
 
Overview
 
We are a holding company that, through
our Subsidiaries, owns and operates a golf course and plans to develop and operate entertainment facilities for the contemplated
Royal Country Club Spa & Resort, including hotels and spas, focused primarily on the East Asia market. We are a holding company
of the following principal operating Subsidiaries: Yao-Teh, which holds part of the land upon which the Royal Country Club golf
course is built and the Royal Country Club Spa & Resort will be constructed; Ta-Teh-Fu, which owns and leases almost all of
its golf machinery and equipment to Yao-Teh and holds the rest of the entire parcel of land where the golf course and the Royal
Country Club Spa & Resort will be located; and Huang Jia, a corporation currently managing and operating the Royal Country
Club. Our future operating results are subject to significant economic, regulatory and competitive uncertainties and risks, many
of which are beyond our control. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Early Stage Development and Our Operations
in General.”
 
Existing operations
 
The Royal Country Club has grown rapidly
since the opening of the eighteen-hole golf course with the capacity to accommodate up to 1,300 players per day. In the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2015, we generated revenue of $1,213,410, substantially all of which was from the operations of the Royal
Country Club. In the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Royal Country Club generated revenue of US$545,970.
 
Yao-Teh, Ta-Teh-Fu and Huang Jia became
our Subsidiaries in August and October 2016, when Huang Jia purchased 99.6% of Yao-Teh’s issued and outstanding shares and
all of the membership interest in Ta-Teh-Fu and thereafter all shareholders of Huang Jia exchanged their shares of Huang Jia for
ordinary shares of Imperial Garden & Resort. As a result of the share exchange and purchases described herein, Imperial Garden
& Resort owns 100% of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of Huang Jia, which in turn owns 100% of Ta-Teh-Fu’s
membership interest and 99.6% issued and outstanding shares of Yao-Teh. In October 2016, we reorganized our corporate structure
and combined our financial statements to reflect the transactions described above.
 
Development Projects
 

•The Royal Country Club Spa & Resort. We began to design the Royal Country Club Spa &
Resort in the first quarter of 2015 and we have signed service contracts with a certain established architecture firm, hotel management
company and resort and recreation facility design firm. We are targeting completion of Phase I of the Royal Country Club Spa &
Resort and open the first hotel before the end of the fourth quarter of 2018. Phase I is expected to include completion of first
hotel with approximately 250 rooms and suites under the Holiday Inn brand name together with a full hot spring spa, gardens, restaurants
and bars. We estimate that we will open Phase II of the Royal Country Club Spa & Resort approximately in the third quarter
of 2020. The second hotel to be built during Phase II is likely to be named under the Crowne Plaza brand with approximately 150
rooms and suites scheduled to open in 2020. The construction and operation of both phases are subject to the grant of imperative
licenses, land reclassification and compliance with Taiwanese law.

Factors Affecting Our Operating
Results
 
Operation license for the golf course
 
Currently, we have the miscellaneous use
license to operate the 18-hole golf course. Although we have the necessary licenses to construct a 36-hole golf course, we are
required to amend our golf course development plan to reflect the change to the construction and operation of the 18-hole golf
course from a 36 hole golf course. We have entered into a service contract with Yi-Cheng Huang, a consultant in Taiwan, to amend
our golf course development plan, reclassify the land use and apply for the official operation license for the 18-hole golf course.
Yi-Cheng Huang is responsible for preparing the relevant documents, including the Land and Water Reservation Plan and the Environmental
Impact Report, revising the application materials to satisfy the comments and requirements from the Miaoli County, reclassifying
our land as golf special district for entertainment purposes and thereafter submitting the application for the operation license.
If we fail to obtain the operation license in a timely manner or at a reasonable cost, our golf course operation will remain limited
to the testing stage, without the qualification to hold golf tournaments.
 
Liabilities and security interest on
our land
 
As of December 31, 2015, we have accumulated
liabilities of $16,878,063 from various banks and individual lenders that hold security of different priorities on our land which
is crucial to our golf course operations and the development of the planned Royal Country Club Spa & Resort. We will face the
risks of foreclosure on our land if we fail to pay off the debts due in a timely manner or fail to restructure and refinance the
debts. Change of ownership or control of the land or imposition of restrictions on the land will likely affect our current business
operations and development plans.
 
Visitation to Taiwan
 
After the Taiwan government relaxed the
restrictions on mainland China visitors to Taiwan, visitation to Taiwan between 2008 and 2014 increased 160% during the seven-year
period, jumping from approximately 3.8 million to approximately 9.9 million per year according to the data from the Tourism Bureau
of M.O.T.C. Visitors from China comprised 40% of the Taiwan market. We believe that visitation and tourism revenue growth for the
Taiwan market have been, and will continue to be, driven by a combination of factors, including liberalization of restrictions
on travel to Taiwan from China, ease of currency restrictions to permit Chinese citizens to take larger sums of foreign currency
out of China when they travel, a growing middle class in Asia with more disposable income and infrastructure improvements that
are expected to facilitate more convenient travel to and within Taiwan. The recent cease of talk between China and Taiwan has contributed
to the abrupt 30% decline of visitation from China to Taiwan. The change of relationship between China and Taiwan is a crucial
and uncontrollable factor that has a substantial impact on the Taiwan tourism.
 
Overview of Financial Results
 
Revenues
 
Our revenues primarily consisted of greens
fee charged for playing golf on the Royal Country Club from members and non-members and non-refundable membership initiation fees.
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, we derived revenue from sale of membership, green fees and leasing in an amount
of $1,213,410. And for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, the revenue from sale of membership, green fees and leasing mounted
to $1,221,781.
 
Other operating income
 
Other operating income comprises revenues
that are not generated in the ordinary course of business. We generated income for renting to Miaoli Sports Center and Miaoli Conference
Center. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, we derived income from leasing in an amount of $44,020. And for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2014, the revenue from leasing was $51,515.
 

 47 
 
 

Liabilities, security
and contingencies
 
As of December 31, 2015, we and our Subsidiaries
have outstanding balances with credit institutions and individual persons that hold security interest on our land in various manners.
Our bank loans, categorized by the borrowing entities in fiscal year 2015 and 2014, were as follows:
 


  
December 31, 

  
2015  
2014 

Bank loans from Ta-Teh-Fu 
$1,949,985  
$2,198,101 

Bank loans from Yao-Teh 
$4,685,931  
$6,053,218 

Total 
$6,635,916  
$8,251,319 

 
In addition to bank loans, Cheng-Yu
Lian, an individual person, held a lien on the land owned by Yao-Teh because of a loan agreement entered into by and between
Geng-Meng Lin, the then vice president of Yao-Teh, and Cheng-Yu Lian on June 25, 1993. As of the date of this registration
statement, Yao-Teh is negotiating with Cheng-Yu Lian to settle the balance of the loan, which was due a long time ago. As of
December 31, 2015 and 2014, the loan balance was $10,242,147 and $10,627,848, respectively. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014,
the accrued interest balance was $19,275,721 and $18,471,200, respectively.
 
Furthermore, as of December 31, 2015, Yao-Teh
had a balance of $228,728 owed to Lang-Sheng Lin, an individual person, who won a settlement against Yao-Teh in a lawsuit regarding
the trust registration agreement entered into by Yao-Teh and Lang-Sheng Lin. Mr. Lin agreed to transfer the title of land associated
with the trust registration agreement back to Yao-Teh after Yao-Teh pays him the entire settlement.
 
Operating costs and expenses
 
Our operating costs and expenses have historically
consisted primarily of expenses for operating the golf course, general and administrative expenses, advertising cost, depreciation
of real property and equipment and amortization of non-refundable membership fees.
 
This operating cost relates to the operations
of the Royal Country Club, including the golf course and the snack bar. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of
salaries and benefits paid to our administrative and finance personnel, cleaning, maintenance and overhead costs and general costs
associated with our corporate offices and professional services fees. We expect our total general and administrative expenses to
increase as we hire additional personnel for our corporate offices and new resort operations and as we incur costs associated with
our obligations as a listed company.
 
Cost of advertising consisted primarily
of advertising, promotional and other sales and marketing expenses. Our sales and marketing expenses decreased in the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2015 as compared to those in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 because we did not employ the promotional
method to encourage members’ participation in golfing as we had done in the fiscal year of 2014. We incurred an expense of
$9,295 on encouraging members’ participation in golfing activities in the fiscal year of 2014 but we discontinued that promotional
plan in the fiscal year of 2015.
 
The depreciation of property and equipment
is calculated on the straight-line method, including property and equipment under capital leases, based on the following useful
lives:
 


  
Estimated Life in Years 

Land improvements 
 50 

Buildings and building improvements 
 15 

Machinery and equipment 
 5 

Office equipment 
 5 

 
The non-refundable membership initiation
fees are amortized on a straight line basis upon the inception of the Royal Country Club over the estimated life of fifty years.
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded the amortization of the non-refundable membership initiation fees in
an amount of $258,093. As for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, we will recognize the amortization of the non-refundable
membership initiation fees in an amount of $248,726.
 

 48 
 
 
Interest Expense
 
Interest expense consisted of interest
expenses with respect to advances from Taiwan Cooperative Bank, Taiwan Business Bank and various individual lenders. As of December
31, 2015 and 2014, we paid interest expenses in amounts of $39,410 and $96,522, respectively, reflecting a decrease of 59.17%,
or $57,112 due to the declination of interest expense on membership deposits.
 
We and our Subsidiaries accrued interest
expenses in aggregate amounts of $1,893,736 and $2,039,287 during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
 
The shareholder who provided credits to
the Company or its Subsidiaries did not charge interest on his advances to us.
 
Income tax expenses
 
Imperial Garden & Resort, Inc. is incorporated
in the British Virgin Islands. Under the current laws of the British Virgin Islands, the Company is not subject to income tax.
 
Our subsidiary, Huang Jia, is incorporated
in Republic of Seychelles, which does not tax income.
 
Our subsidiaries, Yao-Teh and Ta-Teh-Fu,
are incorporated in Taiwan, which imposes a unified enterprise income tax at the rate of 17% on all enterprises with taxable income
greater than approximately NT$120,000, equivalent to approximately $3,660. Because the Company and its Subsidiaries suffered operating
losses during the periods ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, no income tax liabilities existed as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.
 
Results of Operations
 
The following discussion relates to our
combined results of operations, financial condition and capital resources. You should read this discussion in conjunction with
our combined financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this prospectus.

The expenses incurred from selling, general and corporate administration
and interest expenses remained essentially the same over the periods ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.
 
Litigation expenses in an amount of $472,526
were incurred in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 only, not in fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 because we recorded a
loss for the obligation of paying settlement for a lawsuit in the amount of $472,526, half of which was paid and transferred to
the other party in the lawsuit during the period ended December 31, 2015.
 
Foreign exchange translation
 
A foreign exchange gain of $2,452,250 was
recorded in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 compared to a gain of $3,761,604 in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014
reflecting the adjustment of the balances of foreign currency assets and liabilities at the prevailing exchange rates except for
those foreign currencies denominated investments in the ordinary shares of the Company, the difference of which is accounted for
as translation adjustments under stockholders’ deficit.
 
Loss for the period
 
As a result of the foregoing, our loss
for the period after income tax increased by $604,903, or 19.15%, from $3,158,693 in fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 to $3,763,596
in fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.
 
Given our and our subsidiaries’ history
of recent losses, we have not recognized any significant deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.

to $545,970 in the six months ended June 30, 2016 because the number of golf club members and the average annual rounds of golf

Foreign exchange translation
 
A foreign exchange loss of $1,182,728 was
recorded in the first six months of 2016 compared to a loss of $1,507,870 in the first six months of 2015 reflecting the adjustment
of the balances of foreign currency assets and liabilities at the prevailing exchange rates except for those foreign currencies
denominated investments in the ordinary shares of the Company, the difference of which is accounted for as translation adjustments
under stockholders’ deficit.
 

 51 
 
 

Net loss for the period
 
Our net loss for the six-month period after
income tax was reduced by $130,054, or 8.11%, from $1,602,793 in the first six months of 2015 to $1,472,739 in the first six months
of 2016 due to less expenditure on maintenance of equipment and machines, pesticide and fertilizers and salaries.
 
Given our and Subsidiaries’ history
of recent losses, we have not recognized any significant deferred tax assets as June 30, 2016 and 2015.
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
 
We have incurred cumulative losses and
negative cash flows during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and as of December 31, 2015 we accumulated losses
of $3,763,596. We anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for at least the next fiscal year as we develop the Royal Country
Club Spa & Resort. We expect that our general and administrative expenses will continue to increase as we continue expanding
our staff personnel. Also we need additional capital to fund our development, construction and operations of the contemplated Royal
Country Club Spa & Resort.
 
We had bank loans, including current and
non-current borrowings, in aggregate amounts of $6,635,916 and $8,251,319 respectively in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015
and 2014.
 
As of December 31, 2015, we had cash and
cash equivalents of $97,586. Cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested in accordance with our investment policy, primarily
with a view to liquidity and capital preservation. Currently, our excessive cash and cash equivalents are held in high quality
credit institutions. We do not enter into financial instruments for hedging, trading or speculative purposes.
 
Cash Flows
 
The following table sets forth the primary
sources and uses of cash for each of the periods set forth below:

 


  
For the year ended
December 31, 

  
2015  
2014 

Net cash provided by operating activities 
$23,058  
$2,344,023 

  
    
   

Net cash used in investing activities 
$(74,615) 
$(354,822)

  
    
   

Net cash used in financing activities 
$(173,889) 
$(1,694,955)

 
Operating activities. For the twelve months
ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, net cash provided by operating activities was $23,058and $2,344,023, respectively. We used cash
raised from other current liabilities and the shareholder’s advances in all periods to fund our operations.
 
Investing activities Net cash used in investing
activities was $74,615 and $354,822 in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which was used to purchase
fixed assets for both of the fiscal years.
 

 52 
 

 
Financing activities For the twelve
months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, net cash used in financing activities was $173,889 and $1,694,955, respectively. Cash
used in financing activities were spent on repaying bank loans during the two fiscal years described herein and cash provided by
financing activities resulted from proceeds of the loans of related parties in the fiscal years of 2015 and 2014.
 
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
 
Management’s discussion and analysis
of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our combined financial statements. Our combined financial
statements were prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. Certain of our accounting policies require that management apply significant
judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions integral to financial estimates. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates those
estimates, including those relating to the estimated lives of depreciable assets, impairment of long lived assets, contingent assets
and revenue recognition. Judgments are based on historical experience, terms of existing contracts, industry trends and information
available from outside sources, as appropriate. However, by their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty,
and therefore actual results could differ from our estimates.
 
Our significant accounting policies are
detailed in “Note 3 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the Company’s combined financial statements
for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. We have summarized below the accounting policies of particular importance to the
portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and that require the application of significant judgment or estimates
by our management.
 
Revenue Recognition
 
We recognize revenue derived from greens
fees when such a fee is charged to a golf player, both member or non-member, when our services is rendered.
 
Revenue from non-refundable membership
initiation fees is recognized over the estimated life of the facilities on a straight-line basis upon inception of the club. As
of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the weighted average remaining period over which non-refundable membership initiation fees will
be recognized is approximately 30 years and 31 years, respectively.
 
Accounts receivable and credit
risk
 
Financial instruments that potentially
subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash. The
Company places its cash and temporary cash investments in high quality credit institutions, but these investments may be in excess
of Taiwan Central Deposit Insurance Corporation’s insurance limits. The Company does not enter into financial instruments
for hedging, trading or speculative purposes.
 
Concentration of credit risk with respect
to trade and notes receivables is limited due to the wide variety of customers and markets in which the Company transacts business,
as well as their dispersion across many geographical areas. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and
generally does not require collaterals, but does require advance deposits on certain transactions.
 
Operating Results
 
The accompanying combined financial statements
have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the
Company and its Subsidiaries have incurred an accumulated deficit of $71,036,558 for the preceding fiscal year ended December 31,
2015. The Company has generated revenue of $1,213,410 for the preceding fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.
 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
 
As of June 30, 2016, we have no off-balance
sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes
in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources..
 

 53 
 

  
Changes in and Disagreements with
Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure
 
As of June 30, 2016, we have no changes
in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure.
 
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
about Market Risks
 
We are exposed to market risks related
to changes in interest rates and exchange rates.
 
As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents
of $97,586 and $327,736, respectively, primarily held in bank accounts and term deposits. Our primary exposure to market risk is
interest rate sensitivity, which is affected primarily by changes in the general level of Taiwanese interest rates.
 
Foreign currency transactions are translated
into functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transactions. Exchange rate differences are recognized
in the combined income statement. We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies that arise from foreign currencies held
in bank accounts. Our foreign exchange exposure is primarily the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency translation risk is not hedged.

BUSINESS
 
 
 
The Royal Country Club Golf
Course
 
Business Overview
 
We, together with all of our Subsidiaries,
currently own approximately 485.1 acres of land located in the Miaoli County, Taiwan, Republic of China (“R.O.C.”)
where we operate a golf course known as “The Royal Country Club,” which occupies approximately 197.7 acres of land.
The Royal Country Club has a renovated18-hole golf course, golf shop, snack bar and locker rooms. The golf course is designed by
Robert T. Jones, a world renowned golf architect.
 
Miaoli is approximately three times the
size of Singapore, with approximate 560,000 inhabitants, and is located in western Taiwan, which is approximately 59.5 miles south
of Taipei, the capital of Taiwan, R.O.C. Miaoli is contiguous with the Hsinchu City to the north, the Taichung City to the south,
and borders the Taiwan Strait to the west. Known as the "Mountain Town", Miaoli is a popular destination for hiking owing
to a large number of mountains. Natural hot springs in Miaoli and the aboriginal culture (Hakka) attract tourists all year round.
 
In addition to operating the golf course,
we aim to build the “Royal Country Club Spa & Resort,” a premier resort that will include two hotels as well as
a collection of recreational activities. The architecture and gardens in our resort will be designed and arranged to recreate a
scene reflecting Japan in the 17th century. We believe that our officers’ and strategic
partners’ managerial expertise in hospitality, entertainment and construction and resources in resort and golf course development,
management, marketing and financing in Taiwan will be an integral part in fully executing our business plan
 
We have entered into a binding letter of
intent with and made an initial payment of $140,000 to IHG pursuant to which IHG has agreed to manage the two hotels to be constructed
on our site. Our current plans include changing the landscape of the golf course to include a floral garden, with the end in view
of making it one of the most scenic golf venues in Taiwan. For this purpose, we have engaged Cuningham as the designer for our
entire resort. In addition, we are currently in preliminary discussion with various leading consulting companies regarding the
management of various entertainment activities to be built in the resort. At the present time, we intend to engage Bayshore Pacific
Leisure, Ltd., a well-established entertainment consulting company that focuses on activity and park design, equipment supply and
entertainment center management in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan.
 
It is anticipated that upon the completion
of this offering, and assuming that the proceeds of at least $50,000,000 is received, we will be able to complete the first phase
of our current plan, which consists of the construction of a premium hotel with an aggregate of two hundred and fifty (250) rooms
or units, a full service hot spring spa and affiliated hot spring therapy center, several courtyard gardens, pools, in addition
to the existing golf course. Upon raising another $150,000,000 of equity and/or debt, we anticipate that, although we cannot guarantee,
we will be able to complete the second phase of our construction plan, which contemplates the construction and development of a
second luxurious hotel with an aggregate of one hundred and fifty (150) rooms or units, another full service hot spring spa and
affiliated hot spring therapy center, three upscale restaurants serving Chinese, American and European dishes, pools and water
slides, a large Japanese garden hosting the golf course, a multi-purpose center for weddings and conferences and a shopping and
entertainment village. The resort contemplated by the management team comprise of these two phases of the construction. The designs
for this resort have been completed by Cuningham.
 
We anticipate completing the two initial
phases according to the following timeline assuming we can raise $200,000,000:
 

•Complete Phase I by the third or fourth quarter of 2018

•Complete Phase II before the third quarter of 2020

•Launch the resort with full function by the third quarter of 2020
 
Phase I will include construction of a
hotel with full service hot spring spa facilities inside, courtyard gardens and pools. We plan to start the construction from the
north side of the resort land in order that we can continue to operate the golf course, which is located on the south side of the
construction site. Phase II will include construction and development of the second hotel, which will feature a full service hot
spring spa, a multi-purpose event center, a shopping and dining village and other venues for recreational purposes.
 

 55 
 
  
Our target customer base includes golfers,
corporate executives, business people, and families. Upon completion of Phase II, we will provide comprehensive recreational and
business services all year round in the resort where our guests can enjoy various indoor and outdoor amenities. We believe that
upon the completion of the two phases of the Royal Country Club Spa & Resort, we will become more competitive in the Taiwan
resort and entertainment space. We also believe upon completion of the two phases of the new construction, our Royal Country Club
Spa & Resort will be one of the well-known attractions in Asia that will draw more tourists from around the world.
 
Hospitality and Entertainment
Industries in Taiwan
 
Background
 
Taiwan’s hospitality sector is thriving,
buoyed by the island’s transformation into what is deemed to be an up-and-coming destination for Asian travelers. In November,
2007, the National Geographic Traveler, a popular travel magazine in the United States, published a 13-page special report to introduce
Taiwan’s diverse sights and cultural features, acclaiming that “Taiwan is Asia’s best-kept secret.”2
After the Taiwanese government eased some of the restrictions on Chinese visitors in 2008, the tourism in Taiwan grew and
the boom has been consistently changing the face of Taiwan’s hospitality sector ever since. From 2008 to 2014, the number
of foreign tourists jumped from 3.8 million to 9.9 million per year, reflecting a 160% increase for the seven-year period.3
Particularly from 2013 to 2014, the number of international travelers increased by 23.63% according to the data from the
Tourism Bureau of Ministry of Transportation and Communications (“M.O.T.C.”).4 The
statistics from the Tourism Bureau of M.O.T.C. revealed that the numbers of visitors from China, Japan, South Korea, and Malaysia
all rose by double-digits. Tourists from South Korea form Taiwan’s fastest growing foreign tourist market. In 2014 alone,
the number of South Korean arrivals rose by 60% year-on-year to more than 527,000.5 Moreover,
visitors from mainland China now comprise 40% of the Taiwan tourist market.6 Since 2008, the
number of tourists from Hong Kong has more than doubled, from 619,000 to 1.51 million in 2015.7 The
number of tourists from Japan has also risen from less than 1.1 million in 2010 to 1.6 million in 2015.8
In 2016, the Tourism Bureau of M.O.T.C. disclosed that the number of visitors coming to Taiwan totaled 7,505,457 in 2015.9
We anticipate that the development of this world-class resort will attract not just foreign visitors but local Taiwanese
visitors as well.
 
While Taiwan’s leisure travel market
is growing at a rapid pace, the percentage of business travelers to Taiwan decreased from one-third of all tourist arrivals in
2000 to just one tenth in 2015, according to the government data.10 In 2015, approximately
758,889 business travelers arrived in Taiwan compared to 769,665 business travelers in 2014.11 Studies
made by CBRE Research (“CBRE”) attribute such a decline to the trend that a number of international companies are shifting
their business operations to China.
 
We believe that the development and launch
of new luxury hotels would herald a turnaround for the business travel sector that had been stagnant for the first decade of the
new millennium. Recently, top global hospitality brands, which ignored Taiwan for years as they expanded their territories in mainland
China and Southeast Asia, are now considering Taiwan as a viable location for new luxury hotels. The overall hospitality business
has become bullish in Taiwan and investor appetite has appeared strong. Some of global hospitality companies are changing the landscape
in Taipei’s five-star hotel segment, which plays a critical role in attracting high-end leisure travelers and business people.
As of 2010, Taipei had four internationally branded five-star hotels: the Grand Hyatt, the Shangri-La’s Far Eastern Plaza,
the Westin and the Regent, which while locally owned, had an international presence.

After the Chinese Civil War in 1949, the
relations between China and Taiwan were characterized by tensions and instability.12 After
the 2008 presidential election in Taiwan, the relationship between mainland China and Taiwan improved and thereafter, the Cross-Strait
business has grown rapidly ever since.13 As a result, the number of business travelers from
China to Taiwan has increased gradually, which in turn benefited a number of five-star hotels in Taiwan as business travelers usually
choose to stay in luxurious hotels.
 
Our Market Opportunity
 
We believe that our resort, as envisioned,
will be able to surpass other recreational resorts and golf courses in Taiwan, including existing theme parks, amusement parks,
resorts and hotels that are near places of interest.
 
Hospitality and recreational businesses
are generally evaluated by the following criteria: location, occupancy rates, reputation, uniqueness, perceived quality of the
attractions and amenities (such as golf courses, spas and theme parks), atmosphere and cleanliness of the attractions and amenities,
quality of the accommodations, quality of food and beverages, service levels and reservation systems.
 
Based on the criteria mentioned above,
we believe that we face minimal competition from local businesses, due to the fact that there is currently no upscale hotel or
resort in the Miaoli County that is comparable to the resort we intend to build. Hotels or motels in Miaoli are generally small.
For example, the Sunrise Country Club in Taoyuan has only 84 rooms. Another medium sized hotel nearby has 66 rooms with few amenities
other than the hot spring facilities. In addition, there is another hotel 50 miles away from our golf course which, although managed
by a reputable management team, is located at least 40 minutes off of the Zhongshan highway. The rest of hotels and resorts in
Miaoli do not have any amenities other than golf courses, and as such, we believe they are not comparable to our resort that we
intend to construct.
 
Location and Transportation
 
We, through Yao-Teh, own and occupy a parcel
of land of approximately 484.3 acres in Miaoli, Taiwan where the Royal Country Club is and the Royal Country Club Spa & Resort
will be located. The property includes 220 lots in Dataoping section, Zaoqiao township and Laotianliao Section, Touwu township.
Yao-Teh’s land is currently categorized as hill land which we are in the process of turning into a golf special district
for entertainment purposes. In addition to Yao-Teh’s hill land, Ta-Teh-Fu owns another parcel of land of approximately 0.71
acres consisting of 26 lots in Gongjing section, Miaoli. Ta-Teh-Fu holds the land for real estate investment purposes.

Site Plan of the Property
 
Our Royal Country Club Spa & Resort
will be located in Miaoli, a renowned tourist destination famous for its rich scenic resources, including mountains, rivers, milky
opaque carbonic acid natural hot springs as well as its well preserved Hakka culture and Taiwanese aboriginal habitation. A large
number of foreign visitors travel to Miaoli every year to enjoy the annual memorial ceremony/holiday held by Saixia people, an
indigenous group. Miaoli has no industrial business and as a result, its well protected natural beauty attracts millions of domestic
and international tourists to Miaoli every year. In the year of 2015, there were 1,875,574 arrivals according to the Tourism Bureau
of M.O.T.C. The Taiwan High Speed Rail passes north to south through Miaoli and has a station in the county. Our golf course is
just 10 miles away from the Miaoli High Speed Rail station.
 
Visitors can easily access the Royal Country
Club Spa & Resort from all directions. It is approximately 60 minutes away from the Taipei International Airport or the Taiwan
Taoyuan International Airport, 20 minutes from the Miaoli High Speed Rail station, 20 minutes away from the Hsinchu City, a home
of high tech companies in Taiwan, and 40 minutes from Taichung, the third biggest city in Taiwan. In addition, upon request, we
provide pick-up and drop-off services to customers between the airports and our resort.
 
Our Services and Facilities
 

1.Existing Facilities at the Resort
 
The Royal Country Club- the
Golf Course
 
Originally built and opened for business
in 1966, the golf course was renovated in 1994. After the major renovation, the golf course has continued its operation since 1994.
It is an 18-hole tournament golf course designed by Robert Trent Jones Jr., a world renowned golf course architect. The fairways
are not long, but the undulating terrain and various obstacles make this venue very challenging. Professional golf players in Taiwan
consider the course moderately to highly challenging as on average, golfers are forced to take eight to ten more strokes to finish
a game. There are approximately 50,000 rounds of golf played on average every year on this golf course. The Royal Country Club
golf course is also recognized one of the most beautiful golf venues in Taiwan. To avoid loss of soil caused by severe weather
conditions, the golf course has adopted an underground drainage system of high quality Japanese pipes which are about 35 kilometers
(21.7 miles) in length. Also the golf course is planted with Tifdwarf, a type of grass that grows very quickly and is popular among
professional golf courses. So far the golf course has not suffered any irreversible loss or damage due to severe weather or other
controllable causes. The golf course is currently in operation and opens to the public. Additionally, golfers have the option to
become members of the club, which provide certain benefits, including but not limited to, reduced fees to play golf.
 

 58 
 
 
 
Our golf course has been at the testing operation stage
for the past 22 years. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, we have generated revenue of approximately
$1,221,781 and $1,213,410, respectively, and after foreign currency adjustment, comprehensive income of $602,911and loss of
$1,311,346, respectively. As for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2016, the Company and its Subsidiaries have produced
revenue of approximately $592,618 and $545,970, respectively, and after foreign currency adjustment, comprehensive loss of
$3,110,663 and $2,655,467, respectively.
 
The Licenses and Permits for the Royal Country
Club
 
Yao-Teh originally planned to build a 36-hole golf course and
obtained the Establishment Permit in 1988, the Development Permit in 1990, five miscellaneous Construction Licenses between 1991
and 1992. Yao-Teh completed the construction of the first eighteen holes of the 36-hole golf course in 1994 and thereafter received
three miscellaneous Operation Licenses. However, due to land ownership disputes and certain land classification unsuitable for
golfing purpose, Yao-Teh was forced to abandon the plan of building a 36-hole golf course and instead settled with the 18-hole
course which was completed at that time. Because the 18-hole golf course does not comply with the description on the permits and
licenses obtained for the 36-hole golf course, Yao-Teh needs to amend all the permits and licenses and thereafter reclassify the
land as golf special district. We currently operate the golf course on a testing basis. Upon finishing the land reclassification,
it will probably take us three months to receive the Operation License for the 18-hole golf course. We have engaged Mr. Yi-Cheng
Huang to obtain all the necessary licenses and permits for the golf course in order to make the golf course run in its full capacity
and with full functionality. Yi-Cheng Huang estimates that he will probably finish the entire application process and obtain the
Operation License for the Royal Country Club in 2018. For more information about the license procurement procedure and risks associated
thereof, please review Exhibit 99.2 Letter from Yi-Cheng Huang.
 

2.Facilities To Be Constructed
 
The Royal Country Club Spa
& Resort
 
We plan to construct the following facilities
in two phases, Phase I and Phase II. Cunningham has provided a complete design for all facilities to be constructed and the blueprint
of the entire resort. During Phase I, the golf course will remain in operation until the opening of the first hotel and hot spring
spa. After that, during Phase II of the construction, we may close the golf course periodically to facilitate the construction
of the second hotel and affiliated amenities. Upon completion of Phase II, the golf course will serve its golfing function for
a few days in a week and as a garden for the rest of the week. The resort will continue generating revenues throughout the two
phases and thereafter from various sources, including golfing, lodging, hot spring spa services, shopping, and admission fees to
gardens.
 

 59 
 
  
 
 
 
The Plan for Phase I Site
 
To materialize our two-phase plan, we intend
to use a large portion of the first $15,000,000 raised through this issuance to construct fourteen (14) roads, set up water, electricity,
internet, natural gas pipelines, and other infrastructure necessary to make a hotel functional. In addition, the rest of the first
$15,000,000 will be devoted to the natural hot spring spa. When we raise $50,000,000 from this issuance, we will be able to finish
the construction of Phase I and part of the entertainment facilities. When we hit the benchmark of $200,000,000 through various
financing avenues, we will be able to complete the entire construction plan, which includes building two new hotels, reforming
the golf course to a floral garden/ golf course, and developing various gardens, spas, shops, and other entertainment facilities.
 
The Hotels
 
 
 
Illustration of the Designs of
the Hotel Rooms
 
We have entered into a binding Letter of
Intent with IHG with respect to implementing marketing campaigns that will effectively target individuals within certain domestic
and international markets. We have paid an amount of $140,000 to IHG for its consulting service. Subject to future modifications
and adjustments, we plan to use the Holiday Inn brand for the first hotel and the Crowne Plaza Hotel brand the second hotel. After
evaluating different architecture firms, we have narrowed down to few outstanding candidates for the design of the two hotels and
will settle down with one of the shortlisted candidates as soon as possible.
 

 60 
 
 
We intend to make Holiday Inn a high-end,
full service hotel that will feature a number of amenities commonly found in comparably priced hotels. We expect to build 230 standard
and family style rooms, 10 elite suites, 3 presidential suites and 7 bungalows, totaling 250 units, by 2018. Water, as a symbol
for inspiration and amorphousness in Chinese culture, will set the magic tone for Phase I. Behind a water-themed gate coming to
visitors’ view are winding creeks, delicate bridges and exotic plants. Walking on narrow trails along the streams, guests
would easily forget about the busy world outside and indulge themselves in this enchanted water fairytale. Travelers will be able
to go to other parts of the Royal Country Club Spa & Resort and surrounding mountains through pathways inside the resort.
 
By 2020, we anticipate, although cannot
guarantee, that we will be able to complete the Crowne Plaza Hotel with 150 rooms. Each room will have premium amenities which
are typically found in a five-star hotel and in compliance with top tier requirements issued by the Tourism Bureau, M.O.T.C. Phase
II constructions will emphasize the elegant Japanese architecture with man-made hills and creeks winding in mist. The reception
desks, public areas and pathways in the Crowne Plaza Hotel will highlight the Japanese royal style featuring the multi-layered
design. The Crowne Plaza Hotel will reserve abundant open space for people to enjoy the view of the gardens, golf course and lakes
which will be decorated by tens of thousands of flower bushes and trees. According to the Cuningham’s blueprint, upon completion
of Phase II, guests will be able to stay at luxurious hotels, explore the gardens and the Shopping & Entertainment Village,
play golf in an 18-hole golf course, experience hot springs, and use the multi-purpose pavilions and conference centers all at
the Royal Country Club Spa & Resort.
 
The description of the two phases is based
on Cuningham’s business plan and may be changed during the construction for practical purposes.
 
The Licenses and Permits for the Royal
Country Club Spa & Resort
 
With respect to the necessary licenses
and permits to build and operate the contemplated resort we have engaged Yi-Cheng Huang to assist us in the reclassification of
our land as a golf special district for entertainment purposes so that we can construct hotels and other resort facilities as we
have planned for the Royal Country Club Spa & Resort. Mr. Huang estimates that it may take approximately eighteen months from
February 2016 to complete the land reclassification process.
 
Simultaneously Chang Chen-Bin Architecture
Firm is preparing relevant documents to obtain the Development Permit and Construction License for the new resort. It is estimated
that we need approximately nine months to obtain such Development Permit and Construction License. After the land is reclassified
for entertainment purposes and proper permit and license are issued, we will have the qualification to begin construction of the
resort. Upon completion of the construction, Chang Chen-Bin Architecture Firm shall, on our behalf, apply for the Operation License
for the Royal Country Club Spa & Resort. The architecture firm predicts that it generally takes 60 days to get the Operation
License. For more information about the licenses and permits to develop and operate the resort, please review Exhibit 99.3 Letter
from Chang Chen-Bin Architecture Firm.
 
The Nature Park of Gardens
 
At Royal Country Club Spa & Resort,
Japanese gardens, along with natural hot spring wells, will blend with local mountain terrane and many other points of view of
the wonders of nature. Based on Cuningham’s blueprint, Japanese gardens will be scattered inside the lodging area and a number
of pavilions in the gardens will provide perfect venues for casual gatherings. During Phase II, we plan to build an artificial
island inside one of the existing ponds in our golf course, upon which a wedding chapel will be constructed.
 

 61 
 
  
 
 
 Nature Reserves
 
The Hot Spring Spas
 
We also plan to build a full service hot
spring spa, the “Enchanted Water Fairy Retreat Spa,” which will provide both indoor and outdoor facilities, as well
as massage rooms, hot spring therapy pools, body treatment and facial & skincare services. The Enchanted Water Fairy Retreat
Spa will reflect the traditional Japanese hot spring spa style, which has been proven popular in Asia. Therefore, we expect a significant
amount of revenue generated from the spa services.
 
Various minerals dissolved in hot springs
have been credited with specific health benefits. For example, sulfur in hot springs is said to relieve nasal congestion, and calcium
and sodium bicarbonate are said to enhance circulations. A report made in 2003 by the Geological Survey Team of China National
Petroleum Corp. stated that the underground hot springs in the Royal Country Club Spa and Resort were rich in sulfur, carbonic
acid and other minerals. According to this report, the temperature of the hot springs ranged from 41.4°C to 53.45°C (106.5°F
to 128.2°F) and the average amount of spring water coming up to the ground was between 150 to 250 tons. Our resort plans to
provide hot springs in winters, cold springs in summers, and hot and cold springs all year round to cater different needs. For
guests staying at our hotels, they will have access to hot spring water in their rooms. Meanwhile, non-staying visitors will be
able to use two huge outdoor spring water pools, one isolated nude bath pool for each gender, and fifteen private spring water
pools for families. Guests may find the Mirror Pool ideal for meditation and the water rides perfect for adventures. For small
children and teenagers, we hope our various water rides will be able to cater their needs and give them exciting and joyful experience
that is beyond their imagination.
 
The Shopping and Entertainment Village
 
 
 
The Design of the Shopping and Entertainment Village
Site
 
The Shopping and Entertainment Village will aim at mirroring
a 17th century Japanese village. We plan to have an exceptional retail and dining area
 
which shall be linked with village–like
streets and yards woven together in a sequence of unfolding architectural spaces, allowing for our guests to enjoy the pleasant
and relaxing environment. For this village, Cuningham has specified the layout of seating, water scenery, and plants in order to
blur the line between the commercial shops and the nature. Groups of bamboos and evergreens will contour the walkways inside the
village. On the bridge connecting the end of the main walkway and the hotel area, visitors shall be able to take in the majestic
view of the entire garden/golf course.
 

 62 
 
 
Our Clients
 
We currently operate the Royal Country
Club, which is a golf course that is open to members of the club and general public.
 
Once the contemplated construction is completed,
our targeted customers will comprise not only golfers, but also corporate executives, general business people and leisure travelers.
We believe that the new retail stores, entertainment facilities, gardens, hotels, conference center, hot spring spas, bars and
restaurants will appeal to both business people and leisure visitors who want to enjoy the natural beauty. Moreover, we will design
several tour packages from which our visitors may choose to serve their different visiting purposes.
 
Seasonality
 
Golf operations are seasonal in nature
and our golf course is also subject to the seasonality in Miaoli. Revenues generated from our golf club decline when temperatures
are low and when days are short. The rainy season in Taiwan is May, July, August and September; however, the weather during the
rest of a year is generally ideal for golf. The average rainy days in Taiwan are 98 days per year, during which our golf operations
decline. Generally, extreme weather patterns such as droughts, could also adversely affect a golf course’s operation because
water may become unavailable or overly expensive for the purpose of maintaining the grass at a satisfactory level. However, there
are currently five lakes inside the resort, which serve as reservoirs to provide irrigation resources for the golf course.
 
Although the golf business can be cyclical
and seasonal, we anticipate that our to-be-constructed resort would, to a limited extent, be affected by weather conditions. Based
on the occupancy rates of major hotels in Taiwan, people tend to stay at hotels and eat at restaurants in their hosting hotels
during the summers and during major holidays. Major holidays in Taiwan are Founding Day of the Republic of China (January 1st),
Labor Day (May 1st), Dragon Boat Festival (in June) and National Day (October 10th).
We also give important consideration to major holidays in mainland China because visitors from mainland China constitute a large
percentage of visitors to Taiwan. The important holidays in mainland China include Chinese New Year (late January or early February),
Labor Day (May 1st) and National Day (October 1st), each
of which is referred to as the “golden tourism week” because workers usually have one week off for each holiday. In
addition, with the well observed Chinese New Year during winters, we do not expect a dramatic downturn of our hotel and retail
business in the resort during such time.
 
Furthermore, Miaoli has what is known as
the “strawberry season” and “spring blossoms” in April, and historically the number of visitors to Miaoli
increases.
 
Because the resort’s non-golfing
operations are not as prone to weather conditions compared to the golf club, we anticipate that the new business operations would
help increase our overall revenues. Winters and the rainy seasons are the slow seasons for the golf course but constitute peak
seasons for tourism because of the Chinese New Year and summer vacations. As a result, we believe that the inclusion of the non-golf
related operations, such as the hotels and other amenities, is an integral aspect of our growth.
 
Marketing
 
As described above, we plan to grow a large
amount of plants, including trees, bushes and flowers of various kinds in the golf course to make it one of the most beautiful
golf venues in Taiwan. As part of the marketing efforts for the contemplated resort, the scenic golf course inside the resort will
be highlighted on different platforms and through various channels, such as social media, high-end leisure publications and visits
by travel agencies. Additionally, we intend to host international golf tournaments on our golf properties and advertise them through
all sorts of channels, such as social media, radio, television, magazines and appropriate billboards.
 
We intend to initiate and maintain an extensive
marketing campaign that will maximize our resort’s visibility in our targeted markets. Our sales and marketing strategy will
primarily consist of hosting press conferences and inviting media personnel to visit our resort during the construction phases,
as well as upon completion thereof.
 

 63 
 
 
 
Our marketing objectives include but are not limited to:
 

•Enhancing brand awareness: utilizing the IHG’s portfolio plus our current establishment to generate a strong brand.
 

•Building a stronger sales network: establishing relationships with both domestic and international travel agencies.
 

•Promoting corporate image with a broad-based public relations firm targeted towards high end travel publications.
 
In addition, pursuant to the Letter of Intent with IHG, both
of the hotels to be constructed will be marketed by IHG in a manner that is consistent with their current marketing efforts for
other hotels which they operate.

result, we believe our employees are devoted to delivering superb customer services. We have not experienced any significant labor
disputes.
 

Risk Control
 
We have designated two full-time employees
to oversee the operations and the implementation of the internal control procedures and control the risks associated with our operations
of the golf course. We have established and maintained a set of authorization procedures regarding recognizing sales revenue and
controlling expenses, a well-developed manual for the operations of the golf course which is designed to prevent dangerous activities
and reduce risks associated with golfing and using golf-related equipment and a document keeping and archiving system which is
designed to avoid the leaking of classified documents and business records.
 

 64 
 
 
Intellectual Property
 
As of the date when this statement is made, we do not possess
any intellectual property rights, including but not limited to rights in patents, trademarks, copyrights, know-how and business
secrets.
 
Insurance
 
We have obtained insurance to cover damages and losses that
would occur to our customers and employees, the properties, machinery and equipment on the golf course and other damages caused
by terrorist attacks.
 
Legal Proceedings
 
We are not currently subject to any legal
proceedings. To the best of our knowledge, we do not believe that there is any pending lawsuit or legal proceeding brought by or
against us or threatened.
 
However, due to certain land use regulations
in Taiwan, Yao-Teh was a party in a real estate lawsuit. The land use regulations in Taiwan prescribed that only individuals could
be lawful owners of farmland. It was unclear whether the land upon which the Royal Country Club had been planned to be built was
farmland or non-farmland when Yao-Teh purchased the real property. As a solution to this uncertainty, Yao-Teh asked a few individual
yeomen at that time to be record owners of the above described land on behalf of Yao-Teh, which actually paid the full purchase
price. After the real property was classified as non-farmland, all but one individual yeomen returned their titles to the real
property respectively without any difficulty. That individual yeoman, Mr. Lang-Sheng Lin insisted on getting compensation in exchange
for the transfer of the title of the real property he was holding for Yao-Teh. On November 29, 2013, Yao-Teh filed a complaint
against Lang-Sheng Lin (the “Defendant”), at Taiwan Miaoli District Court in Taiwan, for not transferring the title
of land that was purchased by Yao-Teh pursuant to the trust registration agreement entered by Yao-Teh and the Defendant. On February
17, 2015, the court found that Yao-Teh’s evidence did not sustain its claim. During the appeal, on September 21, 2015, Yao-Teh
and the Defendant settled the case. Pursuant to the settlement, Yao-Teh agreed to pay approximately $458,000 to the Defendant who
in return agreed to transfer the title of land back to Yao-Teh after receiving the full payment. As of December 31, 2016, Yao-Teh
has paid approximately $228,728 to the Defendant. For more details, please refer to Exhibit 99.1 the Legal Opinion on Land Dispute
issued from Sha Hung Law Firm, our counsel in Taiwan.
 
Research & Development
 
Our ability to develop and offer superior
hotel amenities can only be achieved through our continued research and development efforts. Our research team understands the
tourist markets and hotel industry. The research team helps us consistently improve our offerings, update pricing structure, and
address emerging market issues.
 
Our research and development effort is
currently focused on the activities at certain type of theme parks, times of visits and amounts of money spent per customer at
certain theme parks.
 

 65 
 
 
Competition
 
Competitors in
the Golf Segment
 
Outside Miaoli, we face significant competition from golf clubs
and country clubs in the greater Taiwan region, China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan, South East Asia, Australia and the greater

The following charts list our main competitors in the golf business

REGULATIONS
 
Regulations on Golf Course Operations
 
We believe the following rules and regulations relate to the
operation and management of golf courses in Taiwan:
 

•environmental laws including Soil and Water Conservation Act (which is enacted for the purpose
of soil and water conservation, treatment and maintenance, conserving soil and water resources, reducing the possibilities of disasters,
and promoting the reasonable use of real property licensing, permitting and inspection requirements applicable to contractors,
electricians and engineers); Drinking Water Management Act (which is formulated to ensure the quality of drinking water sources)

•regulations relating to workers’ safety and environmental protection;

•permitting and inspection requirements applicable to construction projects;

•regulations relating to transportation of equipment and materials, including licensing and permitting requirements;

•building and electrical codes;

•regulations related to the operation and management of hotels, golf courses and other facilities; and

•privacy regulations.
 
We believe we have all the licenses materially
required to conduct our current golf operations, and we are in substantial compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.
Our failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating licenses, give
rise to termination or cancellation of rights under our contracts, and disqualify us from future bidding opportunities.
 
Regulations on Hotel Operations
 
The land upon which the Royal Country Club
Spa & Resort will be built is classified as Immaterial Wetlands, Non-State-Park that indicate our land is not considered as
state parks or administrative lands affiliated with state parks, Non-High-Quality-Farmlands, non-public-traffic land, unimportant
military purpose land, non-mineral deposit land and non-aviation-noise-isolation land. We are applying to reclassify the land as
golf special district for entertainment purposes and expect to know the result by the second quarter of 2017. We expect to obtain
all the necessary licenses and permits to construct the hotels by the third quarter of 2017.

Board of Directors
 
 Our Board of Directors consists of

may vote with respect to any contract, proposed contract or arrangement in which he is interested, and if he does so his vote
shall be counted and he may be counted in the quorum at any meeting of our directors at which any such contract or proposed contract
or arrangement is considered, provided that such director has declared the nature of his interest in such contract or Transaction
at or prior to its consideration and any vote thereon. The directors may exercise all the powers of the company to borrow money,
to mortgage or charge its undertaking, property and uncalled capital, and to issue debentures or other securities whenever money
is borrowed or as security for any debt, liability or obligation of the company or of any third party. None of our non-executive
directors has a service contract with us that provides for benefits upon termination of service.

 

 69 
 

 
Committees of the Board of Directors
 
We will establish two committees under the Board immediately
upon the effectiveness of our registration statement on Form F-1, of which this prospectus is a part: an audit committee and a
compensation committee. We will adopt a charter for each of the two committees. Each committee’s functions are described
below.
 
Audit Committee. Our audit committee
will consist of persons that will satisfy the “independence” requirements of NASDAQ Rule 5605 and Rule 10A-3 under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The audit committee will oversee our accounting and financial reporting processes and the
audits of the financial statements of our company. The audit committee will be responsible for, among other things:
 

•appointing the independent auditors and pre-approving all auditing and non-auditing services permitted to be performed by the
independent auditors;
 

•reviewing with the independent auditors any audit problems or difficulties and management’s response;
 

•discussing the annual audited financial statements with management and the independent auditors;
 

•reviewing the adequacy and effectiveness of our accounting and internal control policies and procedures and any steps taken
to monitor and control major financial risk exposures;
 

•reviewing and approving all proposed related party transactions;
 

•meeting separately and periodically with management and the independent auditors; and
 

•monitoring compliance with our code of business conduct and ethics, including reviewing the adequacy and effectiveness of our
procedures to ensure proper compliance.
 
Compensation Committee. Our compensation
committee will consist of persons that will satisfy the “independence” requirements under NASDAQ Rule 5605. The compensation
committee will assist the board in reviewing and approving the compensation structure, including all forms of compensation, relating
to our directors and executive officers. It is anticipated our chief executive officer may not be present at any committee meeting
during which his compensation is deliberated. The compensation committee will be responsible for, among other things:
 

•reviewing and approving, or recommending to the board for its approval, the compensation for our chief executive officer and
other executive officers;

Duties of Directors
 
Under British Virgin Islands law, our directors
owe fiduciary duties to our company, including a duty of loyalty, a duty to act honestly and a duty to act in what they consider
in good faith to be in our best interests. Our directors also have a duty to exercise the skill they actually possess and such
care and diligence that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in comparable circumstances. In fulfilling their duty of care
to us, our directors must ensure compliance with our M&A, as amended and restated from time to time, the BVI Act and the class
rights vested thereunder in the holders of the shares. Our company has the right to seek damages if a duty owed by our directors
is breached. A shareholder may in certain limited exceptional circumstances have the right to seek damages in our name if a duty
owed by the directors is breached.
 
Our Board of Directors has all the powers
necessary for managing, and for directing and supervising, our business affairs. The functions and powers of our Board include,
among others:
 

•convening shareholders’ general meetings;
 

•declaring dividends and distributions;
 

•appointing officers and determining the term of office of the officers;
 

•exercising the borrowing powers of our company and mortgaging the property of our company; and
 

•approving the transfer of shares in our company, including the registration of such shares in our share register.
 
Terms of Directors and Officers
 
Our directors may be elected by a resolution
of our Board of Directors, or by an ordinary resolution of our shareholders. Each of our directors will hold office until the expiration
of his or her term as provided in the written agreement with our company, if any, and until his or her successor has been elected
or appointed. A director will cease to be a director if, among other things, the director (i) becomes bankrupt or makes any arrangement
or composition with his creditors;
(ii)	dies or is found by our company
to be or becomes of unsound mind, (iii) resigns his office by notice in writing to the company, or (iv) without special leave of
absence from our board, is absent from three consecutive board meetings and our directors resolve that his office be vacated. Our
officers are elected by and serve at the discretion of the Board.
 
Employment Agreements
 
There is no employment agreement with our
officers or directors.
 
No Compensation to Directors
 
No director has received any cash or other
compensation for serving as a non-executive director for the Company and any of its Subsidiaries and we do not plan to pay any
cash or other compensation to any person for serving as a non-executive director. Our directors are entitled to reimbursement for
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with our business. Our Board of Directors may award special remuneration
to any director undertaking any special services on our behalf, other than services ordinarily required of a director.
 
Compensation to Executive Officers
 
Because the Company is a newly formed corporate
entity, it has not paid its executive officers for the past fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. We have not set aside or accrued
any amount to provide pension, retirement or other similar benefits to our executive officers and directors. Our Taiwan subsidiaries
and combined variable interest entity are required by law to make contributions equal to certain percentages of each employee’s
salary for his or her pension insurance, medical insurance, unemployment insurance and other statutory benefits and a housing provident
fund.

DESCRIPTION OF SHARE CAPITAL
 
General
 
 The Imperial Garden & Resort, Inc.
is a BVI business company incorporated in British Virgin Islands and our affairs are governed by the provisions of our memorandum
and articles of association (the “M&A”), as amended and restated from time to time, or the BVI Act, and
the applicable laws of the BVI (including applicable common law). 
 
Our M&A authorizes us to issue 200,000,000
of shares consisting of one class of ordinary shares of the Company.
 
The following description of our authorized
shares and our constitutional rules under our M&A is qualified in its entirety by reference to our M&A, which have been
filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part.
 
M&A
 
The following discussion describes our M&A:
 
 Objects and Purposes, Register, and
Shareholders. Subject to the BVI Act, our objects and purposes are unlimited. Our register of members will be maintained
by our transfer agent, [          ] . Under the BVI Act, a BVI company may treat
the registered holder of a share as the only person entitled to (a) exercise any voting rights attaching to the share, (b) receive
notices, (c) receive a distribution in respect of the share and (d) exercise other rights and powers attaching to the share. Consequently,
as a matter of BVI law, where a shareholder’s shares are registered in the name of a nominee, the nominee is entitled to
receive notices, receive distributions and exercise rights in respect of any such shares registered in its name. The beneficial
owners of the shares registered in a nominee’s name will therefore be reliant on their contractual arrangements with the
nominee in order to receive notices and dividends and ensure the nominee exercises voting and other rights in respect of the shares
in accordance with their directions. 
 
Directors’ Powers. Under
the BVI Act, subject to any modifications or limitations in a company’s M&A, a company’s business and affairs are
managed by, or under the direction or supervision of, its directors; and directors generally have all powers necessary to manage
a company. A director must disclose any interest he has on any proposal, arrangement or contract not entered into in the ordinary
course of business and on usual terms and conditions. An interested director may (subject to the M&A) vote on a transaction
in which he has an interest. In accordance with, and subject to, our M&A, the directors may by resolution of directors exercise
all the powers of the Company to incur indebtedness, liabilities or obligations and to secure indebtedness, liabilities or obligations
whether of the Company or of any third party.
 
Rights, Preferences and Restrictions
of Ordinary Shares. Subject to the restrictions described under the section titled “Dividend Policy” above,
our directors may (subject to the M&A) authorize dividends at such time and in such amount as they determine. Each ordinary
share is entitled to one vote. In the event of a liquidation or dissolution of the Company, the holders of ordinary shares are
(subject to the M&A) entitled to share ratably in all surplus assets remaining available for distribution to them after payment
and discharge of all claims, debts, liabilities and obligations of the Company and after provision is made for each class of shares
(if any) having preference over the ordinary shares if any at that time. There are no sinking fund provisions applicable to our
ordinary shares. Holders of our ordinary shares have no pre-emptive rights. Subject to the provisions of the BVI Act, we may, (subject
to the M&A) with shareholder consent, repurchase our ordinary shares in certain circumstances provided always that the Company
will, immediately after the repurchase, satisfy the solvency test. The Company will satisfy the solvency test, if (i) the value
of the Company’s assets exceeds its liabilities; and (ii) the Company is able to pay its debts as they fall due.
 
In accordance with the BVI Act:
 

(i)the Company may purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire its own shares in accordance with either
(a) Sections 60, 61 and 62 of the BVI Act (save to the extent that those Sections are negated, modified or inconsistent with provisions
for the purchase, redemption or acquisition of its own shares specified in the Company’s M&A); or (b) such other provisions
for the purchase, redemption or acquisition of its own shares as may be specified in the Company’s M&A. The Company’s
M&A provide that such Sections 60, 61 and 62 of the BVI Act do not apply to the Company; and
 

 74 
 
 

(ii)where a company may purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire its own shares otherwise than in accordance
with Sections 60, 61 and 62 of the BVI Act, it may not purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire the shares without the consent of
the member whose shares are to be purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired, unless the Company is permitted by the M&A to
purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire the shares without that consent; and
 

(iii)unless the shares are held as treasury shares in accordance with Section 64 of the BVI Act, any
shares acquired by the Company are deemed to be cancelled immediately on purchase, redemption or other acquisition.
 
Variation of the Rights of Shareholders.
As permitted by the BVI Act and our M&A, the rights attached to shares of the Company may (subject to the M&A)
only, whether or not the Company is being wound up, be varied with the consent in writing of or by a resolution passed at a meeting
by the holders of more than fifty percent (50%) of the issued shares of that class, except where a different majority is required
under our M&A or the BVI Act. A greater majority is required in relation to a scheme of arrangement and may be required in
relation to a plan of arrangement, as described under “Summary of Certain Significant Provisions of BVI Law—Mergers,
Consolidations and Similar Arrangements” below.
 
Shareholder Meetings. In accordance
with, and subject to, our M&A, (a) any director of the Company may convene meetings of the shareholders at such times as the
director considers necessary or desirable (and the director convening a meeting of shareholders may fix as the record date for
determining those shareholders that are entitled to vote at the meeting the date notice is given of the meeting, or such other
date as may be specified in the notice, being a date not earlier than the date of the notice); and (b) upon the written request
of shareholders entitled to exercise thirty percent (30%) or more of the voting rights in respect of the matter for which the meeting
is requested, the directors shall convene a meeting of shareholders. Under BVI law, the M&A may be amended to decrease but
not increase the required percentage to call a meeting above thirty percent (30%). In accordance with, and subject to, our M&A,
(a) the director convening a meeting shall give not less than seven (7) days’ notice of a meeting of shareholders to those
shareholders whose names on the date the notice is given appear as shareholders in the register of members of the Company and are
entitled to vote at the meeting; and the other directors; (b) a meeting of shareholders held in contravention of the requirement
to give notice is valid if shareholders holding at least ninety percent (90%) of the total voting rights on all the matters to
be considered at the meeting have waived notice of the meeting and, for this purpose, the presence of a shareholder at the meeting
shall constitute waiver in relation to all of the ordinary shares that that shareholder holds; (c) a meeting of shareholders is
duly constituted if, at the commencement of the meeting, there are present in person or by proxy not less than fifty percent (50%)
of the votes of the ordinary shares or class or series of ordinary shares entitled to vote on resolutions of shareholders to be
considered at the meeting; and (d) if within two hours from the time appointed for the meeting a quorum is not present, the meeting,
if convened upon the request of the shareholders, shall be dissolved; in any other case it shall stand adjourned to the next business
day in the jurisdiction in which the meeting was to have been held at the same time and place or to such other time and place as
the directors may determine, and if at the adjourned meeting there are present within one hour from the time appointed for the
meeting in person or by proxy not less than one third (1/3) of the votes of the ordinary shares or each class or series of ordinary
shares entitled to vote on the matters to be considered by the meeting, those present shall constitute a quorum but otherwise the
meeting shall be dissolved.
 
Dividends. Subject to the BVI
Act and our M&A, our directors may, by resolution, declare dividends at a time and amount as they think fit if they are satisfied,
based on reasonable grounds, that, immediately after distribution of the dividend, the value of our assets will exceed our liabilities
and we will be able to pay our debts as they fall due. There is no further BVI law restriction on the amount of funds which may
be distributed by us by dividend, including all amounts paid by way of the subscription price for ordinary shares regardless of
whether such amounts may be wholly or partially treated as share capital or share premium under certain accounting principles.
Shareholder approval is not (except as otherwise provided in our M&As) required to pay dividends under BVI law. In accordance
with, and subject to, our M&A, no dividend shall bear interest as against the Company (except as otherwise provided in our
M&As).

Disclosure of the Securities and Exchange
Commission’s Position on Indemnification for Securities Act Liabilities. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities
arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling the registrant pursuant to the
foregoing provisions, the registrant has been informed that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification
is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable.
 
Transfer of Shares. Subject to
any applicable restrictions or limitations arising pursuant to (i) our M&A; or (ii) the BVI Act, any of our shareholders may
transfer all or any of his or her shares by an instrument of transfer in the usual or common form or in any other form which our
directors may approve (such instrument of transfer being signed by the transferor and containing the name and address of the transferee).
Our M&A also (save as otherwise provided therein) provide that (i) where ordinary shares of the Company are listed on the Nasdaq
Global Market or any other stock exchange or automated quotation system on which the ordinary shares are then traded (the "Recognised
Exchange"), shares may be transferred without the need for a written instrument of transfer if the transfer is carried
out in accordance with the law, rules, procedures and other requirements applicable to shares listed on the Recognised Exchange
or (ii) shares may be transferred by means of a system utilized for the purposes of holding and transferring shares in uncertified
form (the "Relevant System"), and that the operator of the Relevant System (and any other person necessary to
ensure the Relevant System is effective to transfer shares) shall act as agent and attorney-in-fact of the Shareholders for the
purposes of the transfer of any shares transferred by means of the Relevant System (including, for such purposes, to execute and
deliver an instrument of transfer in the name of and on behalf of any Shareholder who is transferring shares).
 
Summary of Certain Significant Provisions
of the BVI Act
 
The BVI Act differs from laws applicable to
US corporations and their shareholders. Set forth below is a summary of certain significant provisions of the BVI Act applicable
to us (save to the extent that such provisions have been, to the extent permitted under the BVI Act, negated or modified in our
M&A in accordance with the BVI Act).
 
Mergers, Consolidations and Similar Arrangements.
The BVI Act provides for mergers as that expression is understood under US corporate law. Common law mergers are also permitted
outside of the scope of the BVI Act. Under the BVI Act, two or more companies may either merge into one of such existing companies,
or the surviving company, or consolidate with both existing companies ceasing to exist and forming a new company, or the consolidated
company. The procedure for a merger or consolidation between our Company and another company (which need not be a BVI company)
is set out in the BVI Act. The directors of the BVI company or BVI companies which are to merge or consolidate must approve a written
plan of merger or consolidation which must also be authorized by a resolution of members (and the outstanding shares of every class
of shares that are entitled to vote on the merger or consolidation as a class if the memorandum or articles of association so provide
or if the plan of merger or consolidation contains any provisions that, if contained in a proposed amendment to the memorandum
or articles, would entitle the class to vote on the proposed amendment as a class) of the shareholders of the BVI company or BVI
companies which are to merge. A foreign company which is able under the laws of its foreign jurisdiction to participate in the
merger or consolidation is required by the BVI Act to comply with the laws of that foreign jurisdiction in relation to the merger
or consolidation. The BVI company must then execute articles of merger or consolidation, containing certain prescribed details.
The plan and articles of merger or consolidation are then filed with the Registrar of Corporate Affairs in the BVI, or the Registrar.
If the surviving company or the consolidated company is to be incorporated under the laws of a jurisdiction outside BVI, it shall
file the additional instruments required under Section 174(2)(b) of the BVI Act. The Registrar then (if he or she is satisfied
that the requirements of the BVI Act have been complied with) registers, in the case of a merger, the articles of merger or consolidation
and any amendment to the M&A of the surviving company and, in the case of a consolidation, the M&A of the new consolidated
company and issues a certificate of merger or consolidation (which is conclusive evidence of compliance with all requirements of
the BVI Act in respect of the merger or consolidation). The merger or consolidation is effective on the date that the articles
of merger or consolidation are registered by the Registrar or on such subsequent date, not exceeding thirty days, as is stated
in the articles of merger or consolidation but if the surviving company or the consolidated company is a company incorporated under
the laws of a jurisdiction outside the BVI, the merger or consolidation is effective as provided by the laws of that other jurisdiction.
 

 76 
 
 
As soon as a merger or consolidation becomes
effective (inter alia), (a) the surviving company or consolidated company (so far as is consistent with its amended memorandum
and articles of association, as amended or established by the articles of merger or consolidation) has all rights, privileges,
immunities, powers, objects and purposes of each of the constituent companies; (b) the memorandum and articles of association of
any surviving company are automatically amended to the extent, if any, that changes to its amended memorandum and articles of association
are contained in the articles of merger; (c) assets of every description, including choses-in-action and the business of each of
the constituent companies, immediately vest in the surviving company or consolidated company; (d) the surviving company or consolidated
company is liable for all claims, debts, liabilities and obligations of each of the constituent companies; (e) no conviction, judgment,
ruling, order, claim, debt, liability or obligation due or to become due, and no cause existing, against a constituent company
or against any shareholder, director, officer or agent thereof, is released or impaired by the merger or consolidation; and (f)
no proceedings, whether civil or criminal, pending at the time of a merger or consolidation by or against a constituent company,
or against any shareholder, director, officer or agent thereof, are abated or discontinued by the merger or consolidation, but:
(i) the proceedings may be enforced, prosecuted, settled or compromised by or against the surviving company or consolidated company
or against the shareholder, director, officer or agent thereof, as the case may be or (ii) the surviving company or consolidated
company may be substituted in the proceedings for a constituent company but if the surviving company or the consolidated company
is incorporated under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the BVI, the effect of the merger or consolidation is the same as noted
foregoing except in so far as the laws of the other jurisdiction otherwise provide.
 
The Registrar shall strike off the register
of companies each constituent company that is not the surviving company in the case of a merger and all constituent companies in
the case of a consolidation (save that this shall not apply to a foreign company).
 
If the directors determine it to be in the
best interests of us, it is also possible for a merger to be approved as a court approved plan of arrangement or as a scheme of
arrangement in accordance with (in each such case) the BVI Act. The convening of any necessary shareholders meetings and subsequently
the arrangement must be authorized by the BVI court. A scheme of arrangement requires the approval of 75% of the votes of the shareholders
or class of shareholders, as the case may be. If the effect of the scheme is different in relation to different shareholders, it
may be necessary for them to vote separately in relation to the scheme, with it being required to secure the requisite approval
level of each separate voting group. Under a plan of arrangement, a BVI court may determine what shareholder approvals are required
and the manner of obtaining the approval.
 
Continuation into a Jurisdiction Outside
the BVI. In accordance with, and subject to, our M&A, the Company may by resolution of Shareholders or by a resolution
passed unanimously by all directors of the Company continue as a company incorporated under the laws of a jurisdiction outside
the BVI in the manner provided under those laws. The Company does not cease to be a BVI company unless the foreign law permits
continuation and the BVI company has complied with the requirements of that foreign law. Where a company is continued under the
laws of a jurisdiction outside the BVI, (a) the Company continues to be liable for all of its claims, debts, liabilities and obligations
that existed prior to its continuation, (b) no conviction, judgment, ruling, order, claim, debt, liability or obligation due or
to become due, and no cause existing, against the Company or against any shareholder, director, officer or agent thereof, is released
or impaired by its continuation as a company under the laws of the jurisdiction outside the BVI, (c) no proceedings, whether civil
or criminal, pending by or against the Company, or against any shareholder, director, officer or agent thereof, are abated or discontinued
by its continuation as a company under the laws of the jurisdiction outside the BVI, but the proceedings may be enforced, prosecuted,
settled or compromised by or against the Company or against the shareholder, director, officer or agent thereof, as the case may
be; and (d) service of process may continue to be effected on the registered agent of the Company in the BVI in respect of any
claim, debt, liability or obligation of the Company during its existence as a company under the BVI Act.
 
Directors. In accordance with,
and subject to, our M&A (including, for the avoidance of any doubt, any rights or restrictions attaching to any ordinary shares),
(a) the directors are elected by resolution of shareholders or by resolution of directors for such term as the shareholders or
directors determine; (b) each director holds office for the term, if any, fixed by the resolution of shareholders or resolution
of directors appointing him, or until his earlier death, resignation or removal. If no term is fixed on the appointment of a director,
the director serves indefinitely until his earlier death, resignation or removal: (c) a director may be removed from office; (d)
a director may resign his office by giving written notice of his resignation to the Company and the resignation has effect from
the date the notice is received by the Company at the office of its registered agent or from such later date as may be specified
in the notice and a director shall resign forthwith as a director if he is, or becomes, disqualified from acting as a director
under the BVI Act; (e) the directors may at any time appoint any person to be a director either to fill a vacancy or as an addition
to the existing directors and where the directors appoint a person as director to fill a vacancy, the term shall not exceed the
term that remained when the person who has ceased to be a director ceased to hold office; (f) a vacancy in relation to directors
occurs if a director dies or otherwise ceases to hold office prior to the expiration of his term of office; and (g) a director
is not required to hold ordinary shares as a qualification to office.
 

 77 
 
 
In accordance with, and subject to, our M&A,
(a) any one director of the Company may call a meeting of the directors by sending a written notice to each other director; (b)
the directors of the Company or any committee thereof may meet at such times and in such manner as the directors may determine
to be necessary or desirable; (c) a director shall be given not less than three (3) days’ notice of meetings of directors,
but a meeting of directors held without three (3) days’ notice having been given to all directors shall be valid if all the
directors entitled to vote at the meeting who do not attend waive notice of the meeting, and the inadvertent failure to give notice
of a meeting to a director, or the fact that a director has not received the notice, does not invalidate the meeting; (d) a meeting
of directors is duly constituted for all purposes if at the commencement of the meeting there are present in person or by alternate
not less than one-half of the total number of directors, unless there are only two (2) directors in which case the quorum is two;
(e) a director may by a written instrument appoint an alternate who need not be a director and the alternate shall be entitled
to attend meetings in the absence of the director who appointed him and to vote or consent in place of the director until the appointment
lapses or is terminated; (f) a resolution of directors is passed if either (i) the resolution is approved at a duly convened and
constituted meeting of directors of the Company or of a committee of directors of the Company by the affirmative vote of a majority
of the directors present at the meeting who voted except that where a director is given more than one vote, he shall be counted
by the number of votes he casts for the purpose of establishing a majority casting the vote; or (ii) the resolution is consented
to in writing by a majority of directors or by a majority of members of a committee of directors of the Company, as the case may
be, unless (in either case) the BVI Act or our M&A require a different majority.
 
Indemnification of Directors. In
accordance with, and subject to, our M&A (including the limitations detailed therein), the Company shall indemnify against
all expenses, including legal fees, and against all judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement and reasonably incurred in
connection with legal, administrative or investigative proceedings any person who (a) is or was a party or is threatened to be
made a party to any threatened, pending or completed proceedings, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by
reason of the fact that the person is or was a director of the Company; or (b) is or was, at the request of the Company, serving
as a director of, or in any other capacity is or was acting for, another company or a partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise.
 
In accordance with, and subject to, our M&A
(including the limitations detailed therein), the indemnity referred to above only applies if the liability does not arise as a
result of actual fraud or willful default of the indemnified person.
 
In accordance with, and subject to, our M&A,
the Company may purchase and maintain insurance in relation to any person who is or was a director, officer or liquidator of the
Company, or who at the request of the Company is or was serving as a director, officer or liquidator of, or in any other capacity
is or was acting for, another company or a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against any liability asserted
against the person and incurred by the person in that capacity, whether or not the Company has or would have had the power to indemnify
the person against the liability as provided in the articles.
 

 78 
 
 
Directors and Conflicts of Interest.
As noted above, pursuant to the BVI Act and the Company’s M&A, a director of a company who has an interest in
a transaction and who has declared such interest to the other directors, may:
 

(a)vote on a matter relating to the transaction;
 

(b)attend a meeting of directors at which a matter relating to the transaction arises and be included
among the directors present at the meeting for the purposes of a quorum; and
 

(c)sign a document on behalf of the Company, or do any other thing in his capacity as a director,
that relates to the transaction,
 
and, subject to compliance with the BVI Act
shall not, by reason of his office be accountable to the Company for any benefit which he derives from such transaction and no
such transaction shall be liable to be avoided on the grounds of any such interest or benefit.
 
In accordance with, and subject to, our M&A,
(a) a director of the Company shall, forthwith after becoming aware of the fact that he is interested in a transaction entered
into or to be entered into by the Company, disclose the interest to all other directors of the Company; and (b) for the purposes
noted foregoing, a disclosure to all other directors to the effect that a director is a member, director or officer of another
named entity or has a fiduciary relationship with respect to the entity or a named individual and is to be regarded as interested
in any transaction which may, after the date of the entry or disclosure, be entered into with that entity or individual, is a sufficient
disclosure of interest in relation to that transaction.
 
Shareholders’ Suits. The
enforcement of the Company’s rights will ordinarily be a matter for its directors.
 
In certain circumstances, a shareholder has
the right to seek various remedies against a BVI company in the event the directors are in breach of their duties under the BVI
Act. Pursuant to Section 184B of the BVI Act, if a company or director of a BVI company engages, proposes to engage in, or has
engaged in conduct that contravenes the provisions of the BVI Act or the memorandum and articles of association of the company,
the BVI court may, on application of a shareholder or director of the company, make an order directing the company or director
to comply with, or restraining the company or director from engaging in conduct that contravenes, the BVI Act or the memorandum
or articles of association.
 
Furthermore, pursuant to Section 184I(1) of
the BVI Act a shareholder of a company who considers that the affairs of the company have been, are being or are likely to be,
conducted in a manner that is, or any acts of the company have been, or are likely to be oppressive, unfairly discriminatory, or
unfairly prejudicial to him in that capacity, may apply to the BVI Court for an order which, inter alia, can require the company
or any other person to pay compensation to the shareholder.
 
The BVI Act provides for a series of remedies
available to shareholders. Where a company incorporated under the BVI Act conducts some activity which contravenes the BVI Act
or the company’s memorandum and articles of association, the court can issue a restraining or compliance order. Under Section
184G of the BVI Act, a shareholder of a company may bring an action against the company for breach of a duty owed by the company
to him as a shareholder. A shareholder also pursuant to Section 184C of the BVI Act may, with the leave of the BVI court, bring
proceedings or intervene in proceedings in the name of the company, in certain circumstances. Such actions are known as derivative
actions. The BVI court may only grant leave to bring a derivative action where the following circumstances apply:
 

•the company does not intend to bring, diligently continue or defend or discontinue proceedings;
and
 

•it is in the interests of the company that the conduct of the proceedings not be left to the directors
or to the determination of the shareholders as a whole.
 
When considering whether to grant leave, the
BVI court is also required to have regard to the following matters:
 

•whether the shareholder is acting in good faith;

•whether a derivative action is in the company’s interests, taking into account the directors’
views on commercial matters;

•whether the proceedings are likely to succeed;

•the costs of the proceedings; and

•whether an alternative remedy is available.
 

 79 
 
 
Any shareholder of a company may apply to the
BVI court under the Insolvency Act, 2003 of the BVI (the “Insolvency Act”) for the appointment of a liquidator to liquidate
the company and the court may appoint a liquidator for the company if it is of the opinion that it is just and equitable to do
so.
 
Appraisal Rights. The BVI Act
provides that any shareholder of a company is entitled to payment of the fair value of his shares upon dissenting from any of the
following: (a) a merger if the company is a constituent company, unless the company is the surviving company and the shareholder
continues to hold the same or similar shares; (b) a consolidation, if the company is a constituent company; (c) any sale, transfer,
lease, exchange or other disposition of more than 50% in value of the assets or business of the Company if not made in the usual
or regular course of the business carried on by the Company but not including: (i) a disposition pursuant to an order of the court
having jurisdiction in the matter, (ii) a disposition for money on terms requiring all or substantially all net proceeds to be
distributed to the shareholders in accordance with their respective interests within one year after the date of disposition, or
(iii) a transfer pursuant to the power of the directors to transfer assets for the protection thereof; (d) a compulsory redemption
of 10% or fewer of the issued shares of the Company required by the holders of 90% or more of the votes of the outstanding shares
of the Company pursuant to the terms of Section 176 of the BVI Act; and (e) an arrangement, if permitted by the BVI court.
 
Generally any other claims against a company
by its shareholders must be based on the general laws of contract or tort applicable in the BVI or their individual rights as shareholders
as established by the company’s memorandum and articles of association. There are common law rights for the protection of
shareholders that may be invoked, largely derived from English common law. For example, under the rule established in the English
case known as Foss v. Harbottle, a court will generally refuse to interfere with the management of a company at the insistence
of a minority of its shareholders who express dissatisfaction with the conduct of the company’s affairs by the majority or
the board of directors. However, every shareholder is entitled to seek to have the affairs of the company conducted properly according
to law and the constituent documents of the company. As such, if those who control the Company have persistently disregarded the
requirements of company law or the provisions of the company’s memorandum and articles of association, then the courts may
grant relief. Generally, the areas in which the courts will intervene are the following:
 

•a company is acting or proposing to act illegally or beyond the scope of its authority;
 

•the act complained of, although not beyond the scope of the authority, could only be effected if
duly authorized by more than the number of votes which have actually been obtained;
 

•the individual rights of the plaintiff shareholder have been infringed or are about to be infringed;
or
 

•those who control the Company are perpetrating a “fraud on the minority.”
 
Share Repurchases and Redemptions. As
permitted by the BVI Act and subject to our M&A, shares may be repurchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired by us with shareholder
consent. Depending on the circumstances of the redemption or repurchase, our directors may need to determine that, immediately
following the redemption or repurchase, we will be able to satisfy our debts as they fall due and the value of our assets exceeds
our liabilities. Our directors may only exercise this power on our behalf, subject to the BVI Act, our M&A and to any applicable
requirements imposed from time to time by the SEC, the NASDAQ or any other stock exchange on which our securities are listed.
 
Inspection of Books and Records.
Under the BVI Act, members of the general public, on payment of a nominal fee, can obtain copies of the public records of a company
available at the office of the Registrar, including the company’s certificate of incorporation, its memorandum and articles
of association (with any amendments thereto), records of license fees paid to date, any articles of dissolution, any articles of
merger, and a register of charges created by the company (if the Company has elected to file such a register or an applicable chargee
has caused the same to be filed).
 
A shareholder of a company is entitled, on
giving written notice to the company, to inspect:
 

(a)the memorandum and articles of association;
 

 80 
 
 

(b)the register of members;
 

(c)the register of directors; and
 

(d)the minutes of meetings and resolutions of shareholders and of those classes of shares of which
he is a shareholder.
 
In addition, a shareholder
may make copies of or take extracts from the documents and records referred to in (a) through (d) above. However, subject to the
M&A of the Company, the directors may, if they are satisfied that it would be contrary to the Company’s interests to
allow a shareholder to inspect any document, or part of any document, specified in (b), (c) or (d) above, refuse to permit the
shareholder to inspect the document or limit the inspection of the document, including limiting the making of copies or the taking
of extracts from the records. Where a company fails or refuses to permit a shareholder to inspect a document or permits a shareholder
to inspect a document subject to limitations, that shareholder may apply to the High Court of the BVI for an order that he should
be permitted to inspect the document or to inspect the document without limitation.
 
Our registered agent is Maples Corporate Services
(BVI) Limited, Kingston Chambers, P.O. Box 173, Road Town, Tortola, British Virgin Islands. A company is required to keep a copy
of its register of members and register of directors at the offices of its registered agent in the BVI, and the Company is required
to notify any changes to the originals of such registers (assuming the originals are held elsewhere) to the registered agent, in
writing, within 15 days of any change; and to provide the registered agent with a written record of the physical address of the
place or places at which the original register of members or the original register of directors is kept.
 
Where the place at which the original register
of members or the original register of directors of the Company is changed, the Company must provide the registered agent with
the physical address of the new location of the records within 14 days of the change of location.
 
A company is also required to keep at the office
of its registered agent or at such other place or places, within or outside the BVI, as the directors may determine the minutes
of meetings and resolutions of shareholders and of classes of shareholders; and the minutes of meetings and resolutions of directors
and committees of directors. If such records are kept at a place other than at the office of the Company’s registered agent,
the Company is required to provide the registered agent with a written record of the physical address of the place or places at
which the records are kept and to notify the registered agent, within 14 days, of the physical address of any new location where
such records may be kept.
 
Dissolution; Winding Up. As permitted
by the BVI Act and subject to our M&A, we may be voluntarily liquidated and dissolved under Part XII of the BVI Act by resolution
of directors and resolution of shareholders if we have no liabilities or we are able to pay our debts as they fall due and the
value of our assets equals or exceeds our liabilities.
 
We also may be wound up and dissolved in circumstances
where we are insolvent in accordance with the terms of the Insolvency Act.
 
Anti-Money Laundering Laws. In
order to comply with legislation and regulations aimed at the prevention of money laundering we are required to adopt and maintain
anti-money laundering procedures, and may require subscribers to provide evidence to verify their identity. Where permitted, and
subject to certain conditions, we also may delegate the maintenance of our anti-money laundering procedures (including the acquisition
of due diligence information) to a suitable person. We reserve the right to request such information as is necessary to verify
the identity of a subscriber. In the event of delay or failure on the part of the subscriber in producing any information required
for verification purposes, we may refuse to accept the application, in which case any funds received will be returned without interest
to the account from which they were originally debited.
 
If any person resident in the BVI knows or
suspects that another person is engaged in money laundering or terrorist financing and the information for that knowledge or suspicion
came to his or her attention in the course of his or her business the person will be required to report his belief or suspicion
to the Financial Investigation Agency of the BVI, pursuant to the Proceeds of Criminal Conduct Act 1997 (as amended). Such a report
shall not be treated as a breach of confidence or of any restriction upon the disclosure of information imposed by any enactment
or otherwise.
 

 81 
 
 
Exchange controls. We know of
no BVI laws, decrees, regulations or other legislation that limit the import or export of capital or the payment of dividends to
shareholders holders who do not reside in the BVI.
 
Material Differences in BVI Law and our
Amended and Restated M&A and Delaware Law
 
Our corporate affairs are governed by our amended
and restated M&A and the provisions of applicable BVI law, including the BVI Act and BVI common law. The BVI Act differs from
laws applicable to US corporations and their shareholders. The following table provides a comparison between certain statutory
provisions of the BVI Act (together with the provisions of our M&A) and the Delaware General Corporation Law relating to shareholders’
rights.

•   Directors owe duties at both common law and under statute including as follows:
 
•   Directors and officers must act in good faith, with the care of a prudent person, and in the best interest of the corporation

on usual terms and conditions. Additionally, the failure of a director to disclose an interest does not affect the validity of the transaction entered into by the company if (a) the material facts of the interest of the director in the transaction are known by the shareholders entitled to vote at a meeting of shareholders and the transaction is approved or ratified by a resolution of shareholders or (b) the company received fair value for the transaction

•   In any derivative suit instituted by a shareholder of a corporation, it shall be averred in the complaint that the plaintiff was a shareholder of the corporation at the time of the transaction of which he complains or that such shareholder’s stock thereafter devolved upon such shareholder by operation of law

 
 
 

•   the company does not intend to bring, diligently continue or defend or discontinue the proceedings; and
 
•   Complaint shall set forth with particularity the efforts of the plaintiff to obtain the action by the board or the reasons for not making such effort

 
 
 

•   it is in the interests of the company that the conduct of the proceedings not be left to the directors or to the determination of the shareholders as a whole when considering whether to grant leave, the BVI court is also required to have regard to the following matters:
 
•   Such action shall not be dismissed or compromised without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery

 

i.whether the shareholder is acting in good faith;

ii.whether a derivative action is in the interests of the company, taking into account the directors’
views on commercial matters;

iii.whether the action is likely to succeed;

iv.the costs of the proceedings in relation to the relief likely to be obtained; and

v.whether an alternative remedy to the derivative claim is available

DESCRIPTION OF AMERICAN DEPOSITARY SHARES
 
American Depositary Shares
 
[], as depositary, will register and deliver
the ADSs. Each ADS will represent ownership of [] share, deposited with [             ],
as custodian for the depositary. Each ADS will also represent ownership of any other securities, cash or other property which may
be held by the depositary. The depositary’s corporate trust office at which the ADSs will be administered is located at [             ].
The principal executive office of the depositary is located at [          ].
 
The Direct Registration System, or DRS, is
a system administered by The Depository Trust Company, or DTC, pursuant to which the depositary may register the ownership of uncertificated
ADSs, which ownership shall be evidenced by periodic statements issued by the depositary to the ADS holders entitled thereto.
 
We will not treat ADS holders as our shareholders
and accordingly, you, as an ADS holder, will not have shareholder rights. British Virgin Islands law governs shareholder rights.
The depositary will be the holder of the ordinary shares underlying your ADSs. As a holder of ADSs, you will have ADS holder rights.
A deposit agreement among us, the depositary and you, as an ADS holder, and the beneficial owners of ADSs sets out ADS holder rights
as well as the rights and obligations of the depositary. The laws of the State of New York govern the deposit agreement and the
ADSs.
 
The following is a summary of the material
provisions of the deposit agreement. For more complete information, you should read the entire deposit agreement and the form of
American Depositary Receipt. For directions on how to obtain copies of those documents, see “Where You Can Find Additional
Information.”
 
Holding the ADSs
 
How will you hold your ADSs?
 
You may hold ADSs either (1) directly (a) by
having an American Depositary Receipt, or ADR, which is a certificate evidencing a specific number of ADSs, registered in your
name, or (b) by holding ADSs in DRS, or (2) indirectly through your broker or other financial institution. If you hold ADSs directly,
you are an ADS holder. This description assumes you hold your ADSs directly. If you hold the ADSs indirectly, you must rely on
the procedures of your broker or other financial institution to assert the rights of ADS holders described in this section. You
should consult with your broker or financial institution to find out what those procedures are.
 
Dividends and Other Distributions
 
How will you receive dividends and other distributions
on the shares?
 
The depositary has agreed to pay to you the
cash dividends or other distributions it or the custodian receives on ordinary shares or other deposited securities, after deducting
its fees and expenses. You will receive these distributions in proportion to the number of ordinary shares your ADSs represent
as of the record date (which will be as close as practicable to the record date for our ordinary shares) set by the depositary
with respect to the ADSs.
 

•Cash. The depositary will convert or cause to be converted any cash dividend or other cash distribution
we pay on the ordinary shares or any net proceeds from the sale of any ordinary shares, rights, securities or other entitlements
under the terms of the deposit agreement into U.S. dollars if it can do so on a practicable basis, and can transfer the U.S. dollars
to the United States and will distribute promptly the amount thus received. If the depositary shall determine in its judgment that
such conversions or transfers are not possible or lawful or if any government approval or license is needed and cannot be obtained
at a reasonable cost within a reasonable period or otherwise sought, the deposit agreement allows the depositary to distribute
the foreign currency only to those ADS holders to whom it is possible to do so. It will hold or cause the custodian to hold the
foreign currency it cannot convert for the account of the ADS holders who have not been paid and such funds will be held or the
respective accounts of the ADS holders. It will not invest the foreign currency and it will not be liable for any interest for
the respective accounts of the ADS holders.
 

 86 
 
 

•Before making a distribution, any taxes or other governmental charges, together with fees and expenses
of the depositary, that must be paid, will be deducted. See “Taxation.” It will distribute only whole U.S. dollars
and cents and will round fractional cents to the nearest whole cent. If the exchange rates fluctuate during a time when the depositary
cannot convert the foreign currency, you may lose some or all of the value of the distribution.
 

•Shares. For any ordinary shares we distribute as a dividend or free distribution, either (1) the
depositary will distribute additional ADSs representing such ordinary shares or (2) existing ADSs as of the applicable record date
will represent rights and interests in the additional ordinary shares distributed, to the extent reasonably practicable and permissible
under law, in either case, net of applicable fees, charges and expenses incurred by the depositary and taxes and/or other governmental
charges. The depositary will only distribute whole ADSs. It will try to sell ordinary shares which would require it to deliver
a fractional ADS and distribute the net proceeds in the same way as it does with cash. The depositary may sell a portion of the
distributed ordinary shares sufficient to pay its fees and expenses in connection with that distribution.
 

•Elective Distributions in Cash or Shares. If we offer holders of our ordinary shares the option
to receive dividends in either cash or shares, the depositary, after consultation with us and having received timely notice as
described in the deposit agreement of such elective distribution by us, has discretion to determine to what extent such elective
distribution will be made available to you as a holder of the ADSs. We must timely first instruct the depositary to make such elective
distribution available to you and furnish it with satisfactory evidence that it is legal to do so. The depositary could decide
it is not legal or reasonably practicable to make such elective distribution available to you. In such case, the depositary shall,
on the basis of the same determination as is made in respect of the ordinary shares for which no election is made, distribute either
cash in the same way as it does in a cash distribution, or additional ADSs representing ordinary shares in the same way as it does
in a share distribution. The depositary is not obligated to make available to you a method to receive the elective dividend in
shares rather than in ADSs. There can be no assurance that you will be given the opportunity to receive elective distributions
on the same terms and conditions as the holders of ordinary shares.
 

•Rights to Purchase Additional Shares. If we offer holders of our ordinary shares any rights to
subscribe for additional shares, the depositary shall having received timely notice as described in the deposit agreement of such
distribution by us, consult with us, and we must determine whether it is lawful and reasonably practicable to make these rights
available to you. We must first instruct the depositary to make such rights available to you and furnish the depositary with satisfactory
evidence that it is legal to do so. If the depositary decides it is not legal or reasonably practicable to make the rights available
but that it is lawful and reasonably practicable to sell the rights, the depositary will endeavor to sell the rights and in a riskless
principal capacity or otherwise, at such place and upon such terms (including public or private sale) as it may deem proper distribute
the net proceeds in the same way as it does with cash. The depositary will allow rights that are not distributed or sold to lapse.
In that case, you will receive no value for them.
 
If the depositary makes rights available to
you, it will establish procedures to distribute such rights and enable you to exercise the rights upon your payment of applicable
fees, charges and expenses incurred by the depositary and taxes and/or other governmental charges. The Depositary shall not be
obliged to make available to you a method to exercise such rights to subscribe for ordinary shares (rather than ADSs).
 
U.S. securities laws may restrict transfers
and cancellation of the ADSs represented by shares purchased upon exercise of rights. For example, you may not be able to trade
these ADSs freely in the United States.
 
There can be no assurance that you will be
given the opportunity to exercise rights on the same terms and conditions as the holders of ordinary shares or be able to exercise
such rights.
 

 87 
 
 

•Other Distributions. Subject to receipt of timely notice, as described in the deposit agreement,
from us with the request to make any such distribution available to you, and provided the depositary has determined such distribution
is lawful and reasonably practicable and feasible and in accordance with the terms of the deposit agreement, the depositary will
distribute to you anything else we distribute on deposited securities by any means it may deem practicable, upon your payment of
applicable fees, charges and expenses incurred by the depositary and taxes and/or other governmental charges. If any of the conditions
above are not met, the depositary will endeavor to sell, or cause to be sold, what we distributed and distribute the net proceeds
in the same way as it does with cash; or, if it is unable to sell such property, the depositary may dispose of such property in
any way it deems reasonably practicable under the circumstances for nominal or no consideration, such that you may have no rights
to or arising from such property.
 
The depositary is not responsible if it decides
that it is unlawful or impractical to make a distribution available to any ADS holders. We have no obligation to register ADSs,
shares, rights or other securities under the Securities Act. We also have no obligation to take any other action to permit the
distribution of ADSs, shares, rights or anything else to ADS holders. This means that you may not receive the distributions we
make on our shares or any value for them if we and/or the depositary determines that it is illegal or not practicable for us or
the depositary to make them available to you.
 
Deposit, Withdrawal and Cancellation
 
How are ADSs issued?
 
The depositary will deliver ADSs if you or
your broker deposit ordinary shares or evidence of rights to receive ordinary shares with the custodian. Upon payment of its fees
and expenses and of any taxes or charges, such as stamp taxes or stock transfer taxes or fees, the depositary will register the
appropriate number of ADSs in the names you request and will deliver the ADSs to or upon the order of the person or persons entitled
thereto.
 
How do ADS holders cancel an American Depositary
Share?
 
You may turn in your ADSs at the depositary’s
corporate trust office or by providing appropriate instructions to your broker. Upon payment of its fees and expenses and of any
taxes or charges, such as stamp taxes or stock transfer taxes or fees, the depositary will deliver the ordinary shares and any
other deposited securities underlying the ADSs to you or a person you designate at the office of the custodian. Or, at your request,
risk and expense, the depositary will deliver the deposited securities at its corporate trust office, to the extent permitted by
law.
 
How do ADS holders interchange between Certificated
ADSs and Uncertificated ADSs?
 
You may surrender your ADR to the depositary
for the purpose of exchanging your ADR for uncertificated ADSs. The depositary will cancel that ADR and will send you a statement
confirming that you are the owner of uncertificated ADSs. Alternatively, upon receipt by the depositary of a proper instruction
from a holder of uncertificated ADSs requesting the exchange of uncertificated ADSs for certificated ADSs, the depositary will
execute and deliver to you an ADR evidencing those ADSs.
 
Voting Rights
 
How do you vote?
 
You may instruct the depositary to vote the
ordinary shares or other deposited securities underlying your ADSs at any meeting at which you are entitled to vote pursuant to
any applicable law, the provisions of our M&A, and the provisions of or governing the deposited securities. Otherwise, you
could exercise your right to vote directly if you withdraw the ordinary shares. However, you may not know about the meeting sufficiently
enough in advance to withdraw the ordinary shares.
 

 88 
 
 
If we ask for your instructions and upon timely
notice from us by regular, ordinary mail delivery, or by electronic transmission, as described in the deposit agreement, the depositary
will notify you of the upcoming meeting at which you are entitled to vote pursuant to any applicable law, the provisions of our
M&A, and the provisions of or governing the deposited securities, and arrange to deliver our voting materials to you. The materials
will include or reproduce (a) such notice of meeting or solicitation of consents or proxies; (b) a statement that the ADS holders
at the close of business on the ADS record date will be entitled, subject to any applicable law, the provisions of our M&A,
and the provisions of or governing the deposited securities, to instruct the depositary as to the exercise of the voting rights,
if any, pertaining to the ordinary shares or other deposited securities represented by such holder’s ADSs; and (c) a brief
statement as to the manner in which such instructions may be given or deemed given in accordance with the second to last sentence
of this paragraph if no instruction is received, to the depositary to give a discretionary proxy to a person designated by us.
Voting instructions may be given only in respect of a number of ADSs representing an integral number of ordinary shares or other
deposited securities. For instructions to be valid, the depositary must receive them in writing on or before the date specified.
The depositary will try, as far as practical, subject to applicable law and the provisions of our M&A, to vote or to have its
agents vote the ordinary shares or other deposited securities (in person or by proxy) as you instruct. The depositary will only
vote or attempt to vote as you instruct. If we timely requested the depositary to solicit your instructions but no instructions
are received by the depositary from an owner with respect to any of the deposited securities represented by the ADSs of that owner
on or before the date established by the depositary for such purpose, the depositary shall deem that owner to have instructed the
depositary to give a discretionary proxy to a person designated by us with respect to such deposited securities, and the depositary
shall give a discretionary proxy to a person designated by us to vote such deposited securities. However, no such instruction shall
be deemed given and no such discretionary proxy shall be given with respect to any matter if we inform the depositary we do not
wish such proxy given, substantial opposition exists or the rights of holders of the ordinary shares would be materially and adversely
affected.
 
We cannot assure you that you will receive
the voting materials in time to ensure that you can instruct the depositary to vote the ordinary shares underlying your ADSs. In
addition, there can be no assurance that ADS holders and beneficial owners generally, or any holder or beneficial owner in particular,
will be given the opportunity to vote or cause the custodian to vote on the same terms and conditions as the holders of our ordinary
shares.
 
The depositary and its agents are not responsible
for failing to carry out voting instructions or for the manner of carrying out voting instructions. This means that you may not
be able to exercise your right to vote and you may have no recourse if the ordinary shares underlying your ADSs are not voted as
you requested.
 
In order to give you a reasonable opportunity
to instruct the depositary as to the exercise of voting rights relating to deposited securities, if we request the depositary to
act, we will give the depositary notice of any such meeting and details concerning the matters to be voted at least 30 business
days in advance of the meeting date.
 
Information Requests
 
Each ADS holder and beneficial owner shall
(a) provide such information as we or the depositary may request pursuant to law, including, without limitation, relevant British
Virgin Islands law, any applicable law of the United States of America, our M&A, any resolutions of our Board of Directors
adopted pursuant to such M&A, the requirements of any markets or exchanges upon which the ordinary shares, ADSs or ADRs are
listed or traded, or to any requirements of any electronic book-entry system by which the ADSs or ADRs may be transferred, regarding
the capacity in which they own or owned ADRs, the identity of any other persons then or previously interested in such ADRs and
the nature of such interest, and any other applicable matters, and (b) be bound by and subject to applicable provisions of the
laws of the British Virgin Islands, our M&A, and the requirements of any markets or exchanges upon which the ADSs, ADRs or
ordinary shares are listed or traded, or pursuant to any requirements of any electronic book-entry system by which the ADSs, ADRs
or ordinary shares may be transferred, to the same extent as if such ADS holder or beneficial owner held ordinary shares directly,
in each case irrespective of whether or not they are ADS holders or beneficial owners at the time such request is made.
 
Disclosure of Interests
 
Each ADS holder and beneficial owner shall
comply with our requests pursuant to British Virgin Islands law, the rules and requirements of the New York Stock Exchange and
any other stock exchange on which the ordinary shares are, or will be, registered, traded or listed or our M&A, which requests
are made to provide information, inter alia, as to the capacity in which such ADS holder or beneficial owner owns ADS and regarding
the identity of any other person interested in such ADS and the nature of such interest and various other matters, whether or not
they are ADS holders or beneficial owners at the time of such requests.
 

 89 
 
 
Fees and Expenses
 
As an ADS holder, you will be required to pay
the following service fees to the depositary bank and certain taxes and governmental charges (in addition to any applicable fees,
expenses, taxes and other governmental charges payable on the deposited securities represented by any of your ADSs):
 


Service
 
Fees

 
 
 

•          To any person to which ADSs are issued or to any person to which a distribution is made in respect of ADS distributions pursuant to stock dividends or other free distributions of stock, bonus distributions, stock splits or other distributions (except where converted to cash)
 
Up to US$0.05 per ADS issued

 
 
 

•          Cancellation of ADSs, including the case of termination of the deposit agreement
 
Up to US$0.05 per ADS cancelled

 
 
 

•          Distribution of cash dividends
 
Up to US$0.05 per ADS held

 
 
 

•          Distribution of cash entitlements (other than cash dividends) and/or cash proceeds from the sale of rights, securities and other entitlements
 
Up to US$0.05 per ADS held

 
 
 

•          Distribution of ADSs pursuant to exercise of rights.
 
Up to US$0.05 per ADS held

 
 
 

•          Distribution of securities other than ADSs or rights to purchase additional ADSs
 
Up to US$0.05 per ADS held

 
 
 

•          Depositary services
 
Up to US$0.05 per ADS held on the applicable record date(s) established by the depositary bank

 
As an ADS holder, you will also be responsible
to pay certain fees and expenses incurred by the depositary bank and certain taxes and governmental charges (in addition to any
applicable fees, expenses, taxes and other governmental charges payable on the deposited securities represented by any of your
ADSs) such as:
 

•Fees for the transfer and registration of ordinary shares charged by the registrar and transfer
agent for the ordinary shares in British Virgin Islands (i.e., upon deposit and withdrawal of ordinary shares).
 

•Expenses incurred for converting foreign currency into U.S. dollars.
 

•Expenses for cable, telex and fax transmissions and for delivery of securities.
 

•Taxes and duties upon the transfer of securities, including any applicable stamp duties, any stock
transfer charges or withholding taxes (i.e., when ordinary shares are deposited or withdrawn from deposit).
 

•Fees and expenses incurred in connection with the delivery or servicing of ordinary shares on deposit.
 

•Fees and expenses incurred in connection with complying with exchange control regulations and other
regulatory requirements applicable to ordinary shares, deposited securities, ADSs and ADRs.
 

•Any applicable fees and penalties thereon.
 
The depositary fees payable upon the issuance
and cancellation of ADSs are typically paid to the depositary bank by the brokers (on behalf of their clients) receiving the newly
issued ADSs from the depositary bank and by the brokers (on behalf of their clients) delivering the ADSs to the depositary bank
for cancellation. The brokers in turn charge these fees to their clients. Depositary fees payable in connection with distributions
of cash or securities to ADS holders and the depositary services fee are charged by the depositary bank to the holders of record
of ADSs as of the applicable ADS record date.
 

 90 
 
 
The depositary fees payable for cash distributions
are generally deducted from the cash being distributed or by selling a portion of distributable property to pay the fees. In the
case of distributions other than cash (i.e., share dividends, rights), the depositary bank charges the applicable fee to the ADS
record date holders concurrent with the distribution. In the case of ADSs registered in the name of the investor (whether certificated
or uncertificated in direct registration), the depositary bank sends invoices to the applicable record date ADS holders. In the
case of ADSs held in brokerage and custodian accounts (via DTC), the depositary bank generally collects its fees through the systems
provided by DTC (whose nominee is the registered holder of the ADSs held in DTC) from the brokers and custodians holding ADSs in
their DTC accounts. The brokers and custodians who hold their clients’ ADSs in DTC accounts in turn charge their clients’
accounts the amount of the fees paid to the depositary banks.
 
In the event of refusal to pay the depositary
fees, the depositary bank may, under the terms of the deposit agreement, refuse the requested service until payment is received
or may set off the amount of the depositary fees from any distribution to be made to the ADS holder.
 
The depositary has agreed to pay certain amounts
to us in exchange for its appointment as depositary. We may use these funds towards our expenses relating to the establishment
and maintenance of the ADR program, including investor relations expenses, or otherwise as we see fit. The depositary may pay us
a fixed amount, it may pay us a portion of the fees collected by the depositary from holders of ADSs, and it may pay specific expenses
incurred by us in connection with the ADR program. Neither the depositary nor we may be able to determine the aggregate amount
to be paid to us because (i) the number of ADSs that will be issued and outstanding and the level of dividend and/or servicing
fees to be charged may vary, and (ii) our expenses related to the program may not be known at this time.
 
Payment of Taxes
 
You will be responsible for any taxes or other
governmental charges payable, or which become payable, on your ADSs or on the deposited securities represented by any of your ADSs.
The depositary may refuse to register or transfer your ADSs or allow you to withdraw the deposited securities represented by your
ADSs until such taxes or other charges are paid. It may apply payments owed to you or sell deposited securities represented by
your ADSs to pay any taxes owed and you will remain liable for any deficiency. If the depositary sells deposited securities, it
will, if appropriate, reduce the number of ADSs to reflect the sale and pay to you any net proceeds, or send to you any property,
remaining after it has paid the taxes. You agree to indemnify us, the depositary, the custodian and each of our and their respective
agents, directors, employees and affiliates for, and hold each of them harmless from, any claims with respect to taxes (including
applicable interest and penalties thereon) arising from any refund of taxes, reduced rate of withholding at source or other tax
benefit obtained for you. Your obligations under this paragraph shall survive any transfer of ADRs, any surrender of ADRs and withdrawal
of deposited securities or the termination of the deposit agreement.
 
Reclassifications, Recapitalizations and
Mergers
 


If we:
 
Then:

 
 
 

Change the nominal or par value of our ordinary shares
 
The cash, shares or other securities received by the depositary will become deposited securities.

 
 
 

Reclassify, split up or consolidate any of the deposited securities
 
Each ADS will automatically represent its equal share of the new deposited securities.

 
 
 

Distribute securities on the ordinary shares that are not distributed to you, or Recapitalize, reorganize, merge, liquidate, sell all or substantially all of our assets, or take any similar action
 
The depositary may distribute some or all of the cash, shares or other securities it received. It may also deliver new ADSs or ask you to surrender your outstanding ADRs in exchange for new ADRs identifying the new deposited securities.

Amendment and Termination
 
How may the deposit agreement be amended?
 
We may agree with the depositary to amend the
deposit agreement and the form of ADR without your consent for any reason. If an amendment adds or increases fees or charges, except
for taxes and other governmental charges or expenses of the depositary for registration fees, facsimile costs, delivery charges
or similar items, including expenses incurred in connection with foreign exchange control regulations and other charges specifically
payable by ADS holders under the deposit agreement, or materially prejudices a substantial existing right of ADS holders, it will
not become effective for outstanding ADSs until 30 days after the depositary notifies ADS holders of the amendment. At the time
an amendment becomes effective, you are considered, by continuing to hold your ADSs, to agree to the amendment and to be bound
by the ADRs and the deposit agreement as amended. If any new laws are adopted which would require the deposit agreement to be amended
in order to comply therewith, we and the depositary may amend the deposit agreement in accordance with such laws and such amendment
may become effective before notice thereof is given to ADS holders.
 
How may the deposit agreement be terminated?
 
The depositary will terminate the deposit agreement
if we ask it to do so, in which case the depositary will give notice to you at least 60 days prior to termination. The depositary
may also terminate the deposit agreement if the depositary has told us that it would like to resign, or if we have removed the
depositary, and in either case we have not appointed a new depositary within 90 days. In either such case, the depositary must
notify you at least 30 days before termination.
 
After termination, the depositary and its agents
will do the following under the deposit agreement but nothing else: collect distributions on the deposited securities, sell rights
and other property and deliver ordinary shares and other deposited securities upon cancellation of ADSs after payment of any fees,
charges, taxes or other governmental charges. Six months or more after the date of termination, the depositary may sell any remaining
deposited securities by public or private sale. After that, the depositary will hold the money it received on the sale, as well
as any other cash it is holding under the deposit agreement, for the pro rata benefit of the ADS holders that have not surrendered
their ADSs. It will not invest the money and has no liability for interest. After such sale, the depositary’s only obligations
will be to account for the money and other cash. After termination, we shall be discharged from all obligations under the deposit
agreement except for our obligations to the depositary thereunder.
 
Books of Depositary
 
The depositary will maintain ADS holder records
at its depositary office. You may inspect such records at such office during regular business hours but solely for the purpose
of communicating with other holders in the interest of business matters relating to the Company, the ADRs and the deposit agreement.
 
The depositary will maintain facilities in
the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York to record and process the issuance, cancellation, combination, split-up and transfer
of ADRs.
 
These facilities may be closed at any time
or from time to time when such action is deemed necessary or advisable by the depositary in connection with the performance of
its duties under the deposit agreement or at our reasonable written request.
 
Limits on our Obligations and the Obligations
of the Depositary and the Custodian; Limits on Liability to Holders of ADSs
 
The deposit agreement expressly limits our
obligations and the obligations of the depositary and the custodian. It also limits our liability and the liability of the depositary.
The depositary and the custodian:
 

•are only obligated to take the actions specifically set forth in the deposit agreement without
gross negligence or willful misconduct;
 

 92 
 
 

•are not liable if any of us or our respective controlling persons or agents are prevented or forbidden
from, or subjected to any civil or criminal penalty or restraint on account of, or delayed in, doing or performing any act or thing
required by the terms of the deposit agreement and any ADR, by reason of any provision of any present or future law or regulation
of the United States or any state thereof, Cayman Island or any other country, or of any other governmental authority or regulatory
authority or stock exchange, or on account of the possible criminal or civil penalties or restraint, or by reason of any provision,
present or future, of our M&A or any provision of or governing any deposited securities, or by reason of any act of God or
war or other circumstances beyond its control (including, without limitation, nationalization, expropriation, currency restrictions,
work stoppage, strikes, civil unrest, revolutions, rebellions, explosions and computer failure);
 

•are not liable by reason of any exercise of, or failure to exercise, any discretion provided for
in the deposit agreement or in our M&A or provisions of or governing deposited securities;
 

•are not liable for any action or inaction of the depositary, the custodian or us or their or our
respective controlling persons or agents in reliance upon the advice of or information from legal counsel, any person presenting
ordinary shares for deposit or any other person believed by it in good faith to be competent to give such advice or information;
 

•are not liable for the inability of any holder of ADSs to benefit from any distribution on deposited
securities that is not made available to holders of ADSs under the terms of the deposit agreement;
 

•are not liable for any indirect, special, consequential or punitive damages for any breach of the
terms of the deposit agreement, or otherwise;
 

•may rely upon any documents we believe in good faith to be genuine and to have been signed or presented
by the proper party;
 

•disclaim any liability for any action or inaction or inaction of any of us or our respective controlling
persons or agents in reliance upon the advice of or information from legal counsel, accountants, any person presenting ordinary
shares for deposit, holders and beneficial owners (or authorized representatives) of ADSs, or any person believed in good faith
to be competent to give such advice or information; and
 

•disclaim any liability for inability of any holder to benefit from any distribution, offering,
right or other benefit made available to holders of deposited securities but not made available to holders of ADS.
 
The depositary and any of its agents also disclaim
any liability (i) for any failure to carry out any instructions to vote, the manner in which any vote is cast or the effect of
any vote or failure to determine that any distribution or action may be lawful or reasonably practicable or for allowing any rights
to lapse in accordance with the provisions of the deposit agreement, (ii) the failure or timeliness of any notice from us, the
content of any information submitted to it by us for distribution to you or for any inaccuracy of any translation thereof, (iii)
any investment risk associated with the acquisition of an interest in the deposited securities, the validity or worth of the deposited
securities, the credit-worthiness of any third party, (iv) for any tax consequences that may result from ownership of ADSs, ordinary
shares or deposited securities, or (vi) for any acts or omissions made by a successor depositary whether in connection with a previous
act or omission of the depositary or in connection with any matter arising wholly after the removal or resignation of the depositary,
provided that in connection with the issue out of which such potential liability arises the depositary performed its obligations
without gross negligence or willful misconduct while it acted as depositary.
 
In addition, the deposit agreement provides
that each party to the deposit agreement (including each holder, beneficial owner and holder of interests in the ADRs) irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in any lawsuit or proceeding
against the depositary or our company related to our shares, the ADSs or the deposit agreement.
 

 93 
 
 
In the deposit agreement, we and the depositary
agree to indemnify each other under certain circumstances.
 
Requirements for Depositary Actions
 
Before the depositary will issue, deliver or
register a transfer of an ADS, split-up, subdivide or combine ADSs, make a distribution on an ADS, or permit withdrawal of ordinary
shares, the depositary may require:
 

•payment of stock transfer or other taxes or other governmental charges and transfer or registration
fees charged by third parties for the transfer of any ordinary shares or other deposited securities and payment of the applicable
fees, expenses and charges of the depositary;
 

•satisfactory proof of the identity and genuineness of any signature or any other matters contemplated
in the deposit agreement; and
 

•compliance with (A) any laws or governmental regulations relating to the execution and delivery
of ADRs or ADSs or to the withdrawal or delivery of deposited securities and (B) such reasonable regulations and procedures as
the depositary may establish, from time to time, consistent with the deposit agreement and applicable laws, including presentation
of transfer documents.
 
The depositary may refuse to issue and deliver
ADSs or register transfers of ADSs generally when the register of the depositary or our transfer books are closed or at any time
if the depositary or we determine that it is necessary or advisable to do so.
 
Your Right to Receive the Shares Underlying
Your ADSs
 
You have the right to cancel your ADSs and
withdraw the underlying ordinary shares at any time except:
 

•when temporary delays arise because: (1) the depositary has closed its transfer books or we have
closed our transfer books; (2) the transfer of ordinary shares is blocked to permit voting at a shareholders’ meeting; or
(3) we are paying a dividend on our ordinary shares;
 

•when you owe money to pay fees, taxes and similar charges;
 

•when it is necessary to prohibit withdrawals in order to comply with any laws or governmental regulations
that apply to ADSs or to the withdrawal of ordinary shares or other deposited securities;
 

•other circumstances specifically contemplated by Section I.A.(l) of the General Instructions to
Form F-6 (as such General Instructions may be amended from time to time); or
 

•for any other reason if the depositary or we determine, in good faith, that it is necessary or
advisable to prohibit withdrawals.
 
The depositary shall not knowingly accept for
deposit under the deposit agreement any ordinary shares or other deposited securities required to be registered under the provisions
of the Securities Act, unless a registration statement is in effect as to such ordinary shares. This right of withdrawal may not
be limited by any other provision of the deposit agreement.
 

 94 
 
 
Pre-release of ADSs
 
The deposit agreement permits the depositary
to deliver ADSs before deposit of the underlying ordinary shares. This is called a pre-release of the ADSs. The depositary may
also deliver ordinary shares upon cancellation of pre-released ADSs (even if the ADSs are cancelled before the pre-release transaction
has been closed out). A pre-release is closed out as soon as the underlying ordinary shares are delivered to the depositary. The
depositary may receive ADSs instead of ordinary shares to close out a pre-release. The depositary may pre-release ADSs only under
the following conditions: (1) before or at the time of the pre-release, the person to whom the pre-release is being made represents
to the depositary in writing that it or its customer (a) owns the ordinary shares or ADSs to be deposited, (b) agrees to indicate
the depositary as owner of such ordinary shares or ADSs in its records and to hold such ordinary shares or ADSs in trust for the
depositary until such ordinary shares or ADSs are delivered to the depositary or the custodian, (c) unconditionally guarantees
to deliver such ordinary shares or ADSs to the depositary or the custodian, as the case may be, and (d) agrees to any additional
restrictions or requirements that the depositary deems appropriate; (2) the pre-release is fully collateralized with cash, United
States government securities or other collateral that the depositary considers appropriate; and (3) the depositary must be able
to close out the pre-release on not more than five business days’ notice. Each pre-release is subject to further indemnities
and credit regulations as the depositary considers appropriate. In addition, the depositary will normally limit the number of ADSs
that may be outstanding at any time as a result of pre-release to 30% of the aggregate number of ADSs then outstanding, although
the depositary may disregard the limit from time to time, if it thinks it is appropriate to do so.
 
Direct Registration System
 
In the deposit agreement, all parties to the
deposit agreement acknowledge that the DRS and Profile Modification System, or Profile, will apply to uncertificated ADSs upon
acceptance thereof to DRS by DTC. DRS is the system administered by DTC pursuant to which the depositary may register the ownership
of uncertificated ADSs, which ownership shall be evidenced by periodic statements issued by the depositary to the ADS holders entitled
thereto. Profile is a required feature of DRS which allows a DTC participant, claiming to act on behalf of an ADS holder, to direct
the depositary to register a transfer of those ADSs to DTC or its nominee and to deliver those ADSs to the DTC account of that
DTC participant without receipt by the depositary of prior authorization from the ADS holder to register such transfer.

SHARES ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALES
 
Upon completion of this offering, we will have
[ ] ADSs outstanding, representing approximately [ ] % of our outstanding ordinary shares, which number of shares has been calculated
based on an assumed initial offering price of US$[ ] per ADS, the mid-point of the initial public offering price. All of the ADSs
sold in this offering will be freely transferable by persons other than by our “affiliates” without restriction or
further registration under the Securities Act. Sales of substantial amounts of our ADSs in the public market could adversely affect
prevailing market prices of our ADSs. Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our ordinary shares or the ADSs.
We intend to apply to list the ADSs on the NYSE, but we cannot assure you that a regular trading market will develop in the ADSs.
We do not expect that a trading market will develop for our ordinary shares not represented by the ADSs.
 
Lock-up Agreements
 
The Company and each of our directors, executive
officers, and existing shareholder of more than 5% of outstanding shares of the Company have entered similar lock-up agreements
for a period of 180 days after the effective date (the “Effective Date”) of this registration statement, not
to offer, issue, sell, contract to sell, encumber, grant any option to purchase, make any short sale, lend or otherwise dispose
of, except in this offering, any of our ordinary shares or ADSs or securities that are substantially similar to our ordinary shares
or ADSs, other than pursuant to employee stock option plans existing on, or upon the conversion or exchange of convertible or exchangeable
securities outstanding as of, the date such lock-up agreement was executed, without the prior written consent of the Underwriter.
 
Other than this offering, we are not aware
of any plans by any significant shareholders to dispose of significant numbers of our ADSs or ordinary shares. However, one or
more existing shareholders may dispose of significant numbers of our ADSs or ordinary shares in the future. We cannot predict what
effect, if any, future sales of our ADSs or ordinary shares, or the availability of ADSs or ordinary shares for future sale, will
have on the trading price of our ADSs from time to time. Sales of substantial amounts of our ADSs or ordinary shares in the public
market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the trading price of our ADSs.
 
Rule 144
 
All of our ordinary shares that will be outstanding
upon the completion of this offering, other than those ordinary shares sold in this offering, are “restricted securities”
as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act and may be sold publicly in the United States only if they are subject
to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act or pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirement such
as those provided by Rule 144 and Rule 701 promulgated under the Securities Act. In general, beginning 90 days after the date of
this prospectus, a person (or persons whose shares are aggregated) who at the time of a sale is not, and has not been during the
three months preceding the sale, an affiliate of ours and has beneficially owned our restricted securities for at least six months
will be entitled to sell the restricted securities without registration under the Securities Act, subject only to the availability
of current public information about us, and will be entitled to sell restricted securities beneficially owned for at least one
year without restriction. Persons who are our affiliates and have beneficially owned our restricted securities for at least six
months may sell a number of restricted securities within any three-month period that does not exceed the greater of the following:
 

•1% of the then outstanding ordinary shares of the same class, in the form of ADSs or otherwise,
which immediately after this offering will equal [ ] ordinary shares, which number of shares has been calculated based on an assumed
initial offering price of US$[ ] per ADS, the mid-point of the estimated range of initial public offering price; or
 

•the average weekly trading volume of our ordinary shares of the same class, in the form of ADSs
or otherwise, during the four calendar weeks preceding the date on which notice of the sale is filed with the SEC.
 

 96 
 
 
Sales by our affiliates under Rule 144 are
also subject to certain requirements relating to manner of sale, notice and the availability of current public information about
us.
 
Rule 701
 
In general, under Rule 701 of the Securities
Act as currently in effect, each of our employees, consultants or advisors who purchases our ordinary shares from us in connection
with a compensatory stock plan or other written agreement executed prior to the completion of this offering is eligible to resell
those ordinary shares in reliance on Rule 144, but without compliance with some of the restrictions, including the holding period,
contained in Rule 144. However, the Rule 701 shares would remain subject to lock-up arrangements and would only become eligible
for sale when the lock-up period expires.

TAXATION
 
The following is a summary of the material
British Virgin Islands, the Republic of China and United States federal income tax consequences and considerations relevant to
an investment in our ADSs and ordinary shares. The discussion is not intended to be, nor should it be construed as, legal or tax
advice to any particular prospective purchaser. The discussion is based on laws and relevant interpretations thereof in effect
as of the date hereof, all of which are subject to change or different interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect. The discussion
does not address United States state or local tax laws, or tax laws of jurisdictions other than the British Virgin Islands, the
Republic of China and the United States.
 
British Virgin Islands Taxation
 
Under British Virgin Islands law as currently
in effect, a holder of ordinary shares who is not a resident of the British Virgin Islands is exempt from British Virgin Islands
income tax on dividends paid with respect to the ordinary shares and all holders of ordinary shares are not liable to the British
Virgin Islands for income tax on gains realized during that year on sale or disposal of such shares. The British Virgin Islands
does not impose a withholding tax on dividends paid by a company incorporated or re-registered under the BVI Act.
 
There are no capital gains, gift or inheritance
taxes levied by the British Virgin Islands on companies incorporated or re-registered under the BVI Act or persons not resident
in the British Virgin Islands. In addition, shares of companies incorporated or re-registered under the BVI Act are not subject
to transfer taxes, stamp duties or similar charges.
 
There is no income tax treaty currently in
effect between the United States and the British Virgin Islands or between Taiwan and the British Virgin Islands.
 
 Maples & Calder, our BVI counsel,
has confirmed the information relating the BVI taxation contained in this section in part of its legal opinion attached
herein as Exhibit 8.1. 
 
United States Taxation
 

•Material United States Federal Income Tax Considerations
 
The following is a general summary of material
U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to the purchase, ownership and disposition of the ADSs or ordinary shares by U.S.
Investors (as defined below) that purchase the ADSs or ordinary shares pursuant to the public offering and hold such ADSs or ordinary
shares as capital assets as defined under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. This summary is based on
the Code, the Treasury regulations issued pursuant to the Code, or the Treasury Regulations, and administrative and judicial interpretations
thereof, all as in effect on the date hereof and all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect, or to different
interpretation. Such change could materially and adversely affect the tax consequences described below. No assurance can be given
that the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary
to any of the tax consequences described below. This summary is for general information only and does not address all of the tax
considerations that may be relevant to specific U.S. Investors in light of their particular circumstances or to U.S. Investors
subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax law (such as banks or other financial institutions, insurance companies,
tax-exempt organizations, retirement plans, partnerships, regulated investment companies, dealers in stock, securities or currencies,
brokers, real estate investment trusts, certain former citizens or residents of the United States, persons who acquire ADSs or
ordinary shares as part of a straddle, hedge, conversion transaction or other integrated investment, persons that have a “functional
currency” other than the U.S. dollar, persons that own directly, indirectly or constructively 10.0% or more of our company’s
shares, persons that are resident in or hold ADSs or ordinary shares in connection with a permanent establishment outside the United
States or persons that generally mark their securities to market for U.S. federal income tax purposes).
 

 98 
 
 
As used in this summary, the term “U.S.
Investor” means a beneficial owner of ADSs or ordinary shares that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) an individual
citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia, (iii)
an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source or (iv) a trust, (a) if a court within
the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over its administration and one or more “U.S. persons” (within
the meaning of the Code) have the authority to control all of its substantial decisions, or (b) if a valid election is in effect
for the trust to be treated as a U.S. person.
 
If an entity treated as a partnership for U.S.
federal income tax purposes holds the ADSs or ordinary shares, the tax treatment of such partnership and each partner thereof will
generally depend upon the status and activities of the partnership and such partner. A holder that is treated as a partnership
for U.S. federal income tax purposes should consult its own tax adviser regarding the U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable
to it and its partners of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the ADSs or ordinary shares.
 
Prospective investors should consult their
tax advisers as to the particular tax considerations applicable to them relating to the purchase, ownership and disposition of
ADSs or ordinary shares, including the applicability of U.S. federal, state and local tax laws and non-U.S. tax laws.
 

•Taxation of Dividends
 
Subject to the passive foreign investment company
(“PFIC”) discussed below, a U.S. Investor will be required to include in gross income the gross amount of any distribution
paid on the ADSs or ordinary shares (including any amount of taxes withheld by our company) out of our Company’s current
or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes). Distributions in excess of our Company’s
current and accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of the U.S. Investor’s
adjusted tax basis in the ordinary shares and ADSs and thereafter will be treated as a gain from the sale of the ordinary shares
and ADSs. Consequently, a U.S. Investor should treat the entire amount of any distribution received as a dividend.
 
In case of a U.S. Investor that is a corporation,
dividends paid on the ADSs or ordinary shares will be subject to regular corporate rates and will not be eligible for the “dividends
received” deduction generally allowed to corporate shareholders with respect to dividends received from U.S. corporations.
Subject to the discussion below, dividends paid on the ADSs or ordinary shares to individuals and certain other non-corporate persons
will generally be subject to tax at ordinary income rates.
 
Certain dividends received by non-corporate
U.S. Investors, including individuals, in taxable years beginning before January 1, 2013, generally will be subject to a maximum
income tax rate of 15.0%. This reduced income tax rate is applicable to dividends paid by “qualified foreign corporations”
and only if certain holding period requirements and other conditions are met. A non-U.S. corporation (other than a corporation
that is classified as a PFIC for the taxable year in which the dividend is paid or the preceding taxable year) generally will be
considered to be a qualified foreign corporation (i) if it is eligible for the benefits of a comprehensive tax treaty with the
U.S. and which includes an exchange of information program or (ii) with respect to any dividend it pays on stock which is readily
tradable on an established securities market in the U.S. Unless legislation is enacted extending the favorable tax treatment of
dividends, dividends received by non-corporate U.S. investors in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2012 will generally
be subject to tax at ordinary income rates.
 
A U.S. Investor may be eligible, subject to
a number of complex limitations, to claim a foreign tax credit in respect of any foreign withholding taxes imposed on dividends
received on the ADSs or ordinary shares. A U.S. Investor who does not elect to claim a foreign tax credit for foreign income tax
withheld, may instead claim a deduction, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in respect of such withholding, but only for a year
in which such investor elects to do so for all creditable foreign income taxes. For purposes of calculating the foreign tax credit
limitation, dividends paid by our Company will, depending on the circumstances of the U.S. investor, be either general or passive
income.
 

 99 
 
 

•Taxation of Sale, Exchange or Other Disposition of ADSs or ordinary shares
 
Subject to the PFIC discussion below, a U.S.
investor generally will recognize capital gain or loss upon the sale, exchange or other disposition of ADSs or ordinary shares
in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount realized on the sale, exchange or other disposition and the U.S.
Investor’s adjusted tax basis in such ADSs or ordinary shares. This capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or
loss if the U.S. Investor’s holding period in the ADSs or ordinary shares exceeds one year. Long-term capital gain of a non-corporate
U.S. investor is generally taxed at preferential rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. The gain
or loss will generally be income or loss from sources within the United States for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes. U.S. Investors
are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences if a foreign tax is imposed on the disposition of ADSs or
ordinary shares, including the availability of the foreign tax credit under an investor’s own particular circumstances.
 
A U.S. investor that receives non-U.S. currency
on the disposition of the ADSs or ordinary shares will realize an amount equal to the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency
received on the date of disposition (or in the case of cash basis and electing accrual basis taxpayers, the settlement date) whether
or not converted into U.S. dollars at that time. Very generally, the U.S. Investor will recognize currency gain or loss if the
U.S. dollar value of the currency received on the settlement date differs from the amount realized with respect to the ADSs or
ordinary shares. Any currency gain or loss on the settlement date or on any subsequent disposition of the foreign currency generally
will be U.S. source ordinary income or loss.
 

•Passive Foreign Investment Company
 
In general, a foreign corporation will be treated
as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes in any taxable year in which either (i) at least 75.0% of its gross income is “passive
income” or (ii) at least 50.0% of the average value of its total assets is attributable to assets that produce passive income
or are held for the production of passive income. Passive income for this purpose generally includes, among other things, dividends,
interest, certain royalties, rents and gains from commodities and securities transactions and from the sale or exchange of property
that gives rise to passive income. In determining whether a foreign corporation is a PFIC, a proportionate share of the income
and assets of each corporation in which it owns, directly or indirectly, at least a 25.0% interest (by value) is taken into account.
 
We do not expect to be a PFIC for the current
taxable year or any future year. The PFIC determination, however, depends upon the application of complex U.S. federal income tax
rules concerning the classification of our assets and income for this purpose and the application of these rules is uncertain in
some respects. Under the income and asset tests, whether our company is a PFIC will be determined annually based upon the composition
and nature of our income and the composition, nature and valuation of our assets, all of which are subject to change. For purposes
of the asset test, any cash, including proceeds from the public offering, will generally be treated as a passive asset and the
amount of cash held by our Company in any year will depend, in part, on when our Company spends the cash raised from the public
offering and generated in its operations. In addition, the determination of our Company’s PFIC status will depend upon the
nature of the assets acquired by our Company. Moreover, the determination of the value of our Company’s assets may depend
on its market capitalization, and that market capitalization may fluctuate. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will
not be a PFIC in the current or any future year. In addition, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge any determination
by our Company that it does not constitute a PFIC.
 

 100 
 
 
If our Company was classified as a PFIC for
any taxable year during which a U.S. Investor held ADSs or ordinary shares, the U.S. Investor, absent certain elections (including
a mark-to-market election), would generally be subject to adverse rules (regardless of whether our company continues to be classified
as a PFIC) with respect to (i) any “excess distributions” (generally, any distributions received by the U.S. Investor
on the ADSs or ordinary shares in a taxable year that were greater than 125 percent of the average annual distributions received
by the U.S. Investor in the three preceding taxable years or, if shorter, the U.S. Investor’s holding period for the ADSs
or ordinary shares) and (ii) any gain realized on the sale or other disposition of ADSs or ordinary shares.
 
Under these adverse rules (a) the excess distribution
or gain would be allocated ratably over the U.S. Investor’s holding period, (b) the amount allocated to the current taxable
year and any taxable year prior to the first taxable year in which our company was classified as a PFIC will be taxed as ordinary
income, and (c) the amount allocated to each of the other taxable years during which our company was classified as a PFIC would
be subject to tax at the highest rate of tax in effect for the applicable class of taxpayers for that year and an interest charge
would be imposed with respect to the resulting tax attributable to each such taxable year.
 
If our company was a PFIC for any taxable year
during which a U.S. Investor held the ADSs or ordinary shares, our company would continue to be treated as a PFIC with respect
to that U.S. Investor for all succeeding years during which the U.S. Investor held the ADSs or ordinary shares. The U.S. Investor
may terminate this deemed PFIC status by electing to recognize gains (which would be taxed under the special tax rules discussed
above) as if the U.S. Investor’s ADSs or ordinary shares had been sold on the last day of the last taxable year for which
our company was a PFIC. If our company holds or acquires an interest in an entity which is itself a PFIC, such an interest may
be treated as owned by a U.S. Investor. U.S. Investors should consult their own tax advisers regarding the consequences to them
if our company holds or acquires an interest in an entity which is itself a PFIC.
 
Although the PFIC rules permit a U.S. holder
of stock in a PFIC in certain circumstances to avoid some of the disadvantageous tax treatment described above by making a “qualified
electing fund,” or QEF, election, a U.S. Investor will not be able to elect to treat our Company as a QEF because our Company
does not intend to prepare the information that the U.S. Investor would need to make a QEF election.
 
If our company was a PFIC in any year with
respect to a U.S. Investor, the disadvantageous tax treatment described above may in part be avoided with respect to our company
if a U.S. Investor validly made a mark-to-market election as of the beginning of such U.S. Investor’s holding period. If
such election was made, such U.S. Investor generally would be required to take into account the difference, if any, between the
fair market value of, and its adjusted tax basis in, the ADSs or ordinary shares at the end of each taxable year as ordinary income
or, to the extent of any net mark-to-market gains previously included in income, ordinary loss, and to make corresponding adjustments
to the tax basis of such ADSs or ordinary shares. In addition, any gain from a sale, exchange or other disposition of the ADSs
or ordinary shares would be treated as ordinary income, and any loss would be treated as ordinary losses (to the extent of any
net mark-to-market gains previously included in income). A mark-to-market election is available to a U.S. Investor only if the
ADSs or ordinary shares are considered “marketable stock.” Generally, shares will be considered marketable stock if
the shares are “regularly traded” on a “qualified exchange” within the meaning of applicable Treasury Regulations.
 
If our company was a PFIC in any year with
respect to a U.S. investor, the U.S. Investor would be required to file an annual return on IRS Form 8621 regarding distributions
received on the ADSs or ordinary shares and any gain realized on the disposition of the ADSs or ordinary shares. In addition, under
recently enacted U.S. legislation and subject to future guidance, if we were a PFIC, U.S. Investors would be required to file,
for taxable years beginning after March 18, 2010, an annual information return with the IRS relating to their ownership of the
ADSs or ordinary shares. Although expected, no guidance has yet been issued about such return, including on the information required
to be reported on such return, the form of the return, or the due date for the return.
 

 101 
 
 
U.S.	investors should consult their tax
advisors regarding the potential application of the PFIC regime, including eligibility for and the manner and advisability of making
a mark-to-market election.
 

•Certain Reporting Requirements
 
Certain U.S. investors are required to file
information returns with the IRS, including IRS Form 926, Return by U.S. Transferor of Property to a Foreign Corporation, reporting
transfers of cash or other property to our Company and information relating to the U.S. Investor and our Company. Substantial penalties
may be imposed upon a U.S. Investor that fails to comply.
 
Subject to specified exceptions and future
guidance, recently enacted U.S. tax legislation generally requires a U.S. Investor (that is an individual or, to the extent provided
in future guidance, a U.S entity) to report to the IRS such U.S. Investor’s interests in stock or securities issued by a
non-U.S. person (such as the company) for taxable years beginning after March 18, 2010. Although expected, no guidance on this
reporting requirement has yet been issued. U.S. Investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the information reporting
obligations that may arise from their acquisition, ownership or disposition of ADSs or ordinary shares.
 

•Backup Withholding Tax and Information Reporting Requirements
 
Under certain circumstances, U.S. backup withholding
tax and/or information reporting may apply to U.S. Investors with respect to dividend payments made on or the payment of proceeds
from the sale, exchange or other disposition of the ADSs or ordinary shares, unless an applicable exemption is satisfied. U.S.
Investors that are corporations generally are excluded from these information reporting and backup withholding tax rules. Backup
withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding tax rules will be allowed as a credit against
a U.S. Investor’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, or will be refunded, if such U.S. Investor timely furnishes
required information to the IRS.

Plan of Distribution
 
We expect to enter into an underwriting agreement
with the Underwriter named therein with respect to the ADSs in this offering. Under the terms and subject to the conditions contained
in the underwriting agreement, we have agreed to issue and sell a minimum offering amount of ADSs and a maximum offering    amount
of ADSs on a best efforts basis. The offering is being made without a firm commitment by the underwriter, which has no obligation
or commitment to purchase any securities. The Underwriter is not required to sell any specific number of dollar amount of ADSs
but will use its best efforts to sell the ADSs offered.
 
We do not intend to close this offering unless
we sell at least a minimum number of ADS, at the price per ADS set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, to result in sufficient
proceeds to list our ADSs on the NASDAQ. We plan to apply to list our ADSs on the NASDAQ under the symbol“ ”. Because
this is a best efforts offering, the Underwriter does not have an obligation to purchase any securities, and, as a result, we may
not be able to sell the minimum number of ADSs. The offering may close or terminate, as the case may be, on the earlier of (i)
any time after the minimum offering amount of our ADSs is raised, or (ii) 90 days from the date of this prospectus, or the expiration
date. If we can successfully raise the minimum offering amount within the offering period, the proceeds from the offering will

letters. The Underwriter is under no obligation to purchase any ADSs for its own account. Trading in the ADSs will commence within
five days after the date of the initial issuance of ADSs pursuant to this prospectus. As an offering on a best efforts basis, there
can be no assurance that the offering contemplated hereby will ultimately be consummated. The Underwriter may, but is not obligated
to, retain other selected dealers that are qualified to offer and sell the shares and that are members of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”).

Prior to this Offering, there has been no public

•the recent market prices of, and demand for, publicly traded securities of generally comparable
companies; and
 

•other factors deemed relevant by the Underwriter and us.
 
The estimated initial public offering price
range set forth on the cover page of this preliminary prospectus is subject to change as a result of market conditions and other
factors. Neither we nor the Underwriter can assure investors that an active trading market will develop for our ordinary shares,
or that the shares will trade in the public market at or above the initial public offering price.
 
We have agreed to indemnify the Underwriter
against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. If we are unable to provide this indemnification,
we will contribute to payments that the Underwriter may be required to make for these liabilities.

Terms of the Offering
 
We are offering, on a best efforts basis, a
minimum of ADSs and a maximum of ADSs. The Offering is being made without a firm commitment by the Underwriter, which has no obligation
or commitment to purchase any securities. The Underwriter is not required to sell any specific number of dollar amount of ADSs
but will use its best efforts to sell the ADSs offered. The ADSs are being offered for a period not to exceed 120 days. If the
minimum offering amount is not raised within 120 days from the date of this prospectus, all subscription funds from the escrow
account will be returned to investors promptly without interest (since the funds are being held in a non-interest bearing account)
or deduction of fees. The Offering may terminate on the earlier of (i) any time after the minimum offering amount of our ADSs is
raised, or (ii) 120 days from the date of this prospectus. If we can successfully raise the minimum offering amount within the
offering period, the proceeds from the Offering will be released to us.
 
Deposit of Offering Proceeds
 
The proceeds from the sale of the ADSs in this
Offering will be deposited in a separate (limited to funds received on behalf of us) non-interest bearing bank account at the branch
of established by the Escrow Agent, or the Escrow Account. The purpose of the Escrow Account is for (i) the deposit of all subscription
monies (checks or wire transfers) which are received by the Underwriter from prospective purchasers of the our offered ADSs and
are delivered by the Underwriter to the Escrow Agent, (ii) the holding of amounts of subscription monies which are collected through
the banking system, and (iii) the disbursement of collected funds.
 
The Underwriter shall promptly deliver to the
Escrow Agent all funds in the form of checks or wire transfers which it receives from prospective purchasers of our ADSs by the
end of the next business day following receipt where internal supervisory review is conducted at the same location at which subscription
documents and funds are received. Simultaneously with each deposit to the Escrow Account, the Underwriter shall inform the Escrow
Agent about the subscription information for each prospective purchaser. Upon the Escrow Agent’s receipt of such monies,
they shall be credited to the Escrow Account. All checks delivered to the Escrow Agent shall be made payable to “ ”
The Escrow Agent shall not be required to accept for credit to the Escrow Account or for deposit into the Escrow Account checks
which are not accompanied by the appropriate subscription information. Wire transfers representing payments by prospective purchasers
shall not be deemed deposited in the Escrow Account until the Escrow Agent has received in writing the subscription information
required with respect to such payments.
 
No interest will be available for payment to
either us or the investors (since the funds are being held in a non-interest bearing account). All subscription funds will be held
in trust pending the raising of the minimum offering amount and no funds will be released to us until the completion of the offering.
Release of the funds to us is based upon the Escrow Agent reviewing the records of the depository institution holding the escrow
to verify that the funds received have cleared the banking system prior to releasing the funds to us. All subscription information
and subscription funds through checks or wire transfers should be delivered to the Escrow Agent. Failure to do so will result in
subscription funds being returned to the investor. In event that the offering is terminated, all subscription funds from the escrow
account will be returned to investors. We have appointed [to be updated], an independent third party, as our Escrow Agent.

Report of Independent
Registered Public Accounting Firm
 
To Shareholders and Board of Directors of
Yao-Teh International Recreation Co.,
Ltd and Ta-Teh-Fu Co., Ltd.
 
We have audited the accompanying combined
balance sheets of Yao-Teh International Recreation Co., Ltd and Ta-Teh-Fu Co., Ltd. (collectively, the “Company”)
as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related combined statements of operations and comprehensive income, cash flows, and
equity for the years then ended. The Company’s management is responsible for these combined financial statements. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these combined financial statements based on our audits.
 
We conducted our audits in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The
company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our
audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate
in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control
over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.
 
In our opinion, the combined financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the combined financial position of Yao-Teh International
Recreation Co., Ltd and Ta-Teh-Fu Co., Ltd. as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the combined results of its operations and its
cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
 
The accompanying combined financial statements
have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As described in NOTE 2 of the combined financial
statements, the Company’s viability is dependent upon its ability to obtain future financing and the success of its future
operations. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s
plan in regard to these matters is also described in NOTE 2 to the combined financial statements. The combined financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

YAO-TEH INTERNATIONAL
RECREATION CO., LTD. AND TA-TEH-FU CO., LTD.
NOTES TO COMBINEDFINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
NOTE 1. ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS
 
Yao-Teh International Recreation Co.,
Ltd., (the “Yao-Teh”), was incorporated on May 30, 1988 under the laws of Taiwan (R.O.C.). Yao-Teh is in the business
of developing and operating golf course facilities. Mr. Fun-Ming Lo is the controlling beneficiary shareholder of Yao-Teh.
 
Ta-Teh-Fu Co., Ltd., (“Ta-Teh-Fu”),
was incorporated on June 27, 2001 under the laws of Taiwan (R.O.C.). Ta-Teh-Fu’s main business is to lease golf carts, machinery,
and equipment to Yao-Teh. Mr. Fun-Ming Lo is the controlling beneficiary shareholder of Ta-Teh-Fu.
 
The fiscal year of Yao-Teh and Ta-Teh-Fu
(collectively, the “Company”) ends on December 31st.
 
NOTE 2. GOING CONCERN
 
The Company has incurred a net loss attributable
to common stock shareholders of $3,763,596 and $3,158,693 during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The
accompanying combined financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. This
basis of accounting contemplates the recovery of the Company’s assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal
course of business. This presentation presumes funds will be available to finance ongoing research and development, operations
and capital expenditures and permit the realization of assets and the payment of liabilities in the normal course of operations
for the foreseeable future.
 
There can be no assurances that there
will be adequate financing available to the Company and the combined financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect
the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities
that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
 
In order to continue as a going concern,
the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management’s plans to obtain such resources for
the Company include (1) obtaining capital from the sale of its equity securities (2) short-term and long-term borrowings from
banks, and (3) short-term borrowings from stockholders or other related party(ies) when needed. However, management cannot provide
any assurance that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans.
 
The ability of the Company to continue
as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and
eventually to secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations.
 
NOTE 3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES
 
Basis of Presentation —
The accompanying combined financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. The financial statements include the combined accounts of Yao-Teh and Ta-Teh-Fu. These Companies
are under common control and ownership. All significant intercompany transactions and account balances have been eliminated.
 

 F-8 
 
 
The functional currency of Yao-Teh and
Ta-Teh-Fu is the New Taiwan dollars, however the accompanying combined financial statements have been translated and presented
in United States Dollars ($). In the accompanying combined financial statements and notes, “$”, “US$”
and “U.S. dollars” mean United States dollars, and “NT$” and “NT dollars” mean New Taiwan
dollars.
 
Segment Reporting —
The Company follows the provisions of ASC 280 (formerly referred to as SFAS No. 131, Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise
and Related Information), which establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments, which uses a “management”
approach for determining segments. The management approach designates the internal organization that is used by management for
making operating decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s reportable segments. ASC Topic 280,
“Segment Reporting,” also requires disclosures about products or services, geographic areas, and major customers.
The Company’s management reporting structure provided for only one segment in 2015 and 2014 and accordingly, no separate
segment information is presented.
 
Accounting Estimates — The preparation
of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
Cash and Cash Equivalents — The Company
considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.
 
Accounts Receivable and Other Receivable
— Accounts receivable and other receivables are stated at carrying value less estimates made for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment of trade and other receivables is established if the collection of a receivable becomes doubtful.
Such receivable becomes doubtful when there is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to collect all amounts due
according to the original terms of the receivables. Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor
will enter into bankruptcy or financial reorganization, and default or delinquency in payments are considered indicators that
the receivable is impaired. The amount of the allowance is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present
value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. An impairment loss is recognized in
the statement of income, as are subsequent recoveries of previous impairments.
 
Property and Equipment —
Property and equipment is carried at cost net of accumulated depreciation. Repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Expenditures
that improve the functionality of the related asset or extend the useful life are capitalized. When property and equipment is
retired or otherwise disposed of, the related gain or loss is included in operating income. Leasehold improvements are depreciated
on the straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining lease term or estimated useful life of the asset. Depreciation is
calculated on the straight-line method, including property and equipment under capital leases, generally based on the following
useful lives:
 


  
Estimated Life in Years 

Land improvements 
 50 

Buildings and building improvements 
 15 

Machinery and equipment 
 5 

Office equipment 
 5 

 

 F-9 
 
 
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
— The Company has adopted Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 360-10, Property, Plant and Equipment (“ASC
360-10”). ASC 360-10 requires that long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles held and used by the Company
be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable. The Company evaluates its long lived assets for impairment annually or more often if events and circumstances warrant.
Events relating to recoverability may include significant unfavorable changes in business conditions, recurring losses, or a forecasted
inability to achieve break-even operating results over an extended period. The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived
assets based upon forecasted undiscounted cash flows. Should impairment in value be indicated, the carrying value of intangible
assets will be adjusted, based on estimates of future discounted cash flows resulting from the use and ultimate disposition of
the asset. ASC 360-10 also requires assets to be disposed of be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value
less costs to sell. Management has determined that no impairments of long-lived assets currently exist.
 
Land Held for Sale and Investment
— The Company recorded the land held for sale and investment at the original land acquisition costs.
 
Fair Value Measurements —
FASB ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements” (formerly SFAS No. 157) defines fair value for certain financial and nonfinancial
assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures
about fair value measurements. It requires that an entity measure its financial instruments to base fair value on exit price,
maximize the use of observable units and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to determine the exit price. It establishes a
hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. This hierarchy increases the consistency
and comparability of fair value measurements and related disclosures by maximizing the use of observable inputs and minimizing
the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that reflect
the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities based on market data obtained from sources
independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company’s own assumptions about the assumptions
market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.
The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels based on the reliability of the inputs as follows:
 

·Level
  1 – Inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
  that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date. Valuation of these
  instruments does not require a high degree of judgment as the valuations are based on
  quoted prices in active markets that are readily and regularly available.
 

·Level
  2 – Inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly
  or indirectly observable as of the measurement date, such as quoted prices for similar
  assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs
  that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially
  the full term of the assets or liabilities.
 

·Level
  3 – Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and not corroborated by market
  data. The fair value for such assets and liabilities is generally determined using pricing
  models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques that incorporate the
  assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability.
 

 F-10 
 
 
This guidance applies to other accounting
pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. On February 12, 2008, the FASB finalized FASB Staff Position (FSP)
No. 157-2, Effective Date of FASB
 
Statement No. 157 (ASC 820). This Staff
Position delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157 (ASC 820) for nonfinancial assets and liabilities to fiscal years beginning
after November 15, 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years, except for those items that are recognized or disclosed
at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). The adoption of SFAS No. 157 (ASC 820) had
no effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations for the year 2015 and 2014.
 
We also analyze all financial instruments
with features of both liabilities and equity under ASC 480-10 (formerly SFAS 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments
with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity”) and ASC 815-40 (formerly EITF 00-19, “Accounting for Derivative
Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own Stock”). We have determined ASC 480-10
(formerly SFAS 150) and ASC 815-40 (formerly EITF 00-19)	had no material effect on our financial position or results of operations
for the year 2015 and 2014.
 
Revenue Recognition —
The following describes the composition of revenues for the Company:
 

·Greens
  fee is charged to play on the golf course from members and non-members. The revenues
  are recognized when the services are rendered.
 

·Revenue
  from non-refundable membership initiation fees is recognized over the estimated life
  of the facilities on a straight-line basis upon inception of the club. As of December
31, 2015 and 2014, the weighted average remaining period over which non-refundable membership
  initiation fees will be recognized is approximately 30 years and 31 years, respectively
  (See NOTE 11).
 
Advertising Costs —
Advertising costs are expensed at the time such advertising commences. Advertising expense for the years ended December 31, 2015
and 2014 was $4,013 and $13,308, respectively.
 
Income Taxes — Income
taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future
tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities
and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to
be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in
the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recognized if it is more likely than not that some portion,
or all, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. There were no significant deferred tax items as of December 31, 2015 and
2014.
 
The Company applied the provisions of
ASC 740-10-50, “Accounting For Uncertainty In Income Taxes”, which provides clarification related to the process associated
with accounting for uncertain tax positions recognized in our financial statements. Audit periods remain open for review until
the statute of limitations has passed. The completion of review or the expiration of the statute of limitations for a given audit
period could result in an adjustment to the Company’s liability for income taxes. Any such adjustment could be material
to the Company’s results of operations for any given quarterly or annual period based, in part, upon the results of operations
for the given period. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, management considered that the Company had no uncertain tax positions, and
will continue to evaluate for uncertain positions in the future.
 

 F-11 
 
 
Concentration of Credit Risk—The
Company’s financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents
and restricted cash. The Company places its cash and temporary cash investments in high quality credit institutions, but these
investments may be in excess of Taiwan Central Deposit Insurance Corporation’s insurance limits. The Company does not enter
into financial instruments for hedging, trading or speculative purposes. Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade
 
and notes receivables is limited due to
the wide variety of customers and markets in which the Company transacts business, as well as their dispersion across many geographical
areas. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral, but does require
advance deposits on certain transactions.
 
Use of Estimates —
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
Foreign-currency Transactions —
Foreign-currency transactions are recorded in New Taiwan dollars (“NT$”) at the rates of exchange in effect when the
transactions occur. Gains or losses resulting from the application of different foreign exchange rates when cash in foreign currency
is converted into New Taiwan dollars, or when foreign-currency receivables or payables are settled, are credited or charged to
income in the year of conversion or settlement. On the balance sheet dates, the balances of foreign-currency assets and liabilities
are restated at the prevailing exchange rates and the resulting differences are charged to current income except for those foreign
currencies denominated investments in shares of stock where such differences are accounted for as translation adjustments under
stockholders’ deficit.
 
Statement of Cash Flows—Cash
flows from the Company's operations are based upon the local currencies. As a result, amounts related to assets and liabilities
reported on the statement of cash flows will not necessarily agree with changes in the corresponding balances on the balance sheet.
 
Translation Adjustment —
The accounts of the Company was maintained, and its financial statements were expressed, in New Taiwan Dollar (“NT$”).
Such financial statements were translated into U.S. Dollars (“$” or “USD”) in accordance ASC 830, "Foreign
Currency Matters", with the NT$ as the functional currency. According to the Statement, all assets and liabilities are translated
at the current exchange rate, stockholder's deficit are translated at the historical rates and income statement items are translated
at an average exchange rate for the period. The resulting translation adjustments are reported under other comprehensive income
as a component of stockholders’ deficit.
 
Comprehensive Income —
Comprehensive income includes accumulated foreign currency translation gains and losses. The Company has reported the components
of comprehensive income on its statements of stockholders’ deficit and comprehensive income (loss).
 
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
— In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "Leases," which requires recognition of lease assets
and lease liabilities on the balance sheet of lessees. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years and interim reporting periods
within those years beginning after December 15, 2018, or in fiscal 2020. Early adoption is permitted. ASU 2016-02 requires a modified
retrospective transition approach and provides certain optional transition relief. We are currently evaluating the effect the
adoption of this guidance will have on our combined results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
 

 F-12 
 
 
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (“ASU 2014-09”), which amends the existing accounting standards
for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 is based on principles that govern the recognition of revenue at an amount an entity expects
to be entitled when products are transferred to customers. The original effective date for ASU 2014-09 would have required the
Company to adopt beginning in its first quarter of 2018. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-
 
14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(Topic 606) – Deferral of the Effective Date, which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for one year and permits early
adoption as early as the original effective date of ASU 2014-09. Accordingly, the Company may adopt the standard in either its
first quarter of 2018 or 2019.In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)
– Principal versus Agent Considerations (“ASU 2016-08”), which clarifies the implementation guidance for principal
versus agent considerations in ASU 2014-09. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(Topic 606) – Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing (“ASU 2016-10”), which amends the guidance in
ASU 2014-09 related to identifying performance obligations and accounting for licenses of intellectual property. The Company must
adopt ASU 2016-08 and ASU 2016-10 with ASU 2014-09.The new revenue standard may be applied retrospectively to each prior period
presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating
the timing of its adoption and the impact of adopting the new revenue standard on its combined financial statements.
 
In August 2014, FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,
“Preparation of Financial Statements – Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40), Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's
Ability to Continue as a Going Concern”. Under U.S. GAAP, continuation of a reporting entity as a going concern is presumed
as the basis for preparing financial statements unless and until the entity's liquidation becomes imminent. Preparation of financial
statements under this presumption is commonly referred to as the going concern basis of accounting. If and when an entity's liquidation
becomes imminent, financial statements should be prepared under the liquidation basis of accounting in accordance with Subtopic
205-30, Presentation of Financial Statements—Liquidation Basis of Accounting. Even when an entity's liquidation is not imminent,
there may be conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern. In those
situations, financial statements should continue to be prepared under the going concern basis of accounting, but the amendments
in this Update should be followed to determine whether to disclose information about the relevant conditions and events. The amendments
in this Accounting Standards Update are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods
and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. The Company will evaluate the going concern considerations in
this ASU, however, at the current period, management does not believe that it has met conditions which would subject these condensed
combined financial statements for additional disclosure.

PROCEEDINGS
 
On November 29, 2013, Yao-Teh filed a
complaint against an individual, Mr. Lang-Sheng Lin (the “Defendant”), at Taiwan Miaoli District Court in Taiwan,
for not transferring the title of land that was purchased by Yao-Teh pursuant to the trust registration agreement entered by Yao-Teh
and the defendant. The case went to court on January 16, 2014. On February 17, 2015, the court pronounced its judgment that the
evidence provided by Yao-Teh was not sustained. An appeal was filed at Taiwan High Court Taichung Branch Court on March 21, 2015
by Yao-Teh. The hearing for the appeal was held on June 23, 2015 at Taiwan High Court Taichung Branch Court. The case was settled
between Yao-Teh and the defendant on September 21, 2015. Pursuant to the settlement, Yao-Teh agreed to pay NT$15,000,000, approximately
equivalent to $458,000, to the defendant, and the defendant agreed to transfer the title of land back to Yao-Teh after he receives
the payment in full.

YAO-TEH INTERNATIONAL RECREATION CO.,
LTD. & TA-TEH-FU CO., LTD.
NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)
 
NOTE 1. ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS
 
Yao-Teh International Recreation Co., Ltd.,
(the “Yao-Teh”), was incorporated on May 30, 1988 under the laws of Taiwan (R.O.C.). Yao-Teh is in the business of
developing and operating golf course facilities. Mr. Fun-Ming Lo is the controlling beneficiary shareholder of Yao-Teh.
 
Ta-Teh-Fu Co., Ltd., (“Ta-Teh-Fu”),
was incorporated on June 27, 2001 under the laws of Taiwan (R.O.C.). Ta-Teh-Fu’s main business is to lease golf carts, machinery,
and equipment to Yao-Teh. Mr. Fun-Ming Lo is the controlling beneficiary shareholder of Ta-Teh-Fu.
 
The fiscal year of Yao-Teh and Ta-Teh-Fu
(collectively, the “Company”) ends on December 31st.
 
NOTE 2. GOING CONCERN
 
The Company had accumulated deficit of
$72,509,297 and $71,036,558 as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The net losses attributable to common stockholders
of $1,472,739 and $1,602,793 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The accompanying unaudited combined
financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. This basis of accounting contemplates
the recovery of the Company’s assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. This presentation
presumes funds will be available to finance ongoing research and development, operations and capital expenditures and permit the
realization of assets and the payment of liabilities in the normal course of operations for the foreseeable future.
 
There can be no assurances that there will
be adequate financing available to the Company and the unaudited combined financial statements do not include any adjustments to
reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities
that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
 
In order to continue as a going concern,
the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management’s plans to obtain such resources for
the Company include (1) obtaining capital from the sale of its equity securities (2) short-term and long-term borrowings from banks,
and (3) short-term borrowings from stockholders or other related party(ies) when needed. However, management cannot provide any
assurance that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans.
 
The ability of the Company to continue
as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and
eventually to secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations.
 

 F-25 
 
 
NOTE 3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES
 
Basis of Presentation —
The accompanying unaudited combined financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America for interim financial reporting and in accordance with instructions for Article 10 of
Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting
principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the unaudited combined financial statements contained
in this report reflect all adjustments that are normal and recurring in nature and considered necessary for a fair presentation
of the financial position and the results of operations for the interim periods presented. The year-end combined balance sheet
data were derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. The results of operations for the interim period are not necessarily indicative of the
results expected for the full year.
 
The accompanying unaudited financial statements
included the combined accounts of Yao-Teh and Ta-Teh-Fu. These companies are under common control and ownership. All significant
intercompany transactions and account balances have been eliminated.
 
The functional currency of Yao-Teh and
Ta-Teh-Fu is the New Taiwan dollars, however the accompanying unaudited combined financial statements have been translated and
presented in United States Dollars ($). In the accompanying unaudited combined financial statements and notes, “$”,
“US$” and “U.S. dollars” mean United States dollars, and “NT$” and “NT dollars”
mean New Taiwan dollars.
 
Segment Reporting —
The Company follows the provisions of ASC 280 (formerly referred to as SFAS No. 131, Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise
and Related Information), which establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments, which uses a “management”
approach for determining segments. The management approach designates the internal organization that is used by management for
making operating decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s reportable segments. ASC Topic 280, “Segment
Reporting,” also requires disclosures about products or services, geographic areas, and major customers. The Company’s
management reporting structure provided for only one segment for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 and accordingly, no
separate segment information is presented.
 
Accounting Estimates —
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
Cash and Cash Equivalents —
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash
equivalents.
 
Accounts Receivable and Other Receivable
— Accounts receivable and other receivables are stated at carrying value less estimates made for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment of trade and other receivables is established if the collection of a receivable becomes doubtful. Such
receivable becomes doubtful when there is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to collect all amounts due according
to the original terms of the receivables. Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter
into bankruptcy or financial reorganization, and default or delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the receivable
is impaired. The amount of the allowance is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated
future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. An impairment loss is recognized in the statement of income,
as are subsequent recoveries of previous impairments.
 
Property and Equipment —
Property and equipment is carried at cost net of accumulated depreciation. Repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Expenditures
that improve the functionality of the related asset or extend the useful life are capitalized. When property and equipment is retired
or otherwise disposed of, the related gain or loss is included in operating income. Leasehold improvements are depreciated on the
straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining lease term or estimated useful life of the asset. Depreciation is calculated
on the straight-line method, including property and equipment under capital leases, generally based on the following useful lives:
 

 F-26 
 
 


  
Estimated Life in Years 

Land improvements 
 50 

Buildings and building improvements 
 15 

Machinery and equipment 
 5 

Office equipment 
 5 

 
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets —
The Company has adopted Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 360-10, Property, Plant and Equipment (“ASC 360-10”).
ASC 360-10 requires that long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles held and used by the Company be reviewed for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The Company evaluates
its long lived assets for impairment annually or more often if events and circumstances warrant. Events relating to recoverability
may include significant unfavorable changes in business conditions, recurring losses, or a forecasted inability to achieve break-even
operating results over an extended period. The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets based upon forecasted
undiscounted cash flows. Should impairment in value be indicated, the carrying value of intangible assets will be adjusted, based
on estimates of future discounted cash flows resulting from the use and ultimate disposition of the asset. ASC 360-10 also requires
assets to be disposed of be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell. Management has determined
that no impairments of long-lived assets currently exist.
 
Land Held for Sale and Investment — The
Company recorded the land held for sale and investment at the original land acquisition costs.
 
Fair Value Measurements —
FASB ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements” (formerly SFAS No. 157) defines fair value for certain financial and nonfinancial
assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures
about fair value measurements. It requires that an entity measure its financial instruments to base fair value on exit price, maximize
the use of observable units and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to determine the exit price. It establishes a hierarchy
which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. This hierarchy increases the consistency and comparability
of fair value measurements and related disclosures by maximizing the use of observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable
inputs by requiring that observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market
participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company.
Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company’s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would
use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. The hierarchy prioritizes
the inputs into three broad levels based on the reliability of the inputs as follows:
 

·Level 1 – Inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability
to access at the measurement date. Valuation of these instruments does not require a high degree of judgment as the valuations
are based on quoted prices in active markets that are readily and regularly available.
 

·Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable as of the
measurement date, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other
inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
 

 F-27 
 
 

·Level 3 – Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and not corroborated by market data. The fair value for such
assets and liabilities is generally determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques
that incorporate the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability.
 
This guidance applies to other accounting
pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. On February 12, 2008, the FASB finalized FASB Staff Position (FSP)
No. 157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157 (ASC 820). This Staff Position delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157 (ASC
820) for nonfinancial assets and liabilities to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 and interim periods within those
fiscal years, except for those items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring
basis (at least annually). The adoption of SFAS No. 157 (ASC 820) had no effect on the Company's financial position or results
of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.
 
We also analyze all financial instruments
with features of both liabilities and equity under ASC 480-10 (formerly SFAS 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments
with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity”) and ASC 815-40 (formerly EITF 00-19, “Accounting for Derivative
Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own Stock”). We have determined ASC 480-10
(formerly SFAS 150) and ASC 815-40 (formerly EITF   00-19) had no material effect on our financial position or results
of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.
 
Revenue Recognition —
The following describes the composition of revenues for the Company:
 

·Greens fee is charged to play on the golf course from members and non-members. The revenues are recognized when the services
are rendered.
 

·Revenue from non-refundable membership initiation fees is recognized over the estimated life of the facilities on a straight-line
basis upon inception of the club. As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the weighted average remaining period over which non-refundable
membership initiation fees will be recognized is approximately 29.5 years and 30 years, respectively (See NOTE 11).
 
Advertising Costs —
Advertising costs are expensed at the time such advertising commences. Advertising expenses were $486 and $445 for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Advertising expenses were $0 and $360 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively.
 
Income Taxes — Income
taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future
tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities
and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the
period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recognized if it is more likely than not that some portion, or
all, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. There were no significant deferred tax items as of June 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015.
 

 F-28 
 
 
The Company applied the provisions of ASC
740-10-50, “Accounting For Uncertainty In Income Taxes”, which provides clarification related to the process associated
with accounting for uncertain tax positions recognized in our financial statements. Audit periods remain open for review until
the statute of limitations has passed. The completion of review or the expiration of the statute of limitations for a given audit
period could result in an adjustment to the Company’s liability for income taxes. Any such adjustment could be material to
the Company’s results of operations for any given quarterly or annual period based, in part, upon the results of operations
for the given period. At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, management considered that the Company had no uncertain tax positions,
and will continue to evaluate for uncertain positions in the future.
 
Concentration of Credit Risk —
The Company’s financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash
equivalents and restricted cash. The Company places its cash and temporary cash investments in high quality credit institutions,
but these investments may be in excess of Taiwan Central Deposit Insurance Corporation’s insurance limits. The Company does
not enter into financial instruments for hedging, trading or speculative purposes. Concentration of credit risk with respect to
trade and notes receivables is limited due to the wide variety of customers and markets in which the Company transacts business,
as well as their dispersion across many geographical areas. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and
generally does not require collateral, but does require advance deposits on certain transactions.
 
Use of Estimates —
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
Foreign-currency Transactions —
Foreign-currency transactions are recorded in New Taiwan dollars (“NT$”) at the rates of exchange in effect when the
transactions occur. Gains or losses resulting from the application of different foreign exchange rates when cash in foreign currency
is converted into New Taiwan dollars, or when foreign-currency receivables or payables are settled, are credited or charged to
income in the year of conversion or settlement. On the balance sheet dates, the balances of foreign-currency assets and liabilities
are restated at the prevailing exchange rates and the resulting differences are charged to current income except for those foreign
currencies denominated investments in shares of stock where such differences are accounted for as translation adjustments under
stockholders’ deficit.
 
Statement of Cash Flows —
Cash flows from the Company's operations are based upon the local currencies. As a result, amounts related to assets and liabilities
reported on the statement of cash flows will not necessarily agree with changes in the corresponding balances on the balance sheet.
 
Reclassifications —
Certain classifications have been made to the prior year financial statements to conform to the current year presentation. The
reclassification had no impact on previously reported net loss or accumulated deficit.
 
Translation Adjustment —
The accounts of the Company was maintained, and its financial statements were expressed, in New Taiwan Dollar (“NT$”).
Such financial statements were translated into U.S. Dollars (“$” or “USD”) in accordance ASC 830, "Foreign
Currency Matters", with the NT$ as the functional currency. According to the Statement, all assets and liabilities are translated
at the current exchange rate, stockholder's deficit are translated at the historical rates and income statement items are translated
at an average exchange rate for the period. The resulting translation adjustments are reported under other comprehensive income
as a component of stockholders’ deficit.
 

 F-29 
 
 
Comprehensive Income —
Comprehensive income includes accumulated foreign currency translation gains and losses. The Company has reported the components
of comprehensive income on its statements of stockholders’ deficit and comprehensive income (loss).
 
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
— In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "Leases," which requires recognition of lease assets and
lease liabilities on the balance sheet of lessees. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years and interim reporting periods within
those years beginning after December 15, 2018, or in fiscal 2020. Early adoption is permitted. ASU 2016-02 requires a modified
retrospective transition approach and provides certain optional transition relief. We are currently evaluating the effect the adoption
of this guidance will have on our combined results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
 
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (“ASU 2014-09”), which amends the existing accounting standards for
revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 is based on principles that govern the recognition of revenue at an amount an entity expects to
be entitled when products are transferred to customers. The original effective date for ASU 2014-09 would have required the Company
to adopt beginning in its first quarter of 2018. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(Topic 606) – Deferral of the Effective Date, which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for one year and permits early
adoption as early as the original effective date of ASU 2014-09. Accordingly, the Company may adopt the standard in either its
first quarter of 2018 or 2019.In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)
– Principal versus Agent Considerations (“ASU 2016-08”), which clarifies the implementation guidance for principal
versus agent considerations in ASU 2014-09. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(Topic 606) – Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing (“ASU 2016-10”), which amends the guidance in
ASU 2014-09 related to identifying performance obligations and accounting for licenses of intellectual property. The Company must
adopt ASU 2016-08 and ASU 2016-10 with ASU 2014-09.The new revenue standard may be applied retrospectively to each prior period
presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating
the timing of its adoption and the impact of adopting the new revenue standard on its unaudited combined financial statements.
 
In August 2014, FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,
“Preparation of Financial Statements – Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40), Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's
Ability to Continue as a Going Concern”. Under U.S. GAAP, continuation of a reporting entity as a going concern is presumed
as the basis for preparing financial statements unless and until the entity's liquidation becomes imminent. Preparation of financial
statements under this presumption is commonly referred to as the going concern basis of accounting. If and when an entity's liquidation
becomes imminent, financial statements should be prepared under the liquidation basis of accounting in accordance with Subtopic
205-30, Presentation of Financial Statements—Liquidation Basis of Accounting. Even when an entity's liquidation is not imminent,
there may be conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern. In those
situations, financial statements should continue to be prepared under the going concern basis of accounting, but the amendments
in this Update should be followed to determine whether to disclose information about the relevant conditions and events. The amendments
in this Accounting Standards Update are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods
and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. The Company will evaluate the going concern considerations in this
ASU, however, at the current period, management does not believe that it has met conditions which would subject these unaudited
combined financial statements for additional disclosure.

Undertakings
 

(a)The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes:
 
(1)  To file, during
any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement:
 
(i) To include any prospectus
required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933;
 
(ii) To reflect in the
prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of this registration statement (or the most recent post-effective
amendment hereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in this
registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar
value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated
maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to
Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than a 20% change in the maximum aggregate
offering price set forth in the “Calculation of Registration Fee” table in the effective registration statement; and
 
(iii) To include any material
information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in this registration statement or any material change
to such information in this registration statement;
 
(2)  That, for the
purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be
a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall
be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.
 
 (3)  To remove
from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination
of the offering. 
   
 (4)  That, for
the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser: 
   
 (i)       If
the Registrant is relying on Rule 430B (§230.430B of this chapter): 
   
 (A)     Each
prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3) shall be deemed to be part of the registration statement as of the
date the filed prospectus was deemed part of and included in the registration statement; and 
   
 (B)     Each
prospectus required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2), (b)(5), or (b)(7) as part of a registration statement in reliance
on Rule 430B relating to an offering made pursuant to Rule 415(a)(1)(i), (vii), or (x) for the purpose of providing the information
required by section 10(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement
as of the earlier of the date such form of prospectus is first used after effectiveness or the date of the first contract of sale
of securities in the offering described in the prospectus. As provided in Rule 430B, for liability purposes of the issuer and
any person that is at that date an underwriter, such date shall be deemed to be a new effective date of the registration statement
relating to the securities in the registration statement to which that prospectus relates, and the offering of such securities
at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration
statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by
reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with
a time of contract of sale prior to such effective date, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement
or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such effective date;
or 
   
 (ii)      If
the Registrant is subject to Rule 430C, each prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of a registration statement relating
to an offering, other than registration statements relying on Rule 430B or other than prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A,
shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness.
Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement
or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part
of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify
any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in
any such document immediately prior to such date of first use. 
   
 (5)  That, for
the purpose of determining liability of the Registrant under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial distribution
of the securities, the undersigned Registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant
pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if
the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant
will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser: 
   
 (i)      Any
preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned Registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule
424; 
 (ii)      Any
free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned Registrant or used or referred to
by the undersigned Registrant; 
 (iii)      The
portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned Registrant
or its securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and 
 (iv)      Any
other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser. 
   
 (6)   To
file a post-effective amendment to the registration statement to include any financial statements required by item 8.A. of Form
20-F at the start of any delayed offering or throughout a continuous offering. Financial statements and information otherwise
required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Act need not be furnished, provided, that the Registrant includes in the prospectus, by means
of a post-effective amendment, financial statements required pursuant to this paragraph (a)(4) and other information necessary
to ensure that all other information in the prospectus is at least as current as the date of those financial statements. 
   
 (7)   For
purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed
as part of this registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a form of prospectus filed by the registrant
under Rule 424(b)(1) or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act shall be deemed to be part of this registration statement as of
the time it was declared effective. 
   
 (8)   For
the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each post-effective amendment that contains a form
of prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering
of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. 
 
(b)   Insofar as indemnification
for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the
Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, the Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange
Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event
that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid
by a director, officer or controlling person of the Registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is
asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the Registrant will,
unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction
the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in such Act and will be governed by the final
adjudication of such issue.
