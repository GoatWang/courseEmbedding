What are analysts saying about Allergan PLC. stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Allergan PLC. stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Allergan is reshaping its portfolio through strategic acquisitions. Following the closure of the Teva deal, Allergan can now focus on the branded segment and is using the proceeds to buy back shares, pay down debt and pursue additional deals. Key products like Botox and Linzess and new products are supporting sales growth. Allergan’s share price has outperformed the broader industry, so far this year. It also boasts a strong pipeline. Biosimilars also represent significant opportunity. While we remain optimistic about the company’s growth prospects, it is facing generic threat for Namenda IR as well as patent challenges for some of the other products in its branded portfolio, which concerns us. Also new competition for key growth drivers, Restasis and Linzess, is an investor concern. Estimates have gone up ahead of the Q1 earnings release. The company has a mixed record of earnings surprises in recent quarters." (7/11/2017)
2. Leerink Swann analysts commented, "AGN modestly beat our 4Q topline forecast (+1.3%) while Non-GAAP EPS beat our forecast by +3.8%. Given the 4Q strength of AGN's aesthetic franchises we're modestly raising our sales and EPS estimates." (2/9/2017)

What are analysts saying about Allergan PLC. stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Allergan PLC. stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Allergan is reshaping its portfolio through strategic acquisitions. Following the closure of the Teva deal, Allergan can now focus on the branded segment and is using the proceeds to buy back shares, pay down debt and pursue additional deals. Key products like Botox and Linzess and new products are supporting sales growth. Allergan’s share price has outperformed the broader industry, so far this year. It also boasts a strong pipeline. Biosimilars also represent significant opportunity. While we remain optimistic about the company’s growth prospects, it is facing generic threat for Namenda IR as well as patent challenges for some of the other products in its branded portfolio, which concerns us. Also new competition for key growth drivers, Restasis and Linzess, is an investor concern. Estimates have gone up ahead of the Q1 earnings release. The company has a mixed record of earnings surprises in recent quarters." (7/11/2017)
2. Leerink Swann analysts commented, "AGN modestly beat our 4Q topline forecast (+1.3%) while Non-GAAP EPS beat our forecast by +3.8%. Given the 4Q strength of AGN's aesthetic franchises we're modestly raising our sales and EPS estimates." (2/9/2017)
