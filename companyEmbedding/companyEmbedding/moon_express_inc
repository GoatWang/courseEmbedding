                    Redefining                    
                    Possible                












                            Our                        
                        Mission                    

                        Our mission is to redefine possible by returning to the Moon and unlocking its mysteries and resources for the benefit of humanity.                    






                    Why the                
                Moon?            

                The Moon is Earth’s 8th continent; a new frontier for humanity with precious resources that can bring enormous benefits to life on Earth and our future in space. Expanding Earth’s economic and social sphere to the Moon is our first step in securing our future. Not long from now, a new generation will look up and see lights on the Moon, and know that they are part of a multi-world species.            






                                8th Continent                            

                                The Moon is a new world with a total landmass approximating North and South America combined. The Moon has only been reached by government superpowers, but new advances in technology are bringing the Moon within reach of everyone. Soon we can all set sail as explorers to Earth’s 8th continent, seeking new knowledge, opportunity and adventure.                            






                                Resources for humanity                            

                                Like the Earth, the Moon has been enriched with vast resources through billions of years of asteroid bombardment. Unlike the Earth, these resources are largely on or near the lunar surface, relatively accessible. We are blazing a trail to the Moon to seek and harvest these resources to support a new space renaissance, where economic trade between countries will eventually become trade between worlds.                             







                            Water                        

                            One of the greatest practical space discoveries of our generation is the presence of vast quantities of water on the Moon, verified by NASA in 2009. Water (H2O) not only supports life, but its constituents hydrogen and oxygen can be used as rocket fuel. The discovery of water on the Moon is a game changer, not just for the economic viability of lunar resources, but for the economics of reaching Mars and other deep space destinations. Water is the oil of the solar system, and the Moon will become a gas station in the sky.

                            Expeditions                        

                            Our maiden robotic expeditions to the Moon will redefine the possible by bringing the Moon within reach of everyone. Our robotic spacecraft systems will collapse the cost of access to the Moon, introduce a new commercial paradigm for government missions, democratize lunar research and exploration, and blaze the trail for commercial space transportation and exploration beyond Earth’s orbit.

                                We are blazing a trail to become the first private enterprise to reach the Moon and reopen the lunar frontier. Only three government superpowers have ever landed on the Moon. Our first maiden lunar expedition to the equatorial region of the Moon will utilize our MX-1E robotic explorers to deliver a diverse manifest of commercial, government and private payloads to the lunar surface at a fraction of the cost of large government programs.

                                Our second lunar expedition will utilize our MX-2 exploration system to establish a research outpost on a ‘peak of eternal light’ at the Moon’s South Pole, where direct solar energy and communications with Earth are possible. Our primary objective is to establish a permanent lunar presence while seeking data on local water and other resources that will enable future lunar development.

                                Only governments own Moon rocks, and we want to change that. The only Moon rocks that exist on Earth today were obtained over 40 years ago by the U.S. (during Apollo) and the Soviet Union (robotically). Our third expedition will bring back samples of lunar dust and rocks that everyone can own, providing scientists with a new source of lunar materials for research, and making these treasures from the Moon available to collectors and commercial purposes.

                        Opening the Frontier                    
                    For all of us                

                    Moon Express is working closely with the U.S. government to assure our freedom of enterprise in space with deference to international treaties. 

The “Space Resource and Utilization Act of 2015” was the first step in the process, recognizing U.S. private sector rights to seek, obtain and utilize space resources.

On July 20, 2016, Moon Express became the first company to receive U.S. government approval to send a robotic spacecraft beyond traditional Earth orbit and to the Moon. This was the first time in history that any government signatory to the Outer Space Treaty exercised its rights and obligations to formally authorize and supervise a commercial entity to fly a mission beyond Earth orbit. This historic ruling is a breakthrough U.S. policy decision supporting our commercial lunar exploration and discovery and heralding a new era of expanding space enterprise. 

Our maiden Mission Approval establishes an important precedent for the private sector to engage in peaceful space exploration, bringing with it monumental implications for the advancement of technology, science, research, and development, as well as commercial ventures that expand Earth’s economic sphere.

History[edit]
In August 2010,[3] Robert D. Richards,[4] Naveen Jain,[5] and Barney Pell co-founded Moon Express, a Mountain View, California-based company that plans to offer commercial lunar robotic transportation and data services with a long-term goal of mining the Moon for resources,[6] including elements that are rare on Earth, including niobium, yttrium and dysprosium.[1][7] Moon Express based itself at the NASA Ames Research Center from 2010 to 2015, and the company announced its relocation to Florida's Cape Canaveral in 2015.[8]
On June 30, 2011, the company held its first successful test flight of a prototype lunar lander system called the Lander Test Vehicle (LTV) that was developed in partnership with NASA.[4]
On September 11, 2011, Moon Express announced that it had set up a robotics lab for a lunar probe named the "Moon Express Robotics Lab for INnovation" (MERLIN) and hired several engineering students who had successfully competed at the FIRST Robotics Competition.
In mid-2012, Moon Express announced that it will work with International Lunar Observatory Association (ILOA) to put a shoebox-sized astronomical telescope on the Moon.[9] Additional details were released in July 2013, including that there would be two telescopes: a 2 meters (6 ft 7 in) radio telescope as well as an optical telescope. The preferred location is 5 kilometers (3.1 mi)-high Malapert crater, with plans to land the mission no earlier than 2018.[10]
By 2012, MoonEx had 20 employees. In December 2012, MoonEx acquired one of the other Google Lunar X-Prize teams, Rocket City Space Pioneers, from Dynetics for an undisclosed sum. The new agreement makes Tim Pickens, the former lead of the RCSP team, the Chief Propulsion Engineer for MoonEx.[11]
In September 2013, MoonEx added Paul Spudis as Chief Scientist and Jack Burns as Science Advisory Board Chair.[12]
In October and November, 2013, Moon Express successfully conducted several free flight tests of its flight software utilizing the NASA Mighty Eagle lander test vehicle, under a Reimbursable Space Act Agreement with the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center.[13]
In December 2013, MoonEx unveiled the MX-1 lunar lander, a toroidal robotic lander that uses high-test hydrogen peroxide as its rocket propellant to support vertical landing on the lunar surface.[14]
On April 30, 2014 NASA announced that Moon Express Inc. was one of the three companies selected for the Lunar CATALYST initiative.[15]
The Moon Express "MX-1" spacecraft is designed to be launched as a secondary payload and to fly to the Moon from GEO.[16]
In December 2014, Moon Express successfully conducted flight tests of its "MTV-1X" lander test vehicle at the Kennedy Space Center Shuttle Landing Facility, becoming the first private company (and GLXP team) to demonstrate a commercial lunar lander.[17]
In October 2015, Moon Express announced a launch contract with Rocket Lab to launch three Moon Express robotic spacecraft to land on the Moon, with two launches manifested in 2017, utilizing an Electron launch vehicle.[18]
In July 2016, Moon Express announced it would be taking over Cape Canaveral Launch Complexes 17 and 18 as its new permanent home.[19]
On July 20, 2016, the Federal Aviation Administration approved Moon Express plans for a mission to deliver commercial payloads to the Moon in late 2017, making Moon Express the first private company to receive government approval for a commercial space mission beyond traditional Earth orbit under the requirements of the Outer Space Treaty.[20][21]
Legal regime for lunar resource extraction[edit]
Although the requisite legal regime to enable mining of lunar resources is not fully in place,[22] major world space agencies, including NASA, have put in place a coordination framework for encouraging the type of commercial activity proposed by Moon Express.

"Entrepreneurs are thinking about further commercial expansion into space. As space exploration extends to the Moon and Mars, there will be potential opportunities for companies to provide ... space-based resource extraction and processing capabilities. For example, Moon rocks are rich in oxygen that might be exploited to provide life support systems for lunar operations. Liquid oxygen can also be used as a rocket propellant – and it might be more economical to manufacture it in space than to lift it off the Earth. Mining the Moon might also yield titanium – a strong but light metal favoured for high-end aerospace applications. Finally, the Moon’s known abundance of Helium-3 could prove valuable if fusion reactors ever become feasible in the future.[23]


"For business to be confident about investing, it needs the certainty of a long-term commitment to space exploration, the opportunity to introduce its ideas into government thinking, and the rule of law. This means common understanding on such difficult issues as property rights and technology transfer. The Coordination Mechanism foreseen as part of the Global Exploration Strategy will provide a forum to discuss these important issues."[23]

The views of Moon Express on the legal and political realities of lunar resource utilization were articulated in an April 2011 Los Angeles Times article where Naveen Jain was interviewed:

The idea of exploiting the Moon's resources for private gain is not likely to be a concern, Jain said. The United States, he said, 'has already brought back Moon rocks to our country without any other country fighting war over it.' 'I also think that the Moon will be treated no differently than the international water in our oceans,' he added. 'In this case, no one really owns the water but any company or country can mine the resources … from the international water as long as they follow certain safety/moral guidelines.' Jain also noted that 'there is strong legal precedent and consensus of 'finders keepers' for resources that are liberated through private investment, and the same will be true on the Moon. You don't have to own land to have ownership of resources you unlock from it. Moon Express will use existing precedents of peaceful presence and exploration set by the U.S. government 40 years ago.'[1]

The Outer Space Treaty of 1967, ratified by 100 nations, including the United States, forbids countries from claiming sovereignty over any part of the Moon, but does not prevent private companies from building or staking claims on the Moon. Mining could fall under similar legal parameters as fishing in international waters.[24]
On May 23, 2017, the Senate Subcommittee on Space, Science, and Competitiveness held a hearing titled, "Reopening the American Frontier: Exploring How the Outer Space Treaty Will Impact American Commerce and Settlement in Space." This hearing examined U.S. government obligations under the Outer Space Treaty on its 50th anniversary, specifically compliance with Article VI of the Treaty that requires governments to authorize and continually supervise the activities of non-government entities. This hearing also explored the Treaty’s potential impacts on expansion of our nation’s commerce and settlement in space. Dr. Bob Richards testified in this hearing with other commercial space proponents. [25]
Mission plans[edit]
Initial contract[edit]
Moon Express has received a NASA contract[26] for data purchase that could be worth up to US$10,000,000.[1][27] Moon Express is also partnered with NASA through a Reimbursable Space Act Agreement that allowed Moon Express to invest over $500K into the commercialization of technology developed by NASA.[4]
Rocket[edit]
On 30 September 2015, Moon Express signed a rocket launch contract with Rocket Lab, a New Zealand startup company.[28][29] Under the launch services contract, Rocket Lab will use its Electron rocket system to launch three missions. Two launches are for 2017, with the third to be scheduled at a later date.[28]
Google Lunar XPRIZE[edit]





This section needs to be updated. Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (March 2017)


The company is also a competitor in the Google Lunar X Prize.[30] As of October 2015, there are 16 teams competing for the Google Lunar XPRIZE, two of which have launch contracts for 2017 (SpaceIL and Moon Express). This prize will award $20 million to the first team to put a robotic spacecraft on the Moon and deliver data, images and video from the landing site and 500 meters away.[5] As of February 2017, five teams are still in the competition.[31]
Other mission plans[edit]
In addition to participation in the Google Lunar XPRIZE, with a planned "maiden technology demonstrator flight" in 2015,[14] MoonEx is planning to place the International Lunar Observatory (ILO) on the Moon as early as 2018. The plan calls for placement of both a 2 meters (6 ft 7 in) radio telescope as well as an optical telescope at the South Pole of the Moon. The preferred location, as of July 2013[update] is 5 kilometers (3.1 mi)-high Malapert crater.[10]

History[edit]
In August 2010,[3] Robert D. Richards,[4] Naveen Jain,[5] and Barney Pell co-founded Moon Express, a Mountain View, California-based company that plans to offer commercial lunar robotic transportation and data services with a long-term goal of mining the Moon for resources,[6] including elements that are rare on Earth, including niobium, yttrium and dysprosium.[1][7] Moon Express based itself at the NASA Ames Research Center from 2010 to 2015, and the company announced its relocation to Florida's Cape Canaveral in 2015.[8]
On June 30, 2011, the company held its first successful test flight of a prototype lunar lander system called the Lander Test Vehicle (LTV) that was developed in partnership with NASA.[4]
On September 11, 2011, Moon Express announced that it had set up a robotics lab for a lunar probe named the "Moon Express Robotics Lab for INnovation" (MERLIN) and hired several engineering students who had successfully competed at the FIRST Robotics Competition.
In mid-2012, Moon Express announced that it will work with International Lunar Observatory Association (ILOA) to put a shoebox-sized astronomical telescope on the Moon.[9] Additional details were released in July 2013, including that there would be two telescopes: a 2 meters (6 ft 7 in) radio telescope as well as an optical telescope. The preferred location is 5 kilometers (3.1 mi)-high Malapert crater, with plans to land the mission no earlier than 2018.[10]
By 2012, MoonEx had 20 employees. In December 2012, MoonEx acquired one of the other Google Lunar X-Prize teams, Rocket City Space Pioneers, from Dynetics for an undisclosed sum. The new agreement makes Tim Pickens, the former lead of the RCSP team, the Chief Propulsion Engineer for MoonEx.[11]
In September 2013, MoonEx added Paul Spudis as Chief Scientist and Jack Burns as Science Advisory Board Chair.[12]
In October and November, 2013, Moon Express successfully conducted several free flight tests of its flight software utilizing the NASA Mighty Eagle lander test vehicle, under a Reimbursable Space Act Agreement with the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center.[13]
In December 2013, MoonEx unveiled the MX-1 lunar lander, a toroidal robotic lander that uses high-test hydrogen peroxide as its rocket propellant to support vertical landing on the lunar surface.[14]
On April 30, 2014 NASA announced that Moon Express Inc. was one of the three companies selected for the Lunar CATALYST initiative.[15]
The Moon Express "MX-1" spacecraft is designed to be launched as a secondary payload and to fly to the Moon from GEO.[16]
In December 2014, Moon Express successfully conducted flight tests of its "MTV-1X" lander test vehicle at the Kennedy Space Center Shuttle Landing Facility, becoming the first private company (and GLXP team) to demonstrate a commercial lunar lander.[17]
In October 2015, Moon Express announced a launch contract with Rocket Lab to launch three Moon Express robotic spacecraft to land on the Moon, with two launches manifested in 2017, utilizing an Electron launch vehicle.[18]
In July 2016, Moon Express announced it would be taking over Cape Canaveral Launch Complexes 17 and 18 as its new permanent home.[19]
On July 20, 2016, the Federal Aviation Administration approved Moon Express plans for a mission to deliver commercial payloads to the Moon in late 2017, making Moon Express the first private company to receive government approval for a commercial space mission beyond traditional Earth orbit under the requirements of the Outer Space Treaty.[20][21]
Legal regime for lunar resource extraction[edit]
Although the requisite legal regime to enable mining of lunar resources is not fully in place,[22] major world space agencies, including NASA, have put in place a coordination framework for encouraging the type of commercial activity proposed by Moon Express.

"Entrepreneurs are thinking about further commercial expansion into space. As space exploration extends to the Moon and Mars, there will be potential opportunities for companies to provide ... space-based resource extraction and processing capabilities. For example, Moon rocks are rich in oxygen that might be exploited to provide life support systems for lunar operations. Liquid oxygen can also be used as a rocket propellant – and it might be more economical to manufacture it in space than to lift it off the Earth. Mining the Moon might also yield titanium – a strong but light metal favoured for high-end aerospace applications. Finally, the Moon’s known abundance of Helium-3 could prove valuable if fusion reactors ever become feasible in the future.[23]


"For business to be confident about investing, it needs the certainty of a long-term commitment to space exploration, the opportunity to introduce its ideas into government thinking, and the rule of law. This means common understanding on such difficult issues as property rights and technology transfer. The Coordination Mechanism foreseen as part of the Global Exploration Strategy will provide a forum to discuss these important issues."[23]

The views of Moon Express on the legal and political realities of lunar resource utilization were articulated in an April 2011 Los Angeles Times article where Naveen Jain was interviewed:

The idea of exploiting the Moon's resources for private gain is not likely to be a concern, Jain said. The United States, he said, 'has already brought back Moon rocks to our country without any other country fighting war over it.' 'I also think that the Moon will be treated no differently than the international water in our oceans,' he added. 'In this case, no one really owns the water but any company or country can mine the resources … from the international water as long as they follow certain safety/moral guidelines.' Jain also noted that 'there is strong legal precedent and consensus of 'finders keepers' for resources that are liberated through private investment, and the same will be true on the Moon. You don't have to own land to have ownership of resources you unlock from it. Moon Express will use existing precedents of peaceful presence and exploration set by the U.S. government 40 years ago.'[1]

The Outer Space Treaty of 1967, ratified by 100 nations, including the United States, forbids countries from claiming sovereignty over any part of the Moon, but does not prevent private companies from building or staking claims on the Moon. Mining could fall under similar legal parameters as fishing in international waters.[24]
On May 23, 2017, the Senate Subcommittee on Space, Science, and Competitiveness held a hearing titled, "Reopening the American Frontier: Exploring How the Outer Space Treaty Will Impact American Commerce and Settlement in Space." This hearing examined U.S. government obligations under the Outer Space Treaty on its 50th anniversary, specifically compliance with Article VI of the Treaty that requires governments to authorize and continually supervise the activities of non-government entities. This hearing also explored the Treaty’s potential impacts on expansion of our nation’s commerce and settlement in space. Dr. Bob Richards testified in this hearing with other commercial space proponents. [25]
Mission plans[edit]
Initial contract[edit]
Moon Express has received a NASA contract[26] for data purchase that could be worth up to US$10,000,000.[1][27] Moon Express is also partnered with NASA through a Reimbursable Space Act Agreement that allowed Moon Express to invest over $500K into the commercialization of technology developed by NASA.[4]
Rocket[edit]
On 30 September 2015, Moon Express signed a rocket launch contract with Rocket Lab, a New Zealand startup company.[28][29] Under the launch services contract, Rocket Lab will use its Electron rocket system to launch three missions. Two launches are for 2017, with the third to be scheduled at a later date.[28]
Google Lunar XPRIZE[edit]





This section needs to be updated. Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (March 2017)


The company is also a competitor in the Google Lunar X Prize.[30] As of October 2015, there are 16 teams competing for the Google Lunar XPRIZE, two of which have launch contracts for 2017 (SpaceIL and Moon Express). This prize will award $20 million to the first team to put a robotic spacecraft on the Moon and deliver data, images and video from the landing site and 500 meters away.[5] As of February 2017, five teams are still in the competition.[31]
Other mission plans[edit]
In addition to participation in the Google Lunar XPRIZE, with a planned "maiden technology demonstrator flight" in 2015,[14] MoonEx is planning to place the International Lunar Observatory (ILO) on the Moon as early as 2018. The plan calls for placement of both a 2 meters (6 ft 7 in) radio telescope as well as an optical telescope at the South Pole of the Moon. The preferred location, as of July 2013[update] is 5 kilometers (3.1 mi)-high Malapert crater.[10]

History[edit]
In August 2010,[3] Robert D. Richards,[4] Naveen Jain,[5] and Barney Pell co-founded Moon Express, a Mountain View, California-based company that plans to offer commercial lunar robotic transportation and data services with a long-term goal of mining the Moon for resources,[6] including elements that are rare on Earth, including niobium, yttrium and dysprosium.[1][7] Moon Express based itself at the NASA Ames Research Center from 2010 to 2015, and the company announced its relocation to Florida's Cape Canaveral in 2015.[8]
On June 30, 2011, the company held its first successful test flight of a prototype lunar lander system called the Lander Test Vehicle (LTV) that was developed in partnership with NASA.[4]
On September 11, 2011, Moon Express announced that it had set up a robotics lab for a lunar probe named the "Moon Express Robotics Lab for INnovation" (MERLIN) and hired several engineering students who had successfully competed at the FIRST Robotics Competition.
In mid-2012, Moon Express announced that it will work with International Lunar Observatory Association (ILOA) to put a shoebox-sized astronomical telescope on the Moon.[9] Additional details were released in July 2013, including that there would be two telescopes: a 2 meters (6 ft 7 in) radio telescope as well as an optical telescope. The preferred location is 5 kilometers (3.1 mi)-high Malapert crater, with plans to land the mission no earlier than 2018.[10]
By 2012, MoonEx had 20 employees. In December 2012, MoonEx acquired one of the other Google Lunar X-Prize teams, Rocket City Space Pioneers, from Dynetics for an undisclosed sum. The new agreement makes Tim Pickens, the former lead of the RCSP team, the Chief Propulsion Engineer for MoonEx.[11]
In September 2013, MoonEx added Paul Spudis as Chief Scientist and Jack Burns as Science Advisory Board Chair.[12]
In October and November, 2013, Moon Express successfully conducted several free flight tests of its flight software utilizing the NASA Mighty Eagle lander test vehicle, under a Reimbursable Space Act Agreement with the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center.[13]
In December 2013, MoonEx unveiled the MX-1 lunar lander, a toroidal robotic lander that uses high-test hydrogen peroxide as its rocket propellant to support vertical landing on the lunar surface.[14]
On April 30, 2014 NASA announced that Moon Express Inc. was one of the three companies selected for the Lunar CATALYST initiative.[15]
The Moon Express "MX-1" spacecraft is designed to be launched as a secondary payload and to fly to the Moon from GEO.[16]
In December 2014, Moon Express successfully conducted flight tests of its "MTV-1X" lander test vehicle at the Kennedy Space Center Shuttle Landing Facility, becoming the first private company (and GLXP team) to demonstrate a commercial lunar lander.[17]
In October 2015, Moon Express announced a launch contract with Rocket Lab to launch three Moon Express robotic spacecraft to land on the Moon, with two launches manifested in 2017, utilizing an Electron launch vehicle.[18]
In July 2016, Moon Express announced it would be taking over Cape Canaveral Launch Complexes 17 and 18 as its new permanent home.[19]
On July 20, 2016, the Federal Aviation Administration approved Moon Express plans for a mission to deliver commercial payloads to the Moon in late 2017, making Moon Express the first private company to receive government approval for a commercial space mission beyond traditional Earth orbit under the requirements of the Outer Space Treaty.[20][21]
Legal regime for lunar resource extraction[edit]
Although the requisite legal regime to enable mining of lunar resources is not fully in place,[22] major world space agencies, including NASA, have put in place a coordination framework for encouraging the type of commercial activity proposed by Moon Express.

"Entrepreneurs are thinking about further commercial expansion into space. As space exploration extends to the Moon and Mars, there will be potential opportunities for companies to provide ... space-based resource extraction and processing capabilities. For example, Moon rocks are rich in oxygen that might be exploited to provide life support systems for lunar operations. Liquid oxygen can also be used as a rocket propellant – and it might be more economical to manufacture it in space than to lift it off the Earth. Mining the Moon might also yield titanium – a strong but light metal favoured for high-end aerospace applications. Finally, the Moon’s known abundance of Helium-3 could prove valuable if fusion reactors ever become feasible in the future.[23]


"For business to be confident about investing, it needs the certainty of a long-term commitment to space exploration, the opportunity to introduce its ideas into government thinking, and the rule of law. This means common understanding on such difficult issues as property rights and technology transfer. The Coordination Mechanism foreseen as part of the Global Exploration Strategy will provide a forum to discuss these important issues."[23]

The views of Moon Express on the legal and political realities of lunar resource utilization were articulated in an April 2011 Los Angeles Times article where Naveen Jain was interviewed:

The idea of exploiting the Moon's resources for private gain is not likely to be a concern, Jain said. The United States, he said, 'has already brought back Moon rocks to our country without any other country fighting war over it.' 'I also think that the Moon will be treated no differently than the international water in our oceans,' he added. 'In this case, no one really owns the water but any company or country can mine the resources … from the international water as long as they follow certain safety/moral guidelines.' Jain also noted that 'there is strong legal precedent and consensus of 'finders keepers' for resources that are liberated through private investment, and the same will be true on the Moon. You don't have to own land to have ownership of resources you unlock from it. Moon Express will use existing precedents of peaceful presence and exploration set by the U.S. government 40 years ago.'[1]

The Outer Space Treaty of 1967, ratified by 100 nations, including the United States, forbids countries from claiming sovereignty over any part of the Moon, but does not prevent private companies from building or staking claims on the Moon. Mining could fall under similar legal parameters as fishing in international waters.[24]
On May 23, 2017, the Senate Subcommittee on Space, Science, and Competitiveness held a hearing titled, "Reopening the American Frontier: Exploring How the Outer Space Treaty Will Impact American Commerce and Settlement in Space." This hearing examined U.S. government obligations under the Outer Space Treaty on its 50th anniversary, specifically compliance with Article VI of the Treaty that requires governments to authorize and continually supervise the activities of non-government entities. This hearing also explored the Treaty’s potential impacts on expansion of our nation’s commerce and settlement in space. Dr. Bob Richards testified in this hearing with other commercial space proponents. [25]
Mission plans[edit]
Initial contract[edit]
Moon Express has received a NASA contract[26] for data purchase that could be worth up to US$10,000,000.[1][27] Moon Express is also partnered with NASA through a Reimbursable Space Act Agreement that allowed Moon Express to invest over $500K into the commercialization of technology developed by NASA.[4]
Rocket[edit]
On 30 September 2015, Moon Express signed a rocket launch contract with Rocket Lab, a New Zealand startup company.[28][29] Under the launch services contract, Rocket Lab will use its Electron rocket system to launch three missions. Two launches are for 2017, with the third to be scheduled at a later date.[28]
Google Lunar XPRIZE[edit]





This section needs to be updated. Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (March 2017)


The company is also a competitor in the Google Lunar X Prize.[30] As of October 2015, there are 16 teams competing for the Google Lunar XPRIZE, two of which have launch contracts for 2017 (SpaceIL and Moon Express). This prize will award $20 million to the first team to put a robotic spacecraft on the Moon and deliver data, images and video from the landing site and 500 meters away.[5] As of February 2017, five teams are still in the competition.[31]
Other mission plans[edit]
In addition to participation in the Google Lunar XPRIZE, with a planned "maiden technology demonstrator flight" in 2015,[14] MoonEx is planning to place the International Lunar Observatory (ILO) on the Moon as early as 2018. The plan calls for placement of both a 2 meters (6 ft 7 in) radio telescope as well as an optical telescope at the South Pole of the Moon. The preferred location, as of July 2013[update] is 5 kilometers (3.1 mi)-high Malapert crater.[10]

History[edit]
In August 2010,[3] Robert D. Richards,[4] Naveen Jain,[5] and Barney Pell co-founded Moon Express, a Mountain View, California-based company that plans to offer commercial lunar robotic transportation and data services with a long-term goal of mining the Moon for resources,[6] including elements that are rare on Earth, including niobium, yttrium and dysprosium.[1][7] Moon Express based itself at the NASA Ames Research Center from 2010 to 2015, and the company announced its relocation to Florida's Cape Canaveral in 2015.[8]
On June 30, 2011, the company held its first successful test flight of a prototype lunar lander system called the Lander Test Vehicle (LTV) that was developed in partnership with NASA.[4]
On September 11, 2011, Moon Express announced that it had set up a robotics lab for a lunar probe named the "Moon Express Robotics Lab for INnovation" (MERLIN) and hired several engineering students who had successfully competed at the FIRST Robotics Competition.
In mid-2012, Moon Express announced that it will work with International Lunar Observatory Association (ILOA) to put a shoebox-sized astronomical telescope on the Moon.[9] Additional details were released in July 2013, including that there would be two telescopes: a 2 meters (6 ft 7 in) radio telescope as well as an optical telescope. The preferred location is 5 kilometers (3.1 mi)-high Malapert crater, with plans to land the mission no earlier than 2018.[10]
By 2012, MoonEx had 20 employees. In December 2012, MoonEx acquired one of the other Google Lunar X-Prize teams, Rocket City Space Pioneers, from Dynetics for an undisclosed sum. The new agreement makes Tim Pickens, the former lead of the RCSP team, the Chief Propulsion Engineer for MoonEx.[11]
In September 2013, MoonEx added Paul Spudis as Chief Scientist and Jack Burns as Science Advisory Board Chair.[12]
In October and November, 2013, Moon Express successfully conducted several free flight tests of its flight software utilizing the NASA Mighty Eagle lander test vehicle, under a Reimbursable Space Act Agreement with the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center.[13]
In December 2013, MoonEx unveiled the MX-1 lunar lander, a toroidal robotic lander that uses high-test hydrogen peroxide as its rocket propellant to support vertical landing on the lunar surface.[14]
On April 30, 2014 NASA announced that Moon Express Inc. was one of the three companies selected for the Lunar CATALYST initiative.[15]
The Moon Express "MX-1" spacecraft is designed to be launched as a secondary payload and to fly to the Moon from GEO.[16]
In December 2014, Moon Express successfully conducted flight tests of its "MTV-1X" lander test vehicle at the Kennedy Space Center Shuttle Landing Facility, becoming the first private company (and GLXP team) to demonstrate a commercial lunar lander.[17]
In October 2015, Moon Express announced a launch contract with Rocket Lab to launch three Moon Express robotic spacecraft to land on the Moon, with two launches manifested in 2017, utilizing an Electron launch vehicle.[18]
In July 2016, Moon Express announced it would be taking over Cape Canaveral Launch Complexes 17 and 18 as its new permanent home.[19]
On July 20, 2016, the Federal Aviation Administration approved Moon Express plans for a mission to deliver commercial payloads to the Moon in late 2017, making Moon Express the first private company to receive government approval for a commercial space mission beyond traditional Earth orbit under the requirements of the Outer Space Treaty.[20][21]
Legal regime for lunar resource extraction[edit]
Although the requisite legal regime to enable mining of lunar resources is not fully in place,[22] major world space agencies, including NASA, have put in place a coordination framework for encouraging the type of commercial activity proposed by Moon Express.

"Entrepreneurs are thinking about further commercial expansion into space. As space exploration extends to the Moon and Mars, there will be potential opportunities for companies to provide ... space-based resource extraction and processing capabilities. For example, Moon rocks are rich in oxygen that might be exploited to provide life support systems for lunar operations. Liquid oxygen can also be used as a rocket propellant – and it might be more economical to manufacture it in space than to lift it off the Earth. Mining the Moon might also yield titanium – a strong but light metal favoured for high-end aerospace applications. Finally, the Moon’s known abundance of Helium-3 could prove valuable if fusion reactors ever become feasible in the future.[23]


"For business to be confident about investing, it needs the certainty of a long-term commitment to space exploration, the opportunity to introduce its ideas into government thinking, and the rule of law. This means common understanding on such difficult issues as property rights and technology transfer. The Coordination Mechanism foreseen as part of the Global Exploration Strategy will provide a forum to discuss these important issues."[23]

The views of Moon Express on the legal and political realities of lunar resource utilization were articulated in an April 2011 Los Angeles Times article where Naveen Jain was interviewed:

The idea of exploiting the Moon's resources for private gain is not likely to be a concern, Jain said. The United States, he said, 'has already brought back Moon rocks to our country without any other country fighting war over it.' 'I also think that the Moon will be treated no differently than the international water in our oceans,' he added. 'In this case, no one really owns the water but any company or country can mine the resources … from the international water as long as they follow certain safety/moral guidelines.' Jain also noted that 'there is strong legal precedent and consensus of 'finders keepers' for resources that are liberated through private investment, and the same will be true on the Moon. You don't have to own land to have ownership of resources you unlock from it. Moon Express will use existing precedents of peaceful presence and exploration set by the U.S. government 40 years ago.'[1]

The Outer Space Treaty of 1967, ratified by 100 nations, including the United States, forbids countries from claiming sovereignty over any part of the Moon, but does not prevent private companies from building or staking claims on the Moon. Mining could fall under similar legal parameters as fishing in international waters.[24]
On May 23, 2017, the Senate Subcommittee on Space, Science, and Competitiveness held a hearing titled, "Reopening the American Frontier: Exploring How the Outer Space Treaty Will Impact American Commerce and Settlement in Space." This hearing examined U.S. government obligations under the Outer Space Treaty on its 50th anniversary, specifically compliance with Article VI of the Treaty that requires governments to authorize and continually supervise the activities of non-government entities. This hearing also explored the Treaty’s potential impacts on expansion of our nation’s commerce and settlement in space. Dr. Bob Richards testified in this hearing with other commercial space proponents. [25]
Mission plans[edit]
Initial contract[edit]
Moon Express has received a NASA contract[26] for data purchase that could be worth up to US$10,000,000.[1][27] Moon Express is also partnered with NASA through a Reimbursable Space Act Agreement that allowed Moon Express to invest over $500K into the commercialization of technology developed by NASA.[4]
Rocket[edit]
On 30 September 2015, Moon Express signed a rocket launch contract with Rocket Lab, a New Zealand startup company.[28][29] Under the launch services contract, Rocket Lab will use its Electron rocket system to launch three missions. Two launches are for 2017, with the third to be scheduled at a later date.[28]
Google Lunar XPRIZE[edit]





This section needs to be updated. Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (March 2017)


The company is also a competitor in the Google Lunar X Prize.[30] As of October 2015, there are 16 teams competing for the Google Lunar XPRIZE, two of which have launch contracts for 2017 (SpaceIL and Moon Express). This prize will award $20 million to the first team to put a robotic spacecraft on the Moon and deliver data, images and video from the landing site and 500 meters away.[5] As of February 2017, five teams are still in the competition.[31]
Other mission plans[edit]
In addition to participation in the Google Lunar XPRIZE, with a planned "maiden technology demonstrator flight" in 2015,[14] MoonEx is planning to place the International Lunar Observatory (ILO) on the Moon as early as 2018. The plan calls for placement of both a 2 meters (6 ft 7 in) radio telescope as well as an optical telescope at the South Pole of the Moon. The preferred location, as of July 2013[update] is 5 kilometers (3.1 mi)-high Malapert crater.[10]

History[edit]
In August 2010,[3] Robert D. Richards,[4] Naveen Jain,[5] and Barney Pell co-founded Moon Express, a Mountain View, California-based company that plans to offer commercial lunar robotic transportation and data services with a long-term goal of mining the Moon for resources,[6] including elements that are rare on Earth, including niobium, yttrium and dysprosium.[1][7] Moon Express based itself at the NASA Ames Research Center from 2010 to 2015, and the company announced its relocation to Florida's Cape Canaveral in 2015.[8]
On June 30, 2011, the company held its first successful test flight of a prototype lunar lander system called the Lander Test Vehicle (LTV) that was developed in partnership with NASA.[4]
On September 11, 2011, Moon Express announced that it had set up a robotics lab for a lunar probe named the "Moon Express Robotics Lab for INnovation" (MERLIN) and hired several engineering students who had successfully competed at the FIRST Robotics Competition.
In mid-2012, Moon Express announced that it will work with International Lunar Observatory Association (ILOA) to put a shoebox-sized astronomical telescope on the Moon.[9] Additional details were released in July 2013, including that there would be two telescopes: a 2 meters (6 ft 7 in) radio telescope as well as an optical telescope. The preferred location is 5 kilometers (3.1 mi)-high Malapert crater, with plans to land the mission no earlier than 2018.[10]
By 2012, MoonEx had 20 employees. In December 2012, MoonEx acquired one of the other Google Lunar X-Prize teams, Rocket City Space Pioneers, from Dynetics for an undisclosed sum. The new agreement makes Tim Pickens, the former lead of the RCSP team, the Chief Propulsion Engineer for MoonEx.[11]
In September 2013, MoonEx added Paul Spudis as Chief Scientist and Jack Burns as Science Advisory Board Chair.[12]
In October and November, 2013, Moon Express successfully conducted several free flight tests of its flight software utilizing the NASA Mighty Eagle lander test vehicle, under a Reimbursable Space Act Agreement with the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center.[13]
In December 2013, MoonEx unveiled the MX-1 lunar lander, a toroidal robotic lander that uses high-test hydrogen peroxide as its rocket propellant to support vertical landing on the lunar surface.[14]
On April 30, 2014 NASA announced that Moon Express Inc. was one of the three companies selected for the Lunar CATALYST initiative.[15]
The Moon Express "MX-1" spacecraft is designed to be launched as a secondary payload and to fly to the Moon from GEO.[16]
In December 2014, Moon Express successfully conducted flight tests of its "MTV-1X" lander test vehicle at the Kennedy Space Center Shuttle Landing Facility, becoming the first private company (and GLXP team) to demonstrate a commercial lunar lander.[17]
In October 2015, Moon Express announced a launch contract with Rocket Lab to launch three Moon Express robotic spacecraft to land on the Moon, with two launches manifested in 2017, utilizing an Electron launch vehicle.[18]
In July 2016, Moon Express announced it would be taking over Cape Canaveral Launch Complexes 17 and 18 as its new permanent home.[19]
On July 20, 2016, the Federal Aviation Administration approved Moon Express plans for a mission to deliver commercial payloads to the Moon in late 2017, making Moon Express the first private company to receive government approval for a commercial space mission beyond traditional Earth orbit under the requirements of the Outer Space Treaty.[20][21]
Legal regime for lunar resource extraction[edit]
Although the requisite legal regime to enable mining of lunar resources is not fully in place,[22] major world space agencies, including NASA, have put in place a coordination framework for encouraging the type of commercial activity proposed by Moon Express.

"Entrepreneurs are thinking about further commercial expansion into space. As space exploration extends to the Moon and Mars, there will be potential opportunities for companies to provide ... space-based resource extraction and processing capabilities. For example, Moon rocks are rich in oxygen that might be exploited to provide life support systems for lunar operations. Liquid oxygen can also be used as a rocket propellant – and it might be more economical to manufacture it in space than to lift it off the Earth. Mining the Moon might also yield titanium – a strong but light metal favoured for high-end aerospace applications. Finally, the Moon’s known abundance of Helium-3 could prove valuable if fusion reactors ever become feasible in the future.[23]


"For business to be confident about investing, it needs the certainty of a long-term commitment to space exploration, the opportunity to introduce its ideas into government thinking, and the rule of law. This means common understanding on such difficult issues as property rights and technology transfer. The Coordination Mechanism foreseen as part of the Global Exploration Strategy will provide a forum to discuss these important issues."[23]

The views of Moon Express on the legal and political realities of lunar resource utilization were articulated in an April 2011 Los Angeles Times article where Naveen Jain was interviewed:

The idea of exploiting the Moon's resources for private gain is not likely to be a concern, Jain said. The United States, he said, 'has already brought back Moon rocks to our country without any other country fighting war over it.' 'I also think that the Moon will be treated no differently than the international water in our oceans,' he added. 'In this case, no one really owns the water but any company or country can mine the resources … from the international water as long as they follow certain safety/moral guidelines.' Jain also noted that 'there is strong legal precedent and consensus of 'finders keepers' for resources that are liberated through private investment, and the same will be true on the Moon. You don't have to own land to have ownership of resources you unlock from it. Moon Express will use existing precedents of peaceful presence and exploration set by the U.S. government 40 years ago.'[1]

The Outer Space Treaty of 1967, ratified by 100 nations, including the United States, forbids countries from claiming sovereignty over any part of the Moon, but does not prevent private companies from building or staking claims on the Moon. Mining could fall under similar legal parameters as fishing in international waters.[24]
On May 23, 2017, the Senate Subcommittee on Space, Science, and Competitiveness held a hearing titled, "Reopening the American Frontier: Exploring How the Outer Space Treaty Will Impact American Commerce and Settlement in Space." This hearing examined U.S. government obligations under the Outer Space Treaty on its 50th anniversary, specifically compliance with Article VI of the Treaty that requires governments to authorize and continually supervise the activities of non-government entities. This hearing also explored the Treaty’s potential impacts on expansion of our nation’s commerce and settlement in space. Dr. Bob Richards testified in this hearing with other commercial space proponents. [25]
Mission plans[edit]
Initial contract[edit]
Moon Express has received a NASA contract[26] for data purchase that could be worth up to US$10,000,000.[1][27] Moon Express is also partnered with NASA through a Reimbursable Space Act Agreement that allowed Moon Express to invest over $500K into the commercialization of technology developed by NASA.[4]
Rocket[edit]
On 30 September 2015, Moon Express signed a rocket launch contract with Rocket Lab, a New Zealand startup company.[28][29] Under the launch services contract, Rocket Lab will use its Electron rocket system to launch three missions. Two launches are for 2017, with the third to be scheduled at a later date.[28]
Google Lunar XPRIZE[edit]





This section needs to be updated. Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (March 2017)


The company is also a competitor in the Google Lunar X Prize.[30] As of October 2015, there are 16 teams competing for the Google Lunar XPRIZE, two of which have launch contracts for 2017 (SpaceIL and Moon Express). This prize will award $20 million to the first team to put a robotic spacecraft on the Moon and deliver data, images and video from the landing site and 500 meters away.[5] As of February 2017, five teams are still in the competition.[31]
Other mission plans[edit]
In addition to participation in the Google Lunar XPRIZE, with a planned "maiden technology demonstrator flight" in 2015,[14] MoonEx is planning to place the International Lunar Observatory (ILO) on the Moon as early as 2018. The plan calls for placement of both a 2 meters (6 ft 7 in) radio telescope as well as an optical telescope at the South Pole of the Moon. The preferred location, as of July 2013[update] is 5 kilometers (3.1 mi)-high Malapert crater.[10]

Moon Express Inc. Key Developments

International Lunar Observatory Association and Moon Express Inc. Announces the Collaboration for the Delivery of the First International Lunar Observatory to the South Pole of the Moon in 2019
Jul 21 17
International Lunar Observatory Association (ILOA) and Moon Express have announced a collaboration for the delivery of the first International Lunar Observatory to the South Pole of the Moon in 2019 (ILO-1). Moon Express has been contracted by ILOA to develop advanced landing technologies supporting the mission. The ILO-1 will be landed on a 'peak of eternal light' at the lunar South Pole by a Moon Express robotic explorer system. The primary landing site under analysis is Malapert Mountain, a 5-km tall peak near the Aitken Basin region that is bathed in sunshine most of the time and has 24/7 direct line of sight to Earth as well as to Shackleton Crater for observation and communication. Moon Express will utilize the mission to explore the Moon's South Pole for mineral resources and water.


Moon Express, Inc. Signs Contract with Rocket Lab to Launch Three Moon Express Robotic Spacecraft to Land on the Moon Starting in 2017
Oct 1 15
Moon Express Inc. announced it signed a contract with Rocket Lab on Sept. 30 to launch three Moon Express robotic spacecraft to land on the Moon starting in 2017. Under the launch services contract, Rocket Lab will use its Electron rocket system to launch three missions of Moon Express' MX-1 lunar lander spacecraft. The MX family of flexible, scalable spacecraft/landers are capable of reaching the lunar surface from Earth orbit on direct or low-energy trajectories. The breakthrough robotic space vehicle offers multiple applications, including delivery of scientific and commercial payloads to the Moon at a fraction of the cost of conventional approaches. Two launches of MX-1 have been manifested with Rocket Lab for 2017, with the third to be scheduled at a later date. Moon Express has the option of launching from Rocket Lab's private launch range in New Zealand or from an American range.

                    Redefining                    
                    Possible                












                            Our                        
                        Mission                    

                        Our mission is to redefine possible by returning to the Moon and unlocking its mysteries and resources for the benefit of humanity.                    






                    Why the                
                Moon?            

                The Moon is Earth’s 8th continent; a new frontier for humanity with precious resources that can bring enormous benefits to life on Earth and our future in space. Expanding Earth’s economic and social sphere to the Moon is our first step in securing our future. Not long from now, a new generation will look up and see lights on the Moon, and know that they are part of a multi-world species.            






                                8th Continent                            

                                The Moon is a new world with a total landmass approximating North and South America combined. The Moon has only been reached by government superpowers, but new advances in technology are bringing the Moon within reach of everyone. Soon we can all set sail as explorers to Earth’s 8th continent, seeking new knowledge, opportunity and adventure.                            






                                Resources for humanity                            

                                Like the Earth, the Moon has been enriched with vast resources through billions of years of asteroid bombardment. Unlike the Earth, these resources are largely on or near the lunar surface, relatively accessible. We are blazing a trail to the Moon to seek and harvest these resources to support a new space renaissance, where economic trade between countries will eventually become trade between worlds.                             







                            Water                        

                            One of the greatest practical space discoveries of our generation is the presence of vast quantities of water on the Moon, verified by NASA in 2009. Water (H2O) not only supports life, but its constituents hydrogen and oxygen can be used as rocket fuel. The discovery of water on the Moon is a game changer, not just for the economic viability of lunar resources, but for the economics of reaching Mars and other deep space destinations. Water is the oil of the solar system, and the Moon will become a gas station in the sky.

                            Expeditions                        

                            Our maiden robotic expeditions to the Moon will redefine the possible by bringing the Moon within reach of everyone. Our robotic spacecraft systems will collapse the cost of access to the Moon, introduce a new commercial paradigm for government missions, democratize lunar research and exploration, and blaze the trail for commercial space transportation and exploration beyond Earth’s orbit.

                                Return
                            



                                We are blazing a trail to become the first private enterprise to reach the Moon and reopen the lunar frontier. Only three government superpowers have ever landed on the Moon. Our first maiden lunar expedition to the equatorial region of the Moon will utilize our MX-1E robotic explorers to deliver a diverse manifest of commercial, government and private payloads to the lunar surface at a fraction of the cost of large government programs.

                                Our second lunar expedition will utilize our MX-2 exploration system to establish a research outpost on a ‘peak of eternal light’ at the Moon’s South Pole, where direct solar energy and communications with Earth are possible. Our primary objective is to establish a permanent lunar presence while seeking data on local water and other resources that will enable future lunar development.

                                Only governments own Moon rocks, and we want to change that. The only Moon rocks that exist on Earth today were obtained over 40 years ago by the U.S. (during Apollo) and the Soviet Union (robotically). Our third expedition will bring back samples of lunar dust and rocks that everyone can own, providing scientists with a new source of lunar materials for research, and making these treasures from the Moon available to collectors and commercial purposes.

                        Opening the Frontier                    
                    For all of us                

                    Moon Express is working closely with the U.S. government to assure our freedom of enterprise in space with deference to international treaties. 

The “Space Resource and Utilization Act of 2015” was the first step in the process, recognizing U.S. private sector rights to seek, obtain and utilize space resources.

On July 20, 2016, Moon Express became the first company to receive U.S. government approval to send a robotic spacecraft beyond traditional Earth orbit and to the Moon. This was the first time in history that any government signatory to the Outer Space Treaty exercised its rights and obligations to formally authorize and supervise a commercial entity to fly a mission beyond Earth orbit. This historic ruling is a breakthrough U.S. policy decision supporting our commercial lunar exploration and discovery and heralding a new era of expanding space enterprise. 

Our maiden Mission Approval establishes an important precedent for the private sector to engage in peaceful space exploration, bringing with it monumental implications for the advancement of technology, science, research, and development, as well as commercial ventures that expand Earth’s economic sphere.
