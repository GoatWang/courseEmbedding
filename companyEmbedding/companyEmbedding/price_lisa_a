Lisa Price, Carol's Daughter Founder, On Success And Crossing The Racial Hair Care Divide






By Janell Ross






























Lisa Price knew that something big had happened to her company when she walked into a New York Macy's store in 2007.  
Price went in incognito, hoping to get the average consumer experience at the counter where shoppers buy her Carol's Daughter brand lotions and creams, hair oils, butters and scents, she said. Price was expecting a few floor displays. Then she saw the words "Carol's Daughter" attached to a wall. 
"I thought these people must really be serious," Price said. "Somebody has put actual holes in the wall."
It was an amazing moment for Price. In the early 1990s, she was part of a television production team by day, and by night she was a one-woman product-concocting hobbyist-turned-entrepreneur. Actually, in Price's case, it was more like nights and weekends. 
In 1993, Price's mother, Carol, convinced her to bring some of her handmade concoctions to a church flea market. Price spent about $100 to cover the fees, labels and a $25 lace tablecloth to make her display look a little more "homey," she said. 
The church flea market and several similar events garnered Price a small following. Then a cadre of customers started visiting Price's Brooklyn apartment for holiday shopping events and populated the pages of Price's customer contact list. Being the 1990s, Price was collecting postal addresses, not email accounts; and she kept her recipes in an ordinary notebook. In the early years, the company sold about $5,000 to $6,000 in products.
The brand soon expanded from lotions to hair oils, butters, conditioners and other products. Then Price added a catalogue, a retail store in Brooklyn and then online sales.
In 2002, the company was featured on the "Oprah Winfrey Show." The daytime TV host and beauty product rainmaker declared herself a fan of the brand's foot lotion. From there, sales skyrocketed. The line that Price had once managed in her spare time, from a spare bedroom, reached $2.2 million in sales. 
But then growth started to slow.  
"I knew no bank was going to say to someone who was operating a business in her house in Brooklyn, 'Oh, here's $3 million. Let's make some butter,'" said Price.
Price pulled together the money to purchase a commercial building and began gradually moving out the shipping, manufacturing and other functions from her kitchen and spare bedroom. But there was still the lingering question of getting the capital needed to really rev up marketing and sales.
Price had been approached before by companies that made her feel like she needed to dance, or to audition for the level of investment that would allow the company to develop new products and reach new consumers. 
In 2002, a friend suggested that she meet with Steve Stoute, a one-time music industry executive and now CEO of Translation, a marketing and ad company. Stoute listened. Then he told Price that it seemed the only thing standing in the way of becoming a full-fledged prestige beauty brand was the ability to write a check and move the project forward. 
"I really knew that I had done everything that I could on my own. I mean, I had gotten on 'Oprah' without (having) a PR agent," said Price. "But I really did have to give it a lot of thought."
After some additional conversations, Stoute brought together a celebrity investment team that includes Will Smith; his wife, Jada Pinket Smith; and Jay-Z. The group invested about $10 million in Carol's Daughter. In exchange, Price surrendered an ownership stake in the company that she declined to specify. 
"That was the decision that changed everything," Price said. "I honestly had not thought of Carol's Daughter as a beauty company."
In 2006, Sephora, a beauty products store, began selling Carol's Daughter products. Today, the company's products are among the top-selling items on The Home Shopping Network and in the Sephora sections of J.C. Penney and Dillard's department stores. Sales this year are expected to top $50 million.
The typical Carol's Daughter client is a 35-year-old or older African-American woman. The company would like its average customer's age to trend into the 20s. As the company grows, Price wants to continue to minimize the number of synthetic ingredients in its products. And she wants the company to become known for serving a variety of women's beauty needs. 
"The world is becoming a much more multiracial place, and perpetuating the idea that Carol's Daughter is a brand for black women with natural hair alone can be limiting," Price said. 
To help shift the company's image, the company has unveiled a new ad campaign featuring three celebrity spokesmodels, at least two of whom have relatively recent multiracial ancestry. The move has garnered some criticism. One blogger wrote that he was disappointed to see a black-owned company reinforcing a whiter or at least biracial standard of beauty.
"We want to expand," said Price. "And we do want to reach new customers, because there are a lot of people who do not always identify themselves or the products they buy by race. That's why we are trying to talk to our customers in terms of skin types and conditions, hair textures and types. But we want to do that without alienating our core customer. We extremely grateful for every one of them."

Carol's Daughter - Wikipedia





















 






Carol's Daughter

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Carol's Daughter is a line of beauty products, including products for hair, body, and face care, as well as fragrances. It was founded by Lisa Price. Price named the company after her mother, Carol Hutson.[citation needed] Its products are available at Target as well as Ulta Beauty and on the Home Shopping Network (HSN).[citation needed]
Development[edit]
Founder Lisa Price began working on the products for her line in the 1980s, when she was working on the set of The Cosby Show.[citation needed] In her free time she made organic beauty products in her kitchen, including pure oils such as sweet almond, jojoba, and soy.[citation needed] Her experimentation eventually led to a mail-order and online business in 1993, followed by the first store opening in Brooklyn in 1999.[1] During the fall of 2005, she opened a second store on 125th Street in Harlem.[2]
Former music executive Steve Stoute, as CEO of the company, led a group of investors in raising $10 million for the venture.[citation needed] Other investors include Jada Pinkett and Will Smith, Jay-Z, Mary J. Blige, Jimmy Iovine, Tommy Mottola, and Thalía.[citation needed] Past spokeswomen for the line include Mary J. Blige,[3] Solange Knowles, Cassie Ventura, Kim Fields, and Jada Pinkett Smith.[4]

 [REACTIONS] Beauty Business Boss Moves: L’Oreal Acquires Carol’s Daughter
Consumers respond to news with mixed emotions, from cheers to disappointment

      by Janell Hazelwood

L’Oreal USA announced today via a statement that they have finalized an agreement to acquire Carol’s Daughter. 
This news comes after the company recently announced filing bankruptcy.
Founded by natural haircare entrepreneur Lisa Price, Carol’s Daughter offers products available at specialty beauty stores, mass retailers, on HSN, through e-commerce and at branded locations in New York City. For the 12 months ending Sept. 30, the company had net sales of $27 million.
“Carol’s Daughter possesses an expertise in the multi-cultural consumer segment, a rapidly expanding market that represents an important growth opportunity in the beauty industry,” Frederic Roze, president and CEO of L’Oreal USA, said in a statement. “This acquisition will enable L’Oreal USA to build a new dedicated multi-cultural beauty division as part of our Consumer Products business, and strengthen the company’s position in this dynamic market.”
Carol’s Daughter will continue to operate out of their New York City headquarters under the brand’s current leadership team, the statement indicated. The brand joins L’Oreal’s roster of American brands which includes Maybelline NY, Kiehl’s, Essie, Urban Decay, Clarisonic and NYX.
WATCH more about her journey on Black Enterprise Business Report:
 
“I have worked hard for the past 21 years nurturing my brand and am thrilled that we will have a new home with L’Oreal USA,” said Lisa Price, founder and president of Carol’s Daughter. “L’Oreal has a proven track record of helping established companies achieve their full potential while staying true to the core of the brand and they have an understanding of the future of multi-cultural beauty. I could not be more proud to begin this next chapter of the Carol’s Daughter brand with them. I know that my mother (Carol) is smiling as well.”
Price started her business as a hobby in her New York City apartment, and began selling what would become a huge haircare brand at church flea markets. The products would become a major force in the widespread popularity of women of color embracing their natural hair, and the company soon expanded into four storefronts. Named after her mother, the brand would gain a loyal following among everyday women and celebrities alike, with record exec Steve Stoute having assembled a star-studded list of investors including Jay Z and Will and Jada Smith. Carol’s Daughter expanded further into retail stores including Macy’s and Target, making it the multimillion-dollar empire it is today.
Upon hearing the news some consumers and industry watchers expressed their congratulations, while others had mixed feelings or expressed utter disappointment. Check out a few reactions from social media on the news of the acquisition:
I do not care about Carol’s Daughter being sold to L’oreal. It’s business, besides they never sent me a #urappreciated note 󾇗☕️󾍃
— Jouelzy (@Jouelzy) October 20, 2014


Can’t believe people think Carol’s Daughter owner made a bad decision solely because it’s no longer “black owned”…
— Huey Ruckus (@MrAviator1906) October 21, 2014


L’OREAL DID NOT JUST BUY CAROL’S DAUGHTER.

It is a little disappointing, but if this was done as a necessity I totally understand. My biggest concern is whether or not Loreal will leave the current formula alone or will they change it. I don’t like Loreal products because they are too perfumey for my taste. I hope they don’t do this to Carols Daughters.






Trezanay M. Atkins



This is a win-win-lose situation.   I explain on my site, “brands. blogs. business.” —->  wp.me/p1W0r0-6e.  






GRAND MASTER SEN$Ei {{-_-}}™



Black people still have a suicidal self-hating mentality that it ain’t right if it ain’t owned by whites. No confidence in anything Black people build and own for themselves. {{-_-}}






Rodney Anthony Bell



THe article also fails to mention that Carol’s Daughter filed for bankruptcy. Before the bankruptcy filing, the company closed all but two of its seven stores and terminated 29 of its 42 employees. The company was about to go under. It was likely her only option.






Isaiah H.



Actually the bankruptcy is mentioned in the second paragraph.








Christine



I think Lisa Price lost a HUGE customer base when she phased out the majority of the bath and body line. This article fails to mention that the brand was started with the bath and body line and there were very few hair care products at all. To start out primarily with one line of products and totally swing the pendulum to the other side without consideration for the loyal customer base for the beginning was a poorly constructed move, in my opinion.

I understand feelings from both sides…business and community.  In my opinion a win- win-win is that Loreal acquires a product line for an ethnic market, Lisa Price comes out of a financial challenge, (I hope she was given stock) and lastly for the third win if she negotiated a social responsibility element that requires that Loreal permanently support the black community in some manner i.e. Scholarships, internships, or support to black owned distributors etc..

Carol's Daughter - Wikipedia





















 






Carol's Daughter

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Carol's Daughter is a line of beauty products, including products for hair, body, and face care, as well as fragrances. It was founded by Lisa Price. Price named the company after her mother, Carol Hutson.[citation needed] Its products are available at Target as well as Ulta Beauty and on the Home Shopping Network (HSN).[citation needed]
Development[edit]
Founder Lisa Price began working on the products for her line in the 1980s, when she was working on the set of The Cosby Show.[citation needed] In her free time she made organic beauty products in her kitchen, including pure oils such as sweet almond, jojoba, and soy.[citation needed] Her experimentation eventually led to a mail-order and online business in 1993, followed by the first store opening in Brooklyn in 1999.[1] During the fall of 2005, she opened a second store on 125th Street in Harlem.[2]
Former music executive Steve Stoute, as CEO of the company, led a group of investors in raising $10 million for the venture.[citation needed] Other investors include Jada Pinkett and Will Smith, Jay-Z, Mary J. Blige, Jimmy Iovine, Tommy Mottola, and Thalía.[citation needed] Past spokeswomen for the line include Mary J. Blige,[3] Solange Knowles, Cassie Ventura, Kim Fields, and Jada Pinkett Smith.[4]

Lisa's Story 
In 1993, encouraged by my mother, Carol, I began creating high-quality products made with love in my Brooklyn kitchen. As family and friends experienced how these products transformed their hair and skin, I knew that I was on to something good. I needed a name for my company, so I made a list of everything I was and everything I wanted to be, and I realized the most special thing that I am is Lisa, Carol’s Daughter. — Lisa Price, Carol’s Daughter Founder

				sale 2017 Lisa Steve Madden ﻿Art Talks: 'Beauty & The Beast' by Sabhan Adam & Hossam Dirar While art is universal across Cairo's galleries, scarcely does an exhibition direct to bear our breath away. 'Beauty and the Beast' – a double exhibition of 'The Beast' from Sabhan Adham, and 'Beauty' from Hossam Dirar – is a demonstration of jaw-dropping talent, perfectly intertwined at Zamalek's Art Talks. Born in Syria in 1973, Sabhan Adam is a self-taught musician and has exhibited his mill extensively worldwide. Unleashing his pain and embitter onto paper, Adam reflects the suffering and events adventure in his homeland, resulting in dramatic, awe-inspiring portraits. Largely using varying media on canvas, the majority of his paintings are large and partly life-size, brewing over the audience in a menacing manner. His figures are half-human and half-animal; while the clothing humanises his characters, the faces are scribbled and sketched, appearing with animalistic features. Some of the faces sport gelid sad eyes, but need any more colouring, while the garb is colourful, often incorporating popular sparkle and gold accents. In one of his paintings, a man-beast sits condescendingly, cross-legged and optimistic in a colourful suit, secure and formal shoes, his fingers crave and spindly, with grating miserable eyes. In another, a man-beast is dressed in what appears to be a galabeyya. Disturbingly, the front of this piece is distorted, with an extra eye and nose, and splatters of red tint dripping from the mouth. Had the exhibition been solely made up of these beautifully ugly depictions, the stack may hold felt a scarcely too intense and hard-hitting. It was for this actuation that his paintings were hung alongside Hossam Dirar's contrasting collection. Born in Cairo in 1978, Hossam Dirar is an award-winning graduate of Helwan University and has since furthermore exhibited around the globe. Depicting grace on the surface, Dirar's assignment follows society's, and his own, definitions of attractiveness. With the chase of capturing unique identities, his subjects are often passersby; women he sees whilst going about his everyday life. Fragmented, without too much weight on their features, Dirar attempts to emanate their prettiness and personalities from within, quickly, so that the memory of the moment doesn't fade. His immense canvases express the heads and bodies of beautiful women, blurred slow a collage of audacious emulsion strokes. His activity is pleasant, appealing and practicable on the eye, using a rainbow of bold, cheerful banner and thick, textured layers of chunky acrylic paint. Despite being visually twin in technique, each picture manages to give off a different vibe; 'I Think We Met Before in My Dreams' exudes a kindly of peaceful, dreamy innocence, whilst the trellis of creams, oranges and burnt autumnal pennant donate it a fading, appeasing feel. In contrast to this, 'Mirror Mirror on the Wall' boasts the most intense stare, along with a sullen expression. Alongside the main exhibition, several obscure sculptures from the celebrated sculptor, Sobhy Guirguis, are displayed in his memory.  Beauty And The Beast puts a uncooked new, realistic and aesthetic knot on the naive childhood fairytale. Both artists are undeniably proficient and their works mortise together flawlessy, manufacture it one of the most visually and theoretically stunning collections we've come across.  Cairo 360 is a multi-award winning online journal which serves as the main critical inventory to living in Cairo, Egypt. Developed by multimedia specialists Media Republic, the site is aimed at Cairene's and carries reviews and features of all the current venues Cairo has to adduce from restaurants and nightspots to art galleries and shopping. Cairo 360 furthermore provides a sweeping register to events, and cinema listings, as well as ideas for travelling on weekends and a absolute brochure to home merriment including DVD's, music, and books. Read original phenomenon Art Talks on Cairo360
