Roy M. Whitehead: Environmentalists can get in way of quality development

Roy M. Whitehead, guest columnist/developer




By Roy M. Whitehead

Posted: April 23, 2010

Regarding Michael Goforth’s recent column about Florida development dragons, there are two sides to every argument. Having been a developer and builder during my working career, I have seen and heard (and given) most arguments for and against development.  We agree that many developments in recent years have been ill-advised and ill-planned, approved by local governments more for tax revenues than for benefit to the community. We have seen this in Fort Pierce. We also agree there has been a too-great proliferation of paving and infrastructure extensions, but some of this problem can be laid at the feet of environmentalists. For a time, I represented a builder of garden apartment projects in the Midwest, for which I handled much of the rezoning and land plan approvals. For these projects to be feasible, densities had to be higher than single-family developments, which local environmentalists usually fought against. The company was providing a high-quality product, usually two-story brick structures of the “Williamsburg” design. The developments usually included a clubhouse, playgrounds and considerable open space. A golf course was sometimes included to provide open space and an amenity for the community. Reasonable and quality rentals of relatively high-density were, and still are, needed to provide decent housing for those who can’t afford, or don’t want to own, a single-family home. In the early 1970s, I was chief executive of a development company on Hilton Head Island, S.C. The best developments on the island in the early years took place without benefit of zoning laws or building codes. Design was market-driven, with developers competing based on good architecture, quality and environmental considerations. Many of these developments had relatively high density. Zoning laws and building codes were enacted due mostly to efforts of environmentalists and development reverted to the “clear-and-pave” mentality of municipal planners. Environmental planning became secondary.  In recent years, we saw the push for ultra-low densities in Martin County and other areas in Florida, driving development into agricultural areas. Recently, some advocates of low-density zoning awakened to the rapid encroachment of development into agricultural lands and the Everglades. They concluded that perhaps cities should be redeveloped with higher densities to avoid paving over the Everglades.  There still is the question about where we are going to put people as the population expands. We understand concerns about over-development in Florida, but is this not the same “not-in-my-backyard” mentality we see regarding power plants, solar energy panels and wind generators? This is reflective of the “burn-the-bridge” syndrome: “I have mine, let’s keep everyone else out.”  Locally, we have seen the fight against high-density developments, but the argument has been more about building height than density. Harbor Isle is a good example of what high density can be when there are height restrictions in place. The argument always has been about obstructing views, but Harbor Isle, while probably a pleasant place to live, is an impenetrable view-blocker. Taller buildings with more open space might be preferable. A two- or three-story building obstructs one’s view, anyway, and a solid phalanx of low buildings obstructs views far worse than a single, taller building with open space around it. With under-building parking, the paving footprint and infrastructure is substantially reduced, a plus for those concerned with the environment.  There is no magic answer and people will continue to come. Local governments would do better to find ways to allow well-designed and higher-density developments even if building height restrictions have to be modified. Unless we do this, we might as well fire up the bulldozers and pavers. The Everglades will continue to disappear as will the lifestyle and environment that we cherish. Whitehead is a retired builder/developer residing in Fort Pierce.

Acne & Pimples 
















Breakouts: Acne & Pimples










 









Who’s afraid of a breakout? Not you! Get to know your skin’s worst enemy and show those pimples who’s boss.
What causes acne and pimples?
Pimples can form when your skin makes too much oil. Pores get clogged with this excess build-up of oil and dead skin cells, which allows bacteria to breed, causing redness and swelling.
What’s the difference between a pimple and acne?
Some people get a pimple or two once in a while, while others get frequent breakouts with lots of pus-filled pimples. If the second sounds more like you, you may have acne – a chronic or long-term condition that affects many teens and adults. But don’t panic, there are many effective treatments that help keep acne under control.
What about bacne, also known as body or back acne?
If you have this, you’re not alone – it can affect many people! Like face acne, bacne can form when your pores get clogged by excess oil and dead skin cells, allowing bacteria to grow. Sometimes, wearing tight clothes and using heavy backpacks can irritate the skin and make bacne worse. You can treat it the same way you would treat acne on your face.
What foods cause acne? Do greasy food and chocolate make me break out?
No. But some refined carbs like white bread, pasta, chips and cornflakes might actually make breakouts worse if you already have them.
Will tanning clear up my acne?
Tanning salons don't actually affect your acne. However, they can potentially cause skin cancer and wrinkles.
Will squeezing pimples make them go away?
Not exactly. Aside from giving you scars, squeezing or popping pimples spreads bacteria, which can make your zits worse.
Then how do I get rid of acne or pimples?
Cleansers, creams and gels with salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide should do the trick. The CLEAN & CLEAR ADVANTAGE® line has a range of pimple-fighting products.
