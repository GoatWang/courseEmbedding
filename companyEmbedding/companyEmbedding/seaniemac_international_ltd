HUNTINGTON, N.Y., Feb. 3, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- In a strong start to 2015 SeanieMac International (OTC: BETS) announced that January 2015 was its most profitable month since its launch in 2013.
Turnover revenue in January was approximately $883,770 and a gross profit for the accounting period was $74,163 which represents our largest gross profit in any accounting month since we began operations.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to financial results reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we have provided the following non-GAAP financial measures: turnover amounts and gross profit. These non-GAAP financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, neither of these measures is intended to be a substitute for those reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures.
Turnover amounts is a non-GAAP financial measure that reflects the total amount of bets placed in an accounting period. We consider turnover amounts to be an important measure for management to evaluate the performance of our business our revenue is directly related to the amount wagered. When evaluating our performance, you should consider turnover amounts as a supplement to other financial performance measures, including net loss and our other U.S. GAAP results.
Gross profit is a non-GAAP financial measure that reflects gross profit from all wages We consider gross profit to be an important measure for management to evaluate the performance of our business because gross profit as a percentage of turnover is an important measure of our odds and bet management. When evaluating our performance, you should consider gross profit as a percentage of amounts staked as a supplement to other financial performance measures, including net loss and our other U.S. GAAP results.
About SeanieMac
SeanieMac International, Ltd. is an Irish gaming company. It owns and operates www.SeanieMac.com, an online sports and casino wagering web-based platform serving gamblers directly under the brand name SeanieMac.com.
While the site offers wagering for many categories outside of sports, SeanieMac intends to capture the Irish market by initially focusing on the Gaelic Athletics Association (GAA) or Gaelic Games as well as Irish horse racing and soccer. The Company's mission is to provide a market-leading, user-friendly website for online gambling, including sports betting and casino gaming (traditional casino, live casino, poker, bingo and interactive skilled games). The Company does not market to U.S. residents and, hereby specifically discourages them from attempting to access its wagering services.
The Irish gambling industry generated approximately $23.7 billion in revenue in 2014, with $2.3 billion of that amount generated online. The Irish online gambling sector is projected to reach $4 billion in 2016. 
As its national pastime, the Gaelic Games have long been popular in Ireland but they are gaining worldwide appeal, especially in areas with large communities of Irish heritage and their descendants, such as the U.S., Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom, where many communities have their own teams and clubs participating in the Gaelic Leagues locally and internationally.

HUNTINGTON, N.Y., Jan. 30, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- SeanieMac International, Ltd. (OTCQB: BETS) announced that it has entered into an exclusive marketing agreement with Overseas BC Marketing, Inc. ("OBCMI") pursuant to which OBCMI will market SeanieMac's online web-based waging services and products. The marketing agreement will provide a platform that allows for revenue sharing on new accounts generated by OBCMI. This platform will allow customers to use bitcoin for wagering by interfacing with SeanieMac's wagering platform.

The new platform build is on target for a September 16th launch. Garreth Core, COO at SeanieMac, said, "We are delighted to finally be able to put a firm date on the launch of our new platform. We have been working extremely hard with Optima to reach our target. Our new website will have plenty of new exciting features that will enhance the user experience of our customers as well as new offerings such as a live casino and virtual sports. We are all very excited about the launch and will be announcing new partnerships over the coming weeks."  https://finance.yahoo.com/news/seaniemac-announces-launch-date-platform-120000317.html  "The Company believes there will be a sharp increase in revenues immediately following the launch." http://ih.advfn.com/p.php?pid=nmona&article=71760497 			  			BETS  			   			YOU AIN'T SEEN NOTHIN' YET...            $BETS PRESS RELEASES  http://seaniemacinternational.com/press-release/      Seanimac Announces Record Revenues and Scores Big With Merger   SeanieMac Holdings UK merges ApolloBet UK and SeanieMac Ireland, While Generating $600,000 in Gross Revenue Last Week HUNTINGTON, NY / ACCESSWIRE / March 23, 2016 / SeanieMac Holdings UK (BETS) officially announced today that it had finalized the acquisition of the business assets of SeanieMac Ireland and ApolloBet UK and consolidated all of the clients (60,000 plus clients of ApolloBet UK and 50,000 SeanieMac Ireland) under one trading platform. Clients of SeanieMac Ireland have been notified of the consolidation which will take place in the next few days depending on regulatory and technical requirements. Once the clients are trading under a single platform, the Company will be providing financial updates on the consolidated trading and financial projections for 2016. The Cheltenham Horse Race last week provided a lot of excitement and a very lucrative week with record revenue of over $600,000 USD for the week as a prelude to a great year ahead. The turnover revenue generated by Apollo Bet UK alone, makes the pending combination even more impressive. Shane ODriscoll said, "The substantial redundant costs in running both companies are now eliminated by the consolidation. This strategically calculated decision is expected to accelerate our growth projections in the medium to long-term. Last year the global online gambling market was worth roughly $41.4 billion with the European online gambling market being the largest in the world. We are now positioned to be one of the bigger players. We will provide detailed and multiple updates in the next few weeks on our accomplishments and plans for the year." Internet gambling is expected to generate revenue exceeding 56 billion dollars in 2018, doubling that of 2009. The company is positioning itself to take full advantage of this growth industry through this merger, one of many planned endeavors this year.  http://finance.yahoo.com/news/seanimac-announces-record-revenues-scores-141600327.html   SeanieMac Holdings UK CEO Presents Updates & Our Forecast for 2016 HUNTINGTON, NY--(Marketwired - Apr 21, 2016) Dear Shareholders, Getting current in our financial filings was just the first step in our plans for 2016. In 2016 our goals are to: SeanieMac Holdings UK CEO    Shane O'Driscoll 1. Acquire 1-2 additional sports books (we completed our first acquisition in February 2016) subject to non-toxic funding.  2. Grow our annual run rate of revenues to a minimum of $50,000,000 organically and even higher through acquisition. 3. Launch on a new platform with sound economics and better autonomy.                                                                                                           4. Further develop our Bit Coin partnership which can reach millions more potential customers. 5. Achieve cash flow positive operations. 6. Clean up the balance sheet of the public Company. 7. Repurchase outstanding convertible notes. 8. Secure long term strategic financing for exponential growth. The thought process behind our acquisition strategy is each acquisition we can identify can save hundreds of thousands of dollars of redundant costs and bring immediate benefits to the bottom line for both companies. We have identified and are actively soliciting additional opportunities in 2016. Thanks in part to our acquisition, 2016 revenue are running 300-400 percent higher than 2015, and we expect that trend to accelerate once we launch our new platform. In the last 60 days we have done well over $3 million in revenue (turnover) compared to $5.7 million for all of 2015. Our target date for the new platform is September 2016. We are on schedule and may be ready even sooner. Updates will be provided as we get closer to launch. We cannot announce the name of the partner until we are further along in the development process but we are confident the news will be well received by our investors, as our partner is one of the dominant and highest quality players in the online gaming space in the world. As a result of these developments, we project achieving cash flow positive shortly soon after the launch of our new platform. In our most recent press release we invited shareholders to submit any questions or requests. Based on the substantial and detailed number of questions we have received submitted, and to honor as many as possible, we are consolidating our responses and will provide the Q&A in a separate release early next week. Thank You for your support, Shane O'Driscoll  https://finance.yahoo.com/news/seaniemac-holdings-uk-ceo-presents-130447391.html SeanieMac Signs Two Major Sponsorship Agreements       HUNTINGTON, NY--(Marketwired - Apr 6, 2016) - Apollobet UK/ SeanieMac (OTC PINK: BETS) is proud to announce to have secured a deal to be an official sponsor of The British Horse Racing Authority (BHA). BHA is recognized as providing the most compelling and attractive racing in the world and seen as the world leader in raceday regulation.    http://www.britishhorseracing.com/bha/authorised-betting-partners/abps-of-british-racing/ Being the First and Only of the largest bookmakers in the world to sponsor the BHA establishes ApollobetUK/ SeanieMac front and center to be recognized by the over 6 million racing fans expected to attend the year long events of what is the second largest spectator sport in Great Britain. The companies [ApollobetUK/ SeanieMac ] also expect to be noticed by millions of broadcast viewers throughout Europe who will see our branding. In turn, ApollobetUK/ SeanieMac will contribute a percentage of its profits to also support and promote British Horse Racing, one of the cornerstones of the British betting industry.  Gambling on horseraces generates over £3.7 billion for the British economy and ApollobetUK/ SeanieMac is in a great position to profit from the branding awareness.  In addition to even more exciting news to follow, we have just signed a deal with the prestigious Jockey Club, to sponsor nearly forty full race meetings over the next few months, reaching millions of viewers throughout Europe. Our branding will receive live terrestrial TV coverage along with full coverage on racing UK.

We think it will be a truly groundbreaking year for us."  http://finance.yahoo.com/news/seaniemac-signs-two-major-sponsorship-140841026.html    SeanieMac Confirms New Platform Launch  April 8, 2016 11:29 AM·   Following a closure of its online betting service with former partner Boylesports, Irish gambling operator SeanieMac has announced that it would go live with a new gaming platform this August. SeanieMac stopped the provision of betting options on its old platform on April 1. The independent gaming company explained that all customers that have any funds in their accounts will be returned their money to the card they had registered upon signing up in due time time and manner. SeanieMac has also confirmed that it is currently working on its new platform together with fellow online gambling brand ApolloBet. Once launched, it would offer gambling customers a number of gambling options, enhanced odds, free bets, rewards, and many more. The Irish gaming operator has pointed out that its new website would operate absolutely independently from former partner Boylesports. It was in March 2016 when SeanieMac completed its merger with ApolloBet, thus consolidating its more than 50,000 customers with its partner’s 60,000 customers under a single trading platform. Following the necessary regulatory checks and approvals, the said consolidation was completed in the last days of March.  The Irish gambling operator has said that the merger was a necessary step as it would allow both SeanieMac and ApolloBet to accelerate their projections for further growth in the medium to long term. Earlier this week, the two gambling operators announced that they have become the latest to join the roster of companies to be supporting the British Horseracing Authority’s Authorised Betting Partner program. Under the terms of their agreement with the racing authority, the two operators would receive preferential treatment when striking commercial deals with various UK-based racetrack operators.

Announces Exclusive Marketing Agreement with Overseas BC Marketing Inc. Permitting Bitcoin Wagering    HUNTINGTON, N.Y., Jan. 30, 2015 — SeanieMac International, Ltd. (BETS) announced that it has entered into an exclusive marketing agreement with Overseas BC Marketing, Inc. (“OBCMI”) pursuant to which OBCMI will market SeanieMac’s online web-based waging services and products. The marketing agreement will provide a platform that allows for revenue sharing on new accounts generated by OBCMI. This platform will allow customers to use bitcoin for wagering by interfacing with SeanieMac’s wagering platform.

SeanieMac believes it will be at the forefront of gaming platforms allowing crypto currency (bitcoin) to be used for wagering, and expects that its credibility in the wagering markets will give bitcoiners confidence in interfacing and using its platform for wagering purposes.     May 11, 2016 SeanieMac Holdings UK Books Over $3,200,000 of Combined Operations and Registers Over 8300 New Customers, a 1600% Increase Since Merger HUNTINGTON, NY--(Marketwired - May 11, 2016) -  SeanieMac UK (OTC PINK: BETS) announces over $3.2 million in sports bets revenue taken in its newly combined Sportsbook operation.
