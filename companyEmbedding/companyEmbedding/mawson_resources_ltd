Suomi








Mawson Resources Ltd on kanadalainen malminetsintäyhtiö, joka keskittyy arvometalliesiintymien etsintään pohjoismaissa. Yhtiön merkittävin tutkimushanke on Rompas-Rajapalojen kultaesiintymä Ylitorniolla ja Rovaniemellä. Mawson on listattu Toronton pörssiin (tunnus: MAW), ja se suunnittelee sivulistautumista Helsinkiin. Yhtiö toimii Suomessa ja Ruotsissa tytäryhtiöidensä Mawson Oy:n ja Mawson AB:n kautta.Yhtiö hakee rahoituksen toiminnalleen kansainvälisiltä rahoitusmarkkinoilta ja sen taloudellinen pohja on vakaa.
 










                                            Mawson: yhtiön yleisesittely
                                        








                                            Mawson: sijoituskohteena
                                        







Malminetsintähankkeet 

Rompas-RajapalotMawsonin päätutkimushanke on Rompas-Rajapalojen tutkimusalue, joka sijaitsee Ylitorniolla ja Rovaniemellä noin 50 kilometriä Rovaniemeltä länsilounaaseen. Rompas-Rajapaloista on tähän mennessä paikannettu kaksi ominaisuuksiltaan toisistaan selvästi poikkeavaa esiintymätyyppiä, jotka sijoittuvat noin 10 x 10 km laajuiselle alueelle:1.   Tämänhetkinen päätutkimuskohde on nimeltään Rajapalot, jossa kulta on suhteellisen tasaisesti kallioperään jakautunutta (pirotteinen esiintymätyyppi). Alueelta otetuista kairausnäytteistä on analysoitu muun muassa seuraavia, erittäin lupaavia kultapitoisuuksia:•  kairareikä PRAJ0006: 1,3 metrin syvyydestä alkava 19,5 m pitkä jakso, jonka kultapitoisuus on keskimäärin 7,4 grammaa tonnissa (19,5m @ 7,4 g/t Au), •  kairareikä PRAJ0009: 5,4 m @ 37,6 g/t Au 2,5 metrin syvyydestä alkaen (sis. 1,0 m @ 189,0 g/t Au 6,9 metrin syvyydestä alkaen)• kairareikä PRAJ0005: 12,6 m @ 3,6 g/t Au 6,7 metrin syvyydestä alkaenRajapalojen pirotteinen mineralisaatiovyöhyke vaikuttaa sijaitsevan geofysikaalisesti poikkeavalla, ns. anomaalisella vyöhykkeellä, jonka pituus on yli neljä kilometriä. Vyöhykkeestä on tähän mennessä otettu kairausnäytteitä vain noin 40 metrin syvyyteen kevyellä, kannettavalla kairakoneella. 2.   Toinen kohdealue on nimeltään Rompas, jossa kulta esiintyy hyvin rikkaissa, pistemäisissä pesäkkeissä (juonityyppinen esiintymä). Rompaksen vyöhykkeeltä otetuista näytteistä on analysoitu muun muassa seuraavia kultapitoisuuksia:•   kairareikä ROM0011 Rompaksen eteläosassa: 7,0 metrin syvyydestä alkava 6 m @ 617 g/t Au (sis. 1 m @ 3 540 g/t Au 11,0 metrin syvyydestä alkaen)•    kairareikä ROM0052 Rompaksen pohjoisosassa: 0,4 m @ 395 g/t Au• kultapitoisuus ylittää 100 g/t noin neljäsosassa Rompaksen alueelta otettuja näytteitäMawsonin tutkimukset Rompas-Rajapalojen tutkimusalueella ovat edelleen aivan alkuvaiheessaan. Yhtiö on kuitenkin tutkimuksissaan jo löytänyt selviä viitteitä kultamalmin muodostuksesta poikkeuksellisen laajalla, noin 10 x 10 kilometrin laajuisella alueella, jossa on paikannettu lukuisissa paikoissa korkeita kultapitoisuuksia. Näin laaja alue on maailmanlaajuisestikin merkittävä.Tarkempia tietoja Rompas-Rajapalojen kultaesiintymistä löydät englanniksi täältä.LuvitusKaikki Rompas-Rajapalojen alueella tähän mennessä tehdyt tutkimukset ovat aikaisen vaiheen malmitutkimuksia. Työtä on vielä paljon jäljellä ennen kuin voidaan varmuudella sanoa löytyykö alueelta yksi tai useampia taloudellisesti hyödynnettävissä olevia kultaesiintymiä eli kultamalmeja.Kaikki Rompas-Rajapalojen alueella tähän mennessä tehdyt tutkimukset ovat aikaisen vaiheen malmitutkimuksia. Työtä on vielä paljon jäljellä ennen kuin voidaan varmuudella sanoa löytyykö alueelta yksi tai useampia taloudellisesti hyödynnettävissä olevia kultaesiintymiä eli kultamalmeja.Suomessa on tarkka luvituskäytäntö ja tiukka ympäristö- ja luonnonsuojelulainsäädäntö. Mawson on sitoutunut yhteistyöhön alueellisten ja kansallisten lupaviranomaisten ja eri sidosryhmien kanssa niin, että hanketta kehitetään vastuullisesti. Yhtiö on teettänyt tutkimusalueen perustilan inventointitutkimuksen, ja ympäristöön liittyviä seurantoja jatketaan koko hankkeen ajan. Yhtiö on myös tehnyt Rompas-Rajapaloihin suunniteltujen tutkimusten ympäristövaikutuksista Natura-arvion, jota täydennetään ja päivitetään tarvittaessa. Yhtiö jatkaa tulevina vuosina tiivistä yhteistyötä kaivos-, ympäristö- ja luonnonsuojeluviranomaisten sekä muiden sidosryhmien kanssa varmistaakseen, että malmitutkimukset tehdään kestävällä tavalla parhaita käytäntöjä hyödyntäen.Natura 2000 --verkostoTietyt osat Rompas-Rajapalojen tutkimusalueesta (malminetsintälupa-alueet Kairamaat 1-3) ovat osa Euroopan laajuista Natura 2000 -verkostoa. Natura-alueita on noin 10% koko Suomen pinta-alasta ja noin 30% Pohjois-Suomen pinta-alasta. Natura 2000 on koko Euroopan yhteisön laajuinen ekologinen verkosto, johon sisältyy yhteensä lähes 26 000 ohjelma-aluetta 27 EU --maassa. Ohjelman toteutus aloitettiin vuoden 1992 luontodirektiivin toimeenpanolla, ja se kattaa nykyään lähes 18% koko Euroopan yhteisön pinta-alasta. Sen tarkoituksena on pitkällä tähtäimellä varmistaa Euroopan arvokkaimpien uhanalaisten lajien ja elinympäristöjen säilyminen. Natura 2000 ei ole luonnonpuistojen verkosto, joissa kaikki inhimillinen toiminta olisi kiellettyä. Suuri osa Natura-verkostoon kuuluvista alueista on edelleen yksityisessä omistuksessa ja tavoitteena on huolehtia, että niiden käyttö on niin ekologisesti kuin taloudellisestikin kestävää. Euroopan yhteisö on julkaissut ohjeet malminetsinnästä ja kaivostoiminnasta Natura-alueilla, löydät ohjeet täältä.Euromines, kaivosteollisuuden kattojärjestö Euroopassa, on julkaissut ohjeet mainittujen EU:n ohjeiden tulkitsemiseksi, löydät ohjeet täältä.Rompas-Rajapalojen luvitustilanneMawsonilla on Rompas-Rajapalojen tutkimusalueen mineraalioikeudet. Käytännössä tämä tarkoittaa, että yhtiö on hakenut kaivosviranomaiselta (TUKES, turvallisuus- ja kemikaalivirasto) lupia malmitutkimusten tekemiseen alueella (malminetsintälupa), ja mikäli se löytää lupa-alueilta taloudellisesti hyödynnettävissä olevia malmeja, sillä on etuoikeus hakea niille kaivoslupaa. Yhtiön lainvoimaiset valtausoikeudet raukesivat lokakuun 2014 lopussa, ja yhtiö on hakenut TUKES:lta malmitutkimuksilleen jatkoaikaa useille alueille kohdistuvilla malminetsintälupahakemuksilla. Toistaiseksi jatkolupahakemuksista yksi, Kairamaat 2-3 joka kohdistuu pääosin Rajapaloissa sijaitsevalle Mustiaapa-Kaattasjärven Natura-alueelle, on ratkaistu.Kaivosviranomainen rajoitti lupamääräyksillä Kairamaat 2-3 -alueille sallittuja etsintämenetelmiä niin, että syväkairaukset ovat mahdollisia ainoastaan riittävän paksun lumipeitteen aikana. Tutkimuskaivantojen teko kaivinkoneella ei ole lainkaan sallittua. Kaivosviranomaisen lupapäätöksestä tehtiin yksi valitus Pohjois-Suomen hallinto-oikeuteen joten malminetsintälupa ei ole toistaiseksi lainvoimainen. TUKES antoi syksyllä 2014 valituksenalaisesta malminetsintäluvasta täytäntöönpanomääräyksen, jonka perusteella yhtiö on voinut jatkaa tutkimuksia Rajapalojen alueella kannettavalla kairauslaitteistolla lintujen pesintäajan ulkopuolella.
 



Ympäristö 

Vastuu Ympäristöstä Kuuluu Kaikille

Mawson Resources Oy toteuttaa tutkimuksiaan laajoilla alueilla, joihin kuuluu myös suojelustatuksen omaavia alueita. Luonnon uusiutumiskyky pohjoisilla alueilla on hitaampaa kuin eteläisillä alueilla. Kylmät ilmasto-olosuhteet ja lyhyt kasvukausi ovat yksittäisiä tähän vaikuttavia osatekijöitä.

Kestävän kehityksen mukaisen toiminnan tuleekin olla tarkkaan ja harkiten suunniteltua. Yhtiö on sitoutunut suorittamaan toteutettavat tutkimustoimenpiteet erityistä varovaisuutta, kansallista lainsäädäntöä ja ympäristöviranomaisten antamia ohjeita ja suosituksia noudattaen. Lisäksi kansainvälinen lainsäädäntö ja erityisesti luonto- ja lintudirektiivit, ja niiden huomioon ottaminen kaikessa toiminnassa ohjaavat yhtiön toimintaa. Yhtiö myös panostaa uusien, vaikutuksiltaan vähäisempien malminetsintämenetelmien ja --tekniikoiden kehittämiseen osana toimintaansa. Yhtiön tavoitteena on toteuttaa tutkimustoimintaansa ekologisesti, sosiaalisesti ja taloudellisesti kestävällä tavalla. Yhtiö edellyttää myös alihankkijoiltaan vastaavaa vastuullisuutta kaikessa toiminnassaan.

ROMPAS JA RAJAPALOTRompaksen ja Rajapalojen alueella yhtiö on suorittanut erilaisia luontoselvityksiä, ja toteuttanut muun muassa Natura vaikutusten arvioinnin liittyen tuleviin ja meneillään oleviin tutkimuksiinsa. Arvokasta tieteellistä tutkimustietoa malminetsinnän vaikutuksista luontoon ja ympäristöön on toistaiseksi vielä vähän. Yhtiön tutkimustoimien vaikutuksia luontoon, lajeihin ja vesistöön seurataankin jatkuvasti. Seurantojen avulla saadaan tutkittua, pidemmän aikavälin tietoa siitä, miten näytteenottoa ja malminetsintää voidaan kestävällä tavalla toteuttaa luonto- ja ympäristöarvoja vaarantamatta.

 AJANKOHTAISTA: 

8.9.2015
Avoin maastovierailupäivä Mawsonin tutkimusalueelle Rajapaloihin



10.2.2015
	Vuoden 2015 kotkaseurantakamerat asennettu

Mawson Oy asensi viime viikolla tutkimusalueellaan sijaitsevan kotkan vaihtopesäpuun läheisyyteen kaksi riistakameraa. Asennus toteutettiin yhdessä Metsähallituksen Lapin Luontopalvelujen asiantuntijan kanssa. Kamerat ottavat kuvaa pesästä puolen tunnin välein.

Kotkan pesintäaika alkaa helmikuun puolivälissä. Riistakamerat ovat helppo ja huomaamaton tapa seurata mahdollista pesinnän aloittamista ja kotkan pesään asettumista. Kamerat eivät häiritse kotkaa. Sähköpostiin välittyvien kuvien perusteella voidaan seurata, asettuuko kotka pesän vai ei. Maaliskuun loppuun mennessä on selvinnyt, asettuiko kotka pesään.

1100 metrin suojavyöhykettä kotkan pesäpuun ympärillä noudatetaan kaikkien tutkimustoimien osalta 15.2 lähtien. Tutkimustoimintaa voidaan jatkaa Metsähallituksen suostumuksella, mikäli kotka ei asetu pesään, muutoin varoaika kestää aina pesintäajan loppuun saakka.

10.2.2015
	Mawson Oy mukana useissa eri sidosryhmätapaamisissa

Tammikuu oli vilkas kuukausi yhtiölle eri sidosryhmätapaamisten osalta. Alueellisen luonnonsuojelujärjestön väen lisäksi yhtiö tapasi muun muassa Meltosjärven kyläyhdistyksen väkeä. Molempien yhdistysten kanssa keskusteltiin ajankohtaisista aiheista, ja niihin liittyvistä kysymyksistä. Yhtiö osallistui myös kuun lopulla Ylitorniolla järjestettyyn suurhankeiltaan.

Kuun vaihteessa yhtiö sai vielä ilokseen Aavasaksalta lähtöisin, nykyisin toisella mantereella asuvan, herrasmiehen vieraakseen. Myös Rovaniemeläistynyt serkkupoika osallistui Lohijärven toimipaikassa pidettyyn neuvonpitoon. Yhtiö sai serkuksilta erinomaisia ajatuksia ja ehdotuksia toiminnan kehittämiseksi ja tiedonkulun parantamiseksi jatkossa. Myös yhteisestä maastokäynnistä ensi kesälle sovittiin.

Lapin luonnonsuojelupiiri kutsui yhtiön osallistumaan 12.3.2015 klo 18.00 Ylitorniolla järjestettävään yleisötilaisuuteen. Yhtiön väki osallistuu tapahtumaan ja vastaa ko. tilaisuudessa mielellään mieltä askarruttaviin kysymyksiin yhtiön toimintaan liittyen.



3.12.2014
	Paikallinen hevosenomistaja valjasti hevosensa malminetsinnän avuksi

Tällä hetkellä yhtiö toteuttaa näytteenottoa alueella kannettavalla kairauslaitteistolla. Kairauslaitteiston käyttäminen vaatii kuitenkin muun muassa polttoaineita (biohajoavia) ja varaosia, joita aikaisemmin alueelle on kannettu miesvoimin yhtiön rakennuttamaa väliaikaista pitkospuupolkua pitkin. Yhtiö päätti vähentää alueelle kulkemisesta koituvaa maapohjan kulumista, ja aloitti yhteistyön paikallisen hevosenomistajan kanssa.

"Hevonen kantaa kerralla 4-5 kertaa sen, mitä yksi mies", toteaa hevosten ensimmäisenä työpäivänä paikalla ollut malminetsintägeologi Janne Kinnunen. Hevosen kulkeminen on myös huomattavasti nopeampaa kuin ihmisen. "Lukumäärältään vähäisemmät ja kestoltaan nopeammat käyntikerrat vähentävät myös esimerkiksi eläinlajeille aiheutuvaa häiriötä" toteaa yhtiön ympäristöpäällikkö Noora Raasakka. Hevonen kuljettaa kerran pari viikossa tarvittavia tykötarpeita kairakoneelle, jolloin ympäristöön kohdistuvaa painetta ja kulumista voidaan vähentää pitkällä aikavälillä jopa merkittävässä määrin.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Mawson Resources Ltd (TSE:MAW) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A

Quoteboard data fields include:  Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session. Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram. Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session. Bid: The last bid price and bid size. Ask: The last ask price and ask size. Volume: The total number of shares or contracts traded in the current trading session. Average Volume: The average number of shares traded over the last 20 days. Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.  Chart Snapshot A thumbnail of a daily chart is provided, with a link to open and customize a full-sized chart.Price Performance This section shows the Highs and Lows over the past 1, 3 and 12-Month periods. Click the "See More" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.Barchart Technical Opinion The Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overally Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal." Support and Resistance This section shows a snapshot view of the Trader's Cheat Sheet with the Last Price, and four separate pivot points (2 Support Levels, and 2 Resistance Points). The Last Price shown is the last trade price at the time the quote page was displayed, and will not update every 10 seconds (as the Last Price at the top of the Quote page does). The Last Price will update only when the page is refreshed. Pivot points are used to identify intraday support, resistance and target levels. The pivot point and its support and resistance pairs are defined as follows, where H, L, C are the current day's high, low and close, respectively. Support and Resistance points are based on end-of-day prices and are intended for the current trading session if the market is open, or the next trading session if the market is closed.   Pivot Point: (P) = (H + L + C) / 3 First Resistance Level: (R1) = (2 * P) - L First Support Level: (S1) = (2 * P) - H Second Resistance Level: (R2) = P + (R1 - S1) Second Support Level: (S2) = P - (R1 - S1) Fundamentals For US Stocks, the Overview page includes key statistics on the stock's fundamentals, with a link to see more. Most Recent Earnings figures are based on Non-GAAP income from continuing operations. Market Cap: capitalization or market value of a stock is simply the market value of all outstanding shares. It is computed by multiplying the market price by the number of outstanding shares. For example, a publicly held company with 10 million shares outstanding that trade at $10 each would have a market capitalization of $100 million. Shares Outstanding: Common shares outstanding as reported by the company on the 10-Q or 10-K. P/E Ratio: Latest closing price divided by the earnings-per-share based on the Latest 12-Month EPS Change (LTM) of earnings. Companies with negative earnings receive an "NE." EPS: The basic annual EPS from total operations is the bottom line income after all expenses, divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. For example, if a company has $10 million in net income and 10 million in outstanding shares, then its EPS is $1. Beta: 36 Month Beta: Coefficient that measures the volatility of a stock's returns relative to the market (S&P 500). It is based on a 36-month historical regression of the return on the stock onto the return on the S&P 500. Earnings: The amount of latest Earnings Per Share (EPS) paid out to shareholders. Dividend Yield: A portion of a company's profit paid to shareholders, quoted as the dollar amount each share receives (dividends per share). Yield is the amount of dividends paid per share, divided by the closing price. Sectors: Links to the Industry Groups and/or SIC codes in which the stock is found.Business Summary Provides a general description of the business conducted by this company.

VANCOUVER, June 14, 2017 /PRNewswire/ - Mawson Resources Limited ("Mawson") or (the "Company") (TSX: MAW) (Frankfurt: MXR) (PINKSHEETS: MWSNF) announces the appointment of Mr. Philip Williams to Mawson's Board of Directors, effective immediately. 








Mr. Williams brings more than 15 years of mining and finance industry experience. His diverse work experience includes roles in corporate development, as a sell-side research analyst, in fund management and most recently as managing director of investment banking focused on the metals and mining sector. In each of these roles, he focused a significant amount of time on the exploration industry. 
As a research analyst at Westwind Partners, Mr. Williams worked with a team that covered a range of commodities including precious and base metals, diamonds and uranium.  In late 2008, he joined Pinetree Capital, a natural resource focused investment fund, in the role of VP Business Development.

In 2012, he joined Dundee Capital Markets (now Eight Capital) in the investment banking group. As a Managing Director, he successfully completed equity financings across a wide range of commodities and was a named advisor on multiple M&A transactions. Mr. Williams is a Chartered Financial Analyst and holds a Bachelor of Commerce Degree.
Mr. Hudson, the Company's Chairman, and CEO states: "Having known and worked with Phil over many years in his earlier roles, I am delighted to welcome him to the Mawson Board.  Mawson will benefit from Phil's analytic and strategic skills and his long and respected experience in the Canadian and US capital markets. Phil's demonstrated track record will aid the Company to grow further, by leveraging its current exploration success in Finland."
