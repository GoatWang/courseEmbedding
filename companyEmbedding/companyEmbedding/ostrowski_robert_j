A Company Man, Spurned, Fights For His Name

By LANDON THOMAS JR.JUNE 8, 2003

Continue reading the main story









IT'S a cold, rainy day in June at the Huntsville Golf Club in the countryside outside this small Pennsylvania city, and Robert J. Ostrowski is trying to explain why he is suing his former employer, Prudential Securities, for $30 million.''I want my reputation back and I want an apology from Prudential,'' Mr. Ostrowski said as he fingered a gold ring that Prudential gave him 25 years ago when he joined its exclusive club for top stockbrokers. ''I walk around proud in this town because I've done nothing wrong and I carry my head high.''Mr. Ostrowski, 66, a broker for 41 years at the Prudential office here, contends that the company is trying to make him a fall guy for its regulatory problems over the marketing of mutual funds. Prudential said he was fired for what it contends was an unauthorized trade in the summer of 2001.Mr. Ostrowski is not going without a fight.A gaunt man whose suit hangs loosely on him, he is prone to excitable rants and accusations. Words stream from him in the relentless, desperate patter of the born salesman, like a dressed-up version of Jack Lemmon in the movie ''Glengarry Glen Ross.''

The dining room at the golf club is usually a hub for the business elite. But on this day it is empty, and that makes Mr. Ostrowski jumpy. Like many small-town brokers, he feeds off people, and today there is no lunch party to barge in on or packed bar to belly up to. He barely touches his food. Continue reading the main story

''Let's go to the locker room,'' he says, leaping up from his seat. The locker room is also empty, save for a table of men drinking beer, smoking cigars and playing poker.''Hi, fellas, I'm Bob Ostrowski,'' he says buoyantly, thrusting his hand into the middle of their game. The beefy young men seem bemused by the intrusion, and Mr. Ostrowski doesn't linger; he rushes back to his table.''I was special,'' he said. ''I brought in $375 million in assets all by myself. Then some young punk comes in and knocks me off. All of a sudden I'm fired.''It's a terrible time to be a retail broker in small-town America.For years now, brokerage houses like Merrill Lynch and Prudential have been shutting down their offices in small cities and towns, but the practice has become even more common since the collapse of the stock market. Prudential, for example, has cut its number of brokers to 4,519 this quarter from 5,656 in the first quarter of 2002.From the other side, they feel attacked by clients who are bitter over stock losses. Arbitration suits filed by investors against brokers were up 25 percent in the first four months of this year, versus the same period last year. In 2002, some 7,704 suits were filed, up 38 percent from 2000. Securities regulators are also investigating the mutual fund marketing practices of brokers and their firms.Many brokers are using the current climate as an excuse to retire, but some are fighting back against their former firms. And brokers aren't alone: unjust-termination suits filed by investment bank employees jumped to 103 last year from 82 in 2001.Many people within the brokerage industry say the suits are frivolous, desperate attempts by brokers and bankers to settle personal scores and to land one final payday. There is growing evidence that many brokers did play fast and loose with their customers during the stock market boom. With that boom now a hazy memory, brokerage firms are cracking down on infractions that they may well have let slide during a more prosperous time.

MERRILL LYNCH, for example, is adopting a sophisticated new technology system that will allow supervisors to better oversee transactions between brokers and their clients, people close to the compliance process at Merrill said.''The reason why we see all this finger pointing is because there is now money at stake for the brokerage firms and reputations at stake for the brokers who have been dismissed,'' said Samuel L. Hayes III, an emeritus professor of investment banking at Harvard. ''It has always been clear that a number of practices by brokers at brokerage firms were likely to be disadvantageous for the customer.''''When the bubble burst,'' he added, ''that's when the suits began.''In the case of Robert Ostrowski, the facts -- as they always are in suits contending unjust termination -- are in dispute. Mr. Ostrowski says Prudential, which like other Wall Street firms has been under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission for how it markets mutual funds, is trying to blame him for its regulatory problems. He also contends that he was fired because his branch manager wanted to steal his clients and and get more business out of them.A spokesman for Prudential Securities said Mr. Ostrowski had been terminated for conducting an unauthorized trade; the spokesman declined further comment.Mr. Ostrowski, like the case itself, brims with ambiguities. A millionaire several times over who owns two top-of-the-line Mercedes-Benzes -- one for him and one for his wife -- he says he is not suing Prudential for the money, yet he is seeking damages of more than $30 million and has hired a high-powered New York law firm, Liddle & Robinson, to advance his case.He says he has never taken advantage of his clients, yet an arbitration case filed against him depicts him as promoting crash-and-burn biotechnology stocks to clients, and he has been subpoenaed by the S.E.C. about the suitability of mutual funds that he and Prudential sold to customers.Despite his inflamed passions against his firm, he remains a Prudential man to the bone. A daughter still works at the firm, and he maintains a brokerage account there. Besides the ring, he proudly wears an 18-karat gold watch with an inscription on the back commending him for his 10 years on the Chairman's Council, a select group of the firm's best-producing brokers nationwide; and when he golfs at the Huntsville club, he totes a golf bag that has ''Prudential Securities'' stitched across it in bold blue letters.''I was a company man,'' Mr. Ostrowski said. ''I had my life, my business for my kids. I went to work every day and one day this guy comes in and blindsides me. I will say this humbly. I was the No. 1 broker in town. Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, they were all here. But I started 41 years ago and I built and built. I am not a rogue broker.''

When Mr. Ostrowski started selling stock out of Prudential's Wilkes-Barre office in 1961, the city was still living off the fumes of the coal-mining days. As the coal business waned, younger generations moved to larger cities for work, and Wilkes-Barre began to shrink.Born and raised here, in the northeastern part of the state, Mr. Ostrowski never entertained such thoughts. Newly married, he pushed himself into the city's upper social strata and found customers with money to spend.For Mr. Ostrowski, the son of a wholesale meat distributor, that exercise in social climbing was no small feat: Wilkes-Barre society is hidebound, set in its ways and manners. But Mr. Ostrowski made inroads; he married into a family with solid financial ties in the community, kept in close contact with his classmates at King's College in Wilkes-Barre who succeeded in business and made it a practice to go to lunch every day at the Westmoreland Club, Wilkes-Barre's most exclusive dinner club, where he would pester the city's business barons with stock tips.Colin R. Keefer, a past client of Mr. Ostrowski's and a former broker for Merrill Lynch, said: ''In my day, a broker making 20 calls a day was a lot, but Bob would make 50. The thing about Bob is that he is very aggressive. If he wanted you to become his client, he kept on working at it until you just decided, 'Well, O.K. then.' ''As his client list and assets grew, so did his social status, and the line separating customers from friends and family blurred. From his father-in-law to the family doctor who delivered his three daughters, just about everyone who knew Bob Ostrowski became a client of Bob Ostrowski's.''You have to depend on your broker and their calls,'' said Charles Boyek, a real estate salesman who has known Mr. Ostrowski for 25 years. ''I don't care a hill of beans for these fund managers who have gone to Harvard. Bob, for us, was someone we could trust.''He had a product for everybody: municipal bond funds for elderly widows; certificates of deposit for conservative investors (he took out ads in a local paper and his clients called him ''the king of C.D.'s''); initial public offerings from Prudential's syndicate desk for his favored clients and hot stock tips for his most aggressive customers. And, like the very best pitchmen, he was never afraid of getting no for an answer.''I've been rejected so many times in my life; you have no idea,'' Mr. Ostrowski said. ''But that doesn't mean I can't keep on sending literature to a guy. I've always been a salesman.''

By the 1990's, with the stock market reaching new highs every day, Mr. Ostrowski's business was flourishing. He was taking home a million dollars a year, and the Ostrowski team, as he called the office -- himself and two daughters -- had more than 3,500 customer accounts totaling $375 million in assets.

With such a big client list, Mr. Ostrowski had his share of customer complaints.In February 2000, for example, according to papers in an arbitration suit filed after he left Prudential, he told a client that EntreMed, a highflying biotechnology company, was on the verge of a major cancer breakthrough. The client bought shares at $75, only to see the stock plummet when no announcement was forthcoming. In a subsequent arbitration suit, the customer contended that Mr. Ostrowski had misled him with false statements so that he would buy the stock. Prudential eventually settled the suit.Mr. Ostrowski denies the allegations.''Bob's clients' interests always came first,'' said James A. Batson, his lawyer at Liddle & Robinson. ''After the panel hears all the evidence, I'm confident that Bob will be vindicated.''Mr. Ostrowski acknowledges though, that during the market's boom his customer's craving for the next hot stock did result in some less-than-sterling recommendations.''The public is gullible,'' Mr. Ostrowski said. ''They are always looking for the golden broker. I had losers just like everyone else.''But during the market's heyday, Mr. Ostrowski's bosses were more inclined to focus on his $375 million book of business than the odd customer complaint. It was an extraordinary figure, given Wilkes-Barre's population of about 50,000, and it made him one of Prudential's star producers.In 1977, Mr. Ostrowski became a member of Prudential's Chairman's Council. He schmoozed with Hardwick Simmons, Prudential's chief executive in the early 1990's, and in May 2001 hit his career peak. Prudential flew Mr. Ostrowski and his wife, Martha, to Paris and, at a glittering ceremony at the Four Seasons Hotel, honored him and a number of his colleagues for their 25 years as members of the Chairman's Council.''Bob Ostrowski represents the type of financial adviser that makes the firm a successful one,'' James D. Price, then president of Prudential Securities, said in a commendation.Two months later, Robert Ostrowski's perfect world in Wilkes-Barre fell apart.In July 2001, Mr. Ostrowski's regional manager, Bruce Taub, paid a visit to Wilkes-Barre and called him into an office. According to Mr. Ostrowski, Mr. Taub said: ''Bob, this is not going to be pleasant, but we are terminating you. We have collected a folder of 40 complaints against you over the years. This goes as high as Mike Rice,'' the president of Prudential's private client group.

The termination was irreversible, he was told, and was a result of the customer complaints, most specifically an incident in June in which Mr. Ostrowski executed an unauthorized trade for one of his clients. Mr. Ostrowski denied that he made such a trade. Security officers were called in, according to brokers who worked at the Wilkes-Barre office, and Mr. Ostrowski was asked to leave.Before he was fired, Mr. Ostrowski said he had heard that Prudential would be shutting down the Wilkes-Barre office and moving it to nearby Scranton.After the shock wore off, he decided to use the move as a way to save face and declare his retirement. Plus, if he retired, he would be in a position to collect more than $1 million from a deferred compensation plan available to longtime Prudential employees, as well as other benefits. His daughters could continue with his business and he could move on to a more pacific life of golf and trips to Europe with his wife.A small retirement party was held for him at the Wilkes-Barre office, and David Capin, his branch manager, saluted Mr. Ostrowski for his years of service.WITHIN days, though, his retirement dreams were punctured. Mr. Capin called him at home, Mr. Ostrowski said, and told him that because he was being fired, he could not declare his retirement and he would not receive any benefits from Prudential. Plus, his U-5, the document that firms must file with regulators explaining the nature of a broker's dismissal, would show that he was fired for unauthorized trading, putting an irreversible black mark on his record.Prudential declined to make Mr. Capin or Mr. Taub available for comment.It was then that Mr. Ostrowski decided to file suit against Prudential. Last June, his lawyer filed a brief with arbitrators at the New York Stock Exchange, and Prudential submitted a response. Hearings are to begin next January.In November 2001, he received a subpoena from the S.E.C. and later submitted testimony on how he marketed Class A and B mutual fund shares. Regulators have long been concerned that brokers have been recommending Class B shares to customers when Class A shares, which carry a discount when bought in large volumes, are in some cases more appropriate and less costly. Like many brokers at Prudential, Mr. Ostrowski was a persistent marketer of Class B shares.His customers liked them because they had no upfront fee, he said, and for Mr. Ostrowski, the funds could bring in higher commissions. ''Bob was the most aggressive marketer of B share funds that I have ever worked with,'' said a Prudential broker who has worked with Mr. Ostrowski and insisted on anonymity because of pending litigation. ''He knew what the rules were and challenged them consistently.''

Mr. Ostrowski denies ever having broken any rules selling fund shares.According to Mr. Ostrowski, Prudential never made the guidelines clear, so he stuck to the Class B funds. In late June 2001, just weeks before Mr. Ostrowski was fired, Prudential did circulate a directive to its branch offices, laying out in detail the firm's policy on the marketing of Class A and B shares.''I could have talked to my clients more about A shares,'' Mr. Ostrowski said. ''But believe me, selling mutual funds is not an easy job. Jeez, when you hear the S.E.C. you think, 'This guy must have been stealing from little old ladies.' I mean it's just A and B shares after all.''Prudential officials have never said publicly that Mr. Ostrowski's encounter with the S.E.C. was the main reason for his dismissal, but in its written response to Mr. Ostrowski's accusations, the company said that ''in early 2000, during an S.E.C. audit, questions were raised about the use of margin and high yield 'B' shares in accounts of Ostrowski's customers.''The S.E.C.'s investigation into Prudential's fund marketing practices is continuing, and though there are a number of possible outcomes, legal experts say that one possibility is for Prudential to be fined for failing to supervise Mr. Ostrowski's activities.Life in Wilkes-Barre has changed for Mr. Ostrowski over the last two years. Consumed as he is with his case, he rarely lunches at the Westmoreland Club. Now, when he goes out to dinner, he said, former clients give him strange looks and try to avoid him.Still, Mr. Ostrowski keeps a full schedule, though he says it has been something of a task to fill up the vacant hours. ''I don't read books,'' he said resignedly. ''I would rather be out talking to people.'' His wife acknowledges that his obsession with the case has put strains on their marriage. ''It hasn't been easy on my wife,'' Mr. Ostrowski said. ''But our marriage is strong.''Most of all, he misses the buzz of working the phones and peddling stocks. In fact, the absence of structure seems to have turned him a bit frantic. ''The market is my life,'' he said. ''I'm a stockaholic. When I get out of bed, I turn on CNBC, do my exercises and take a little Viagra -- not that I need any Viagra.''As Mr. Ostrowski drove back from the golf club, his vitriol toward Prudential seemed to be getting the better of him. ''Prudential loved me,'' he shouted, his face flush with anger. ''I was a money maker, the largest producer of anyone out there. I want to make those people pay.''His Mercedes tore through quiet roads, zooming past cars and startling his wife, who is in the back seat. ''Whoa, Bob, watch out for the stop sign,'' she yelled, as he barreled through an intersection.

Mr. Ostrowski let out a whoosh of breath and took his foot off the gas pedal.''Five weeks before I turn 65 and they take it all away from me,'' he said. ''I wasn't going anywhere. I love Prudential.'' Continue reading the main story
