Early life and education[edit]
James Dyson was born in Cromer, Norfolk, one of three children. He was educated at Gresham's School,[1] an independent boarding school in Holt, Norfolk, from 1956 to 1965, when his father died of cancer.[6] He excelled at long distance running: "I was quite good at it, not because I was physically good, but because I had more determination. I learnt determination from it."[7] He spent one year (1965–1966) at the Byam Shaw School of Art, and then studied furniture and interior design at the Royal College of Art (1966–1970) before moving into engineering.
Early inventions[edit]
Dyson helped design the Sea Truck in 1970 while studying at the Royal College of Art. His first original invention, the Ballbarrow, was a modified version of a wheelbarrow using a ball instead of a wheel. This was featured on the BBC's Tomorrow's World television programme. Dyson stuck with the idea of a ball, which his brother had thought of, inventing the Trolleyball, a trolley that launched boats. He then designed the Wheelboat,[8] which could travel at speeds of 64 kilometres per hour (40 mph) on both land and water.
Vacuum cleaners[edit]




DC07 bagless Dyson vacuum cleaner


In the late 1970s, Dyson had the idea of using cyclonic separation to create a vacuum cleaner that would not lose suction as it picked up dirt. He became frustrated with his Hoover Junior's diminishing performance: the dust bag kept becoming clogged with loads of dust thus reducing suction.[9] The cyclone idea came from a sawmill that used cyclone technology (qv. History of Dyson Ltd).[10]
Partly supported by his wife's salary as an art teacher, and after five years and many prototypes, Dyson launched the "G-Force" cleaner in 1983. However, no manufacturer or distributor would handle his product in the UK, as it would disturb the valuable market for replacement dust bags, so Dyson launched it in Japan through catalogue sales.[11] Manufactured in bright pink, the G-Force sold for the equivalent of £2,000. It won the 1991 International Design Fair Prize in Japan. He obtained his first US patent on the idea in 1986 (U.S. Patent 4,593,429).
After failing to sell his invention to the major manufacturers, Dyson set up his own manufacturing company, Dyson Ltd. In June 1993, he opened his research centre and factory in Malmesbury, Wiltshire.
Dyson's breakthrough in the UK market came more than ten years after the initial idea, through a TV advertising campaign in which it was emphasised that, unlike most of its rivals, the Dyson vacuum did not require the continuing purchase of replacement bags. At that time, the UK market for disposable cleaner bags was £100 million. The slogan "say goodbye to the bag" proved more attractive to the buying public than a previous emphasis on the suction efficiency that its technology delivers. Ironically, the previous step change in domestic vacuum cleaner design had been the introduction of the disposable bag – users being prepared to pay extra for the convenience. The Dyson Dual Cyclone became the fastest-selling vacuum cleaner ever made in the UK, and outsold those of some of the companies that rejected his idea, becoming one of the most popular brands in the UK.[12] In early 2005, it was reported that Dyson cleaners had become the market leaders in the United States by value (though not by number of units sold).
Dyson licensed the technology in North America from 1986 to 2001 to Fantom Technologies, after which Dyson entered the market directly.
Following his success, other major manufacturers began to market their own cyclonic vacuum cleaners. In 1999 Dyson sued Hoover (UK) for patent infringement. The High Court ruled that Hoover had deliberately copied a fundamental part of his patented designs in making its Triple Vortex bagless vacuum cleaner range.[13] Hoover agreed to pay damages of £4 million.
In 2005, Dyson incorporated the wheel ball from his Ballbarrow concept into a vacuum cleaner, creating the Dyson Ball, with the aim of making it more manoeuvrable.
In mid-2014, Dyson personally appeared in Tokyo to introduce his "360 Eye" robotic vacuum cleaner. Dyson's initial entry into this market segment features 360° scanning and mapping for navigation, cyclonic dust separation, a custom-designed digital motor for high suction, tank treads for traction, a full-width beater bar, and user interface via a free iOS or Android app.[14]
Other inventions[edit]
In 2000, Dyson expanded his appliance range to include a washing machine called the ContraRotator, which had two rotating drums moving in opposite directions. The range was decorated in the usual bright Dyson colours, rather than the traditional white, grey or black of most other machines. The item was not a commercial success and is no longer available.[15]
In 2002, Dyson created a realisation of the optical illusions depicted in the lithographs of Dutch artist M. C. Escher. Engineer Derek Phillips was able to accomplish the task after a year of work, creating a water sculpture in which the water appears to flow up to the tops of four ramps arranged in a square, before cascading to the bottom of the next ramp. The creation titled Wrong Garden,[16] was displayed at the Chelsea Flower Show in 2003.[17] The illusion is accomplished with water containing air bubbles pumped through a chamber underneath the transparent glass ramps to a slit at the top from which the bulk of the water cascades down. This makes it appear that the water is flowing up, when really, a small amount of water diverted from the slit at the top flows back down the ramps in a thin layer.




Dyson Airblade hand dryer


In October 2006 Dyson launched the Dyson Airblade, a fast hand dryer that uses a thin sheet of moving air as a squeegee to remove water, rather than attempting to evaporate it with heat. This allows faster drying, while using much less energy than traditional electrical hand dryers.
Another product is a fan without external blades, which he calls the "Air Multiplier".[18] In addition to a cooling fan, a model which distributes electrically produced heat and an ultrasonic humidifier model are also available.
In April 2016, Dyson launched the Dyson Supersonic, a hair dryer with a smaller motor located in the handle so as to provide better balance and smaller size, as well as quieter operation.[19] Commenting on the launch Vogue magazine said "as the first product to launch from Dyson's new UK state-of-the-art hair laboratory, we have high hopes for the future of our blow-dries."[20]
Manufacturing[edit]
In February 2002, Dyson announced that production was being shifted to Malaysia leaving 560[21] workers redundant in 2002 for economic reasons and because of difficulty acquiring land for expansion. The company's headquarters and research facilities remain in Malmesbury.
In November 2014, Dyson announced plans to invest a further £1.5bn into the research and development of new technology, including funding for a campus at the Dyson UK headquarters in Malmesbury which will create up to 3,000 jobs.[22]
Former Prime Minister David Cameron, said: “Dyson is a great British success story and the expansion of the Malmesbury campus will create thousands of new jobs, providing a real boost to the local economy and financial security for more hardworking families. Investment on this scale shows confidence in our long-term economic plan to back business, create more jobs and secure a brighter future for Britain.”[23]
European single currency[edit]

In 1998, Dyson was one of the chairmen and chief executives of the twenty FTSE 100 companies who signed a statement published in The Financial Times in 1998 calling on the government for early British membership of the Eurozone.[24] He claimed that failure to join the euro would lead to the destruction of the British manufacturing base and said: "It does not mean that the jobs will go tomorrow but will drift abroad over a period and the longer-term future of Britain as a manufacturing nation will be blighted. Ministers had better understand that if we delay entry too long there may be nothing left to save."[25]
An editorial published by The Times responded: "Mr Dyson, a manufacturing version of Sir Richard Branson, likes complaining. Yesterday he was complaining that Britain's failure to join the Euro and the resultant strong Pound will force him to move abroad. Last week he blamed the price of land and planning delays in Wiltshire, but never mind. So where will he go? To Portugal, Italy or to an EU candidate such as Poland? No, Mr Dyson threatens to go to the Far East. Like so many entrepreneurs, he wants a cheap currency and low interest rates, but also low inflation, low wages, a flexible labour market and low regulation. He will not find them in the eurozone."[26] Lord Tebbit, a former Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, also questioned Dyson's motives and said: "[W]hat still puzzles me is why such a euro-enthusiast as [Mr] Dyson does not intend to establish his new factory in Europe if he can't have it in Britain."[27]
In 2014, Dyson said he would now be voting to leave the European Union to avoid being "dominated and bullied by the Germans".[28] In November 2015, Dyson lost his case against EU energy labelling laws in the European Court of Justice.[29] Dyson was one of the most prominent UK business leaders to publicly support Brexit before the referendum in June 2016.[30] Since the EU referendum, Dyson has stated that Britain should leave the EU Single Market and that this would "liberate" the UK economy.[31]
James Dyson Foundation[edit]




Dyson in 2013 at Sydney, Australia


Dyson set up the Foundation in 2002 to support design and engineering education – it now operates in UK, US and Japan. The Foundation's aim is to inspire young people to study engineering and become engineers by encouraging students to think differently and to make mistakes. The Foundation supports engineering education in schools and universities, as well as medical and scientific research in partnership with charities. It achieves this by funding different resources such as the "Engineering Box", a box filled with activities for a school to use as a teaching aid. The Foundation loans the boxes to schools for four weeks free of charge, they are suitable for Key Stage 4 and above. The Engineering Box enables students to take apart and examine a Dyson DC22 Telescope vacuum cleaner. In addition, a school is allowed to retain a James Dyson Foundation teacher pack, and a copy of Genius of Britain, a Channel 4 TV series featuring Dyson, and design engineering posters. Other resources are also available.
In May 2014, the Foundation announced an £8m donation to create a technology hub at the University of Cambridge. A new four-storey building will house 1,200 postgraduate engineers and support world-leading research. The donation will also allow for a design and making lab to be developed for undergraduate engineering students.[32]
In March 2015, the James Dyson Foundation pledged a £12m donation to Imperial College London to allow the purchase of an iconic Post Office building (located on Exhibition Road) from the Science Museum. Imperial College will open the Dyson School of Design Engineering in this building, and teach a new four-year Masters course in design engineering, developing a new cohort of creative and theoretical engineers.[33]
The Foundation also supports the work of young designers through the James Dyson Award. This is an international design award that "celebrates, encourages and inspires the next generation of design engineers".[34] It is run in twenty countries and is open to recent graduates in product design, industrial design, and engineering.
Honours and awards[edit]
In 1997, Dyson was awarded The Prince Philip Designers Prize.[35] Dyson was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1998 New Year Honours. In 2000, he received the Lord Lloyd of Kilgerran Award. He received an Honorary DEng degree from the University of Bath in 2000.[36] In 2005, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering (FREng).[37] He was appointed a Knight Bachelor in the 2007 New Year Honours. Since 2011 he has been Provost of the Royal College of Art. Dyson was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2015.[2] In the 2016 New Year Honours, Dyson's appointment to the Order of Merit (OM) was announced for "contributions and achievements in industrial design".[38][39] 2017: IEEE Honorary Membership. In March 2017 Dyson was voted the most reputable company in the UK followed by Aston Martin.[40]
Personal life[edit]
Dyson married Deirdre Dyson (née Hindmarsh) in 1968.[1] The couple have three children.[1][41] In 2003, Dyson paid £15 million[citation needed] for Dodington Park,[42] a 300-acre (1.2 km2) Georgian estate in South Gloucestershire close to Chipping Sodbury. He and his wife also own Domaine des Rabelles, near Tourtour, France, and a townhouse in Chelsea, London.[43] His vessel Nahlin is the largest British-flagged and owned super yacht with an LOA of 91 metres (299 ft), and was ranked 36th in a 2013 survey of the world's 100 biggest yachts.[44][45]
Dyson is Provost of the Royal College of Art in London, having succeeded Sir Terence Conran in August 2011,[46] and is Patron of the Design & Technology Association.[47] He was chair of the board of trustees of the Design Museum, "the first in the world to showcase design of the manufactured object", until suddenly resigning in September 2004,[48] stating the museum had "become a style showcase" instead of "upholding its mission to encourage serious design of the manufactured object".

At that time, the UK market for disposable cleaner bags was £100 million. The slogan "say goodbye to the bag" proved more attractive to the buying public than a previous emphasis on the suction efficiency that its technology delivers. Ironically, the previous step change in domestic vacuum cleaner design had been the introduction of the disposable bag – users being prepared to pay extra for the convenience. The Dyson Dual Cyclone became the fastest-selling vacuum cleaner ever made in the UK, and outsold those of some of the companies that rejected his idea, becoming one of the most popular brands in the UK.[12] In early 2005, it was reported that Dyson cleaners had become the market leaders in the United States by value (though not by number of units sold).
Dyson licensed the technology in North America from 1986 to 2001 to Fantom Technologies, after which Dyson entered the market directly.
Following his success, other major manufacturers began to market their own cyclonic vacuum cleaners. In 1999 Dyson sued Hoover (UK) for patent infringement. The High Court ruled that Hoover had deliberately copied a fundamental part of his patented designs in making its Triple Vortex bagless vacuum cleaner range.[13] Hoover agreed to pay damages of £4 million.
In 2005, Dyson incorporated the wheel ball from his Ballbarrow concept into a vacuum cleaner, creating the Dyson Ball, with the aim of making it more manoeuvrable.
In mid-2014, Dyson personally appeared in Tokyo to introduce his "360 Eye" robotic vacuum cleaner. Dyson's initial entry into this market segment features 360° scanning and mapping for navigation, cyclonic dust separation, a custom-designed digital motor for high suction, tank treads for traction, a full-width beater bar, and user interface via a free iOS or Android app.[14]
Other inventions[edit]
In 2000, Dyson expanded his appliance range to include a washing machine called the ContraRotator, which had two rotating drums moving in opposite directions. The range was decorated in the usual bright Dyson colours, rather than the traditional white, grey or black of most other machines. The item was not a commercial success and is no longer available.[15]
In 2002, Dyson created a realisation of the optical illusions depicted in the lithographs of Dutch artist M. C. Escher. Engineer Derek Phillips was able to accomplish the task after a year of work, creating a water sculpture in which the water appears to flow up to the tops of four ramps arranged in a square, before cascading to the bottom of the next ramp. The creation titled Wrong Garden,[16] was displayed at the Chelsea Flower Show in 2003.[17] The illusion is accomplished with water containing air bubbles pumped through a chamber underneath the transparent glass ramps to a slit at the top from which the bulk of the water cascades down. This makes it appear that the water is flowing up, when really, a small amount of water diverted from the slit at the top flows back down the ramps in a thin layer.




Dyson Airblade hand dryer


In October 2006 Dyson launched the Dyson Airblade, a fast hand dryer that uses a thin sheet of moving air as a squeegee to remove water, rather than attempting to evaporate it with heat. This allows faster drying, while using much less energy than traditional electrical hand dryers.
Another product is a fan without external blades, which he calls the "Air Multiplier".[18] In addition to a cooling fan, a model which distributes electrically produced heat and an ultrasonic humidifier model are also available.
In April 2016, Dyson launched the Dyson Supersonic, a hair dryer with a smaller motor located in the handle so as to provide better balance and smaller size, as well as quieter operation.[19] Commenting on the launch Vogue magazine said "as the first product to launch from Dyson's new UK state-of-the-art hair laboratory, we have high hopes for the future of our blow-dries."[20]
Manufacturing[edit]
In February 2002, Dyson announced that production was being shifted to Malaysia leaving 560[21] workers redundant in 2002 for economic reasons and because of difficulty acquiring land for expansion. The company's headquarters and research facilities remain in Malmesbury.
In November 2014, Dyson announced plans to invest a further £1.5bn into the research and development of new technology, including funding for a campus at the Dyson UK headquarters in Malmesbury which will create up to 3,000 jobs.[22]
Former Prime Minister David Cameron, said: “Dyson is a great British success story and the expansion of the Malmesbury campus will create thousands of new jobs, providing a real boost to the local economy and financial security for more hardworking families. Investment on this scale shows confidence in our long-term economic plan to back business, create more jobs and secure a brighter future for Britain.”[23]
European single currency[edit]

In 1998, Dyson was one of the chairmen and chief executives of the twenty FTSE 100 companies who signed a statement published in The Financial Times in 1998 calling on the government for early British membership of the Eurozone.[24] He claimed that failure to join the euro would lead to the destruction of the British manufacturing base and said: "It does not mean that the jobs will go tomorrow but will drift abroad over a period and the longer-term future of Britain as a manufacturing nation will be blighted. Ministers had better understand that if we delay entry too long there may be nothing left to save."[25]
An editorial published by The Times responded: "Mr Dyson, a manufacturing version of Sir Richard Branson, likes complaining. Yesterday he was complaining that Britain's failure to join the Euro and the resultant strong Pound will force him to move abroad. Last week he blamed the price of land and planning delays in Wiltshire, but never mind. So where will he go? To Portugal, Italy or to an EU candidate such as Poland? No, Mr Dyson threatens to go to the Far East. Like so many entrepreneurs, he wants a cheap currency and low interest rates, but also low inflation, low wages, a flexible labour market and low regulation. He will not find them in the eurozone."[26] Lord Tebbit, a former Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, also questioned Dyson's motives and said: "[W]hat still puzzles me is why such a euro-enthusiast as [Mr] Dyson does not intend to establish his new factory in Europe if he can't have it in Britain."[27]
In 2014, Dyson said he would now be voting to leave the European Union to avoid being "dominated and bullied by the Germans".[28] In November 2015, Dyson lost his case against EU energy labelling laws in the European Court of Justice.[29] Dyson was one of the most prominent UK business leaders to publicly support Brexit before the referendum in June 2016.[30] Since the EU referendum, Dyson has stated that Britain should leave the EU Single Market and that this would "liberate" the UK economy.[31]
James Dyson Foundation[edit]




Dyson in 2013 at Sydney, Australia


Dyson set up the Foundation in 2002 to support design and engineering education – it now operates in UK, US and Japan. The Foundation's aim is to inspire young people to study engineering and become engineers by encouraging students to think differently and to make mistakes. The Foundation supports engineering education in schools and universities, as well as medical and scientific research in partnership with charities. It achieves this by funding different resources such as the "Engineering Box", a box filled with activities for a school to use as a teaching aid. The Foundation loans the boxes to schools for four weeks free of charge, they are suitable for Key Stage 4 and above. The Engineering Box enables students to take apart and examine a Dyson DC22 Telescope vacuum cleaner. In addition, a school is allowed to retain a James Dyson Foundation teacher pack, and a copy of Genius of Britain, a Channel 4 TV series featuring Dyson, and design engineering posters. Other resources are also available.
In May 2014, the Foundation announced an £8m donation to create a technology hub at the University of Cambridge. A new four-storey building will house 1,200 postgraduate engineers and support world-leading research. The donation will also allow for a design and making lab to be developed for undergraduate engineering students.[32]
In March 2015, the James Dyson Foundation pledged a £12m donation to Imperial College London to allow the purchase of an iconic Post Office building (located on Exhibition Road) from the Science Museum. Imperial College will open the Dyson School of Design Engineering in this building, and teach a new four-year Masters course in design engineering, developing a new cohort of creative and theoretical engineers.[33]
The Foundation also supports the work of young designers through the James Dyson Award. This is an international design award that "celebrates, encourages and inspires the next generation of design engineers".[34] It is run in twenty countries and is open to recent graduates in product design, industrial design, and engineering.
Honours and awards[edit]
In 1997, Dyson was awarded The Prince Philip Designers Prize.[35] Dyson was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1998 New Year Honours. In 2000, he received the Lord Lloyd of Kilgerran Award. He received an Honorary DEng degree from the University of Bath in 2000.[36] In 2005, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering (FREng).[37] He was appointed a Knight Bachelor in the 2007 New Year Honours. Since 2011 he has been Provost of the Royal College of Art. Dyson was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2015.[2] In the 2016 New Year Honours, Dyson's appointment to the Order of Merit (OM) was announced for "contributions and achievements in industrial design".[38][39] 2017: IEEE Honorary Membership. In March 2017 Dyson was voted the most reputable company in the UK followed by Aston Martin.[40]
Personal life[edit]
Dyson married Deirdre Dyson (née Hindmarsh) in 1968.[1] The couple have three children.[1][41] In 2003, Dyson paid £15 million[citation needed] for Dodington Park,[42] a 300-acre (1.2 km2) Georgian estate in South Gloucestershire close to Chipping Sodbury. He and his wife also own Domaine des Rabelles, near Tourtour, France, and a townhouse in Chelsea, London.[43] His vessel Nahlin is the largest British-flagged and owned super yacht with an LOA of 91 metres (299 ft), and was ranked 36th in a 2013 survey of the world's 100 biggest yachts.[44][45]
Dyson is Provost of the Royal College of Art in London, having succeeded Sir Terence Conran in August 2011,[46] and is Patron of the Design & Technology Association.[47] He was chair of the board of trustees of the Design Museum, "the first in the world to showcase design of the manufactured object", until suddenly resigning in September 2004,[48] stating the museum had "become a style showcase" instead of "upholding its mission to encourage serious design of the manufactured object".

Technologies and other products[edit]
Dyson has developed various technologies in their products, such as the dual cyclone used in vacuum cleaners and their Airblade hand dryers.
Digital motor[edit]
The Dyson digital motor is a DC electric motor operates on the switched reluctance principle[1] used in several pieces of equipment. According to Dyson, it is smaller, lighter, cleaner and more power-efficient (due in part to tight tolerances) than conventional electric motors. These brushless motors rotate at up to 110,000 rpm.[2] The motor is a two-pole brushless motor with a digital controller. Dyson says efficiency is 84%, which is less than the 96% efficiency that is achieved in some brushless designs. In order to deal with the high speed, the impeller is made of carbon-fibre reinforced polymer, the shaft is steel. The first version was named X020 and used in the Airblade hand dryer; the later DDM (Dyson digital motor) V2 is used for Dyson handheld vacuum cleaners.[3]
Airblade hand dryer[edit]
Main article: Dyson Airblade




Dyson Airblade (view from top)


The Dyson Airblade is a hand dryer for commercial customers, typically made available in public hand-washing facilities. The Airblade uses Dyson's Digital Motor to produce a stream of air that flows at up to 430 mph (700 km/h) and is claimed to dry the hands in 10 to 12 seconds.[4][5] The Airblade uses a HEPA filter to remove bacteria and mould from the air. The Dyson Airblade is the world's first hygienic commercial hand dryer according to NSF International; it is accredited by the British Skin Foundation and the Royal Institute of Public Health as well.[6] The Dyson Airblade is HACCP approved. The first Dyson Airblade was launched in 2006
Bladeless fans[edit]
Air Multiplier[edit]




Display of a range of Dyson Air Multipliers


The Dyson Air Multiplier was announced on 18 October 2009 as an electric fan, intended to provide smoother airflow and, having no exposed rotating blades, operating in a safer manner than conventional bladed fans.[7][8] Like other bladeless fans, the apparatus itself has no visible external blades, as the fan blades are concealed within the body of the product. The fan works by drawing 27 litres of air per second[9] in through an inlet in the base pillar and forcing it through an outlet in the upper ring. The jet of air travels over the airfoil shape of the ring, creating local low pressure, thereby pulling air from behind it as it decelerates in a process known as inducement, a property of Bernoulli's principle.[8] Once the air exits the ring it entrains the air in front and alongside, producing an airflow of 405 l/second.[9] Using this process, a small brushless impeller in the fan's base can power a much larger air outlet without exposing any blades.[7]
Dyson stated that the initially generated air flow is multiplied between 15 and 18 times for the models AM01, AM02 and AM03, projecting a smooth stream of uninterrupted air.[10] In March 2014, the second-generation models of the Air Multiplier were acoustically re-engineered so that the bladeless fans were quieter than their predecessors by improved airflow and a Helmholtz resonator to cancel a 10 kHz whine.[11]
Since the original release, Dyson has produced combination electrical heater and cooling fans (some with HEPA filters) based on its Air Multiplier design. In addition, some newer designs have the ability to shift between a wider and shallower or a narrower but farther-reaching stream of air, under user control. Most of the Dyson fans and heaters are controlled by small infrared remote controls, which can be adhered magnetically to the appliance when not in use. A more limited set of control switches is available on the body of the appliance.
The design for a bladeless fan was patented by Toshiba in 1981, but was never manufactured. The initial patent claim by Dyson was rejected by the Intellectual Property Office, ruling that it "cannot be considered novel or cannot be considered to involve an inventive step" compared to the Japanese version.[12]
The Air Multiplier fan received the Good Design Award in 2010.
Fan heater[edit]
In September 2011, Dyson announced the Dyson Hot fan heater (AM04), using Air Multiplier technology. Like most fan heaters it has a thermostat to control the temperature, and can also be used as a fan (without heat). All AM04 models made prior to 1 April 2014 were subject to a no-charge product recall for repairs because of a fire risk.[13]
Ultrasonic humidifier[edit]
In March 2015, Dyson released their new Air Multiplier Humidifier. It uses Ultraviolet Cleanse technology to clean water by running it through ultraviolet light twice before it is released. A piezoelectric transducer in the base vibrates up to 1.7 million times a second to break the water down into small particles which are drawn up and added to the air with air multiplier technology.[14]
Air purifier[edit]
In January 2016, Dyson released the Dyson Pure Cool air purifier. It uses the same air multiplier technology to blow air as well as a .99 micron HEPA filter to trap air particles. Along with the filter to trap slow particles the unit uses low-force velocity to trap fine particles within the filter as well.[15]
Contrarotator washing machine[edit]
 The discontinued Dyson CR01 Contrarotator is a washing machine with two counter-rotating drums, the first of its type. Each drum had 5,000 spin perforations to help evacuate water. The machine was first available in November 2000. Dyson's next washing machine, in 2004, was the CR02, with "Flowcheck" and "Allergy" models. The company later stopped making washing machines the same year, as they were unprofitable for the company.[16] As of November 2012, Dyson no longer supports or services the Contrarotator washing machines, which it has officially declared obsolete.
Hair Dryer[edit]
On 27 April 2016, Dyson introduced the Supersonic handheld hair dryer. The digital motor V9 is housed in the handle.[17]
Lighting[edit]
In 2015 Dyson introduced the "Csys" range of LED lamps. The lamps incorporate heat pipe technology designed to extend the life of the product.
Vacuum cleaners[edit]
Root Cyclone technology[edit]
The Dyson Root Cyclone technology is used in all Dyson vacuum cleaners from DC07. The DC17, DC22, and DC23 use the improved Root Cyclone & Core Separator, also called Radix Cyclone, Intermediary Cyclone, or Level 3 Root Cyclone Technology.
Model versions[edit]
All versions are identified by a name such as "DC14". Some have submodels identified by a suffix indicating specific facilities, implemented sometimes by additional tools supplied. Suffixes with the same meaning vary from model to model.

All Floors, Multi Floor, Wood+Wool: suitable for both hard surfaces and carpets.
Allergy: suitable for filtering out microscopic allergens.
Animal: will pick up animal hairs better than a general-purpose model, and filter out fine particles. These machines all come with a mini turbine tool to help remove pet hair, human hair and cotton fibres from upholstery, cars, and confined areas.
Motorhead: cylinder model with motorised brush head.
Full Gear: same features as "Animal" with more attachments.

Special Edition Models[edit]
Other suffixes sometimes used indicate exclusivity to certain stores, e.g. "Comet Exclusive" and "Overdrive" (Comet) or "Blitz it" (Currys).
Some are limited editions:
"Drawing" limited editions[edit]
These machines feature a different range of tools to the usual "Multifloor" and "Animal" versions and also appear in different colours. The Drawing later became exclusive to John Lewis.
"De Stijl" limited editions[edit]
Some of the early Dyson models (DC01, DC02, DC04) were available in a special limited edition "De Stijl" colour scheme, in homage to the Dutch design movement of the same name. All these are coloured a combination of purple, red and yellow.
"Dyson Antarctic Solo" limited editions[edit]
In 1996, 100,000 recolored DC01 and DC02 models were produced as part of a fund-raising effort for Ranulph Fiennes's solo expedition to the Antarctic. For these models, the yellow parts found on the mainstream models were replaced with light blue ones, and on the DC02 Antarctic Solo the body was also recoloured in white instead of silver.[18]
Discontinued models[edit]
G-Force[edit]
"G-Force" was the name given to Dyson's first widely available vacuum cleaner. It was the first to use "Dual Cyclone" separation technology. Licensed to the Japanese company Apex Inc., and only available on the Japanese market, it was not sold under the Dyson name. Dyson used the money he earned from G-Force to start up the Dyson company.
DC01[edit]
The first vacuum cleaner sold under the Dyson name was the DA001, launched in, 1993. It was a domestic upright model that used the patented "Dual Cyclone" technology and was made in Chippenham, England. After a short period, it was renamed the DC01 and production later moved to Malmesbury, at the company's new factory/research centre.
The DC01 had a single motor which provided the suction and also drove the brushroll directly via a single rubber toothless belt with no form of "brush control" (where the user can turn off the brushroll for use on hard floors), so was mainly designed to use on carpeted floors. It stored its hose on the back of the housing as part of the handle wand, and removing the handle wand enabled this stretch hose to be used. This was the only Dyson upright not to use washable pre-motor filters; these had to be purchased and replaced every 3 months. It also had a choice of post motor filtration – standard or HEPA (High Efficiency Particle Arrest) according to the model purchased. It competed with models like the Hoover Turbopower, and was priced very high in comparison to other bagged cleaners. The suction power of the DC01 is 90 airwatts. Dyson no longer supports this model, nor produces parts for it.
DC02[edit]
The DC02, launched in 1995, was the first cylinder (canister) model sold by Dyson. Its shape allowed it to sit on stairs. Like the DC01, it used Dual Cyclone technology. It was not that popular during its production run and sold fewer than the DC01. The DC02 is no longer supported by Dyson.
The DC02 was available in several special editions:

The De Stijl was colored purple, red and yellow, in homage to the Dutch art movement from which it takes its name. It was produced in a limited edition of 20,000 units.
The DC02 Clear was produced in clear blue and green plastic, allowing the user to see its internal components through the casing.
The Antarctica Solo model, coloured white and pale blue, helped raise funds for the Breakthrough cancer charity, whilst commemorating Sir Ranulph Fiennes's solo trek across Antarctica. Each of the limited edition run of 100,000 machines bore the image of Ranulph Fiennes's autograph.
The Recyclone was the first vacuum cleaner to be made of recycled plastic. Originally intended as a test-run for a range-wide 'Recyclone' scheme, the concept never went beyond a very small production run of DC02s. They were coloured green with organic pigment.

DC03[edit]
The DC03, Dyson's second upright vacuum cleaner, released in 1997, was a lightweight (6.9 kg), low profile upright cleaner. It resembled a twin-cylinder version of the DC01, contained one normal cylinder and a second which contained a pair of HEPA filters. The DC03 had a smaller, more compact 700W motor, and while its suction power was lower than any of the currently available uprights at around 100 Airwatts, its heavy-duty filtration system allowed it to survive for many years after the rest of the original Cyclone cleaners were discontinued. It was the first upright model to feature brush control, via a clutch between the motor and the brushroll, and was able to be stored hung on a wall. It was also the first Dyson to have the Reversible Hose, like on the DC07 and DC24 Ball
DC04[edit]
The DC04, released around 1998, had improved filters fitted as standard. The Pre motor filter was washable and was relocated to the top of the cyclone assembly, and the tools stored on the top of the filter housing. Most models also featured the new clutch controlled brushbar introduced on the DC03.
DC05[edit]
The DC05, launched in 2002, was the second cylinder model. It was designed as a replacement for the DC02. The 'Motorhead' version was the first Dyson to offer a "powernozzle", a floor nozzle with a motor-powered brush-roll for improved performance on carpets.
DC06[edit]
Dyson's first robotic vacuum cleaner, equipped with the Dyson Digital Motor, had not proceeded beyond the home-trial stage by 2012, as cost and weight needed reducing. It had the ability to 'learn' the room, and to distinguish between solid objects, such as walls and furniture, and human beings, pets, etc. by utilising sensors and specially-written navigation software. Dyson DC06 got introduced in 2005.
DC07[edit]




DC07 "Origin" Dyson Vacuum cleaner


The DC07, released in 2001 was the first implementation of Root Cyclone technology into a cleaner. In features it was similar to the DC04, but included a bottom drop bin, controlled by a trigger in the top of the cyclone housing, which made for easier emptying, and the handle wand was also able to be reversed and fitted to the hose cuff at the handle, so making it easier to use than that on the DC04. Many models were fitted with clutch controlled brushbars.
The DC07 had a new 1400W motor that provided 280 Airwatts, making it about the most powerful model that Dyson made, and also the noisiest in use, with much of the operating noise coming from the upwards mounted cyclone assembly. It weighed 9 kg. In the U.S. The Dyson DC07 was sold only at Target. The DC07 had a long production run from 2001 until 2008, and came in many different colour combinations.
DC08[edit]
The DC08 was a new cylinder revision, released around 2002, incorporating the Dyson Root Cyclone technology found on the DC07. The DC08 was the replacement for the DC05. It was the first of the Dyson cylinder models to feature the new "Animal" derivative first seen on the DC07, which essentially meant that the cleaner was capable of dealing effectively with pet hair and dander. Animal models came with an air driven turbine floorhead and mini turbo brush for effective pet hair removal on carpets and furnishings – they also came equipped with Hepa post motor filters.
None of the DC08 models had electric motorised floorheads. Like the DC07, the DC08 was fitted with an uprated motor giving it more suction power, handled by the new root 12 cyclone system the DC08 was equipped with. This higher power output was able to drive the main turbo floorhead without the need for an electric motor and the expensive wiring that the DC05 motorhead had.
Lower models in the DC08 range did not come with the turbine floorhead, having only the standard floorheads which were better suited to hard flooring than carpets. Unlike the DC02, the DC08 did not have storage for its small tools in the body of the cleaner. As with the DC05, tools were stored on a small caddy attached to the suction hose. The DC08 had a long production run; it was upgraded to the DC08 Telescope wrap after the launch of the DC11, to enable it to be stored more efficiently, and was eventually superseded by the DC19.
DC08T[edit]
Next product after the DC11 with 'Telescope Wrap'. Wand handle is telescopic and the hose wraps around the machine. Launched in 2003
DC09, DC10, DC13 omitted[edit]
There are no Dyson models DC09 as the numbers are associated with the DC-9 and DC-10 aircraft produced by McDonnell Douglas. DC13 omitted due to superstition surrounding the number 13.
DC11[edit]
The DC11 was the first Dyson cylinder cleaner with Telescope wrap. Launched around 2003. It had two separate dust bins and cyclone assemblies to make the machine smaller when it was packed away. It was only available in two variants, one coloured yellow and the other was a turquoise/aqua model. The DC11 was quickly superseded by the DC08T Telescope wrap, and not produced for very long.
DC12[edit]
Small cylinder machine released in Japan.Launched near 2005.
DC12plus[edit]
Small cylinders in Japan. Top-of-the-range models are fitted with the Dyson Digital Motor, which rotates at 100,000 rpm.
DC14[edit]
The DC14 was released in 2004. It is a revision of the DC07 upright vacuum cleaner with lower centre of gravity and 'telescope reach'. It uses Dyson's Root 8 Cyclone technology, which maintains constant suction. Aside from the different design of the cyclone assembly and bin, the DC14 looks very similar to the DC07. It also has the same motor as fitted to the DC07 and the same floorhead (with the exception that the DC14 has a large debris channel fitted to the front of the brushroll housing). Due to the different downwards pointing cyclone design, the DC14 was slightly quieter in operation than the DC07 was, but still had the familiar motor noise as it used the same 1400 watt motor. Like the DC07, the DC14 comes in many variants, the standard DC14 (the Origin, non clutched), the All Floors (Clutched), the Allergy (Clutched), the Animal (Clutched, + mini turbine tool) and other special editions and colourways. As of January 2012[update] listed as "End of Line" on Dyson Web site.
DC15[edit]
The DC15, known as The Ball was released in 2005 in three variants, the DC15 All Floors, Allergy and Animal. It was the first of the many "Ball" vacuums, and is based on the DC14. It has a ball instead of wheels which, in conjunction with a universal joint on the cleaner head, makes it possible to steer the machine by twisting the handle to the right or left. The inspiration of the "Ball" system originated from the Ballbarrow, James Dyson's first invention.
The DC15 is a complex machine compared to earlier upright models, and is the first Dyson upright with an independent motorised brushroll, controlled by a switch next to the main power switch. The main suction motor is housed inside the "ball".
Due to its high launch price, its weight (8.6 kilograms (19 lb)), and the fact that it may have initially been seen as a gimmick, not that many DC15s were sold, with the cheaper DC14 remaining much more popular. The lightweight DC18 was launched late the following year, addressing the DC15's biggest criticism, its heavy weight.
DC16 – Dyson Handheld[edit]




DC16 Handheld Cyclonic Vacuum Cleaner


The DC16 is Dyson's first handheld vacuum cleaner based on the same technology as used in the DC14 and DC15 root cyclone upright vacuum cleaners. The DC16 has 36 airwatts of constant suction. The DC16 shares the same styling as the other recent upright and cylinder vacuum cleaners in the Dyson range, and weighs 1.5 kg (3.3 lb).
Also available in an Issey Miyake limited edition in which the manifold on the cyclone assembly is pink instead of the standard yellow, and an Animal version with a motorised brushbar for picking up pet hair and gold cyclone manifold. Newest to the range is the DC16 Car and Boat which is designed for car and boat cleaning, supplied with a car 12 V charger and has a blue cyclone manifold. Launched in 2007.
DC17[edit]
The Dyson DC17 is an upright cleaner launched in October 2006 in the US. Although visually similar to the DC14, it contains new technologies. The first upgrade is the use of Dyson's Level 3 Root Cyclone.[19] This system incorporates 11 cyclones to more efficiently filter sand and dust particles out of the airstream. In this system, the airflow travels from the low speed outer cyclone to two intermediate cyclones that filter out the bulk of dust and sand particles that are drawn into the system. Beyond that, the airflow flows through the remaining eight high speed cyclones which filters any remaining dust particles out of the airstream. The Level 3 Root Cyclone improves upon the original Root Cyclone system with its capability to more efficiently separate sand particles from the air flow, a problem with the earlier system.
The second change with the DC17 upright is the brushroll design. While the brushrolls used on the DC07, DC14 and DC15 were designed with European carpets in mind, the DC17's brush roll was designed for North America with a cylindrical shape, a large diameter, and short stiff bristles. A separate motor drives the brushroll, unlike the DC07 and DC14, which use power from the main motor via clutches. This made the DC17 the most effective of Dyson cleaners on carpeting.
The third change is a new colour scheme for the DC17, and also the Dyson DC16 Root 6 Handheld; the bright colours and silver tones are toned down in favour of shiny metallic accents and titanium as the main colour for the entire machine.[20]
The level 3 root cyclone system on the DC17 was quietly redesigned due to a gasket defect that allowed dirt to enter the cyclones backwards, clogging them and causing the cleaner to lose suction; almost all of the original DC17s had this problem. The redesigned cyclone pack, fitted to later DC17s, resolved this issue. Older DC17s were not recalled, but Dyson gave out and sold many of the redesigned cyclone packs.[citation needed]
DC18[edit]
The 6.6 kilograms (15 lb) Dyson DC18 Slim, launched in September 2006 and produced until summer 2008, is a slimmer and lighter-weight successor of the DC15 Ball upright. The DC18's Root Cyclone system has been trimmed down to better accommodate the machine's slimmer profile; the DC15 uses 8 cyclones, the DC18, 6.
The ball design has been simplified for the DC18: rather than riding on a large ball that encloses the primary motor, the DC18 rides on a thin, cigar-shaped roller that provides more space for separate motor enclosure and airway paths.[21]
DC19[edit]
Cylinder model, without the Telescopic Wrap system. It was the replacement of the DC08, and to all intents and purposes is virtually the same in appearance and design as the DC08.
DC19 T2[edit]
Same as DC19, but improved so that the brushbar can pick up on carpets and on hard floors. This model also used a plastic telescopic rod instead of the metal one found on the original DC19. Still a current model as of November 2012.
DC20[edit]
'Stowaway', as DC19 but with telescope wrap. Dyson have updated the DC08T (part of the DC08) series to form the DC20. Called the Dyson Stowaway in the UK. The colour scheme is new, and the cleaner is available in Standard, Allergy and Animal.
DC21[edit]
Entering into the American Market in 2008, this model is known as the Stowaway in the United States, but as the Motorhead in the United Kingdom and other countries. It is the second cylinder vacuum from Dyson to have a motorised brushbar on the head of the nozzle. It is an advance on the DC08 Telescopic Wrap system, discontinued in some countries including the United Kingdom.
DC22[edit]
Known as "Dyson Baby" or "Dyson Compact" or "Dyson Allergy" and two-thirds the size of the DC23. Using the Dyson Digital Motor and Core Separation which adds a third cyclone 'layer' to filter out smaller particles. Has turbine head and motor head versions.
DC23[edit]
DC23 is similar in design to the DC21 but uses the new Core Separation that is also in the DC22. There is also a turbinehead animal version in Canada.
DC23 T2[edit]
A DC23 with different accessories and tools.
DC24[edit]
A small version of the DC25. Also uses ball technology with separate brushroll motor. It weighs 5.4 kilogrammes (11.9 pounds) and has 115 airwatts of suction power.[22] It is small and compact, and the handle compacts further for easy storage. It appeals to people who prefer a lightweight cleaner. Like the DC25, this model has proved to be a big seller, due to its extremely compact size, but did have quality issues with the brushroll motors, some of which have failed prematurely. Was superseded by the DC50 in November 2012
DC25[edit]
The DC25 is a full size Ball upright, the replacement for the DC15 and DC18. A no-loss-of-suction vacuum features a lifetime washable high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter. The DC25 and the other upright vacuums from Dyson are the only vacuum on the market that has been certified asthma and allergy friendly by the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America. It is available as All Floors (yellow), Animal (purple), Overdrive (blue), Blitz It (red), Exclusive (silver), and Blueprint (white and blue). This vacuum is very similar to the DC15 but on a smaller size, addressing issues brought up with the DC15. Proved to be a very popular ball cleaner, more so than the DC15 and the DC18 (which was not a true ball model). Superseded in mid-2012 by the DC40 and DC41 Animal
DC26[edit]
Ultra compact cylinder model, the DC26, known as the Dyson "City" is the World's smallest vacuum with constant suction. Even smaller than the DC22. The machine is so small that it will fit onto a piece of A4 paper. With a very small dust container of 0.68 litres, and cord length of 5 metres, it was designed for small flats with primarily hard floors. It weighs just 5.6 kg and has an impressive 160 AirWatts suction power.
DC27[edit]
The DC27 is an update on the DC14. The DC27 is a full size upright which has wheels rather than a ball, an auto-adjusting cleaner head and "root-cyclone" technology. It also features an extending wand and hose and has a large debris channel to pick up large dirt particles.[23]
DC28[edit]
This was another upright model produced for the US market. It was the replacement for the DC17. Has a powered cam to adjust the height of the brushbar ("Dyson Airmuscle") controlled from a set of buttons by the main power switch above the cyclone assembly, a pneumatic actuator to keep the cleaning head on the floor, and a high-torque clutch to give extra power to the brushbar.
DC29[edit]
In Australia the DC29 is a cylinder model, an improved version of DC19. Very similar to DC19T2, the main differences being colour and tooling and non-HEPA machine. A HEPA filter is now included in 2012 'Multi-Floor' white models. In Canada, the DC29 is actually an upright model similar to the DC25. This appears to be the first instance of a particular model number being used on an Upright OR a Cylinder depending on country of destination Supplied to Continental Europe and Australia (Cylinder type) and Canada (Upright type) (Not available in the UK). According to this Dyson review listing on the Australian website, the Dyson DC29 Multi floor is no longer available.[24]
DC30[edit]
Powerful handheld with a brushless switched reluctance motor.[25] Can provide 6 minutes of high and constant suction. It is smaller, lighter and more powerful than the DC16, which uses a conventional motor. The DC30 has a yellow cyclone manifold.
DC31[edit]
The most powerful handheld, with the same motor technology as the DC30, but with a larger battery and dual power for more runtime. 10 minutes of high constant suction (at the same level as the DC30) or 6 minutes with 70% higher suction. Available as DC31 with a blue (UK and AUS), yellow (US), or red (EU) cyclone manifold, or the DC31 Animal which has a purple cyclone manifold.
DC32[edit]




Dyson DC32


Basically the same as DC23T2 (in the UK) with a revised color scheme and additional tooling.
Models current as of December 2016[edit]





This section needs to be updated. Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (December 2016)


DC33[edit]
Revised version of the DC27/DC28. Replacement for the DC14, upright wheeled cleaner that does not use ball technology. Available as Multi Floor (Yellow), Stubborn (White), Animal (Purple), i (Red). The DC33 has a plastic telescopic pole with smaller diameter than the metal telescopic pole of the DC14, so attachments from older Dyson's such as the DC14 do not fit the DC33. This model more closely resembles the old DC14 than the DC27 did, using exactly the same style of floorhead as the DC14, DC07 and DC04. The plastic wand pole has been criticised as a lowering of quality from the older metal type, and also causes the main spine of the cleaner to flex more, without the support of the metal wand[citation needed]. The fact that older model's tools were not interchangeable was also criticised, with many buyers trading up from the DC07 or DC14 to the DC33, and finding that their old tools would not fit[citation needed]. The DC33 uses a single motor for the suction and to drive the brushroll via a mechanical clutch as on the DC04, DC07 and DC14. This unit has been discontinued as of July 2013. No replacement model has been announced.
In mainland Europe, the DC33c is a cylinder machine known as the "Allergy Musclehead".[26]
DC34[edit]
Another Handheld model similar to the DC31; launched in 2009.
DC35[edit]

DC40[edit]
The Dyson DC40 upright vacuum released in early 2012. The DC40 vacuum is Dyson's counterpart to the previously released DC41 Animal. The DC40 has Multifloor and Animal editions that utilise the Dyson ball technology.
DC41[edit]
The Dyson DC41 upright released in late 2011 as the replacement for the DC25, is the first upright vacuum with Dyson's new Radial Root Cyclone technology as well as an automatic height adjuster which provides the maximum amount of power in the suction head. The cleaner also has Dyson's new high-powered turbo brush for the hose. The DC41 uses ball technology.
DC42[edit]
A version of the Dyson DC40 offered for sale in Canada.
DC43[edit]
A version of the Dyson DC41 offered for sale in Canada.
DC44[edit]
The Dyson Digital Slim DC44 is Dyson's newest handheld vacuum cleaner which uses the same motorised brush head as the DC35 as well as the Radial Root Cyclone Technology. Has an extension pole to make it similar to a cylinder cleaner's handle, pole and floorhead. Improves on the DC35 by incorporating a more powerful brush bar motor and having more cleaning tools. It is being replaced by Dyson V6 Motor Head Cordless Vacuum.[27]
DC45[edit]
Dyson Digital Slim for Canada and Continental Europe, essentially the same as the DC44
DC46[edit]
Version of the DC47 cylinder model for the Canadian, and the Japanese market.
DC47[edit]
The DC47 was released at the end of 2012, and is an update on the DC38. It is a compact cylinder model based on the technologies featured on the DC38, but introducing the new 2 Tier Radial Root Cyclone Technology for greater suction and filtration, and also the new 2 channel floor tool. It weighs 6 kg and has a suction power of 180 Airwatts.
DC48[edit]
Version of the DC49 cylinder model for the Canadian, and the Japanese market. Launched in 2012.
DC49[edit]
Updated DC47, with more compact design and using the new digital motor v4. Billed by Dyson as its "smallest and quietest vacuum cleaner".
DC50[edit]
The DC50 was released at the end of 2012, and is an update on the DC24. It is a very small and lightweight upright ball cleaner incorporating the technologies introduced on the DC41 (i.e. self-adjusting brushroll), plus the addition of a new brushroll motor mounted inside the brushroll to save on space. The brushroll also incorporates carbon fibre bristles found in the DC35 and DC44 models. It weighs 5.4 kg (11.9 lbs) and has a suction rating of 140 airwatts, with a dirt capacity of 0.8 litres. Also featuring the 2 tier radial cyclone system found on the DC47. In Canada it is called the DC51.
DC51[edit]
A lightweight upright model[28] "with two tiers of smaller cyclones".
DC52[edit]
Version of the DC54 cylinder model for Continental Europe and Singapore[29]
DC54[edit]
Newest ball vacuum cleaner from Dyson. It uses Cinetic technology which Dyson says will not lose suction over 10 years. It is the first Dyson that does not require cleaning of filters. Consists of 54 cyclones with high frequency oscillating tips that vibrate to prevent clogging. Comes in Animal and Multi-Floor versions where it bundles a range of cleaning tools to tackle all surface types.[30]
DC56[edit]
Cordless handheld, powered by Dyson digital motor V2, has 5 cyclones. Weighs 2.92 pounds (1.32 kg), including a 22.2V rechargeable lithium ion battery.
DC58[edit]
Handheld, powered by Dyson digital motor V6, has 15 cyclones.
DC59[edit]
The DC59 replaces the DC44 and is claimed to remove as much dust as a corded vacuum. This is made possible by the combination of the Dyson digital motor V6, 2 Tier Radial cyclones and the latest floor tool with carbon fibre filaments. This power-dense motor uses digital pulse technology and a neodymium magnet to spin at up to 110,000 times a minute. Its small size means that the machines it powers can also be small, light and powerful.
DC61[edit]
For specific markets (e.g. Singapore); based on the V6; Handheld Version; very similar to the DC59.
DC62[edit]
For specific markets (e.g. Canada, Singapore, Continental Europe); based on the V6; very similar to the DC59.
DC63[edit]
DC63 is a small Ball Vacuum. Launched in 2014.It powered by the Dyson Digital Motor V4. It has 2 Tier Radial Root Cyclones.
DC65[edit]
The DC65 (DC66 in Canada)—released in early 2014—is an update of the DC41. The vacuum features an updated root cyclone and a redesigned brush roll with more power than the DC41 and a better edge cleaning system. It also includes the same Tangle-Free Turbine Tool.
Dyson Cinetic[edit]
The Dyson Cinetic canister vacuum features Dyson's new Cinetic technology which never needs filters replaced.[31] This is an updated version of the DC54 canister and is the first to break the "DC" numbering system of previous units in most markets (in Canada it is named DC78).
DC75 – Dyson Cinetic Big Ball[edit]
Launched in 2015, the DC75 (DC77 in Canada) is Dyson's upright version of the Cinetic vacuum. Contains Cinetic technology which never requires changing filters as well as Dyson's auto adjusting power brushroll and Tangle-Free Turbine Tool.
Dyson V6[edit]
Dyson cordless vacuums are powered by the Dyson digital motor. This power-dense motor uses digital pulse technology and a neodymium magnet to spin at up to 110,000 times a minute. Its small size means that the machines it powers can also be small, light and powerful. The Dyson brand, as well as various reviews, claim that the V6 can have up to a 20-minute run time.[32][33] The Dyson V6 replaced the Dyson DC59.[34][35][36]
Dyson V8[edit]
Introduced in 2016, the Dyson V8 is an updated version of the V6 with better battery life(up to 40 mins without the brush heads), modifications to the debris emptying process, and reported quieter operation than its predecessor due to a different noise frequency and noise dampening post motor filter. 28 Air watts on normal power and 115 in turbo mode. Their motorized floor heads are driven by their own separate motors.
Dyson 360 Eye[edit]
The Dyson 360 Eye, a floor cleaning robot, uses a 360° panoramic vision camera and IR distance sensors to map a room and navigate, enabling it to perform a systematic cleaning pattern that covers the accessible floor area only once. Launched in 2014, Dyson's initial entry into this market segment also features cyclonic dust separation, a Dyson digital motor V2 for high power suction, tank treads for traction, a full-width brush-bar, and user interface via a free iOS or Android app.[37]

Early life and education[edit]
James Dyson was born in Cromer, Norfolk, one of three children. He was educated at Gresham's School,[1] an independent boarding school in Holt, Norfolk, from 1956 to 1965, when his father died of cancer.[6] He excelled at long distance running: "I was quite good at it, not because I was physically good, but because I had more determination. I learnt determination from it."[7] He spent one year (1965–1966) at the Byam Shaw School of Art, and then studied furniture and interior design at the Royal College of Art (1966–1970) before moving into engineering.
Early inventions[edit]
Dyson helped design the Sea Truck in 1970 while studying at the Royal College of Art. His first original invention, the Ballbarrow, was a modified version of a wheelbarrow using a ball instead of a wheel. This was featured on the BBC's Tomorrow's World television programme. Dyson stuck with the idea of a ball, which his brother had thought of, inventing the Trolleyball, a trolley that launched boats. He then designed the Wheelboat,[8] which could travel at speeds of 64 kilometres per hour (40 mph) on both land and water.
Vacuum cleaners[edit]




DC07 bagless Dyson vacuum cleaner


In the late 1970s, Dyson had the idea of using cyclonic separation to create a vacuum cleaner that would not lose suction as it picked up dirt. He became frustrated with his Hoover Junior's diminishing performance: the dust bag kept becoming clogged with loads of dust thus reducing suction.[9] The cyclone idea came from a sawmill that used cyclone technology (qv. History of Dyson Ltd).[10]
Partly supported by his wife's salary as an art teacher, and after five years and many prototypes, Dyson launched the "G-Force" cleaner in 1983. However, no manufacturer or distributor would handle his product in the UK, as it would disturb the valuable market for replacement dust bags, so Dyson launched it in Japan through catalogue sales.[11] Manufactured in bright pink, the G-Force sold for the equivalent of £2,000. It won the 1991 International Design Fair Prize in Japan. He obtained his first US patent on the idea in 1986 (U.S. Patent 4,593,429).
After failing to sell his invention to the major manufacturers, Dyson set up his own manufacturing company, Dyson Ltd. In June 1993, he opened his research centre and factory in Malmesbury, Wiltshire.
Dyson's breakthrough in the UK market came more than ten years after the initial idea, through a TV advertising campaign in which it was emphasised that, unlike most of its rivals, the Dyson vacuum did not require the continuing purchase of replacement bags. At that time, the UK market for disposable cleaner bags was £100 million. The slogan "say goodbye to the bag" proved more attractive to the buying public than a previous emphasis on the suction efficiency that its technology delivers. Ironically, the previous step change in domestic vacuum cleaner design had been the introduction of the disposable bag – users being prepared to pay extra for the convenience. The Dyson Dual Cyclone became the fastest-selling vacuum cleaner ever made in the UK, and outsold those of some of the companies that rejected his idea, becoming one of the most popular brands in the UK.[12] In early 2005, it was reported that Dyson cleaners had become the market leaders in the United States by value (though not by number of units sold).
Dyson licensed the technology in North America from 1986 to 2001 to Fantom Technologies, after which Dyson entered the market directly.
Following his success, other major manufacturers began to market their own cyclonic vacuum cleaners. In 1999 Dyson sued Hoover (UK) for patent infringement. The High Court ruled that Hoover had deliberately copied a fundamental part of his patented designs in making its Triple Vortex bagless vacuum cleaner range.[13] Hoover agreed to pay damages of £4 million.
In 2005, Dyson incorporated the wheel ball from his Ballbarrow concept into a vacuum cleaner, creating the Dyson Ball, with the aim of making it more manoeuvrable.
In mid-2014, Dyson personally appeared in Tokyo to introduce his "360 Eye" robotic vacuum cleaner. Dyson's initial entry into this market segment features 360° scanning and mapping for navigation, cyclonic dust separation, a custom-designed digital motor for high suction, tank treads for traction, a full-width beater bar, and user interface via a free iOS or Android app.[14]
Other inventions[edit]
In 2000, Dyson expanded his appliance range to include a washing machine called the ContraRotator, which had two rotating drums moving in opposite directions. The range was decorated in the usual bright Dyson colours, rather than the traditional white, grey or black of most other machines. The item was not a commercial success and is no longer available.[15]
In 2002, Dyson created a realisation of the optical illusions depicted in the lithographs of Dutch artist M. C. Escher. Engineer Derek Phillips was able to accomplish the task after a year of work, creating a water sculpture in which the water appears to flow up to the tops of four ramps arranged in a square, before cascading to the bottom of the next ramp. The creation titled Wrong Garden,[16] was displayed at the Chelsea Flower Show in 2003.[17] The illusion is accomplished with water containing air bubbles pumped through a chamber underneath the transparent glass ramps to a slit at the top from which the bulk of the water cascades down. This makes it appear that the water is flowing up, when really, a small amount of water diverted from the slit at the top flows back down the ramps in a thin layer.




Dyson Airblade hand dryer


In October 2006 Dyson launched the Dyson Airblade, a fast hand dryer that uses a thin sheet of moving air as a squeegee to remove water, rather than attempting to evaporate it with heat. This allows faster drying, while using much less energy than traditional electrical hand dryers.
Another product is a fan without external blades, which he calls the "Air Multiplier".[18] In addition to a cooling fan, a model which distributes electrically produced heat and an ultrasonic humidifier model are also available.
In April 2016, Dyson launched the Dyson Supersonic, a hair dryer with a smaller motor located in the handle so as to provide better balance and smaller size, as well as quieter operation.[19] Commenting on the launch Vogue magazine said "as the first product to launch from Dyson's new UK state-of-the-art hair laboratory, we have high hopes for the future of our blow-dries."[20]
Manufacturing[edit]
In February 2002, Dyson announced that production was being shifted to Malaysia leaving 560[21] workers redundant in 2002 for economic reasons and because of difficulty acquiring land for expansion. The company's headquarters and research facilities remain in Malmesbury.
In November 2014, Dyson announced plans to invest a further £1.5bn into the research and development of new technology, including funding for a campus at the Dyson UK headquarters in Malmesbury which will create up to 3,000 jobs.[22]
Former Prime Minister David Cameron, said: “Dyson is a great British success story and the expansion of the Malmesbury campus will create thousands of new jobs, providing a real boost to the local economy and financial security for more hardworking families. Investment on this scale shows confidence in our long-term economic plan to back business, create more jobs and secure a brighter future for Britain.”[23]
European single currency[edit]

In 1998, Dyson was one of the chairmen and chief executives of the twenty FTSE 100 companies who signed a statement published in The Financial Times in 1998 calling on the government for early British membership of the Eurozone.[24] He claimed that failure to join the euro would lead to the destruction of the British manufacturing base and said: "It does not mean that the jobs will go tomorrow but will drift abroad over a period and the longer-term future of Britain as a manufacturing nation will be blighted. Ministers had better understand that if we delay entry too long there may be nothing left to save."[25]
An editorial published by The Times responded: "Mr Dyson, a manufacturing version of Sir Richard Branson, likes complaining. Yesterday he was complaining that Britain's failure to join the Euro and the resultant strong Pound will force him to move abroad. Last week he blamed the price of land and planning delays in Wiltshire, but never mind. So where will he go? To Portugal, Italy or to an EU candidate such as Poland? No, Mr Dyson threatens to go to the Far East. Like so many entrepreneurs, he wants a cheap currency and low interest rates, but also low inflation, low wages, a flexible labour market and low regulation. He will not find them in the eurozone."[26] Lord Tebbit, a former Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, also questioned Dyson's motives and said: "[W]hat still puzzles me is why such a euro-enthusiast as [Mr] Dyson does not intend to establish his new factory in Europe if he can't have it in Britain."[27]
In 2014, Dyson said he would now be voting to leave the European Union to avoid being "dominated and bullied by the Germans".[28] In November 2015, Dyson lost his case against EU energy labelling laws in the European Court of Justice.[29] Dyson was one of the most prominent UK business leaders to publicly support Brexit before the referendum in June 2016.[30] Since the EU referendum, Dyson has stated that Britain should leave the EU Single Market and that this would "liberate" the UK economy.[31]
James Dyson Foundation[edit]




Dyson in 2013 at Sydney, Australia


Dyson set up the Foundation in 2002 to support design and engineering education – it now operates in UK, US and Japan. The Foundation's aim is to inspire young people to study engineering and become engineers by encouraging students to think differently and to make mistakes. The Foundation supports engineering education in schools and universities, as well as medical and scientific research in partnership with charities. It achieves this by funding different resources such as the "Engineering Box", a box filled with activities for a school to use as a teaching aid. The Foundation loans the boxes to schools for four weeks free of charge, they are suitable for Key Stage 4 and above. The Engineering Box enables students to take apart and examine a Dyson DC22 Telescope vacuum cleaner. In addition, a school is allowed to retain a James Dyson Foundation teacher pack, and a copy of Genius of Britain, a Channel 4 TV series featuring Dyson, and design engineering posters. Other resources are also available.
In May 2014, the Foundation announced an £8m donation to create a technology hub at the University of Cambridge. A new four-storey building will house 1,200 postgraduate engineers and support world-leading research. The donation will also allow for a design and making lab to be developed for undergraduate engineering students.[32]
In March 2015, the James Dyson Foundation pledged a £12m donation to Imperial College London to allow the purchase of an iconic Post Office building (located on Exhibition Road) from the Science Museum. Imperial College will open the Dyson School of Design Engineering in this building, and teach a new four-year Masters course in design engineering, developing a new cohort of creative and theoretical engineers.[33]
The Foundation also supports the work of young designers through the James Dyson Award. This is an international design award that "celebrates, encourages and inspires the next generation of design engineers".[34] It is run in twenty countries and is open to recent graduates in product design, industrial design, and engineering.
Honours and awards[edit]
In 1997, Dyson was awarded The Prince Philip Designers Prize.[35] Dyson was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1998 New Year Honours. In 2000, he received the Lord Lloyd of Kilgerran Award. He received an Honorary DEng degree from the University of Bath in 2000.[36] In 2005, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering (FREng).[37] He was appointed a Knight Bachelor in the 2007 New Year Honours. Since 2011 he has been Provost of the Royal College of Art. Dyson was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2015.[2] In the 2016 New Year Honours, Dyson's appointment to the Order of Merit (OM) was announced for "contributions and achievements in industrial design".[38][39] 2017: IEEE Honorary Membership. In March 2017 Dyson was voted the most reputable company in the UK followed by Aston Martin.[40]
Personal life[edit]
Dyson married Deirdre Dyson (née Hindmarsh) in 1968.[1] The couple have three children.[1][41] In 2003, Dyson paid £15 million[citation needed] for Dodington Park,[42] a 300-acre (1.2 km2) Georgian estate in South Gloucestershire close to Chipping Sodbury. He and his wife also own Domaine des Rabelles, near Tourtour, France, and a townhouse in Chelsea, London.[43] His vessel Nahlin is the largest British-flagged and owned super yacht with an LOA of 91 metres (299 ft), and was ranked 36th in a 2013 survey of the world's 100 biggest yachts.[44][45]
Dyson is Provost of the Royal College of Art in London, having succeeded Sir Terence Conran in August 2011,[46] and is Patron of the Design & Technology Association.[47] He was chair of the board of trustees of the Design Museum, "the first in the world to showcase design of the manufactured object", until suddenly resigning in September 2004,[48] stating the museum had "become a style showcase" instead of "upholding its mission to encourage serious design of the manufactured object".

Technologies and other products[edit]
Dyson has developed various technologies in their products, such as the dual cyclone used in vacuum cleaners and their Airblade hand dryers.
Digital motor[edit]
The Dyson digital motor is a DC electric motor operates on the switched reluctance principle[1] used in several pieces of equipment. According to Dyson, it is smaller, lighter, cleaner and more power-efficient (due in part to tight tolerances) than conventional electric motors. These brushless motors rotate at up to 110,000 rpm.[2] The motor is a two-pole brushless motor with a digital controller. Dyson says efficiency is 84%, which is less than the 96% efficiency that is achieved in some brushless designs. In order to deal with the high speed, the impeller is made of carbon-fibre reinforced polymer, the shaft is steel. The first version was named X020 and used in the Airblade hand dryer; the later DDM (Dyson digital motor) V2 is used for Dyson handheld vacuum cleaners.[3]
Airblade hand dryer[edit]
Main article: Dyson Airblade




Dyson Airblade (view from top)


The Dyson Airblade is a hand dryer for commercial customers, typically made available in public hand-washing facilities. The Airblade uses Dyson's Digital Motor to produce a stream of air that flows at up to 430 mph (700 km/h) and is claimed to dry the hands in 10 to 12 seconds.[4][5] The Airblade uses a HEPA filter to remove bacteria and mould from the air. The Dyson Airblade is the world's first hygienic commercial hand dryer according to NSF International; it is accredited by the British Skin Foundation and the Royal Institute of Public Health as well.[6] The Dyson Airblade is HACCP approved. The first Dyson Airblade was launched in 2006
Bladeless fans[edit]
Air Multiplier[edit]




Display of a range of Dyson Air Multipliers


The Dyson Air Multiplier was announced on 18 October 2009 as an electric fan, intended to provide smoother airflow and, having no exposed rotating blades, operating in a safer manner than conventional bladed fans.[7][8] Like other bladeless fans, the apparatus itself has no visible external blades, as the fan blades are concealed within the body of the product. The fan works by drawing 27 litres of air per second[9] in through an inlet in the base pillar and forcing it through an outlet in the upper ring. The jet of air travels over the airfoil shape of the ring, creating local low pressure, thereby pulling air from behind it as it decelerates in a process known as inducement, a property of Bernoulli's principle.[8] Once the air exits the ring it entrains the air in front and alongside, producing an airflow of 405 l/second.[9] Using this process, a small brushless impeller in the fan's base can power a much larger air outlet without exposing any blades.[7]
Dyson stated that the initially generated air flow is multiplied between 15 and 18 times for the models AM01, AM02 and AM03, projecting a smooth stream of uninterrupted air.[10] In March 2014, the second-generation models of the Air Multiplier were acoustically re-engineered so that the bladeless fans were quieter than their predecessors by improved airflow and a Helmholtz resonator to cancel a 10 kHz whine.[11]
Since the original release, Dyson has produced combination electrical heater and cooling fans (some with HEPA filters) based on its Air Multiplier design. In addition, some newer designs have the ability to shift between a wider and shallower or a narrower but farther-reaching stream of air, under user control. Most of the Dyson fans and heaters are controlled by small infrared remote controls, which can be adhered magnetically to the appliance when not in use. A more limited set of control switches is available on the body of the appliance.
The design for a bladeless fan was patented by Toshiba in 1981, but was never manufactured. The initial patent claim by Dyson was rejected by the Intellectual Property Office, ruling that it "cannot be considered novel or cannot be considered to involve an inventive step" compared to the Japanese version.[12]
The Air Multiplier fan received the Good Design Award in 2010.
Fan heater[edit]
In September 2011, Dyson announced the Dyson Hot fan heater (AM04), using Air Multiplier technology. Like most fan heaters it has a thermostat to control the temperature, and can also be used as a fan (without heat). All AM04 models made prior to 1 April 2014 were subject to a no-charge product recall for repairs because of a fire risk.[13]
Ultrasonic humidifier[edit]
In March 2015, Dyson released their new Air Multiplier Humidifier. It uses Ultraviolet Cleanse technology to clean water by running it through ultraviolet light twice before it is released. A piezoelectric transducer in the base vibrates up to 1.7 million times a second to break the water down into small particles which are drawn up and added to the air with air multiplier technology.[14]
Air purifier[edit]
In January 2016, Dyson released the Dyson Pure Cool air purifier. It uses the same air multiplier technology to blow air as well as a .99 micron HEPA filter to trap air particles. Along with the filter to trap slow particles the unit uses low-force velocity to trap fine particles within the filter as well.[15]
Contrarotator washing machine[edit]
 The discontinued Dyson CR01 Contrarotator is a washing machine with two counter-rotating drums, the first of its type. Each drum had 5,000 spin perforations to help evacuate water. The machine was first available in November 2000. Dyson's next washing machine, in 2004, was the CR02, with "Flowcheck" and "Allergy" models. The company later stopped making washing machines the same year, as they were unprofitable for the company.[16] As of November 2012, Dyson no longer supports or services the Contrarotator washing machines, which it has officially declared obsolete.
Hair Dryer[edit]
On 27 April 2016, Dyson introduced the Supersonic handheld hair dryer. The digital motor V9 is housed in the handle.[17]
Lighting[edit]
In 2015 Dyson introduced the "Csys" range of LED lamps. The lamps incorporate heat pipe technology designed to extend the life of the product.
Vacuum cleaners[edit]
Root Cyclone technology[edit]
The Dyson Root Cyclone technology is used in all Dyson vacuum cleaners from DC07. The DC17, DC22, and DC23 use the improved Root Cyclone & Core Separator, also called Radix Cyclone, Intermediary Cyclone, or Level 3 Root Cyclone Technology.
Model versions[edit]
All versions are identified by a name such as "DC14". Some have submodels identified by a suffix indicating specific facilities, implemented sometimes by additional tools supplied. Suffixes with the same meaning vary from model to model.

All Floors, Multi Floor, Wood+Wool: suitable for both hard surfaces and carpets.
Allergy: suitable for filtering out microscopic allergens.
Animal: will pick up animal hairs better than a general-purpose model, and filter out fine particles. These machines all come with a mini turbine tool to help remove pet hair, human hair and cotton fibres from upholstery, cars, and confined areas.
Motorhead: cylinder model with motorised brush head.
Full Gear: same features as "Animal" with more attachments.

Special Edition Models[edit]
Other suffixes sometimes used indicate exclusivity to certain stores, e.g. "Comet Exclusive" and "Overdrive" (Comet) or "Blitz it" (Currys).
Some are limited editions:
"Drawing" limited editions[edit]
These machines feature a different range of tools to the usual "Multifloor" and "Animal" versions and also appear in different colours. The Drawing later became exclusive to John Lewis.
"De Stijl" limited editions[edit]
Some of the early Dyson models (DC01, DC02, DC04) were available in a special limited edition "De Stijl" colour scheme, in homage to the Dutch design movement of the same name. All these are coloured a combination of purple, red and yellow.
"Dyson Antarctic Solo" limited editions[edit]
In 1996, 100,000 recolored DC01 and DC02 models were produced as part of a fund-raising effort for Ranulph Fiennes's solo expedition to the Antarctic. For these models, the yellow parts found on the mainstream models were replaced with light blue ones, and on the DC02 Antarctic Solo the body was also recoloured in white instead of silver.[18]
Discontinued models[edit]
G-Force[edit]
"G-Force" was the name given to Dyson's first widely available vacuum cleaner. It was the first to use "Dual Cyclone" separation technology. Licensed to the Japanese company Apex Inc., and only available on the Japanese market, it was not sold under the Dyson name. Dyson used the money he earned from G-Force to start up the Dyson company.
DC01[edit]
The first vacuum cleaner sold under the Dyson name was the DA001, launched in, 1993. It was a domestic upright model that used the patented "Dual Cyclone" technology and was made in Chippenham, England. After a short period, it was renamed the DC01 and production later moved to Malmesbury, at the company's new factory/research centre.
The DC01 had a single motor which provided the suction and also drove the brushroll directly via a single rubber toothless belt with no form of "brush control" (where the user can turn off the brushroll for use on hard floors), so was mainly designed to use on carpeted floors. It stored its hose on the back of the housing as part of the handle wand, and removing the handle wand enabled this stretch hose to be used. This was the only Dyson upright not to use washable pre-motor filters; these had to be purchased and replaced every 3 months. It also had a choice of post motor filtration – standard or HEPA (High Efficiency Particle Arrest) according to the model purchased. It competed with models like the Hoover Turbopower, and was priced very high in comparison to other bagged cleaners. The suction power of the DC01 is 90 airwatts. Dyson no longer supports this model, nor produces parts for it.
DC02[edit]
The DC02, launched in 1995, was the first cylinder (canister) model sold by Dyson. Its shape allowed it to sit on stairs. Like the DC01, it used Dual Cyclone technology. It was not that popular during its production run and sold fewer than the DC01. The DC02 is no longer supported by Dyson.
The DC02 was available in several special editions:

The De Stijl was colored purple, red and yellow, in homage to the Dutch art movement from which it takes its name. It was produced in a limited edition of 20,000 units.
The DC02 Clear was produced in clear blue and green plastic, allowing the user to see its internal components through the casing.
The Antarctica Solo model, coloured white and pale blue, helped raise funds for the Breakthrough cancer charity, whilst commemorating Sir Ranulph Fiennes's solo trek across Antarctica. Each of the limited edition run of 100,000 machines bore the image of Ranulph Fiennes's autograph.
The Recyclone was the first vacuum cleaner to be made of recycled plastic. Originally intended as a test-run for a range-wide 'Recyclone' scheme, the concept never went beyond a very small production run of DC02s. They were coloured green with organic pigment.

DC03[edit]
The DC03, Dyson's second upright vacuum cleaner, released in 1997, was a lightweight (6.9 kg), low profile upright cleaner. It resembled a twin-cylinder version of the DC01, contained one normal cylinder and a second which contained a pair of HEPA filters. The DC03 had a smaller, more compact 700W motor, and while its suction power was lower than any of the currently available uprights at around 100 Airwatts, its heavy-duty filtration system allowed it to survive for many years after the rest of the original Cyclone cleaners were discontinued. It was the first upright model to feature brush control, via a clutch between the motor and the brushroll, and was able to be stored hung on a wall. It was also the first Dyson to have the Reversible Hose, like on the DC07 and DC24 Ball
DC04[edit]
The DC04, released around 1998, had improved filters fitted as standard. The Pre motor filter was washable and was relocated to the top of the cyclone assembly, and the tools stored on the top of the filter housing. Most models also featured the new clutch controlled brushbar introduced on the DC03.
DC05[edit]
The DC05, launched in 2002, was the second cylinder model. It was designed as a replacement for the DC02. The 'Motorhead' version was the first Dyson to offer a "powernozzle", a floor nozzle with a motor-powered brush-roll for improved performance on carpets.
DC06[edit]
Dyson's first robotic vacuum cleaner, equipped with the Dyson Digital Motor, had not proceeded beyond the home-trial stage by 2012, as cost and weight needed reducing. It had the ability to 'learn' the room, and to distinguish between solid objects, such as walls and furniture, and human beings, pets, etc. by utilising sensors and specially-written navigation software. Dyson DC06 got introduced in 2005.
DC07[edit]




DC07 "Origin" Dyson Vacuum cleaner


The DC07, released in 2001 was the first implementation of Root Cyclone technology into a cleaner. In features it was similar to the DC04, but included a bottom drop bin, controlled by a trigger in the top of the cyclone housing, which made for easier emptying, and the handle wand was also able to be reversed and fitted to the hose cuff at the handle, so making it easier to use than that on the DC04. Many models were fitted with clutch controlled brushbars.
The DC07 had a new 1400W motor that provided 280 Airwatts, making it about the most powerful model that Dyson made, and also the noisiest in use, with much of the operating noise coming from the upwards mounted cyclone assembly. It weighed 9 kg. In the U.S. The Dyson DC07 was sold only at Target. The DC07 had a long production run from 2001 until 2008, and came in many different colour combinations.
DC08[edit]
The DC08 was a new cylinder revision, released around 2002, incorporating the Dyson Root Cyclone technology found on the DC07. The DC08 was the replacement for the DC05. It was the first of the Dyson cylinder models to feature the new "Animal" derivative first seen on the DC07, which essentially meant that the cleaner was capable of dealing effectively with pet hair and dander. Animal models came with an air driven turbine floorhead and mini turbo brush for effective pet hair removal on carpets and furnishings – they also came equipped with Hepa post motor filters.
None of the DC08 models had electric motorised floorheads. Like the DC07, the DC08 was fitted with an uprated motor giving it more suction power, handled by the new root 12 cyclone system the DC08 was equipped with. This higher power output was able to drive the main turbo floorhead without the need for an electric motor and the expensive wiring that the DC05 motorhead had.
Lower models in the DC08 range did not come with the turbine floorhead, having only the standard floorheads which were better suited to hard flooring than carpets. Unlike the DC02, the DC08 did not have storage for its small tools in the body of the cleaner. As with the DC05, tools were stored on a small caddy attached to the suction hose. The DC08 had a long production run; it was upgraded to the DC08 Telescope wrap after the launch of the DC11, to enable it to be stored more efficiently, and was eventually superseded by the DC19.
DC08T[edit]
Next product after the DC11 with 'Telescope Wrap'. Wand handle is telescopic and the hose wraps around the machine. Launched in 2003
DC09, DC10, DC13 omitted[edit]
There are no Dyson models DC09 as the numbers are associated with the DC-9 and DC-10 aircraft produced by McDonnell Douglas. DC13 omitted due to superstition surrounding the number 13.
DC11[edit]
The DC11 was the first Dyson cylinder cleaner with Telescope wrap. Launched around 2003. It had two separate dust bins and cyclone assemblies to make the machine smaller when it was packed away. It was only available in two variants, one coloured yellow and the other was a turquoise/aqua model. The DC11 was quickly superseded by the DC08T Telescope wrap, and not produced for very long.
DC12[edit]
Small cylinder machine released in Japan.Launched near 2005.
DC12plus[edit]
Small cylinders in Japan. Top-of-the-range models are fitted with the Dyson Digital Motor, which rotates at 100,000 rpm.
DC14[edit]
The DC14 was released in 2004. It is a revision of the DC07 upright vacuum cleaner with lower centre of gravity and 'telescope reach'. It uses Dyson's Root 8 Cyclone technology, which maintains constant suction. Aside from the different design of the cyclone assembly and bin, the DC14 looks very similar to the DC07. It also has the same motor as fitted to the DC07 and the same floorhead (with the exception that the DC14 has a large debris channel fitted to the front of the brushroll housing). Due to the different downwards pointing cyclone design, the DC14 was slightly quieter in operation than the DC07 was, but still had the familiar motor noise as it used the same 1400 watt motor. Like the DC07, the DC14 comes in many variants, the standard DC14 (the Origin, non clutched), the All Floors (Clutched), the Allergy (Clutched), the Animal (Clutched, + mini turbine tool) and other special editions and colourways. As of January 2012[update] listed as "End of Line" on Dyson Web site.
DC15[edit]
The DC15, known as The Ball was released in 2005 in three variants, the DC15 All Floors, Allergy and Animal. It was the first of the many "Ball" vacuums, and is based on the DC14. It has a ball instead of wheels which, in conjunction with a universal joint on the cleaner head, makes it possible to steer the machine by twisting the handle to the right or left. The inspiration of the "Ball" system originated from the Ballbarrow, James Dyson's first invention.
The DC15 is a complex machine compared to earlier upright models, and is the first Dyson upright with an independent motorised brushroll, controlled by a switch next to the main power switch. The main suction motor is housed inside the "ball".
Due to its high launch price, its weight (8.6 kilograms (19 lb)), and the fact that it may have initially been seen as a gimmick, not that many DC15s were sold, with the cheaper DC14 remaining much more popular. The lightweight DC18 was launched late the following year, addressing the DC15's biggest criticism, its heavy weight.
DC16 – Dyson Handheld[edit]




DC16 Handheld Cyclonic Vacuum Cleaner


The DC16 is Dyson's first handheld vacuum cleaner based on the same technology as used in the DC14 and DC15 root cyclone upright vacuum cleaners. The DC16 has 36 airwatts of constant suction. The DC16 shares the same styling as the other recent upright and cylinder vacuum cleaners in the Dyson range, and weighs 1.5 kg (3.3 lb).
Also available in an Issey Miyake limited edition in which the manifold on the cyclone assembly is pink instead of the standard yellow, and an Animal version with a motorised brushbar for picking up pet hair and gold cyclone manifold. Newest to the range is the DC16 Car and Boat which is designed for car and boat cleaning, supplied with a car 12 V charger and has a blue cyclone manifold. Launched in 2007.
DC17[edit]
The Dyson DC17 is an upright cleaner launched in October 2006 in the US. Although visually similar to the DC14, it contains new technologies. The first upgrade is the use of Dyson's Level 3 Root Cyclone.[19] This system incorporates 11 cyclones to more efficiently filter sand and dust particles out of the airstream. In this system, the airflow travels from the low speed outer cyclone to two intermediate cyclones that filter out the bulk of dust and sand particles that are drawn into the system. Beyond that, the airflow flows through the remaining eight high speed cyclones which filters any remaining dust particles out of the airstream. The Level 3 Root Cyclone improves upon the original Root Cyclone system with its capability to more efficiently separate sand particles from the air flow, a problem with the earlier system.
The second change with the DC17 upright is the brushroll design. While the brushrolls used on the DC07, DC14 and DC15 were designed with European carpets in mind, the DC17's brush roll was designed for North America with a cylindrical shape, a large diameter, and short stiff bristles. A separate motor drives the brushroll, unlike the DC07 and DC14, which use power from the main motor via clutches. This made the DC17 the most effective of Dyson cleaners on carpeting.
The third change is a new colour scheme for the DC17, and also the Dyson DC16 Root 6 Handheld; the bright colours and silver tones are toned down in favour of shiny metallic accents and titanium as the main colour for the entire machine.[20]
The level 3 root cyclone system on the DC17 was quietly redesigned due to a gasket defect that allowed dirt to enter the cyclones backwards, clogging them and causing the cleaner to lose suction; almost all of the original DC17s had this problem. The redesigned cyclone pack, fitted to later DC17s, resolved this issue. Older DC17s were not recalled, but Dyson gave out and sold many of the redesigned cyclone packs.[citation needed]
DC18[edit]
The 6.6 kilograms (15 lb) Dyson DC18 Slim, launched in September 2006 and produced until summer 2008, is a slimmer and lighter-weight successor of the DC15 Ball upright. The DC18's Root Cyclone system has been trimmed down to better accommodate the machine's slimmer profile; the DC15 uses 8 cyclones, the DC18, 6.
The ball design has been simplified for the DC18: rather than riding on a large ball that encloses the primary motor, the DC18 rides on a thin, cigar-shaped roller that provides more space for separate motor enclosure and airway paths.[21]
DC19[edit]
Cylinder model, without the Telescopic Wrap system. It was the replacement of the DC08, and to all intents and purposes is virtually the same in appearance and design as the DC08.
DC19 T2[edit]
Same as DC19, but improved so that the brushbar can pick up on carpets and on hard floors. This model also used a plastic telescopic rod instead of the metal one found on the original DC19. Still a current model as of November 2012.
DC20[edit]
'Stowaway', as DC19 but with telescope wrap. Dyson have updated the DC08T (part of the DC08) series to form the DC20. Called the Dyson Stowaway in the UK. The colour scheme is new, and the cleaner is available in Standard, Allergy and Animal.
DC21[edit]
Entering into the American Market in 2008, this model is known as the Stowaway in the United States, but as the Motorhead in the United Kingdom and other countries. It is the second cylinder vacuum from Dyson to have a motorised brushbar on the head of the nozzle. It is an advance on the DC08 Telescopic Wrap system, discontinued in some countries including the United Kingdom.
DC22[edit]
Known as "Dyson Baby" or "Dyson Compact" or "Dyson Allergy" and two-thirds the size of the DC23. Using the Dyson Digital Motor and Core Separation which adds a third cyclone 'layer' to filter out smaller particles. Has turbine head and motor head versions.
DC23[edit]
DC23 is similar in design to the DC21 but uses the new Core Separation that is also in the DC22. There is also a turbinehead animal version in Canada.
DC23 T2[edit]
A DC23 with different accessories and tools.
DC24[edit]
A small version of the DC25. Also uses ball technology with separate brushroll motor. It weighs 5.4 kilogrammes (11.9 pounds) and has 115 airwatts of suction power.[22] It is small and compact, and the handle compacts further for easy storage. It appeals to people who prefer a lightweight cleaner. Like the DC25, this model has proved to be a big seller, due to its extremely compact size, but did have quality issues with the brushroll motors, some of which have failed prematurely. Was superseded by the DC50 in November 2012
DC25[edit]
The DC25 is a full size Ball upright, the replacement for the DC15 and DC18. A no-loss-of-suction vacuum features a lifetime washable high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter. The DC25 and the other upright vacuums from Dyson are the only vacuum on the market that has been certified asthma and allergy friendly by the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America. It is available as All Floors (yellow), Animal (purple), Overdrive (blue), Blitz It (red), Exclusive (silver), and Blueprint (white and blue). This vacuum is very similar to the DC15 but on a smaller size, addressing issues brought up with the DC15. Proved to be a very popular ball cleaner, more so than the DC15 and the DC18 (which was not a true ball model). Superseded in mid-2012 by the DC40 and DC41 Animal
DC26[edit]
Ultra compact cylinder model, the DC26, known as the Dyson "City" is the World's smallest vacuum with constant suction. Even smaller than the DC22. The machine is so small that it will fit onto a piece of A4 paper. With a very small dust container of 0.68 litres, and cord length of 5 metres, it was designed for small flats with primarily hard floors. It weighs just 5.6 kg and has an impressive 160 AirWatts suction power.
DC27[edit]
The DC27 is an update on the DC14. The DC27 is a full size upright which has wheels rather than a ball, an auto-adjusting cleaner head and "root-cyclone" technology. It also features an extending wand and hose and has a large debris channel to pick up large dirt particles.[23]
DC28[edit]
This was another upright model produced for the US market. It was the replacement for the DC17. Has a powered cam to adjust the height of the brushbar ("Dyson Airmuscle") controlled from a set of buttons by the main power switch above the cyclone assembly, a pneumatic actuator to keep the cleaning head on the floor, and a high-torque clutch to give extra power to the brushbar.
DC29[edit]
In Australia the DC29 is a cylinder model, an improved version of DC19. Very similar to DC19T2, the main differences being colour and tooling and non-HEPA machine. A HEPA filter is now included in 2012 'Multi-Floor' white models. In Canada, the DC29 is actually an upright model similar to the DC25. This appears to be the first instance of a particular model number being used on an Upright OR a Cylinder depending on country of destination Supplied to Continental Europe and Australia (Cylinder type) and Canada (Upright type) (Not available in the UK). According to this Dyson review listing on the Australian website, the Dyson DC29 Multi floor is no longer available.[24]
DC30[edit]
Powerful handheld with a brushless switched reluctance motor.[25] Can provide 6 minutes of high and constant suction. It is smaller, lighter and more powerful than the DC16, which uses a conventional motor. The DC30 has a yellow cyclone manifold.
DC31[edit]
The most powerful handheld, with the same motor technology as the DC30, but with a larger battery and dual power for more runtime. 10 minutes of high constant suction (at the same level as the DC30) or 6 minutes with 70% higher suction. Available as DC31 with a blue (UK and AUS), yellow (US), or red (EU) cyclone manifold, or the DC31 Animal which has a purple cyclone manifold.
DC32[edit]




Dyson DC32


Basically the same as DC23T2 (in the UK) with a revised color scheme and additional tooling.
Models current as of December 2016[edit]





This section needs to be updated. Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (December 2016)


DC33[edit]
Revised version of the DC27/DC28. Replacement for the DC14, upright wheeled cleaner that does not use ball technology. Available as Multi Floor (Yellow), Stubborn (White), Animal (Purple), i (Red). The DC33 has a plastic telescopic pole with smaller diameter than the metal telescopic pole of the DC14, so attachments from older Dyson's such as the DC14 do not fit the DC33. This model more closely resembles the old DC14 than the DC27 did, using exactly the same style of floorhead as the DC14, DC07 and DC04. The plastic wand pole has been criticised as a lowering of quality from the older metal type, and also causes the main spine of the cleaner to flex more, without the support of the metal wand[citation needed]. The fact that older model's tools were not interchangeable was also criticised, with many buyers trading up from the DC07 or DC14 to the DC33, and finding that their old tools would not fit[citation needed]. The DC33 uses a single motor for the suction and to drive the brushroll via a mechanical clutch as on the DC04, DC07 and DC14. This unit has been discontinued as of July 2013. No replacement model has been announced.

It is being replaced by Dyson V6 Motor Head Cordless Vacuum.[27]
DC45[edit]
Dyson Digital Slim for Canada and Continental Europe, essentially the same as the DC44
DC46[edit]
Version of the DC47 cylinder model for the Canadian, and the Japanese market.
DC47[edit]
The DC47 was released at the end of 2012, and is an update on the DC38. It is a compact cylinder model based on the technologies featured on the DC38, but introducing the new 2 Tier Radial Root Cyclone Technology for greater suction and filtration, and also the new 2 channel floor tool.

DC59[edit]
The DC59 replaces the DC44 and is claimed to remove as much dust as a corded vacuum. This is made possible by the combination of the Dyson digital motor V6, 2 Tier Radial cyclones and the latest floor tool with carbon fibre filaments. This power-dense motor uses digital pulse technology and a neodymium magnet to spin at up to 110,000 times a minute. Its small size means that the machines it powers can also be small, light and powerful.
DC61[edit]
For specific markets (e.g. Singapore); based on the V6; Handheld Version; very similar to the DC59.
DC62[edit]
For specific markets (e.g. Canada, Singapore, Continental Europe); based on the V6; very similar to the DC59.

Dyson Cinetic[edit]
The Dyson Cinetic canister vacuum features Dyson's new Cinetic technology which never needs filters replaced.[31] This is an updated version of the DC54 canister and is the first to break the "DC" numbering system of previous units in most markets (in Canada it is named DC78).
DC75 – Dyson Cinetic Big Ball[edit]
Launched in 2015, the DC75 (DC77 in Canada) is Dyson's upright version of the Cinetic vacuum. Contains Cinetic technology which never requires changing filters as well as Dyson's auto adjusting power brushroll and Tangle-Free Turbine Tool.
Dyson V6[edit]
Dyson cordless vacuums are powered by the Dyson digital motor. This power-dense motor uses digital pulse technology and a neodymium magnet to spin at up to 110,000 times a minute. Its small size means that the machines it powers can also be small, light and powerful. The Dyson brand, as well as various reviews, claim that the V6 can have up to a 20-minute run time.[32][33] The Dyson V6 replaced the Dyson DC59.[34][35][36]
Dyson V8[edit]
Introduced in 2016, the Dyson V8 is an updated version of the V6 with better battery life(up to 40 mins without the brush heads), modifications to the debris emptying process, and reported quieter operation than its predecessor due to a different noise frequency and noise dampening post motor filter. 28 Air watts on normal power and 115 in turbo mode. Their motorized floor heads are driven by their own separate motors.
Dyson 360 Eye[edit]
The Dyson 360 Eye, a floor cleaning robot, uses a 360° panoramic vision camera and IR distance sensors to map a room and navigate, enabling it to perform a systematic cleaning pattern that covers the accessible floor area only once. Launched in 2014, Dyson's initial entry into this market segment also features cyclonic dust separation, a Dyson digital motor V2 for high power suction, tank treads for traction, a full-width brush-bar, and user interface via a free iOS or Android app.[37]

Early life and education[edit]
James Dyson was born in Cromer, Norfolk, one of three children. He was educated at Gresham's School,[1] an independent boarding school in Holt, Norfolk, from 1956 to 1965, when his father died of cancer.[6] He excelled at long distance running: "I was quite good at it, not because I was physically good, but because I had more determination. I learnt determination from it."[7] He spent one year (1965–1966) at the Byam Shaw School of Art, and then studied furniture and interior design at the Royal College of Art (1966–1970) before moving into engineering.
Early inventions[edit]
Dyson helped design the Sea Truck in 1970 while studying at the Royal College of Art. His first original invention, the Ballbarrow, was a modified version of a wheelbarrow using a ball instead of a wheel. This was featured on the BBC's Tomorrow's World television programme. Dyson stuck with the idea of a ball, which his brother had thought of, inventing the Trolleyball, a trolley that launched boats. He then designed the Wheelboat,[8] which could travel at speeds of 64 kilometres per hour (40 mph) on both land and water.
Vacuum cleaners[edit]




DC07 bagless Dyson vacuum cleaner


In the late 1970s, Dyson had the idea of using cyclonic separation to create a vacuum cleaner that would not lose suction as it picked up dirt. He became frustrated with his Hoover Junior's diminishing performance: the dust bag kept becoming clogged with loads of dust thus reducing suction.[9] The cyclone idea came from a sawmill that used cyclone technology (qv. History of Dyson Ltd).[10]
Partly supported by his wife's salary as an art teacher, and after five years and many prototypes, Dyson launched the "G-Force" cleaner in 1983. However, no manufacturer or distributor would handle his product in the UK, as it would disturb the valuable market for replacement dust bags, so Dyson launched it in Japan through catalogue sales.[11] Manufactured in bright pink, the G-Force sold for the equivalent of £2,000. It won the 1991 International Design Fair Prize in Japan. He obtained his first US patent on the idea in 1986 (U.S. Patent 4,593,429).
After failing to sell his invention to the major manufacturers, Dyson set up his own manufacturing company, Dyson Ltd. In June 1993, he opened his research centre and factory in Malmesbury, Wiltshire.
Dyson's breakthrough in the UK market came more than ten years after the initial idea, through a TV advertising campaign in which it was emphasised that, unlike most of its rivals, the Dyson vacuum did not require the continuing purchase of replacement bags. At that time, the UK market for disposable cleaner bags was £100 million. The slogan "say goodbye to the bag" proved more attractive to the buying public than a previous emphasis on the suction efficiency that its technology delivers. Ironically, the previous step change in domestic vacuum cleaner design had been the introduction of the disposable bag – users being prepared to pay extra for the convenience. The Dyson Dual Cyclone became the fastest-selling vacuum cleaner ever made in the UK, and outsold those of some of the companies that rejected his idea, becoming one of the most popular brands in the UK.[12] In early 2005, it was reported that Dyson cleaners had become the market leaders in the United States by value (though not by number of units sold).
Dyson licensed the technology in North America from 1986 to 2001 to Fantom Technologies, after which Dyson entered the market directly.
Following his success, other major manufacturers began to market their own cyclonic vacuum cleaners. In 1999 Dyson sued Hoover (UK) for patent infringement. The High Court ruled that Hoover had deliberately copied a fundamental part of his patented designs in making its Triple Vortex bagless vacuum cleaner range.[13] Hoover agreed to pay damages of £4 million.
In 2005, Dyson incorporated the wheel ball from his Ballbarrow concept into a vacuum cleaner, creating the Dyson Ball, with the aim of making it more manoeuvrable.
In mid-2014, Dyson personally appeared in Tokyo to introduce his "360 Eye" robotic vacuum cleaner. Dyson's initial entry into this market segment features 360° scanning and mapping for navigation, cyclonic dust separation, a custom-designed digital motor for high suction, tank treads for traction, a full-width beater bar, and user interface via a free iOS or Android app.[14]
Other inventions[edit]
In 2000, Dyson expanded his appliance range to include a washing machine called the ContraRotator, which had two rotating drums moving in opposite directions. The range was decorated in the usual bright Dyson colours, rather than the traditional white, grey or black of most other machines. The item was not a commercial success and is no longer available.[15]
In 2002, Dyson created a realisation of the optical illusions depicted in the lithographs of Dutch artist M. C. Escher. Engineer Derek Phillips was able to accomplish the task after a year of work, creating a water sculpture in which the water appears to flow up to the tops of four ramps arranged in a square, before cascading to the bottom of the next ramp. The creation titled Wrong Garden,[16] was displayed at the Chelsea Flower Show in 2003.[17] The illusion is accomplished with water containing air bubbles pumped through a chamber underneath the transparent glass ramps to a slit at the top from which the bulk of the water cascades down. This makes it appear that the water is flowing up, when really, a small amount of water diverted from the slit at the top flows back down the ramps in a thin layer.




Dyson Airblade hand dryer


In October 2006 Dyson launched the Dyson Airblade, a fast hand dryer that uses a thin sheet of moving air as a squeegee to remove water, rather than attempting to evaporate it with heat. This allows faster drying, while using much less energy than traditional electrical hand dryers.
Another product is a fan without external blades, which he calls the "Air Multiplier".[18] In addition to a cooling fan, a model which distributes electrically produced heat and an ultrasonic humidifier model are also available.
In April 2016, Dyson launched the Dyson Supersonic, a hair dryer with a smaller motor located in the handle so as to provide better balance and smaller size, as well as quieter operation.[19] Commenting on the launch Vogue magazine said "as the first product to launch from Dyson's new UK state-of-the-art hair laboratory, we have high hopes for the future of our blow-dries."[20]
Manufacturing[edit]
In February 2002, Dyson announced that production was being shifted to Malaysia leaving 560[21] workers redundant in 2002 for economic reasons and because of difficulty acquiring land for expansion. The company's headquarters and research facilities remain in Malmesbury.
In November 2014, Dyson announced plans to invest a further £1.5bn into the research and development of new technology, including funding for a campus at the Dyson UK headquarters in Malmesbury which will create up to 3,000 jobs.[22]
Former Prime Minister David Cameron, said: “Dyson is a great British success story and the expansion of the Malmesbury campus will create thousands of new jobs, providing a real boost to the local economy and financial security for more hardworking families. Investment on this scale shows confidence in our long-term economic plan to back business, create more jobs and secure a brighter future for Britain.”[23]
European single currency[edit]

In 1998, Dyson was one of the chairmen and chief executives of the twenty FTSE 100 companies who signed a statement published in The Financial Times in 1998 calling on the government for early British membership of the Eurozone.[24] He claimed that failure to join the euro would lead to the destruction of the British manufacturing base and said: "It does not mean that the jobs will go tomorrow but will drift abroad over a period and the longer-term future of Britain as a manufacturing nation will be blighted. Ministers had better understand that if we delay entry too long there may be nothing left to save."[25]
An editorial published by The Times responded: "Mr Dyson, a manufacturing version of Sir Richard Branson, likes complaining. Yesterday he was complaining that Britain's failure to join the Euro and the resultant strong Pound will force him to move abroad. Last week he blamed the price of land and planning delays in Wiltshire, but never mind. So where will he go? To Portugal, Italy or to an EU candidate such as Poland? No, Mr Dyson threatens to go to the Far East. Like so many entrepreneurs, he wants a cheap currency and low interest rates, but also low inflation, low wages, a flexible labour market and low regulation. He will not find them in the eurozone."[26] Lord Tebbit, a former Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, also questioned Dyson's motives and said: "[W]hat still puzzles me is why such a euro-enthusiast as [Mr] Dyson does not intend to establish his new factory in Europe if he can't have it in Britain."[27]
In 2014, Dyson said he would now be voting to leave the European Union to avoid being "dominated and bullied by the Germans".[28] In November 2015, Dyson lost his case against EU energy labelling laws in the European Court of Justice.[29] Dyson was one of the most prominent UK business leaders to publicly support Brexit before the referendum in June 2016.[30] Since the EU referendum, Dyson has stated that Britain should leave the EU Single Market and that this would "liberate" the UK economy.[31]
James Dyson Foundation[edit]




Dyson in 2013 at Sydney, Australia


Dyson set up the Foundation in 2002 to support design and engineering education – it now operates in UK, US and Japan. The Foundation's aim is to inspire young people to study engineering and become engineers by encouraging students to think differently and to make mistakes. The Foundation supports engineering education in schools and universities, as well as medical and scientific research in partnership with charities. It achieves this by funding different resources such as the "Engineering Box", a box filled with activities for a school to use as a teaching aid. The Foundation loans the boxes to schools for four weeks free of charge, they are suitable for Key Stage 4 and above. The Engineering Box enables students to take apart and examine a Dyson DC22 Telescope vacuum cleaner. In addition, a school is allowed to retain a James Dyson Foundation teacher pack, and a copy of Genius of Britain, a Channel 4 TV series featuring Dyson, and design engineering posters. Other resources are also available.
In May 2014, the Foundation announced an £8m donation to create a technology hub at the University of Cambridge. A new four-storey building will house 1,200 postgraduate engineers and support world-leading research. The donation will also allow for a design and making lab to be developed for undergraduate engineering students.[32]
In March 2015, the James Dyson Foundation pledged a £12m donation to Imperial College London to allow the purchase of an iconic Post Office building (located on Exhibition Road) from the Science Museum. Imperial College will open the Dyson School of Design Engineering in this building, and teach a new four-year Masters course in design engineering, developing a new cohort of creative and theoretical engineers.[33]
The Foundation also supports the work of young designers through the James Dyson Award. This is an international design award that "celebrates, encourages and inspires the next generation of design engineers".[34] It is run in twenty countries and is open to recent graduates in product design, industrial design, and engineering.
Honours and awards[edit]
In 1997, Dyson was awarded The Prince Philip Designers Prize.[35] Dyson was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1998 New Year Honours. In 2000, he received the Lord Lloyd of Kilgerran Award. He received an Honorary DEng degree from the University of Bath in 2000.[36] In 2005, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering (FREng).[37] He was appointed a Knight Bachelor in the 2007 New Year Honours. Since 2011 he has been Provost of the Royal College of Art. Dyson was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2015.[2] In the 2016 New Year Honours, Dyson's appointment to the Order of Merit (OM) was announced for "contributions and achievements in industrial design".[38][39] 2017: IEEE Honorary Membership. In March 2017 Dyson was voted the most reputable company in the UK followed by Aston Martin.[40]
Personal life[edit]
Dyson married Deirdre Dyson (née Hindmarsh) in 1968.[1] The couple have three children.[1][41] In 2003, Dyson paid £15 million[citation needed] for Dodington Park,[42] a 300-acre (1.2 km2) Georgian estate in South Gloucestershire close to Chipping Sodbury. He and his wife also own Domaine des Rabelles, near Tourtour, France, and a townhouse in Chelsea, London.[43] His vessel Nahlin is the largest British-flagged and owned super yacht with an LOA of 91 metres (299 ft), and was ranked 36th in a 2013 survey of the world's 100 biggest yachts.[44][45]
Dyson is Provost of the Royal College of Art in London, having succeeded Sir Terence Conran in August 2011,[46] and is Patron of the Design & Technology Association.[47] He was chair of the board of trustees of the Design Museum, "the first in the world to showcase design of the manufactured object", until suddenly resigning in September 2004,[48] stating the museum had "become a style showcase" instead of "upholding its mission to encourage serious design of the manufactured object".

Technologies and other products[edit]
Dyson has developed various technologies in their products, such as the dual cyclone used in vacuum cleaners and their Airblade hand dryers.
Digital motor[edit]
The Dyson digital motor is a DC electric motor operates on the switched reluctance principle[1] used in several pieces of equipment. According to Dyson, it is smaller, lighter, cleaner and more power-efficient (due in part to tight tolerances) than conventional electric motors. These brushless motors rotate at up to 110,000 rpm.[2] The motor is a two-pole brushless motor with a digital controller. Dyson says efficiency is 84%, which is less than the 96% efficiency that is achieved in some brushless designs. In order to deal with the high speed, the impeller is made of carbon-fibre reinforced polymer, the shaft is steel. The first version was named X020 and used in the Airblade hand dryer; the later DDM (Dyson digital motor) V2 is used for Dyson handheld vacuum cleaners.[3]
Airblade hand dryer[edit]
Main article: Dyson Airblade




Dyson Airblade (view from top)


The Dyson Airblade is a hand dryer for commercial customers, typically made available in public hand-washing facilities. The Airblade uses Dyson's Digital Motor to produce a stream of air that flows at up to 430 mph (700 km/h) and is claimed to dry the hands in 10 to 12 seconds.[4][5] The Airblade uses a HEPA filter to remove bacteria and mould from the air. The Dyson Airblade is the world's first hygienic commercial hand dryer according to NSF International; it is accredited by the British Skin Foundation and the Royal Institute of Public Health as well.[6] The Dyson Airblade is HACCP approved. The first Dyson Airblade was launched in 2006
Bladeless fans[edit]
Air Multiplier[edit]




Display of a range of Dyson Air Multipliers


The Dyson Air Multiplier was announced on 18 October 2009 as an electric fan, intended to provide smoother airflow and, having no exposed rotating blades, operating in a safer manner than conventional bladed fans.[7][8] Like other bladeless fans, the apparatus itself has no visible external blades, as the fan blades are concealed within the body of the product. The fan works by drawing 27 litres of air per second[9] in through an inlet in the base pillar and forcing it through an outlet in the upper ring. The jet of air travels over the airfoil shape of the ring, creating local low pressure, thereby pulling air from behind it as it decelerates in a process known as inducement, a property of Bernoulli's principle.[8] Once the air exits the ring it entrains the air in front and alongside, producing an airflow of 405 l/second.[9] Using this process, a small brushless impeller in the fan's base can power a much larger air outlet without exposing any blades.[7]
Dyson stated that the initially generated air flow is multiplied between 15 and 18 times for the models AM01, AM02 and AM03, projecting a smooth stream of uninterrupted air.[10] In March 2014, the second-generation models of the Air Multiplier were acoustically re-engineered so that the bladeless fans were quieter than their predecessors by improved airflow and a Helmholtz resonator to cancel a 10 kHz whine.[11]
Since the original release, Dyson has produced combination electrical heater and cooling fans (some with HEPA filters) based on its Air Multiplier design. In addition, some newer designs have the ability to shift between a wider and shallower or a narrower but farther-reaching stream of air, under user control. Most of the Dyson fans and heaters are controlled by small infrared remote controls, which can be adhered magnetically to the appliance when not in use. A more limited set of control switches is available on the body of the appliance.
The design for a bladeless fan was patented by Toshiba in 1981, but was never manufactured. The initial patent claim by Dyson was rejected by the Intellectual Property Office, ruling that it "cannot be considered novel or cannot be considered to involve an inventive step" compared to the Japanese version.[12]
The Air Multiplier fan received the Good Design Award in 2010.
Fan heater[edit]
In September 2011, Dyson announced the Dyson Hot fan heater (AM04), using Air Multiplier technology. Like most fan heaters it has a thermostat to control the temperature, and can also be used as a fan (without heat). All AM04 models made prior to 1 April 2014 were subject to a no-charge product recall for repairs because of a fire risk.[13]
Ultrasonic humidifier[edit]
In March 2015, Dyson released their new Air Multiplier Humidifier. It uses Ultraviolet Cleanse technology to clean water by running it through ultraviolet light twice before it is released. A piezoelectric transducer in the base vibrates up to 1.7 million times a second to break the water down into small particles which are drawn up and added to the air with air multiplier technology.[14]
Air purifier[edit]
In January 2016, Dyson released the Dyson Pure Cool air purifier. It uses the same air multiplier technology to blow air as well as a .99 micron HEPA filter to trap air particles. Along with the filter to trap slow particles the unit uses low-force velocity to trap fine particles within the filter as well.[15]
Contrarotator washing machine[edit]
 The discontinued Dyson CR01 Contrarotator is a washing machine with two counter-rotating drums, the first of its type. Each drum had 5,000 spin perforations to help evacuate water. The machine was first available in November 2000. Dyson's next washing machine, in 2004, was the CR02, with "Flowcheck" and "Allergy" models. The company later stopped making washing machines the same year, as they were unprofitable for the company.[16] As of November 2012, Dyson no longer supports or services the Contrarotator washing machines, which it has officially declared obsolete.
Hair Dryer[edit]
On 27 April 2016, Dyson introduced the Supersonic handheld hair dryer. The digital motor V9 is housed in the handle.[17]
Lighting[edit]
In 2015 Dyson introduced the "Csys" range of LED lamps. The lamps incorporate heat pipe technology designed to extend the life of the product.
Vacuum cleaners[edit]
Root Cyclone technology[edit]
The Dyson Root Cyclone technology is used in all Dyson vacuum cleaners from DC07. The DC17, DC22, and DC23 use the improved Root Cyclone & Core Separator, also called Radix Cyclone, Intermediary Cyclone, or Level 3 Root Cyclone Technology.
Model versions[edit]
All versions are identified by a name such as "DC14". Some have submodels identified by a suffix indicating specific facilities, implemented sometimes by additional tools supplied. Suffixes with the same meaning vary from model to model.

All Floors, Multi Floor, Wood+Wool: suitable for both hard surfaces and carpets.
Allergy: suitable for filtering out microscopic allergens.
Animal: will pick up animal hairs better than a general-purpose model, and filter out fine particles. These machines all come with a mini turbine tool to help remove pet hair, human hair and cotton fibres from upholstery, cars, and confined areas.
Motorhead: cylinder model with motorised brush head.
Full Gear: same features as "Animal" with more attachments.

Special Edition Models[edit]
Other suffixes sometimes used indicate exclusivity to certain stores, e.g. "Comet Exclusive" and "Overdrive" (Comet) or "Blitz it" (Currys).
Some are limited editions:
"Drawing" limited editions[edit]
These machines feature a different range of tools to the usual "Multifloor" and "Animal" versions and also appear in different colours. The Drawing later became exclusive to John Lewis.
"De Stijl" limited editions[edit]
Some of the early Dyson models (DC01, DC02, DC04) were available in a special limited edition "De Stijl" colour scheme, in homage to the Dutch design movement of the same name. All these are coloured a combination of purple, red and yellow.
"Dyson Antarctic Solo" limited editions[edit]
In 1996, 100,000 recolored DC01 and DC02 models were produced as part of a fund-raising effort for Ranulph Fiennes's solo expedition to the Antarctic. For these models, the yellow parts found on the mainstream models were replaced with light blue ones, and on the DC02 Antarctic Solo the body was also recoloured in white instead of silver.[18]
Discontinued models[edit]
G-Force[edit]
"G-Force" was the name given to Dyson's first widely available vacuum cleaner. It was the first to use "Dual Cyclone" separation technology. Licensed to the Japanese company Apex Inc., and only available on the Japanese market, it was not sold under the Dyson name. Dyson used the money he earned from G-Force to start up the Dyson company.
DC01[edit]
The first vacuum cleaner sold under the Dyson name was the DA001, launched in, 1993. It was a domestic upright model that used the patented "Dual Cyclone" technology and was made in Chippenham, England. After a short period, it was renamed the DC01 and production later moved to Malmesbury, at the company's new factory/research centre.
The DC01 had a single motor which provided the suction and also drove the brushroll directly via a single rubber toothless belt with no form of "brush control" (where the user can turn off the brushroll for use on hard floors), so was mainly designed to use on carpeted floors. It stored its hose on the back of the housing as part of the handle wand, and removing the handle wand enabled this stretch hose to be used. This was the only Dyson upright not to use washable pre-motor filters; these had to be purchased and replaced every 3 months. It also had a choice of post motor filtration – standard or HEPA (High Efficiency Particle Arrest) according to the model purchased. It competed with models like the Hoover Turbopower, and was priced very high in comparison to other bagged cleaners. The suction power of the DC01 is 90 airwatts. Dyson no longer supports this model, nor produces parts for it.
DC02[edit]
The DC02, launched in 1995, was the first cylinder (canister) model sold by Dyson. Its shape allowed it to sit on stairs. Like the DC01, it used Dual Cyclone technology. It was not that popular during its production run and sold fewer than the DC01. The DC02 is no longer supported by Dyson.
The DC02 was available in several special editions:

The De Stijl was colored purple, red and yellow, in homage to the Dutch art movement from which it takes its name. It was produced in a limited edition of 20,000 units.
The DC02 Clear was produced in clear blue and green plastic, allowing the user to see its internal components through the casing.
The Antarctica Solo model, coloured white and pale blue, helped raise funds for the Breakthrough cancer charity, whilst commemorating Sir Ranulph Fiennes's solo trek across Antarctica. Each of the limited edition run of 100,000 machines bore the image of Ranulph Fiennes's autograph.
The Recyclone was the first vacuum cleaner to be made of recycled plastic. Originally intended as a test-run for a range-wide 'Recyclone' scheme, the concept never went beyond a very small production run of DC02s. They were coloured green with organic pigment.

DC03[edit]
The DC03, Dyson's second upright vacuum cleaner, released in 1997, was a lightweight (6.9 kg), low profile upright cleaner. It resembled a twin-cylinder version of the DC01, contained one normal cylinder and a second which contained a pair of HEPA filters. The DC03 had a smaller, more compact 700W motor, and while its suction power was lower than any of the currently available uprights at around 100 Airwatts, its heavy-duty filtration system allowed it to survive for many years after the rest of the original Cyclone cleaners were discontinued. It was the first upright model to feature brush control, via a clutch between the motor and the brushroll, and was able to be stored hung on a wall. It was also the first Dyson to have the Reversible Hose, like on the DC07 and DC24 Ball
DC04[edit]
The DC04, released around 1998, had improved filters fitted as standard. The Pre motor filter was washable and was relocated to the top of the cyclone assembly, and the tools stored on the top of the filter housing. Most models also featured the new clutch controlled brushbar introduced on the DC03.
DC05[edit]
The DC05, launched in 2002, was the second cylinder model. It was designed as a replacement for the DC02. The 'Motorhead' version was the first Dyson to offer a "powernozzle", a floor nozzle with a motor-powered brush-roll for improved performance on carpets.
DC06[edit]
Dyson's first robotic vacuum cleaner, equipped with the Dyson Digital Motor, had not proceeded beyond the home-trial stage by 2012, as cost and weight needed reducing. It had the ability to 'learn' the room, and to distinguish between solid objects, such as walls and furniture, and human beings, pets, etc. by utilising sensors and specially-written navigation software. Dyson DC06 got introduced in 2005.
DC07[edit]




DC07 "Origin" Dyson Vacuum cleaner


The DC07, released in 2001 was the first implementation of Root Cyclone technology into a cleaner. In features it was similar to the DC04, but included a bottom drop bin, controlled by a trigger in the top of the cyclone housing, which made for easier emptying, and the handle wand was also able to be reversed and fitted to the hose cuff at the handle, so making it easier to use than that on the DC04. Many models were fitted with clutch controlled brushbars.
The DC07 had a new 1400W motor that provided 280 Airwatts, making it about the most powerful model that Dyson made, and also the noisiest in use, with much of the operating noise coming from the upwards mounted cyclone assembly. It weighed 9 kg. In the U.S. The Dyson DC07 was sold only at Target. The DC07 had a long production run from 2001 until 2008, and came in many different colour combinations.
DC08[edit]
The DC08 was a new cylinder revision, released around 2002, incorporating the Dyson Root Cyclone technology found on the DC07. The DC08 was the replacement for the DC05. It was the first of the Dyson cylinder models to feature the new "Animal" derivative first seen on the DC07, which essentially meant that the cleaner was capable of dealing effectively with pet hair and dander. Animal models came with an air driven turbine floorhead and mini turbo brush for effective pet hair removal on carpets and furnishings – they also came equipped with Hepa post motor filters.
None of the DC08 models had electric motorised floorheads. Like the DC07, the DC08 was fitted with an uprated motor giving it more suction power, handled by the new root 12 cyclone system the DC08 was equipped with. This higher power output was able to drive the main turbo floorhead without the need for an electric motor and the expensive wiring that the DC05 motorhead had.
Lower models in the DC08 range did not come with the turbine floorhead, having only the standard floorheads which were better suited to hard flooring than carpets. Unlike the DC02, the DC08 did not have storage for its small tools in the body of the cleaner. As with the DC05, tools were stored on a small caddy attached to the suction hose. The DC08 had a long production run; it was upgraded to the DC08 Telescope wrap after the launch of the DC11, to enable it to be stored more efficiently, and was eventually superseded by the DC19.
DC08T[edit]
Next product after the DC11 with 'Telescope Wrap'. Wand handle is telescopic and the hose wraps around the machine. Launched in 2003
DC09, DC10, DC13 omitted[edit]
There are no Dyson models DC09 as the numbers are associated with the DC-9 and DC-10 aircraft produced by McDonnell Douglas. DC13 omitted due to superstition surrounding the number 13.
DC11[edit]
The DC11 was the first Dyson cylinder cleaner with Telescope wrap. Launched around 2003. It had two separate dust bins and cyclone assemblies to make the machine smaller when it was packed away. It was only available in two variants, one coloured yellow and the other was a turquoise/aqua model. The DC11 was quickly superseded by the DC08T Telescope wrap, and not produced for very long.
DC12[edit]
Small cylinder machine released in Japan.Launched near 2005.
DC12plus[edit]
Small cylinders in Japan. Top-of-the-range models are fitted with the Dyson Digital Motor, which rotates at 100,000 rpm.
DC14[edit]
The DC14 was released in 2004. It is a revision of the DC07 upright vacuum cleaner with lower centre of gravity and 'telescope reach'. It uses Dyson's Root 8 Cyclone technology, which maintains constant suction. Aside from the different design of the cyclone assembly and bin, the DC14 looks very similar to the DC07. It also has the same motor as fitted to the DC07 and the same floorhead (with the exception that the DC14 has a large debris channel fitted to the front of the brushroll housing). Due to the different downwards pointing cyclone design, the DC14 was slightly quieter in operation than the DC07 was, but still had the familiar motor noise as it used the same 1400 watt motor. Like the DC07, the DC14 comes in many variants, the standard DC14 (the Origin, non clutched), the All Floors (Clutched), the Allergy (Clutched), the Animal (Clutched, + mini turbine tool) and other special editions and colourways. As of January 2012[update] listed as "End of Line" on Dyson Web site.
DC15[edit]
The DC15, known as The Ball was released in 2005 in three variants, the DC15 All Floors, Allergy and Animal. It was the first of the many "Ball" vacuums, and is based on the DC14. It has a ball instead of wheels which, in conjunction with a universal joint on the cleaner head, makes it possible to steer the machine by twisting the handle to the right or left. The inspiration of the "Ball" system originated from the Ballbarrow, James Dyson's first invention.
The DC15 is a complex machine compared to earlier upright models, and is the first Dyson upright with an independent motorised brushroll, controlled by a switch next to the main power switch. The main suction motor is housed inside the "ball".
Due to its high launch price, its weight (8.6 kilograms (19 lb)), and the fact that it may have initially been seen as a gimmick, not that many DC15s were sold, with the cheaper DC14 remaining much more popular. The lightweight DC18 was launched late the following year, addressing the DC15's biggest criticism, its heavy weight.
DC16 – Dyson Handheld[edit]




DC16 Handheld Cyclonic Vacuum Cleaner


The DC16 is Dyson's first handheld vacuum cleaner based on the same technology as used in the DC14 and DC15 root cyclone upright vacuum cleaners. The DC16 has 36 airwatts of constant suction. The DC16 shares the same styling as the other recent upright and cylinder vacuum cleaners in the Dyson range, and weighs 1.5 kg (3.3 lb).
Also available in an Issey Miyake limited edition in which the manifold on the cyclone assembly is pink instead of the standard yellow, and an Animal version with a motorised brushbar for picking up pet hair and gold cyclone manifold. Newest to the range is the DC16 Car and Boat which is designed for car and boat cleaning, supplied with a car 12 V charger and has a blue cyclone manifold. Launched in 2007.
DC17[edit]
The Dyson DC17 is an upright cleaner launched in October 2006 in the US. Although visually similar to the DC14, it contains new technologies. The first upgrade is the use of Dyson's Level 3 Root Cyclone.[19] This system incorporates 11 cyclones to more efficiently filter sand and dust particles out of the airstream. In this system, the airflow travels from the low speed outer cyclone to two intermediate cyclones that filter out the bulk of dust and sand particles that are drawn into the system. Beyond that, the airflow flows through the remaining eight high speed cyclones which filters any remaining dust particles out of the airstream. The Level 3 Root Cyclone improves upon the original Root Cyclone system with its capability to more efficiently separate sand particles from the air flow, a problem with the earlier system.
The second change with the DC17 upright is the brushroll design. While the brushrolls used on the DC07, DC14 and DC15 were designed with European carpets in mind, the DC17's brush roll was designed for North America with a cylindrical shape, a large diameter, and short stiff bristles. A separate motor drives the brushroll, unlike the DC07 and DC14, which use power from the main motor via clutches. This made the DC17 the most effective of Dyson cleaners on carpeting.
The third change is a new colour scheme for the DC17, and also the Dyson DC16 Root 6 Handheld; the bright colours and silver tones are toned down in favour of shiny metallic accents and titanium as the main colour for the entire machine.[20]
The level 3 root cyclone system on the DC17 was quietly redesigned due to a gasket defect that allowed dirt to enter the cyclones backwards, clogging them and causing the cleaner to lose suction; almost all of the original DC17s had this problem. The redesigned cyclone pack, fitted to later DC17s, resolved this issue. Older DC17s were not recalled, but Dyson gave out and sold many of the redesigned cyclone packs.[citation needed]
DC18[edit]
The 6.6 kilograms (15 lb) Dyson DC18 Slim, launched in September 2006 and produced until summer 2008, is a slimmer and lighter-weight successor of the DC15 Ball upright. The DC18's Root Cyclone system has been trimmed down to better accommodate the machine's slimmer profile; the DC15 uses 8 cyclones, the DC18, 6.
The ball design has been simplified for the DC18: rather than riding on a large ball that encloses the primary motor, the DC18 rides on a thin, cigar-shaped roller that provides more space for separate motor enclosure and airway paths.[21]
DC19[edit]
Cylinder model, without the Telescopic Wrap system. It was the replacement of the DC08, and to all intents and purposes is virtually the same in appearance and design as the DC08.
DC19 T2[edit]
Same as DC19, but improved so that the brushbar can pick up on carpets and on hard floors. This model also used a plastic telescopic rod instead of the metal one found on the original DC19. Still a current model as of November 2012.
DC20[edit]
'Stowaway', as DC19 but with telescope wrap. Dyson have updated the DC08T (part of the DC08) series to form the DC20. Called the Dyson Stowaway in the UK. The colour scheme is new, and the cleaner is available in Standard, Allergy and Animal.
DC21[edit]
Entering into the American Market in 2008, this model is known as the Stowaway in the United States, but as the Motorhead in the United Kingdom and other countries. It is the second cylinder vacuum from Dyson to have a motorised brushbar on the head of the nozzle. It is an advance on the DC08 Telescopic Wrap system, discontinued in some countries including the United Kingdom.
DC22[edit]
Known as "Dyson Baby" or "Dyson Compact" or "Dyson Allergy" and two-thirds the size of the DC23. Using the Dyson Digital Motor and Core Separation which adds a third cyclone 'layer' to filter out smaller particles. Has turbine head and motor head versions.
DC23[edit]
DC23 is similar in design to the DC21 but uses the new Core Separation that is also in the DC22. There is also a turbinehead animal version in Canada.
DC23 T2[edit]
A DC23 with different accessories and tools.
DC24[edit]
A small version of the DC25. Also uses ball technology with separate brushroll motor. It weighs 5.4 kilogrammes (11.9 pounds) and has 115 airwatts of suction power.[22] It is small and compact, and the handle compacts further for easy storage. It appeals to people who prefer a lightweight cleaner. Like the DC25, this model has proved to be a big seller, due to its extremely compact size, but did have quality issues with the brushroll motors, some of which have failed prematurely. Was superseded by the DC50 in November 2012
DC25[edit]
The DC25 is a full size Ball upright, the replacement for the DC15 and DC18. A no-loss-of-suction vacuum features a lifetime washable high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter. The DC25 and the other upright vacuums from Dyson are the only vacuum on the market that has been certified asthma and allergy friendly by the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America. It is available as All Floors (yellow), Animal (purple), Overdrive (blue), Blitz It (red), Exclusive (silver), and Blueprint (white and blue). This vacuum is very similar to the DC15 but on a smaller size, addressing issues brought up with the DC15. Proved to be a very popular ball cleaner, more so than the DC15 and the DC18 (which was not a true ball model). Superseded in mid-2012 by the DC40 and DC41 Animal
DC26[edit]
Ultra compact cylinder model, the DC26, known as the Dyson "City" is the World's smallest vacuum with constant suction. Even smaller than the DC22. The machine is so small that it will fit onto a piece of A4 paper. With a very small dust container of 0.68 litres, and cord length of 5 metres, it was designed for small flats with primarily hard floors. It weighs just 5.6 kg and has an impressive 160 AirWatts suction power.
DC27[edit]
The DC27 is an update on the DC14. The DC27 is a full size upright which has wheels rather than a ball, an auto-adjusting cleaner head and "root-cyclone" technology. It also features an extending wand and hose and has a large debris channel to pick up large dirt particles.[23]
DC28[edit]
This was another upright model produced for the US market. It was the replacement for the DC17. Has a powered cam to adjust the height of the brushbar ("Dyson Airmuscle") controlled from a set of buttons by the main power switch above the cyclone assembly, a pneumatic actuator to keep the cleaning head on the floor, and a high-torque clutch to give extra power to the brushbar.
DC29[edit]
In Australia the DC29 is a cylinder model, an improved version of DC19. Very similar to DC19T2, the main differences being colour and tooling and non-HEPA machine. A HEPA filter is now included in 2012 'Multi-Floor' white models. In Canada, the DC29 is actually an upright model similar to the DC25. This appears to be the first instance of a particular model number being used on an Upright OR a Cylinder depending on country of destination Supplied to Continental Europe and Australia (Cylinder type) and Canada (Upright type) (Not available in the UK). According to this Dyson review listing on the Australian website, the Dyson DC29 Multi floor is no longer available.[24]
DC30[edit]
Powerful handheld with a brushless switched reluctance motor.[25] Can provide 6 minutes of high and constant suction. It is smaller, lighter and more powerful than the DC16, which uses a conventional motor. The DC30 has a yellow cyclone manifold.
DC31[edit]
The most powerful handheld, with the same motor technology as the DC30, but with a larger battery and dual power for more runtime. 10 minutes of high constant suction (at the same level as the DC30) or 6 minutes with 70% higher suction. Available as DC31 with a blue (UK and AUS), yellow (US), or red (EU) cyclone manifold, or the DC31 Animal which has a purple cyclone manifold.
DC32[edit]




Dyson DC32


Basically the same as DC23T2 (in the UK) with a revised color scheme and additional tooling.
Models current as of December 2016[edit]

DC33[edit]
Revised version of the DC27/DC28. Replacement for the DC14, upright wheeled cleaner that does not use ball technology. Available as Multi Floor (Yellow), Stubborn (White), Animal (Purple), i (Red). The DC33 has a plastic telescopic pole with smaller diameter than the metal telescopic pole of the DC14, so attachments from older Dyson's such as the DC14 do not fit the DC33. This model more closely resembles the old DC14 than the DC27 did, using exactly the same style of floorhead as the DC14, DC07 and DC04. The plastic wand pole has been criticised as a lowering of quality from the older metal type, and also causes the main spine of the cleaner to flex more, without the support of the metal wand[citation needed]. The fact that older model's tools were not interchangeable was also criticised, with many buyers trading up from the DC07 or DC14 to the DC33, and finding that their old tools would not fit[citation needed]. The DC33 uses a single motor for the suction and to drive the brushroll via a mechanical clutch as on the DC04, DC07 and DC14. This unit has been discontinued as of July 2013. No replacement model has been announced.
In mainland Europe, the DC33c is a cylinder machine known as the "Allergy Musclehead".[26]
DC34[edit]
Another Handheld model similar to the DC31; launched in 2009.
DC35[edit]

DC41[edit]
The Dyson DC41 upright released in late 2011 as the replacement for the DC25, is the first upright vacuum with Dyson's new Radial Root Cyclone technology as well as an automatic height adjuster which provides the maximum amount of power in the suction head. The cleaner also has Dyson's new high-powered turbo brush for the hose. The DC41 uses ball technology.
DC42[edit]
A version of the Dyson DC40 offered for sale in Canada.
DC43[edit]
A version of the Dyson DC41 offered for sale in Canada.
DC44[edit]
The Dyson Digital Slim DC44 is Dyson's newest handheld vacuum cleaner which uses the same motorised brush head as the DC35 as well as the Radial Root Cyclone Technology. Has an extension pole to make it similar to a cylinder cleaner's handle, pole and floorhead. Improves on the DC35 by incorporating a more powerful brush bar motor and having more cleaning tools. It is being replaced by Dyson V6 Motor Head Cordless Vacuum.[27]
DC45[edit]
Dyson Digital Slim for Canada and Continental Europe, essentially the same as the DC44
DC46[edit]
Version of the DC47 cylinder model for the Canadian, and the Japanese market.
DC47[edit]
The DC47 was released at the end of 2012, and is an update on the DC38. It is a compact cylinder model based on the technologies featured on the DC38, but introducing the new 2 Tier Radial Root Cyclone Technology for greater suction and filtration, and also the new 2 channel floor tool. It weighs 6 kg and has a suction power of 180 Airwatts.
DC48[edit]
Version of the DC49 cylinder model for the Canadian, and the Japanese market. Launched in 2012.
DC49[edit]
Updated DC47, with more compact design and using the new digital motor v4. Billed by Dyson as its "smallest and quietest vacuum cleaner".
DC50[edit]
The DC50 was released at the end of 2012, and is an update on the DC24. It is a very small and lightweight upright ball cleaner incorporating the technologies introduced on the DC41 (i.e. self-adjusting brushroll), plus the addition of a new brushroll motor mounted inside the brushroll to save on space. The brushroll also incorporates carbon fibre bristles found in the DC35 and DC44 models. It weighs 5.4 kg (11.9 lbs) and has a suction rating of 140 airwatts, with a dirt capacity of 0.8 litres. Also featuring the 2 tier radial cyclone system found on the DC47. In Canada it is called the DC51.
DC51[edit]
A lightweight upright model[28] "with two tiers of smaller cyclones".
DC52[edit]
Version of the DC54 cylinder model for Continental Europe and Singapore[29]
DC54[edit]
Newest ball vacuum cleaner from Dyson. It uses Cinetic technology which Dyson says will not lose suction over 10 years. It is the first Dyson that does not require cleaning of filters. Consists of 54 cyclones with high frequency oscillating tips that vibrate to prevent clogging. Comes in Animal and Multi-Floor versions where it bundles a range of cleaning tools to tackle all surface types.[30]
DC56[edit]
Cordless handheld, powered by Dyson digital motor V2, has 5 cyclones. Weighs 2.92 pounds (1.32 kg), including a 22.2V rechargeable lithium ion battery.
DC58[edit]
Handheld, powered by Dyson digital motor V6, has 15 cyclones.
DC59[edit]
The DC59 replaces the DC44 and is claimed to remove as much dust as a corded vacuum. This is made possible by the combination of the Dyson digital motor V6, 2 Tier Radial cyclones and the latest floor tool with carbon fibre filaments. This power-dense motor uses digital pulse technology and a neodymium magnet to spin at up to 110,000 times a minute. Its small size means that the machines it powers can also be small, light and powerful.
DC61[edit]
For specific markets (e.g. Singapore); based on the V6; Handheld Version; very similar to the DC59.
DC62[edit]
For specific markets (e.g. Canada, Singapore, Continental Europe); based on the V6; very similar to the DC59.
DC63[edit]
DC63 is a small Ball Vacuum. Launched in 2014.It powered by the Dyson Digital Motor V4. It has 2 Tier Radial Root Cyclones.
DC65[edit]
The DC65 (DC66 in Canada)—released in early 2014—is an update of the DC41. The vacuum features an updated root cyclone and a redesigned brush roll with more power than the DC41 and a better edge cleaning system. It also includes the same Tangle-Free Turbine Tool.
Dyson Cinetic[edit]
The Dyson Cinetic canister vacuum features Dyson's new Cinetic technology which never needs filters replaced.[31] This is an updated version of the DC54 canister and is the first to break the "DC" numbering system of previous units in most markets (in Canada it is named DC78).
DC75 – Dyson Cinetic Big Ball[edit]
Launched in 2015, the DC75 (DC77 in Canada) is Dyson's upright version of the Cinetic vacuum. Contains Cinetic technology which never requires changing filters as well as Dyson's auto adjusting power brushroll and Tangle-Free Turbine Tool.
Dyson V6[edit]
Dyson cordless vacuums are powered by the Dyson digital motor. This power-dense motor uses digital pulse technology and a neodymium magnet to spin at up to 110,000 times a minute. Its small size means that the machines it powers can also be small, light and powerful. The Dyson brand, as well as various reviews, claim that the V6 can have up to a 20-minute run time.[32][33] The Dyson V6 replaced the Dyson DC59.[34][35][36]
Dyson V8[edit]
Introduced in 2016, the Dyson V8 is an updated version of the V6 with better battery life(up to 40 mins without the brush heads), modifications to the debris emptying process, and reported quieter operation than its predecessor due to a different noise frequency and noise dampening post motor filter. 28 Air watts on normal power and 115 in turbo mode. Their motorized floor heads are driven by their own separate motors.
Dyson 360 Eye[edit]
The Dyson 360 Eye, a floor cleaning robot, uses a 360° panoramic vision camera and IR distance sensors to map a room and navigate, enabling it to perform a systematic cleaning pattern that covers the accessible floor area only once. Launched in 2014, Dyson's initial entry into this market segment also features cyclonic dust separation, a Dyson digital motor V2 for high power suction, tank treads for traction, a full-width brush-bar, and user interface via a free iOS or Android app.[37]

Early life and education[edit]
James Dyson was born in Cromer, Norfolk, one of three children. He was educated at Gresham's School,[1] an independent boarding school in Holt, Norfolk, from 1956 to 1965, when his father died of cancer.[6] He excelled at long distance running: "I was quite good at it, not because I was physically good, but because I had more determination. I learnt determination from it."[7] He spent one year (1965–1966) at the Byam Shaw School of Art, and then studied furniture and interior design at the Royal College of Art (1966–1970) before moving into engineering.
Early inventions[edit]
Dyson helped design the Sea Truck in 1970 while studying at the Royal College of Art. His first original invention, the Ballbarrow, was a modified version of a wheelbarrow using a ball instead of a wheel. This was featured on the BBC's Tomorrow's World television programme. Dyson stuck with the idea of a ball, which his brother had thought of, inventing the Trolleyball, a trolley that launched boats. He then designed the Wheelboat,[8] which could travel at speeds of 64 kilometres per hour (40 mph) on both land and water.
Vacuum cleaners[edit]




DC07 bagless Dyson vacuum cleaner


In the late 1970s, Dyson had the idea of using cyclonic separation to create a vacuum cleaner that would not lose suction as it picked up dirt. He became frustrated with his Hoover Junior's diminishing performance: the dust bag kept becoming clogged with loads of dust thus reducing suction.[9] The cyclone idea came from a sawmill that used cyclone technology (qv. History of Dyson Ltd).[10]
Partly supported by his wife's salary as an art teacher, and after five years and many prototypes, Dyson launched the "G-Force" cleaner in 1983. However, no manufacturer or distributor would handle his product in the UK, as it would disturb the valuable market for replacement dust bags, so Dyson launched it in Japan through catalogue sales.[11] Manufactured in bright pink, the G-Force sold for the equivalent of £2,000. It won the 1991 International Design Fair Prize in Japan. He obtained his first US patent on the idea in 1986 (U.S. Patent 4,593,429).
After failing to sell his invention to the major manufacturers, Dyson set up his own manufacturing company, Dyson Ltd. In June 1993, he opened his research centre and factory in Malmesbury, Wiltshire.
Dyson's breakthrough in the UK market came more than ten years after the initial idea, through a TV advertising campaign in which it was emphasised that, unlike most of its rivals, the Dyson vacuum did not require the continuing purchase of replacement bags. At that time, the UK market for disposable cleaner bags was £100 million. The slogan "say goodbye to the bag" proved more attractive to the buying public than a previous emphasis on the suction efficiency that its technology delivers. Ironically, the previous step change in domestic vacuum cleaner design had been the introduction of the disposable bag – users being prepared to pay extra for the convenience. The Dyson Dual Cyclone became the fastest-selling vacuum cleaner ever made in the UK, and outsold those of some of the companies that rejected his idea, becoming one of the most popular brands in the UK.[12] In early 2005, it was reported that Dyson cleaners had become the market leaders in the United States by value (though not by number of units sold).
Dyson licensed the technology in North America from 1986 to 2001 to Fantom Technologies, after which Dyson entered the market directly.
Following his success, other major manufacturers began to market their own cyclonic vacuum cleaners. In 1999 Dyson sued Hoover (UK) for patent infringement. The High Court ruled that Hoover had deliberately copied a fundamental part of his patented designs in making its Triple Vortex bagless vacuum cleaner range.[13] Hoover agreed to pay damages of £4 million.
In 2005, Dyson incorporated the wheel ball from his Ballbarrow concept into a vacuum cleaner, creating the Dyson Ball, with the aim of making it more manoeuvrable.
In mid-2014, Dyson personally appeared in Tokyo to introduce his "360 Eye" robotic vacuum cleaner. Dyson's initial entry into this market segment features 360° scanning and mapping for navigation, cyclonic dust separation, a custom-designed digital motor for high suction, tank treads for traction, a full-width beater bar, and user interface via a free iOS or Android app.[14]
Other inventions[edit]
In 2000, Dyson expanded his appliance range to include a washing machine called the ContraRotator, which had two rotating drums moving in opposite directions. The range was decorated in the usual bright Dyson colours, rather than the traditional white, grey or black of most other machines. The item was not a commercial success and is no longer available.[15]
In 2002, Dyson created a realisation of the optical illusions depicted in the lithographs of Dutch artist M. C. Escher. Engineer Derek Phillips was able to accomplish the task after a year of work, creating a water sculpture in which the water appears to flow up to the tops of four ramps arranged in a square, before cascading to the bottom of the next ramp. The creation titled Wrong Garden,[16] was displayed at the Chelsea Flower Show in 2003.[17] The illusion is accomplished with water containing air bubbles pumped through a chamber underneath the transparent glass ramps to a slit at the top from which the bulk of the water cascades down. This makes it appear that the water is flowing up, when really, a small amount of water diverted from the slit at the top flows back down the ramps in a thin layer.




Dyson Airblade hand dryer


In October 2006 Dyson launched the Dyson Airblade, a fast hand dryer that uses a thin sheet of moving air as a squeegee to remove water, rather than attempting to evaporate it with heat. This allows faster drying, while using much less energy than traditional electrical hand dryers.
Another product is a fan without external blades, which he calls the "Air Multiplier".[18] In addition to a cooling fan, a model which distributes electrically produced heat and an ultrasonic humidifier model are also available.
In April 2016, Dyson launched the Dyson Supersonic, a hair dryer with a smaller motor located in the handle so as to provide better balance and smaller size, as well as quieter operation.[19] Commenting on the launch Vogue magazine said "as the first product to launch from Dyson's new UK state-of-the-art hair laboratory, we have high hopes for the future of our blow-dries."[20]
Manufacturing[edit]
In February 2002, Dyson announced that production was being shifted to Malaysia leaving 560[21] workers redundant in 2002 for economic reasons and because of difficulty acquiring land for expansion. The company's headquarters and research facilities remain in Malmesbury.
In November 2014, Dyson announced plans to invest a further £1.5bn into the research and development of new technology, including funding for a campus at the Dyson UK headquarters in Malmesbury which will create up to 3,000 jobs.[22]
Former Prime Minister David Cameron, said: “Dyson is a great British success story and the expansion of the Malmesbury campus will create thousands of new jobs, providing a real boost to the local economy and financial security for more hardworking families. Investment on this scale shows confidence in our long-term economic plan to back business, create more jobs and secure a brighter future for Britain.”[23]
European single currency[edit]

In 1998, Dyson was one of the chairmen and chief executives of the twenty FTSE 100 companies who signed a statement published in The Financial Times in 1998 calling on the government for early British membership of the Eurozone.[24] He claimed that failure to join the euro would lead to the destruction of the British manufacturing base and said: "It does not mean that the jobs will go tomorrow but will drift abroad over a period and the longer-term future of Britain as a manufacturing nation will be blighted. Ministers had better understand that if we delay entry too long there may be nothing left to save."[25]
An editorial published by The Times responded: "Mr Dyson, a manufacturing version of Sir Richard Branson, likes complaining. Yesterday he was complaining that Britain's failure to join the Euro and the resultant strong Pound will force him to move abroad. Last week he blamed the price of land and planning delays in Wiltshire, but never mind. So where will he go? To Portugal, Italy or to an EU candidate such as Poland? No, Mr Dyson threatens to go to the Far East. Like so many entrepreneurs, he wants a cheap currency and low interest rates, but also low inflation, low wages, a flexible labour market and low regulation. He will not find them in the eurozone."[26] Lord Tebbit, a former Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, also questioned Dyson's motives and said: "[W]hat still puzzles me is why such a euro-enthusiast as [Mr] Dyson does not intend to establish his new factory in Europe if he can't have it in Britain."[27]
In 2014, Dyson said he would now be voting to leave the European Union to avoid being "dominated and bullied by the Germans".[28] In November 2015, Dyson lost his case against EU energy labelling laws in the European Court of Justice.[29] Dyson was one of the most prominent UK business leaders to publicly support Brexit before the referendum in June 2016.[30] Since the EU referendum, Dyson has stated that Britain should leave the EU Single Market and that this would "liberate" the UK economy.[31]
James Dyson Foundation[edit]




Dyson in 2013 at Sydney, Australia


Dyson set up the Foundation in 2002 to support design and engineering education – it now operates in UK, US and Japan. The Foundation's aim is to inspire young people to study engineering and become engineers by encouraging students to think differently and to make mistakes. The Foundation supports engineering education in schools and universities, as well as medical and scientific research in partnership with charities. It achieves this by funding different resources such as the "Engineering Box", a box filled with activities for a school to use as a teaching aid. The Foundation loans the boxes to schools for four weeks free of charge, they are suitable for Key Stage 4 and above. The Engineering Box enables students to take apart and examine a Dyson DC22 Telescope vacuum cleaner. In addition, a school is allowed to retain a James Dyson Foundation teacher pack, and a copy of Genius of Britain, a Channel 4 TV series featuring Dyson, and design engineering posters. Other resources are also available.
In May 2014, the Foundation announced an £8m donation to create a technology hub at the University of Cambridge. A new four-storey building will house 1,200 postgraduate engineers and support world-leading research. The donation will also allow for a design and making lab to be developed for undergraduate engineering students.[32]
In March 2015, the James Dyson Foundation pledged a £12m donation to Imperial College London to allow the purchase of an iconic Post Office building (located on Exhibition Road) from the Science Museum. Imperial College will open the Dyson School of Design Engineering in this building, and teach a new four-year Masters course in design engineering, developing a new cohort of creative and theoretical engineers.[33]
The Foundation also supports the work of young designers through the James Dyson Award. This is an international design award that "celebrates, encourages and inspires the next generation of design engineers".[34] It is run in twenty countries and is open to recent graduates in product design, industrial design, and engineering.
Honours and awards[edit]
In 1997, Dyson was awarded The Prince Philip Designers Prize.[35] Dyson was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1998 New Year Honours. In 2000, he received the Lord Lloyd of Kilgerran Award. He received an Honorary DEng degree from the University of Bath in 2000.[36] In 2005, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering (FREng).[37] He was appointed a Knight Bachelor in the 2007 New Year Honours. Since 2011 he has been Provost of the Royal College of Art. Dyson was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2015.[2] In the 2016 New Year Honours, Dyson's appointment to the Order of Merit (OM) was announced for "contributions and achievements in industrial design".[38][39] 2017: IEEE Honorary Membership. In March 2017 Dyson was voted the most reputable company in the UK followed by Aston Martin.[40]
Personal life[edit]
Dyson married Deirdre Dyson (née Hindmarsh) in 1968.[1] The couple have three children.[1][41] In 2003, Dyson paid £15 million[citation needed] for Dodington Park,[42] a 300-acre (1.2 km2) Georgian estate in South Gloucestershire close to Chipping Sodbury. He and his wife also own Domaine des Rabelles, near Tourtour, France, and a townhouse in Chelsea, London.[43] His vessel Nahlin is the largest British-flagged and owned super yacht with an LOA of 91 metres (299 ft), and was ranked 36th in a 2013 survey of the world's 100 biggest yachts.[44][45]
Dyson is Provost of the Royal College of Art in London, having succeeded Sir Terence Conran in August 2011,[46] and is Patron of the Design & Technology Association.[47] He was chair of the board of trustees of the Design Museum, "the first in the world to showcase design of the manufactured object", until suddenly resigning in September 2004,[48] stating the museum had "become a style showcase" instead of "upholding its mission to encourage serious design of the manufactured object".

Early Virginia Families Along the James River:Their Deep and Tangled Branches. Volume Three: James City and Surry Counties by Louise Pledge Heath Foley, (1990), 2009


The main body of the text consists of a chronological series of abstracts giving the name of the patentee, the location and acreage of the patent and the date of settlement, with references to family members and owners of adjoining properties, and, most importantly, the names of the thousands of settlers brought over as headrights. In addition, this volume contains the Quit Rent Rolls for James City and Surry County, 1704- 1705, containing the names of more than 500 patentees of new land with the number of their taxable acres. Also includes an index to the James City County Civil War map of 1864 which gives the names of persons located on their respective properties. (1990), 2009.

Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice Form
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") is a United States copyright law that provides guidelines for online service providers in case of copyright infringement. Below is the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to us as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the DMCA, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office website, http://www.copyright.gov.
To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide us with the items specified below. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that the material is infringing your copyright. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
This notice and any attachments we receive will be forwarded to the alleged infringer, who will then have the opportunity to file a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Should a properly filed counter notification be filed, you will be notified and have 10 business days within which to file for a restraining order in Federal Court to prevent the reinstatement of the material.

Lulu abides by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"), which governs how we are to treat claims of copyright infringement.

To file a DMCA Notice with Lulu, click on the button "Continue".
We reserve the right to ignore a Notice that is not in compliance with the DMCA. When a clear and valid Notice is received pursuant to the guidelines, we will respond by either taking down the allegedly infringing content or blocking access to it, and we may also contact you for more information.
If you are not the copyright holder or its agent and if the content is clearly infringing the copyright of a well-known work, please select "Infringes a well-known work" from the dropdown menu.

Test Bank for A Survey of Mathematics with Applications 9E Allen R. Angel, Christine Abbott. Dennis C. Runde

$36.50
 0 review(s)
ISBN-10: 0321759664 • ISBN-13: 9780321759665
In a Liberal Arts Math course, a common question students ask is, “Why do I have to know this?”  A Survey of Mathematics with Applications continues to be a best-seller because it shows students how we use mathematics in our daily lives and whythis is important. The Ninth Edition further emphasizes this with the addition of new “Why This Is Important” sections throughout the text. Real-life and up-to-date examples motivate the topics throughout, and a wide range of exercises help students to develop their problem-solving and critical thinking skills.
Angel, Abbott, and Runde present the material in a way that is clear and accessible to non-math majors. The text includes a wide variety of math topics, with contents that are flexible for use in any one- or two-semester Liberal Arts Math course.

ISBN 9780131577138
ISBN 10 0131577131
Calculus for Engineers, Fourth Canadian Edition, is appropriate for first-year university-level engineering/physical science students who are studying calculus. 
Using an early transcendental approach, Trim emphasizes practical applications, many of which are drawn from various engineering fields. Students begin with basic practice drills and then progress to problems that require the integration of information learned in previous chapters. In this way, students develop an understanding of the mathematical procedure, rather than simply plugging numbers into formulae.

	An early, heavy, regular cropper. Melting flesh with excellent flavour. Does very well in the north. Flower is resistant to frost damage. Partially self-fertile.

	Minarette® trees are perfect for today's smaller gardens because they can be planted as close as 60-90cm (2-3ft) apart as well as being ideal for growing in tubs on patios or balconies. When mature, Minarette® trees are 1.8-2.4m (6-8ft) tall and will crop prolifically.

Minarette® trees are available for delivery from late November until late March.


            


Please remember that Minarette® trees require permanent staking, we also strongly recommend the use of rootgrow™ when planting to encourage strong root growth and aid establishment. 

Tree stakes, rootgrow™ and fruit tree feed can be found by clicking on the 'related products' tab above.





Special Offer 

		Get our 'Minarette® Accessory Pack’ for just *£15.99 (normally £19.99) when you purchase it together with any Minarette® tree.

		(*Offer price limited to one planter per Minarette® tree ordered).
