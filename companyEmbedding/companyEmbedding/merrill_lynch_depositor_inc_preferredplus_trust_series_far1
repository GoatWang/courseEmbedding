PART I



ITEM 1. BUSINESS

For information with respect to the underlying
securities held by PreferredPLUS Trust Series FAR-1,
please refer to The First American Corporations
(Commission file number 001-13585) periodic reports,
including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly
reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K,
and other information on file with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the SEC). You can read and
copy these reports and other information at the
public reference facilities maintained by the SEC at
Room 1580, 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20549.
You may obtain copies of this material for a fee by
writing to the SECs Public Reference Section of the
SEC at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20549. You
may obtain information about the operation of the
Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at
1-800-SEC-0330. You can also access some of this
information electronically by means of the SECs
website on the Internet at http://www.sec.gov, which
contains reports, proxy and information statements
and other information that the underlying securities
issuer has filed electronically with the SEC.

Although we have no reason to believe the information
concerning the underlying securities or the
underlying securities issuer contained in the
underlying securities issuers Exchange Act reports
is not reliable, neither the depositor nor the
trustee participated in the preparation of such
documents or made any due diligence inquiry with
respect to the information provided therein. No
investigation with respect to the underlying
securities issuer (including, without limitation, no
investigation as to its financial condition or
creditworthiness) or of the underlying securities has
been made. You should obtain and evaluate the same
information concerning the underlying securities
issuer as you would obtain and evaluate if your
investment were directly in the underlying securities
or in other securities issued by the underlying
securities issuer. There can be no assurance that
events affecting the underlying securities or the
underlying securities issuer have not occurred or
have not yet been publicly disclosed which would
affect the accuracy or completeness of the publicly
available documents described above.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Your investment in the trust certificates will
involve certain risks. You should carefully consider
the following discussion of risks, and the other
information included or incorporated by reference in
the applicable prospectus supplement and the
accompanying prospectus. You should also carefully
consider any risk factors and other information that
the underlying securities issuer may file in its
Exchange Act reports as referenced in Item 1 above.

IF THE UNDERLYING SECURITIES ARE REDEEMED PRIOR TO
THEIR MATURITY DATE OR IF ANY CALL WARRANTS ARE
EXERCISED, YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REINVEST YOUR
REDEMPTION OR CALL PROCEEDS AT A YIELD COMPARABLE TO
THE YIELD YOU WOULD HAVE RECEIVED ON YOUR TRUST
CERTIFICATES

The yield you will realize on your trust certificates
depends upon several factors, including:




 

 
the purchase price of the trust certificates,


 

 

 
when you acquire your trust certificates,


 

 

 
whether the underlying securities issuer
exercises its option to redeem the underlying
securities, and


 

 

 
whether the call warrant holders exercise their
optional rights to purchase outstanding trust
certificates.



The underlying securities issuer has the right to
redeem the underlying securities at its option.
Because the underlying securities issuer has the
right to redeem the underlying securities early, we
cannot assure you that the trust will be able to hold
the underlying securities until their maturity date.

Although the call warrant holders are not obligated
to exercise the call warrants, the yield you will
realize on your trust certificates depends on whether
the call warrant holders exercise their call warrants
to purchase the trust certificates.

Prevailing interest rates at the time of an early
redemption or a call exercise may be lower than the
yield on your trust certificates. Therefore, you may
be unable to realize a comparable yield upon
reinvesting the funds you receive from an early
redemption or exercise of any call warrants. In
addition, if the prevailing market value of the trust
certificates exceeds the redemption price or call
exercise price paid to you upon a redemption of the
underlying securities or the exercise of a call, you
will not be able to realize such excess. As well,
though holders of trust certificates are entitled to
receive a distribution of a proportionate amount of
the principal amount of the underlying securities on
December 15, 2028, if that amount exceeds the call
exercise price, then the call warrant holders are
likely to exercise their optional purchase rights. If
they do exercise those rights, you will receive the
call exercise price, not a proportional amount of the
principal amount on the underlying securities.

3

 



YOU MAY NOT BE PAID IF THE ASSETS OF THE TRUST
ARE INSUFFICIENT

Currently, the trust has no significant assets other
than the underlying securities. If the underlying
securities are insufficient to make payments or
distributions on the trust certificates, no other
assets will be available for payment of the
deficiency. As a holding company, the underlying
securities issuers assets consist primarily of
equity in its subsidiaries. As a result, the ability
of the underlying securities issuer to make payments
on the underlying securities depends upon its receipt
of dividends, loan payments and other funds from its
subsidiaries. In addition, if any of the underlying
securities issuers subsidiaries becomes insolvent,
the direct creditors of that subsidiary will have a
prior claim on its assets, and the rights of the
underlying securities issuer and the rights of the
underlying securities issuers creditors, including
the trusts rights as a holder of the underlying
securities, will be subject to that prior claim,
unless the underlying securities issuer is also a
direct creditor of that subsidiary. In addition,
various statutes and regulations restrict some of the
underlying securities issuers subsidiaries from
paying dividends or making loans or advances to the
underlying securities issuer. These restrictions
could prevent those subsidiaries from paying the cash
to the underlying securities issuer that the
underlying securities issuer may need in order to pay
the trust.

YOU MAY NOT RECOVER THE WHOLE OF THE STATED AMOUNT OF
YOUR TRUST CERTIFICATES IF THE TRUST DISPOSES OF THE
UNDERLYING SECURITIES ON A DEFAULT BY THE UNDERLYING
SECURITIES ISSUER OR IN THE EVENT THE UNDERLYING
SECURITIES ISSUER CEASES FILING EXCHANGE ACT REPORTS

If the underlying securities issuer defaults on its
obligations under the underlying securities or the
underlying securities issuer ceases to file Exchange
Act reports, then the trust will either distribute
the underlying securities to the trust
certificateholders or dispose of them and distribute
the proceeds to the trust certificateholders. Your
recovery in either of those events may be limited by
two factors:




 

 
if a default occurs, the market value of the
underlying securities may be adversely affected
and the proceeds of their disposition may be
lower than the aggregate stated amount of the
trust certificates; and



4

 






 

 

 
The funds or aggregate principal amount of
underlying securities you receive on that
distribution may be less than the stated amount
of your trust certificates.



THE TRUSTEE WILL NOT MANAGE THE UNDERLYING
SECURITIES

Except as described below, the trust will not dispose
of any underlying securities, even if an event occurs
that adversely affects the value of the underlying
securities or that adversely affects the underlying
securities issuer. As provided in the applicable
trust agreement, the trust will dispose of the
underlying securities only if:




 

 
there is a payment default on any underlying
securities,


 

 

 
there is another type of default that
accelerates the maturity of the underlying
securities, or


 

 

 
the underlying securities issuer ceases to file
Exchange Act reports.



Under the first circumstance listed above, the
trustee must sell the underlying securities on behalf
of the trust, even if adverse market conditions
exist. The trustee has no discretion to do otherwise.
If adverse market conditions do exist at the time of
the trustees sale of the underlying securities, you
may incur greater losses than if the trust continued
to hold the underlying securities.

THE TRUST CERTIFICATES ARE SUBJECT TO THE
CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE UNDERLYING
SECURITIES ISSUER

The trust certificates represent interests in
obligations of the underlying securities issuer. In
particular, the trust certificates will be subject to
all the risks associated with directly investing in
the underlying securities issuers unsecured
subordinated debt obligations. Neither the underlying
indenture nor the underlying securities place a
limitation on the amount of indebtedness that may be
incurred by the underlying securities issuer.

THE PAYMENTS OWED TO THE TRUST CERTIFICATEHOLDERS
ARE UNSECURED OBLIGATIONS

In a liquidation, holders of the underlying
securities, including the trust, will be paid only
after holders of secured obligations of the
underlying securities issuer. According to the
underlying securities prospectus, the underlying
securities are unsecured and will rank pari passu
with all other unsecured and unsubordinated debt of
the underlying securities issuer. However, the
underlying indenture provides that, subject to
certain exceptions, the underlying securities issuer
will not create, assume, incur or suffer to exist any
lien (with certain exceptions), on the capital stock
of any restricted subsidiary now owned by or acquired
by it, unless the underlying securities issuer shall
cause the underlying securities to be secured equally
and ratably with (or, at the underlying securities
issuers option, prior to) any indebtedness secured
thereby.

5

 



THE RATINGS OF THE TRUST CERTIFICATES MAY CHANGE

At the time of issuance, Moodys and/or S&P assigned
ratings to the trust certificates equivalent to the
ratings of the underlying securities as of the date
of the applicable prospectus supplement.

Any rating issued with respect to the trust
certificates is not a recommendation to purchase,
sell or hold a security. Ratings do not comment on
the market price of the trust certificates or their
suitability for a particular investor. We cannot
assure you that these ratings will remain for any
given period of time or that a ratings agency would
not revise or withdraw entirely the ratings if, in
its judgment, circumstances (including, without
limitation, the rating of the underlying securities)
merit. A revision or withdrawal of a rating may
adversely affect the market price of the trust
certificates.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM




EXHIBIT 99.2
 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
 Merrill Lynch Depositor, Inc.
 We have examined managements assertion that Merrill Lynch Depositor, Inc. (the Company) has complied as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010, with its established minimum servicing standards described in the accompanying Managements Assertion on Compliance with PPLUS Minimum Servicing Standards with respect to PreferredPLUS Trust Series ALL-1, dated March 21, 2011. Management is responsible for the Companys compliance with those minimum servicing standards excluding those with respect to the Bank of New York Mellon as Trustee, Custodian, Paying Agent and Transfer Agent. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assertion about the Companys compliance based on our examination.
 Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Companys compliance with its minimum servicing standards and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Companys compliance with its minimum servicing standards.
 In our opinion, based on our examination, managements assertion that the Company complied with the aforementioned minimum servicing standards excluding those with respect to the Bank of New York Mellon as Trustee, Custodian, Paying Agent and Transfer Agent as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria set forth in Appendix I.
