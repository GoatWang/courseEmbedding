Asset Allocation Outlook 2017


































What Major Economic Trends Will Impact Asset Allocation in 2017?

As investors plot a roadmap for asset allocation in 2017, they should be mindful of macro transitions driving potential risks and opportunities.

Overall Risk Position

We present our views on asset allocation, which we hope help investors see through market volatility to potential opportunities ahead.
We remain modestly overweight on overall risk positioning. In light of stretched valuations and complacency across many assets, we are maintaining ample dry powder and remain focused on portfolio liquidity as well as tail risk hedging strategies.
















Equities

While we are more constructive on equities relative to other risk assets, in light of the recent rally we are maintaining a neutral view overall and an underweight to U.S. equities.  Yet potential changes to U.S. tax policy and regulation may provide further support to domestically oriented U.S. corporations. We are moderately bullish on European equities, with growth in the region above trend and an accommodative ECB. We currently have a small positive allocation to EM as a long-term value play.
Watch the Video 

















Rates

We remain defensive on interest rate exposure. In the U.S., we prefer TIPS. Beyond the U.S., we find UK Gilts and Japanese government bonds rich, and we believe valuations of bonds by "peripheral" countries in Europe are not sustainable without ECB support.
Watch the Video 

















Credit

This late in the cycle investors should appreciate the limited spread tightening potential of corporate bonds as well as the downside potential for defaults or spread widening. Our overweight to credit is focused on non-agency mortgage-backed securities, which will likely continue to benefit from an ongoing recovery in the U.S. housing market and remain well-insulated from many global risks.
Watch the Video 

















Real Assets

We maintain an overweight to real assets, with a focus on U.S. TIPS. Inflation expectations have risen recently, yet we believe there is still value in TIPS as the market is underpricing inflation risk. Inflation is on course to reach and possibly exceed the Fed's 2% target over the coming months. (The Fed watches the PCE measure of inflation, not CPI. The latter recently surpassed 2%.)

Currencies

We continue to favor the U.S. dollar against a basket of Asian currencies  - a region that has benefited inordinately from global trade. We also have a modest underweight in the euro, anticipating continued dovish monetary policy from the ECB. We are holding small tactical positions in some of the higher-carry "commodity currencies" given the excessive cheapening seen post elections.

All investments contain risk and may lose value. Investing in the bond market is subject to risks, including market, interest rate, issuer, credit, inflation risk, and liquidity risk. The value of most bonds and bond strategies are impacted by changes in interest rates. Bonds and bond strategies with longer durations tend to be more sensitive and volatile than those with shorter durations; bond prices generally fall as interest rates rise, and the current low interest rate environment increases this risk. Current reductions in bond counterparty capacity may contribute to decreased market liquidity and increased price volatility. Bond investments may be worth more or less than the original cost when redeemed. Equities may decline in value due to both real and perceived general market, economic and industry conditions. Investing in foreign-denominated and/or -domiciled securities may involve heightened risk due to currency fluctuations, and economic and political risks, which may be enhanced in emerging markets. Currency rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time and may reduce the returns of a portfolio. Sovereign securities are generally backed by the issuing government. Obligations of U.S. government agencies and authorities are supported by varying degrees, but are generally not backed by the full faith of the U.S. government. Portfolios that invest in such securities are not guaranteed and will fluctuate in value. Inflation-linked bonds (ILBs) issued by a government are fixed income securities whose principal value is periodically adjusted according to the rate of inflation; ILBs decline in value when real interest rates rise. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) are ILBs issued by the U.S. government. Commodities contain heightened risk, including market, political, regulatory and natural conditions, and may not be suitable for all investors. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities may be sensitive to changes in interest rates, subject to early repayment risk, and while generally supported by a government, government-agency or private guarantor, there is no assurance that the guarantor will meet its obligations. High yield, lower-rated securities involve greater risk than higher-rated securities; portfolios that invest in them may be subject to greater levels of credit and liquidity risk than portfolios that do not. There is no assurance that the liquidation of any collateral from a secured bank loan would satisfy the borrower's obligation, or that such collateral could be liquidated. There is no guarantee that these investment strategies will work under all market conditions or are suitable for all investors and each investor should evaluate their ability to invest long-term, especially during periods of downturn in the market. Investors should consult their investment professional prior to making an investment decision.

The Volatility Risk Premium



Graham A. Rennison, Niels K. Pedersen


Article Introduction​Amid elevated global macroeconomic uncertainty and market turbulence, investors are searching for ways to diversify portfolios with non-traditional asset classes.
Volatility risk premium strategies aim to capture a return premium over time as compensation for the risk of losses during sudden increases in market volatility.
We believe investors seeking to diversify their equity risk exposures should consider adding volatility risk premium strategies to their portfolios, albeit with appropriate diversification across major option markets, active risk management and prudent scaling.


Article Main BodyElevated global macroeconomic uncertainty and bouts of extreme market turbulence have recently plagued financial markets. This environment has prompted a search for diversifying investment opportunities that lie outside the space of traditional asset classes. This article examines the performance of options strategies that aim to capture a return premium over time as compensation for the risk of losses during sudden increases in market volatility. We show that these “volatility risk premium” strategies deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns across 14 options markets from June 1994 to June 2012. Performance furthermore improves significantly after the crisis in 2008 (see Figure 1). We conclude that the risk-return tradeoff for volatility strategies compares favorably to those of traditional investments, such as equities and bonds, and that the strategies exhibit relatively low correlations to equity risk. Investors who want to diversify their portfolio’s equity risk exposures should therefore consider making allocations to volatility risk premium strategies. However, successful implementation would require diversification across major options markets (equities, interest rates, currencies and commodities), active risk management and prudent scaling.

 
Perspective on the volatility risk premium
The volatility risk premium can be seen as compensation to option sellers for the risk of losses during periods when realized volatility increases suddenly; these periods tend to coincide with general market turmoil, elevated uncertainty and investor stress. The volatility risk premium causes option-implied volatility to exceed realized volatility, on average. Option-implied volatility is consequently a biased estimate of future realized volatility. And, therefore, the volatility risk premium is just another economic risk premium that investors may consider as part of their portfolios. Similar “biases” can be observed in all asset markets that expose investors to important systematic risk factors. In interest rate markets, the term premium, which can be seen as compensation for uncertainty about future inflation and monetary policy, typically causes forward rates to exceed realized interest rates. In credit markets, the credit-risk premium causes market-implied default rates to exceed realized default rates, on average, and compensates investors for the risk of losses on defaults and downgrades. Finally, the currency-carry risk premium typically causes forward exchange rates of low-yielding currencies to exceed realized exchange rates. 
 
In addition, the observed magnitude of the volatility risk premium may be supported structurally by an imbalance in supply and demand. Buyers of options include hedgers, or speculators seeking leverage with capped downside, but there are few natural sellers of options. Imbalances between supply and demand for options may have been especially acute following the 2008 financial crisis and the subsequent sovereign debt crises. While demand for options has increased, fewer market participants are willing or able to supply options, due to increased capital requirements, higher costs and lower tolerance of leverage. 
 
Strategies to capture the volatility premiumOur analysis is based on data from 14 options markets, grouped into four categories: 
Equities: Equity index options (S&P 500, EURO STOXX, FTSE 100, Nikkei) 
Commodities: Commodity futures options (Oil, Gold, Natural Gas)
Currencies: Currency forward options (EUR, GBP, JPY – each vs. USD)
Interest Rates: 10-year swaptions (USD, EUR, GBP, JPY)
As a first indication of the magnitude of the volatility risk premium in these markets, Figure 2 compares average one-month option-implied volatilities to subsequent one-month realized volatilities (options are equally weighted within each broad market). The difference is positive on average and significant – corresponding to roughly one-tenth of the implied volatility.
 

 
Of course, these results do not directly correspond to the returns of a tradable strategy. The simplest way to capture the volatility risk premium is to sell one-month at-the-money straddlesi (straddles are comprised of a put and a call at the same strike and maturity). The straddles need to be hedged each day against moves in the underlying instrument (“delta-hedging”), so that they remain exposed primarily to changes in market volatility. 
We calculate hypothetical monthly returns of this strategy in each of the 14 options markets, from June 1994 to June 2012. The straddles are sold on the first business day of each month and held till expiry. We include conservative trading costs on both the sale of the option and the rebalancing of the hedgeii. 
 
Figure 3 shows average excess returns, standard deviations of returns, and the associated Sharpe ratios for each option-market category. (The Sharpe ratio measures the excess return per unit of standard deviation in an investment asset or trading strategy.) We find significant positive excess returns in each market with Sharpe ratios of 1.2 for commodities and interest rates, 1.0 for equities, and 0.7 for FX.
 

 
These Sharpe ratios compare favorably with other asset classes. However, it is well-known that standard deviation alone is insufficient as a measure of riskiness of a given investment strategy. This is especially true for strategies with embedded tail risks and returns that may be skewed to the downside.
 
Tail risk analysis 
To analyze the left tail risk in the volatility strategies, we calculate the worst returns over one-, three- and 12-month periods (Figure 4), and the number of standard deviationsiii  to which these returns correspond. To summarize the right tail of the distributions, we use the same statistics for the highest returns. The last column notes the dates of the worst three-month periods.
 
 
Over short horizons, the strategies show significant negative skewed tail risk. All experience at least three- to four-sigma losses over one month vs. two- to three-sigma gains in the right tail. However, over a 12-month period the pattern is reversed: The strategies exhibit positive skew; the right tail of the distribution is more pronounced than the left tail. 
 
These results highlight a consistent empirical characteristic of volatility strategies: they are typically subject to relatively short, sharp losses, but tend to recover quickly. This may be because implied volatility tends to overreact to shocks due to demand from risk-averse hedgers, and remains elevated for some time. Since the strategies sell short-dated options, they monetize this excess risk aversion. To further illustrate this effect, Figure 5 shows the average length of drawdowns of the volatility strategies compared with investments in other classic risk premium strategiesiv. Drawdowns are measured by the average number of months taken for a strategy to recover a previous peak. The volatility strategies exhibit relatively short drawdowns of about five months, compared with an average of more than one year for the U.S. large cap stocks, for example.

 
Figure 6 highlights the quarter-by-quarter performance during 2008, compared with U.S. large cap stocks and U.S. investment grade credit. As in Figure 4, quarterly returns are expressed as the number of standard deviations. The volatility strategies experience smaller negative shocks than investment grade credit, and comparable or smaller negative shocks than stocks. The third quarter of 2008, which includes the sharp sell-off in September, is the only quarter when all four volatility strategies have negative returns. By the fourth quarter, the volatility strategies start to recover as they monetize the higher implied volatility.
 

 
How much return is attributable to equity risk?
Market volatility tends to rise rapidly at times of overall market stress. As such, short-volatility strategies would be expected to lose money when equities sell off, especially during equity tail events. Are returns of these strategies simply due compensation for exposure to equity risk and to equity tail risk in particular? To answer this, we decompose returns into a component attributable to broad equity beta, and a component attributable to exposure to equity tail riskv. 
 
Figure 7 shows the proportion of the return that cannot be attributed to either equity beta or to equity tail risk. Equity volatility strategies, unsurprisingly, contain a substantial component of equity risk. Nearly 60% of returns are attributable to broad-equity and tail-equity risk. Currency volatility strategies also have a significant equity-risk component, contributing nearly 40% of returns. Commodities and interest rate volatility strategies do not have substantial exposure to equity risk.
 
These results highlight that the majority of the strategy returns (more than 75% on average across asset classes) cannot be explained by their exposure to equity risk. This supports the hypothesis of a distinct volatility risk premium and/or the existence of persistent structural supply-demand imbalances in the options market.
 

 
Is there a role for these strategies in portfolios?
The performance of the volatility strategies suggests that they may be attractive on a stand-alone basis. To evaluate their contribution potential in an asset allocation context, we next compare their risk, return and correlation with other risk premiums. 
 
Figure 8 compares realized Sharpe ratios of the volatility strategies with the classic risk premium strategies (see appendix for details) across four historical periods. The four periods cover the pre-crisis era (June 1994 to June 2007), the crisis (July 2007 to March 2009), the sharp recovery (April 2009 to March 2010) and the sovereign-crisis period (April 2010 to June 2012). The volatility strategies perform relatively well across each of these four periods, with notably strong performance during the two most recent periods. 
 
Finally, Figure 9 shows a monthly correlation matrix of the four volatility strategies with each other, and with the other risk premiums. Although the correlations between the volatility strategies in the full sample are positive, they are generally fairly low (around 20%-30%) with the exception of the equity volatility strategies (which are as high as 63%). Correlations do, however, increase across the board during the financial crisis, as shown in the lower part of Figure 9. ConclusionThis article examines the historical performance of simple tradable strategies that are designed to capture the volatility risk premium over time. The empirical analysis shows that the strategies deliver significant positive risk-adjusted returns across 14 options markets over a sample period from June 1994 to June 2012. The strategies experience drawdowns during spikes in market volatility and exhibit fatter left tails than normal distributions, but rebound fairly rapidly following such episodes. Overall, the risk-return tradeoff for the volatility premium compares favorably to other sources of risk premiums such as equity and credit. As always, there is a limit to conclusions that can be drawn based solely on historical-return analysis. Some potential risks may not have been realized during the sample period. However, given the economic rationale for the existence of a volatility risk premium, and the supportive supply-demand situation that emerged following the 2008 financial crisis, we believe an allocation to volatility strategies could enhance portfolio efficiency. An allocation should not be sized solely on historical-return statistics, however, but on conservative estimates of potential future returns. Volatility strategies are complex to implement, so both active portfolio and risk management are critical to their successful implementation in portfolios.
 
 
Endnotes:
iStraddles are comprised of an at-the-money put and call with the same expiry date. On the day the straddle is sold, the value of the option has close to zero sensitivity (“zero delta”) to changes in the price of the underlying. During the month, the delta may become positive or negative as the underlying moves, potentially leading to option gains and losses driven by market direction rather than the volatility premium. To neutralize this we simulate daily delta-hedging – taking an offsetting position in the underlying market – at the market close. The payoff of a delta-hedged straddle is closely related to the difference between initial implied volatility and subsequent realized volatility.iiA bid-offer of between 0.4% and 1.0% of the implied volatility is assessed on the sale of the option each month, and a bid-offer of between 0 bps and 2 bps is assessed daily on the notional required to rebalance the hedges. These bid-offers are further scaled up in periods of increased volatility, representing a reduction in liquidity in stressed periods. See appendix for additional details.iiiTo reflect the changing magnitudes of returns through time we measure standard deviations using a 36-month look-back window ending in the same month as the return-observation window, and then scale to match the return-window length. For example, if the worst three-month return is from September 2008 to November 2008, inclusive, the standard deviation is measured by monthly returns from December 2005 to November 2008, inclusive, and multiplied by the square root of three to scale to a three-month standard deviation.ivClassic risk premium strategies are defined as follows: U.S. large cap stocks, measured as the total return of the S&P 500 minus the total return of the Barclays Capital U.S. 1-3 Month T-Bill Index; U.S. Treasuries, measured as the total return of the Barclays U.S. Treasury Index minus the total return of the Barclays 1-3 Month T-Bill Index; U.S. investment grade credit, measured as the excess return of the Barclays U.S. Corporate Index over duration-matched treasuries; U.S. high yield credit, measured as the excess return of the Barclays U.S. High Yield Index over duration-matched treasuries; emerging market equity, measured as the total return of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index minus the total return of the Barclays Capital 1-3 Month T-Bill Index; emerging market bonds, measured as the excess return of the J.P. Morgan EMBI Global Index over duration-matched treasuries; commodities, measured as the total return of the Dow Jones UBS Commodity Index minus the total return of the Barclays 1-3 Month T-Bill Index; currency carry, measured as the return of investing in the three highest-yielding currencies, and going short the three lowest-yielding currencies each month, as per the Bloomberg function FXFB.vThe return attributable to equity beta is computed by regressing monthly returns of the volatility strategy on the monthly excess returns of the S&P 500 Index and multiplying the beta of this regression by the average annual excess return of the S&P 500 Index. The return attributable to equity and equity tail risk is computed by regressing monthly returns of the volatility strategy jointly on the monthly excess returns of the S&P 500 Index and the monthly excess returns of a short 5% out-of-the-money one-month S&P 500 Index put. The return is then computed by summing the betas from this regression multiplied by average annual excess returns of the S&P 500 Index and the short puts respectively. All calculations are based on data from June 1994 to June 2012.

Article DisclaimerPast performance is not a guarantee or a reliable indicator of future results. All investments contain risk and may lose value. Investing in the bond market is subject to certain risks including market, interest-rate, issuer, credit, and inflation risk; investments may be worth more or less than the original cost when redeemed. Equities may decline in value due to both real and perceived general market, economic, and industry conditions. Currency rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time and may reduce the returns of a portfolio. Commodities contain heightened risk including market, political, regulatory, and natural conditions, and may not be suitable for all investors. Tail risk hedging may involve entering into financial derivatives that are expected to increase in value during the occurrence of tail events. Investing in a tail event instrument could lose all or a portion of its value even in a period of severe market stress. A tail event is unpredictable; therefore, investments in instruments tied to the occurrence of a tail event are speculative. Derivatives may involve certain costs and risks such as liquidity, interest rate, market, credit, management and the risk that a position could not be closed when most advantageous. Investing in derivatives could lose more than the amount invested.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

Overview of the Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment ETF | Direxion


























 






























Why KNOW? Why now?
Since inception, the Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment Shares ETF (Ticker: KNOW) has outperfomed the major U.S. stock indexes including the: S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400, S&P SmallCap 600 and S&P1500 (source: Morningstar Direct). 
It makes sense. Corporate insiders− top officers, boards of directors, and major shareholders − have a natural edge over retail investors, and even financial analysts, because they typically know their businesses and industries better than anyone. That’s why, no matter how much research you do, or how much financial news you consume, you’re always a step behind those “in the know”.
The Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment Shares (KNOW) is designed to help long term-investors pursue better portfolio outcomes by using insider sentiment to seek alpha relative to S&P 500® Index.
With a net expense ratio of just 0.65%, this strategic index-based ETF provides investors with cost-effective access to stocks that corporate officers, directors, and shareholders who own more than 5% of each company’s stock, are accumulating.
This insider sentiment selection uses a screening methodology based on public-company filings and positive earnings analysis that provides the basis for the funds’ quantitatively-weighted indexes. The ETF is comprised of 100 companies selected from the S&P 1500 Index.

Performance
Performance for different share classes varies based on differences in sales charges and fees associated with each class. Not all Funds offer every class of shares.
Net asset value (NAV) returns do not include sales charges or contingent deferred sales charges (CDSC). If they were included, returns would be lower.
Class A and T: Public offering price (POP) returns are calculated with the effect of the maximum initial sales charge.
Class B: Class B shares are closed to new investors. Returns W/CDSC are calculated with the effect of a contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC).
Class C: Returns W/CDSC are calculated with the effect of a CDSC.
Class V: POP returns are calculated with the effect of the maximum initial sales charge.
Class R, R4, R5, Y and Z: Shares are sold only at NAV. Only eligible investors may purchase these shares. See the prospectus for eligibility requirements and other important information.
Gross expense ratio: Fund expense ratios are calculated based on the Fund's average net assets during the Fund's most recently completed fiscal year (or based on estimated amounts for funds that have been in existence less than one year), and have not been adjusted for current asset levels. If adjusted for any decrease or increase in assets, expense ratios would be higher or lower, respectively, than the numbers shown above. Please see the Fund's prospectus for additional details.
Net expense ratio: Net expenses are after expense waiver/reimbursement. The investment manager and certain of its affiliates have contractually (for at least the current fiscal year) agreed to waive certain fees and/or to reimburse certain expenses of the Fund, as described in the Fund's prospectus, unless sooner terminated at the sole discretion of the Fund's board. Fee waivers/expense caps would limit the impact that any decrease in assets would have on net expense ratios in the current fiscal year.
†† For Columbia Adaptive Alternatives Fund, effective March 4, 2015, the investment manager and certain of its affiliates have contractually agreed (for at least twelve months after the date of the fund prospectus), in addition to an existing arrangement, to waive certain fees and/or to reimburse certain expenses of the fund. The capped expense ratio consists of the gross expense ratio, as reflected in the fund's prospectus adjusted to reflect any fee waiver/expense reimbursement and excluding dividends and interest expense on securities sold short at the fund and underlying fund levels.
*Inception date shown is the share class inception date. The since inception returns shown are since fund inception. Returns shown for periods prior to the fund's share class inception date include the returns of the oldest share class of the fund, adjusted to reflect higher class-related operating expenses, as applicable. In addition, the returns shown include the returns of any predecessor to the fund. Click here for more information.
**Portfolio characteristics are subject to change periodically and may not be representative of current characteristics.

Morningstar Rating
For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ used to rank the fund against other funds in the same category. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, without any adjustments for loads (front-end, deferred, or redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star (each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages).

Morningstar Percentile Rankings are based on the average annual total returns of the funds in the category for the periods stated and do not include any sales charges or redemption fees, but do not include 12b-1 fees and the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains distributions. The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. Rankings for each share class will vary due to different expenses. Had sales charges or redemption fees been included, total returns would be lower.
Morningstar Style Box 
The Morningstar Style BoxTM is based on the Fund's portfolio holdings as of period end. The vertical axis shows the market capitalization of the stocks owned, and the horizontal axis shows investment style (value, blend, or growth). Information shown is based on the most recent data provided by Morningstar. The Morningstar style box data is updated on the 10th business day after every month end.

The Morningstar information contained herein: (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers; (2) may not be copied or distributed; and (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information.
Definitions
Alpha measures the relationship between the Fund's performance and its beta over a three-year period. Alpha greater than 0.0 means an investment has performed better than the compared index given its level of risk. It can be viewed as a measure of the value added by the Fund manager.
Annual Distribution Rate at NAV: is based on the Fund's most recent distribution per share (annualized) divided by the Fund's NAV.
Average effective duration provides a measure of the fund's interest-rate sensitivity.
Beta measures a fund's risk relative to its benchmark The index is equivalent to 1.0. A fund with a beta greater than 1.0 has been more volatile than the index while a fund with a beta less than 1.0 has been less volatile.
Price-to-Book Ratio is a stock's price divided by its book value, and may help determine if the stock is valued fairly.
Price-to-Earnings Ratio is a stock's price divided by after-tax earnings over a trailing 12-month period, which serves as an indicator of value based on earnings.
R-Squared ranges from 0.00 to 100 and measures how closely the Fund's performance matches (or doesn't match) the performance of its benchmark index.
30-day SEC Yield: The SEC yield should be regarded as an estimate of the fund's rate of investment income reflecting an estimated yield to maturity (assuming all current portfolio holdings are held to maturity), and it may not equal the fund's actual income distribution rate or the income paid to a shareholder's account. The yield shown reflects fee waivers in effect, if any. In the absence of such waivers, yields would be reduced. The fund may own treasury inflation protected securities (TIPS) or other inflation indexed securities. If so, the yield will reflect an inflation adjustment that is attributable to these securities. This adjustment and the resulting yield can be positive (in the case of inflation) or negative (in the case of deflation) during the period shown.
Unsubsidized 30-day SEC Yield: The unsubsidized yield shown is the SEC yield adjusted to reflect the gross expense ratio applicable to the class of shares shown and without regard to the contractual reimbursements and fee waivers required of the fund's investment manager and affiliates.
The 30-day yields may appear to be the same due to rounding.
The Columbia Inflation Protection Securities Fund and certain other funds own treasury inflation protected securities (TIPS) or other inflation indexed securities. For a fund that owns TIPS or other inflation indexed securities, the SEC Yield, when shown, will reflect an inflation adjustment that is attributable to these types of securities. This adjustment as well as the resulting yield can be positive (in the case of inflation) or negative (in the case of deflation) during the period shown. Absent the inflation adjustment, the yield shown may be materially different and may vary significantly from month to month, especially for a fund such as Columbia Inflation Protection Securities Fund which invests substantially in TIPS and other inflation indexed securities. In periods when the SEC yield is exceptionally high due to a rise in the inflation rate, it is important to bear in mind that the adjustment in the yield from the inflation rate may not be repeated.
Sharpe Ratio divides a fund's return in excess of the 90-day Treasury bill by the investment's standard deviation to measure risk-adjusted performance.
Standard Deviation is a statistical measure of the degree to which an individual value in a probability distribution tends to vary from the mean of the distribution.
Turnover Rate (fiscal year end%) measures the percentage of holdings that has been "turned over" or replaced, in the past year.
Average Coupon is a calculation of the total interest cost for a bond issue expressed as a percentage. The average coupon is equal to the total interest payments of an issue divided by bond year dollars.
Duration to Worst is the duration of a bond computed using the bond's nearest call date or maturity, whichever comes first. This measure ignores future cash flow fluctuations due to embedded optionality.
It is not possible to invest directly in an index. For index descriptions, click here.


Performance
Returns shown do not reflect any fees, expenses or sales charges imposed by your Contract or Qualified Plan, or imposed on Accounts that may own shares directly. Inclusion of these charges would reduce total returns for all periods shown.
Gross expense ratio: Fund expense ratios are calculated based on the Fund's average net assets during the Fund's most recently completed fiscal year (or based on estimated amounts for funds that have been in existence less than one year), and have not been adjusted for current asset levels. If adjusted for any decrease or increase in assets, expense ratios would be higher or lower, respectively, than the numbers shown above. Please see the Fund's prospectus for additional details.
Net expense ratio: Net expenses are after expense waiver/reimbursement. The investment manager and certain of its affiliates have contractually (for at least the current fiscal year) agreed to waive certain fees and/or to reimburse certain expenses of the Fund, as described in the Fund's prospectus, unless sooner terminated at the sole discretion of the Fund's board. Fee waivers/expense caps would limit the impact that any decrease in assets would have on net expense ratios in the current fiscal year. 
*Inception date shown is the share class inception date. The since inception returns shown are since fund inception. Returns shown for periods prior to the fund’s share class inception date include the returns of the oldest share class of the fund, adjusted to reflect higher class-related operating expenses, as applicable. In addition, the returns shown include the returns of any predecessor to the fund. Click here for more information.
It is not possible to invest directly in an index. For index descriptions, click here.
The Columbia Variable Portfolios and Wanger Funds (the "Variable Funds") are available only through variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies issued by participating insurance companies or certain eligible retirement plans. The Variable Funds are not offered to the public. Not all Variable Funds and classes are available in all contracts, policies or plans. Please contact your financial advisor or insurance representative for more information.
Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC serves as the investment adviser to the Columbia Variable Portfolios. Columbia Wanger Asset Management, LLC serves as the investment adviser to the Wanger Funds. The variable funds are distributed by Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc., member FINRA.


Performance
Effective 09/01/2016, performance reporting for Class A and Class AG with all sales charges reflects a maximum sales charge of 3.75% , except for the Columbia Conservative 529 Portfolio, FA Strategic Income 529 Portfolio, Columbia Income Opportunities 529 Portfolio, Columbia Total Return Bond 529 Portfolio, JP Morgan Core Bond 529 Portfolio, iShares TIPS Bond ETF 529 Portfolio, Templeton Global Bond 529 Portfolio and Columbia US Government Mortgage 529 Portfolio, which reflect a maximum sales charge of 3%. The Columbia College 529 Portfolio, Columbia Short Term Bond 529 Portfolio, Columbia Legacy Capital Preservation 529 Portfolio have no initial sales charges for Pricing Alternative A, but the Legacy Capital Preservation 529 Portfolio has a contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) for Pricing Alternative C.
Please consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. Contact your financial advisor or visit columbiathreadneedle.com/us for a Program Description, which contains this and other important information about the Future Scholar College Savings Plan. Read it carefully before investing. You should also consider, before investing, whether the investor’s or designated beneficiary’s home state offers any state tax or other benefits that are only available for investments in such state’s qualified tuition program.
Expense ratios are as of the plan's most recent Program Brochure & Tuition Savings Agreement. Performance may reflect waivers or reimbursements of fund expenses by the adviser or its affiliates. Absent these waivers, or reimbursement arrangements, performance results may be lower. The net and gross expense ratios shown are updated on the first day of each month.
Total returns assume the reinvestment of all underlying fund distributions at NAV. Portfolio unit value (PUV) returns do not include sales charges or contingent deferred sales charges (CDSCs). If they were included, returns would have been lower.
Pricing Alternative B: Public offering price (POP) returns are calculated with the effect of the applicable CDSC for the holding period after an initial purchase as follows: through the first year, 5%; second year, 4%; third year, 3%; fourth year, 3%; fifth year, 2%; sixth year, 1% and thereafter, 0%. These shares convert to Pricing Alternative A units in the eighth year after purchase. Effective December 1, 2010, Class B of each portfolio was closed to both new accounts and additional contributions to existing accounts.
Pricing Alternative C: Public offering price (POP) returns are calculated with the effect of a 1% CDSC for the first year after purchase except for the Conservative 529 and College 529 Portfolios as well as the single-fund fixed-income portfolios and the Legacy Capital Preservation 529 Portfolio, which have a 0.75% CDSC.
Pricing Alternative E: Units are sold only at portfolio unit value (PUV). Only eligible investors may purchase these units. See the program description for eligibility requirements and other important information.
Pricing Alternative Z: Units are sold only at portfolio unit value (PUV). Only eligible investors may purchase these units. See the program description for eligibility requirements and other important information.
Contributions initially invested directly into the Columbia Bank Deposit 529 Portfolio are not subject to the imposition of an initial or deferred sales charge under any Pricing Alternative.

The Overall Morningstar Rating for a retail mutual fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5- and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For share classes that do not have a 3-, 5- or 10-year actual performance history, the fund’s independent Morningstar Rating metric is then compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating.
For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ used to rank the fund against other funds in the same category. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, without any adjustments for loads (front-end, deferred, or redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star (each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages).
The Morningstar RatingTM is for Class Z shares only; other classes may have different performance characteristics and may have different ratings.
