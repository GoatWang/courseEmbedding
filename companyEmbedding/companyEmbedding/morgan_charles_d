“Charles Morgan tells how companies are built and wealth is created. It’s a story as American as apple pie–and proof again that America is rich in talent beyond her elite universities and privileged families.”

The life journey of Charles Morgan, from childhood to the present, is an inspirational story of tenacity, grit, adversity, vision and blind faith. Every college level business course should make his book required reading – a remarkable Horatio Alger adventure of one who never gives up.
— David Pryor, Former Governor & U.S. Senator
Matters of Life and Data is a compelling read, a page-turner of a memoir that sheds light on what it takes to be successful in business as well as on what it takes to live a fulfilling life. A fascinating book!
— William Dillard, Chairman and CEO, Dillard’s Inc

 
 
 




The book is like reading Atlas Shrugged, Peyton Place and the best of Car and Driver all rolled into one. Reads like a novel rather than autobiography. Written by a true legend of the big data movement.
— Harry Gambill, CEO (ret.) TransUnion, Investor, Philanthropist
Charles Morgan continues to be an exemplary, inspirational leader, an “idea man” who knows how to transform those ideas into action. Matters of Life and Data is as much a memoir of his brilliant, outside-the-box ideas as of his remarkable life and career–thus far! An enjoyable and engaging book written by a man it is a privilege to know and work with.
 — Madison Murphy, Chairman, Murphy USA

Arkansas Author, Charles Morgan, shares his memoir Matters of Life and Data
Arkansas’ own Charles D. Morgan (former CEO of Acxiom and current CEO of Privacystar) is ready to share his new memoir with the world. Read his journey as he took on big data and impacted millions of people across America. The heartfelt moments take you for an adventure from beginning to end.
“I didn’t set out to become a collector of your and your neighbors’ information. When I was growing up, nobody but egghead scientists talked about ‘data.’ It was the mechanical age, and I was a gadget geek, taking apart my cousin’s toys and trying to put them back together again. I was especially crazy about cars and engines, and had it not been for a fateful encounter during college recruiting season, I might’ve lived my life as a race car mechanic instead of learning about computers at IBM. As it turned out, pursuing Big Data allowed me the resources to become a professional race car driver on the side, competing against the likes of Paul Newman, who makes appearances in these pages as well…”
