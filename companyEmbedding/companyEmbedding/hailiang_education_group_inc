We estimate that we will receive net proceeds from the minimum offering amount
of approximately US$6.0 million, after deducting the commissions to the
underwriter and the estimated offering expenses payable by us, and net proceeds
from the maximum offering amount of approximately US$15.5 million, after
deducting the estimated commissions to the underwriter and the estimated
offering expenses payable by us.

We plan to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering for the following

technology systems and our                                                                        
general working capital           approximately US$1.2 million       approximately US$3.1 million  

The foregoing represents our current intentions based upon our present plans and
business conditions to use and allocate the net proceeds of this offering. Our
management, however, will have significant flexibility and discretion to apply
the net proceeds of this offering. If an unforeseen event occurs or business
conditions change, we may use the proceeds of this offering differently than as
described in this prospectus. To the extent that the net proceeds we receive
from this offering are not immediately used for the above purposes, we intend to
invest our net proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing bank deposits or debt
instruments.

In utilizing the proceeds of this offering, as an offshore holding company of
our PRC subsidiary, we may (i) make loans to our PRC subsidiary and affiliated
entities, (ii) make additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiary,
(iii) establish new PRC subsidiaries and make capital contributions to these new
PRC subsidiaries, and (iv) acquire offshore entities with business operations in
China in an offshore transaction. However, most of these uses are subject to PRC
regulations and approvals. For example:

• loans by us to our wholly-owned subsidiary in China, which is a 
  foreign-invested enterprise, cannot exceed statutory limit and must be    
  registered with SAFE or its local counterparts. The statutory limit for the 
  total amount of foreign debt to be incurred by a foreign-invested enterprise 
  is the difference between the amount of total investment as approved by the 
  Ministry of Commerce or its local counterpart and the amount of registered 
  capital of such foreign-invested enterprise. For example, the current amounts 
  of approved total investment and registered capital of Hailiang Consulting are 
  US$6 million and US$3 million, respectively. This means Hailiang Consulting 
  cannot obtain loans in excess of US$3 million from entities outside of China. 
  However, we may from time to time further increase such statutory limit by 
  making additional capital contributions and increase the total investment 
  amount to Hailiang Consulting, thereby increasing the statutory limit of the 
  loans Hailiang Consulting may obtain in the future based on our operational 
  needs;       

• loans by us to our affiliated entities, which are domestic PRC entities,over a 
  certain threshold must be approved by the relevant government authorities and 
  must also be registered with SAFE or its local counterparts; and                                                         

• capital contributions to our wholly-owned subsidiary must be approved by the 
  MOFCOM or its local counterparts.                                     

We intend to use the majority of proceeds from this offering for acquisitions
although we are not currently negotiating any acquisitions. In addition to
acquisitions, we currently expect that a portion of the proceeds of this 
offering will be used by Hailiang Consulting to provide better support to the
operations of our affiliated entities. Specifically, Hailiang Consulting will
make substantial investments with respect to leasehold improvements at our
schools, marketing to enhance our brand, recruitment of additional
administrative staff and enhancement of our information technology systems.
These uses of proceeds are for purposes within the business scope of Hailiang
Consulting. Hailiang Consulting received the necessary approvals from the
relevant PRC regulatory authority to include leasehold improvements within its
business scope in October 2014.

Meanwhile, we believe that our affiliated entities will have adequate cash from
their operations to support their own operation and expansion. However, if
needed, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the government
registrations or approvals required to transfer offering proceeds to our PRC
subsidiaries or affiliated entities on a timely basis, if at all. If we fail to
satisfy these requirements on a timely basis, our ability to remit the funds
received from this offering to capitalize our PRC operations may be negatively
affected, which could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and
expand our business.


The K-12 educational services market in China is rapidly evolving, highly
fragmented and competitive. According to the CCID Report, the total number of
private K-12 schools has increased steadily, from 89,383 in 2006 to 145,817 in
2013. The proportion of students in private K-12 schools against the total
number of students in K-12 schools also increased from 8.5% to 16.5% during the
same period. However, in 2012, the top six private schools in China, including
our Company, only enrolled 0.3% of the total private school students in China,
according to the CCID Report.

Because the market share of private K-12 schools is relatively small compared to
that of public schools, our primary competitors are public K-12 schools in areas
where we recruit our students. With respect to our basic educational program,
currently our major competitor in Zhuji is Zhuji No. 1 Middle School. With
respect to our international program, currently our major competitors are
Hangzhou No. 14 Middle School’s AP Center, The Affiliated High School of
Hangzhou Normal University International Department, and Hangzhou Foreign
Language School. We also face competition from Zhuji Ronghuai School, which is
the second-largest private school in Zhuji, where our three schools are located.
As we continue to grow our business through expansion and acquisitions, we also
expect to face competition from K-12 schools, both private and public, located
in other geographic regions where we will establish or acquire additional K-12
schools.

We believe that the competition in the K-12 educational services market is
generally based on school brand, student academic performance, parent
satisfaction, quality of teachers, campus size, and tuition fees. We expect
competition to persist and intensify. We believe that we are able to compete
effectively because of our strong brand recognition and established
international program. However, some of our existing and potential competitors,
especially public schools, may have access to resources that we do not have.
Some of these competitors, particularly public schools, have governmental
support in forms of government subsidies and other payments or fee reductions.
These competitors may devote greater resources, financial or otherwise, than we
can to student recruitment, campus development and brand promotion and respond
more quickly than we can to changes in student demands and market needs.


Company Description
We are the third largest provider of private K-12 educational services in China
and the largest provider of private K-12 educational services in the Yangtze
River Delta region (comprising Zhejiang province, Jiangsu province and
Shanghai), as measured by the total number of students enrolled in


 2012,
according to the CCID Report. According to the same report, in 2013, there were
145,817 private K-12 schools with 33.1 million enrolled students in China and
our national market share was 0.051% based on the number of students enrolled.
In 2012, there were approximately 10,728 private K-12 schools with 3.6 million
enrolled students in the Yangtze River Delta region, and our market share in the
region was 0.467% based on the number of students enrolled. We currently operate
three centrally managed schools through our PRC affiliated entities, namely
Zhuji Hailiang Foreign Language School, Zhuji Private High School and Tianma
Experimental School. These schools are all located in Zhuji city, Zhejiang
province in China. Our ultimate Cayman Islands holding company does not have any
substantive operations other than indirectly controlling Hailiang Investment,
our affiliated entity, which controls and holds our schools through certain
contractual arrangements.

As of December 31, 2014, 17,211 students were enrolled in our schools and we
employed a total of 1,219 teachers and educational staff. We are dedicated to
hiring teachers and educational staff who hold the necessary academic
credentials, are dedicated and active professionals in their field, and are
committed to improving their students’ academic performance.

We offer our basic educational program and international program at the
kindergarten, primary school, middle school and high school levels. Our basic
educational program offers curricula with courses mandated by the PRC regulatory
authorities, as well as those developed through our own research and development
efforts. Our international program also offers curricula mandated by the PRC
regulatory authorities and in addition, provides curricula with a focus on
preparing students to study abroad. As most of the students in our international
program plan to study abroad after they graduate from our middle school and high
school programs, we have designed our international program to specifically
address the needs of these students in terms of both language and academics. In
addition, for students planning to apply for undergraduate programs in the U.S.
and the U.K., we provide courses designed to help students become admitted to
these programs, such as A-levels courses for U.K. universities and SAT courses
for U.S. universities. We have steadily grown our international program from 250
students as of June 30, 2012 to 1,347 students as of December 31, 2014, and many
of our students have been accepted to top universities abroad.

With over 19 years of operation, we believe that we have become one of the most
well-known and respected providers of private K-12 educational services in the
Yangtze River Delta region. Both Hailiang high schools were recognized as “Key
Schools” and all of Hailiang middle schools and primary schools were recognized 
as “Model Schools” by Zhejiang’s Department of Education in recognition of a 
number of factors, including the quality of education, course design, teacher 
qualifications and feedback from parents. In 2012, Hailiang Education Group was 
listed as one of the “Ten Best-Known Private Education Brands in China” by the 
China Private Educationalist Association and as one of the “Most Competitive 
Education Groups” by Sina.com Education Channel.
