Learn about upgrading this memorial...Birth: Mar. 2,  1927Death: Aug. 30,  2007HANOVER Frank Elsner, Jr., P.E., departed from this part of life to be with his Lord on Thursday, August 30, 2007, with his family by his side, after a brief illness at the age of 80. Frank is survived by his loving wife of 56 years, Eleanor Jane Scholl Elsner. Frank was born on March 2, 1927, in Brooklyn, N.Y., the son of first generation German immigrants to the U.S.A., Franz and Johanna Elsner. He moved with his parents to Hanover in 1932. Frank left his high school career early to enlist in the U.S. Navy. Ensign Elsner served in the Pacific Theatre during World War II as a machinist for fleet support on the U.S.S. Pentheus LST. He spent the majority of his time in the Bikini Atoll islands in the South Pacific. Frank was discharged one week before the first test of the atom bomb. Upon his discharge from the Navy, Frank received his high school diploma from Eichelberger High School and went on to receive his Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from The Pennsylvania State University. After his graduation, he worked in Canton, Ohio, and Meadville, Pa., before moving back to Hanover to join his father's business, Elsner Engineering Works, Inc., in 1954. Upon his father's untimely death in 1967, Frank assumed the Presidency and Treasurer position until his retirement in 1993, spanning a 38 year career with the family business. Frank was Chairman Emeritus of Elsner Engineering Works, Inc., until his death. He was also President and Treasurer of EEW International, Ltd., for many years before its dissolution. Frank was a registered Professional Engineer and holds several patents. Frank was actively involved in his community, both civically and socially. He was former Chairman of the Board of the Hanover Hospital Board of Directors and served on that Board for 21 years. He was a founding member of the Clearview Fire Company #3 and was a consultant to the State of Pennsylvania in the development of Project 70 (Codorus State Park). He also served on the Hanover Water Works Commission for eight years for Hanover Borough. Frank was a member of St. Mark Lutheran Church in Hanover. He also enjoyed membership in the Hanover Country Club, BPOE Elks Lodge #763, Hanover Arcadian Club, Hanover Area Historical Society, American Legion Post #14, VFW Post #2506, Penn State Alumni Association, National Society of Professional Engineers, Society of Manufacturing Engineers, the Wedgwood Collectors Society, AARP, Pennsylvania and U.S. LST Associations, and Sampson WWII Vets. Frank was also a member of several Masonic organizations including Patmos Lodge #348, Ancient & Accepted Scottish Rite, in which Frank was a 32nd degree Mason, and Zembo Shrine in Harrisburg. Frank and his wife were avid sailors and boaters for many years. He enjoyed model building, photography, and travel. He and his wife visited six continents and over 60 countries during business and pleasure travels. Upon his retirement, Frank spent over two years building a scale working model replica of the LST on which he served during the war. This model was awarded the Best Steel Navy Ship by the U.S. Naval Academy Ship Model Society in 2000. Frank followed his father's footsteps as a director on the Adams County National Bank Board for 33 years and served in numerous committee capacities within this public banking institution during that time. In addition to his wife, he is survived by four children, Vivian Cullison and husband, L. Daniel of Hanover, Victoria Eckard and husband, Larry of Hanover, Debra Kinard and husband, Timothy of Gettysburg, and son, Frank "Rusty" Elsner, III and wife, Grace of Hanover. He is also survived by three grandchildren, Nicole A., Nathan L., and Natalie J. Kinard of Gettysburg; two stepgrandchildren, Hope Nicole and Chad W. Eckard of State College; his brother, Bertram F. Elsner and wife, Joyce of Hanover; his sister, Norma Garbani of Manitou Springs, Colo.; and numerous relatives throughout the USA, Germany, Austria, and France. Interment will take place immediately following the service at Rest Haven Cemetery, Westminster Ave., Hanover. Serving as casketbearers will be L. Daniel Cullison, Larry W. Eckard, Timothy L. Kinard, Nathan L. Kinard, Scott E. Ziegler, and Kent W. Ziegler.
