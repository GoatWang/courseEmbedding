                                         Since its founding in 2008, Veracyte has commercialized three genomic tests, which are transforming the diagnosis of thyroid cancer, lung cancer and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and collectively target a $2 billion market opportunity. Veracyte is based in South San Francisco, California. Veracytes common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol VCYT.

ABOUT US




      Veracyte is a pioneering genomic diagnostics company. Our tests are dramatically improving clinical outcomes for patients by resolving inconclusive results from traditional diagnostic methods. We ask the right questions to resolve ambiguity and bring assurance to light, rendering tens of thousands of costly and unnecessary surgeries truly unnecessary. We are giving patients a clearer path forward.
      Through scientific rigor we employ the best tools, best science and best minds to create tests that enable a more accurate diagnosis without the need for risky, costly and often unnecessary surgery. Veracyte consistently brings to bear evidence that is unprecedented in genomic tests, thereby changing today's clinical practice standards. We are making a difference in the lives of physicians and patients. We are doing something real.



Our Mission
To improve the lives of patients by resolving diagnostic uncertainty and reducing  risky, costly and often unnecessary surgeries.

Our Vision
To lead a transformation of diagnostics with a new genomic standard of truth.

ABOUT US




      Veracyte is a pioneering genomic diagnostics company. Our tests are dramatically improving clinical outcomes for patients by resolving inconclusive results from traditional diagnostic methods. We ask the right questions to resolve ambiguity and bring assurance to light, rendering tens of thousands of costly and unnecessary surgeries truly unnecessary. We are giving patients a clearer path forward.
      Through scientific rigor we employ the best tools, best science and best minds to create tests that enable a more accurate diagnosis without the need for risky, costly and often unnecessary surgery. Veracyte consistently brings to bear evidence that is unprecedented in genomic tests, thereby changing today's clinical practice standards. We are making a difference in the lives of physicians and patients. We are doing something real.



Our Mission
To improve the lives of patients by resolving diagnostic uncertainty and reducing  risky, costly and often unnecessary surgeries.

Our Vision
To lead a transformation of diagnostics with a new genomic standard of truth.

	                                I have seen first hand the impact an answer has on a patient’s life. I am in a relentless search for clear evidence. Evidence that I know will change clinical outcomes.
