Overview







								Clinical Programs: Immunology and Hematology							

Knopp is advancing dexpramipexole as an anti-inflammatory therapeutic based on extensive preclinical and clinical evidence of its activity in modulating white blood cells known as eosinophils. 




								KCNQ2 Preclinical Program							

Knopp is advancing novel agents to activate a key ion channel in nerve cells, targeting a devastating genetic mutation associated with neonatal encephalopathy, as well as epilepsy and neuropathic pain. 



Knopp's pipeline consists of investigational drug products that have not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. These investigational drug products are still undergoing clinical study to verify their safety and effectiveness.

Products and Programs



Clinical Programs: Inflammation and Hematology

Knopp is advancing dexpramipexole as an anti-inflammatory therapeutic based on extensive preclinical and clinical evidence of its activity in modulating white blood cells known as eosinophils.



Hematology Discovery Program

The selective arrest of eosinophil maturation using orally available drugs presents the potential for novel treatments for inflammatory disease. Knopp is focused on identifying and modulating the molecular mechanisms underlying eosinophil differentiation.



KCNQ2 Preclinical Program

Knopp is advancing novel agents to activate a key ion channel in nerve cells, targeting a devastating genetic mutation associated with neonatal encephalopathy, as well as epilepsy and neuropathic pain. 



Mitochondrial Discovery Program

The disruption of cellular bioenergetics has emerged as a common factor in pathways leading to cell death in ALS, Parkinson's, and other neurodegenerative disorders. Knopp's research is focused on small molecule modulators to improve mitochondrial efficiency.

Our Mission
The mission of Knopp Biosciences is to discover, develop, and deliver breakthrough medicines for devastating diseases and to improve global access to health care. We target diseases imposing high costs on the healthcare system, with patient populations clearly identifiable using validated biomarkers or genetic testing.
We predicate our work on the value of collaboration, the fundamentals of quality and safety, and an unwavering commitment to our patients, partners, shareholders, community, and colleagues.
Our Work
Our research has led to an investigational compound in clinical development for immunological and hematological disorders, as well as discovery platforms directed to small molecule mediators of epilepsy and neuropathic pain.
Days count for people with devastating diseases. That’s why we bring unmatched energy and a new level of collaboration with practitioners, investigators, and pharmaceutical companies in bridging the distance from the laboratory to the bedside.

Knopp's pipeline consists of investigational drug products that have not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. These investigational drug products are still undergoing clinical study to verify their safety and effectiveness.




				We are driven by our unwavering commitment to patients, our partners, and the bioscience community to revolutionize medicine.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
