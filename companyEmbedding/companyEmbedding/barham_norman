			Norman Barham, 74, has been a director since August 2004 and currently serves as Chairman of the Compensation Committee and a member of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board. Mr. Barham was Vice Chairman and President of Global Operations of Marsh, Inc., the largest diversified insurance brokerage and risk management services company in the world, from 1997 to 2000. Prior to joining Marsh, Inc., Mr. Barham held numerous senior management roles in various parts of Johnson & Higgins from 1975 to 1997, prior to the merger of Johnson & Higgins and Marsh & McLennan Companies, including President, Chief Technical Officer and Head of Global Property Insurance. Mr. Barham currently serves on the NYC Outward Bound Advisory Board. Mr. Barham was chairman of the board of directors of Coral Insurance Company ("Coral"), a Florida domiciled property casualty insurance company, from 2004 until April 2009. On April 9, 2009, Coral was placed into receivership for purposes of rehabilitation. The Florida Department of Financial Services was appointed receiver of Coral. 

We believe Mr. Barham's qualifications to serve on our Board include Mr. Barham's more than thirty years of experience in the insurance brokerage industry, particularly the numerous senior management roles held during his career, which provide him with unique insights that are particularly valuable to the Board, given the Company's significant use of brokers in both its insurance and reinsurance businesses.

It arrived in  England with the  Norman Conquest of 1066. The Barham family lived in any of several places of this name in the counties of Middlesex and  Kent having derived from the Old English words beorg, meaning hill, and ham, meaning homestead.Barham Early OriginsPDF Coat of Arms+ Extended History
    Buy PDF History »The surname Barham was first found in  Kent, where Barham is a village and civil parish in the City of Canterbury. It was listed as Bioraham in 799 and later as Bercheham in the Domesday Book.[1]CITATION[CLOSE]Williams, Dr Ann. And G.H. Martin, Eds., Domesday Book A Complete Translation. London: Penguin, 1992. Print.  (ISBN 0-141-00523-8) The first record of the surname was Warine de Berham, as holding lands in  Kent in 1203.Barham Spelling VariationsBarham Spelling VariationsIt is only in the last few  hundred years that the English language has been standardized. For that reason, Anglo-Norman surnames like Barham are characterized by many  spelling variations. Scribes and monks in the Middle Ages spelled names they sounded, so it is common to find several variations that refer to a single person. As the English language changed and incorporated elements of other European languages such as Norman French and Latin, even literate people regularly changed the spelling of their names. The variations of the name Barham include Barham, Bareham, Barrham, Braham, Bearham, Bereham and many more.Barham Early HistoryBarham Early HistoryThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Barham research.

Another 26 words (2 lines of text) are included under the topic Early Barham Notables in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.The Great MigrationThe Great MigrationFaced with the chaos present in  England at that time, many English families looked towards the open frontiers of the New World with its opportunities to escape oppression and starvation. People migrated to North America, as well as  Australia and  Ireland in droves, paying exorbitant rates for passages in cramped, unsafe ships. Many of the settlers did not make the long passage alive, but those who did see the shores of North America were welcomed with great opportunity. Many of the families that came from  England went on to make essential contributions to the emerging nations of Canada and the United States. Some of the first immigrants to cross the Atlantic and come to North America carried the name Barham, or a variant listed above: Barham Settlers in United States in the 17th CenturyAnthony Barham, who landed in Virginia in 1624 [2]CITATION[CLOSE]Filby, P.

It arrived in  England with the  Norman Conquest of 1066. The Barham family lived in any of several places of this name in the counties of Middlesex and  Kent having derived from the Old English words beorg, meaning hill, and ham, meaning homestead.Barham Early OriginsPDF Coat of Arms+ Extended History
    Buy PDF History »The surname Barham was first found in  Kent, where Barham is a village and civil parish in the City of Canterbury. It was listed as Bioraham in 799 and later as Bercheham in the Domesday Book.[1]CITATION[CLOSE]Williams, Dr Ann. And G.H. Martin, Eds., Domesday Book A Complete Translation. London: Penguin, 1992. Print.  (ISBN 0-141-00523-8) The first record of the surname was Warine de Berham, as holding lands in  Kent in 1203.Barham Spelling VariationsBarham Spelling VariationsIt is only in the last few  hundred years that the English language has been standardized. For that reason, Anglo-Norman surnames like Barham are characterized by many  spelling variations. Scribes and monks in the Middle Ages spelled names they sounded, so it is common to find several variations that refer to a single person. As the English language changed and incorporated elements of other European languages such as Norman French and Latin, even literate people regularly changed the spelling of their names. The variations of the name Barham include Barham, Bareham, Barrham, Braham, Bearham, Bereham and many more.Barham Early HistoryBarham Early HistoryThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Barham research.

Another 26 words (2 lines of text) are included under the topic Early Barham Notables in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.The Great MigrationThe Great MigrationFaced with the chaos present in  England at that time, many English families looked towards the open frontiers of the New World with its opportunities to escape oppression and starvation. People migrated to North America, as well as  Australia and  Ireland in droves, paying exorbitant rates for passages in cramped, unsafe ships. Many of the settlers did not make the long passage alive, but those who did see the shores of North America were welcomed with great opportunity. Many of the families that came from  England went on to make essential contributions to the emerging nations of Canada and the United States. Some of the first immigrants to cross the Atlantic and come to North America carried the name Barham, or a variant listed above: Barham Settlers in United States in the 17th CenturyAnthony Barham, who landed in Virginia in 1624 [2]CITATION[CLOSE]Filby, P.
