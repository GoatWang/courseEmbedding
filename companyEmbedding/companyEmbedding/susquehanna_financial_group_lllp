NEW YORK, June 11, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP (SFG), the institutional broker-dealer member of the Susquehanna International Group of Companies (SIG), announced today the appointment of Akir Gutierrez as its new Director of Research. Akir assumes the role after serving as Head of Product Management for the past four years and liaison to corporate managements delivering market intelligence. Prior to joining SFG, Mr. Gutierrez was a Director at Deutsche Bank for four years, and a Senior Vice President at Lehman Brothers for 11 years. His experience includes nine years in institutional equity sales, three years as a senior derivatives sales trader and three years as a product manager.
"Akir has a wide ranging skill set. He has helped shape our research product over the last four years working closely with our research analysts and sales," said Nick Wood, SFG's Co-Head of Equities and Head of Derivatives.  "We are confident in his abilities to lead the research department and look forward to the contributions he will continue to make at SFG."
"Over the past 4 years, SFG has more than doubled its fundamental equity research footprint, which now spans six major industry sectors (Financial, Consumer, Healthcare, Energy, Industrials, and Technology) covering approximately 300 companies.  In addition to expanding our fundamental research offering, we have built out two other highly respected teams -- Derivative Strategy and Event-Driven/Special Situations (including risk arbitrage, litigation, credit and distressed equity research)," said Wood. "That's a significant amount of intellectual capital we bring to bear for our clients' investment process."
