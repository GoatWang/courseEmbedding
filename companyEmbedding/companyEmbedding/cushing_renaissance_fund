Summary







 


Overall Rating

3 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 3 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 129 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.

What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average


This fund scores Average because it delivered returns that were in the middle 35% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average


This fund's expenses are rated as Above Average because they fall between the 60th and 80th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category.





How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average

This fund scores Above Average because Morningstar has rated its risk between the 60th and 80th percentiles when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average


This fund scores Average because it delivered returns that were in the middle 35% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

The "Mutual Funds" area at the top of each page allows access to mutual fund holdings with individual and joint Fidelity non-retirement accounts. Individual stock positions, ETFs and 529 funds are not available through this view. For the full list of your holdings visit Portfolio Summary.Mutual Funds are priced as of the previous business day's market close when the market is open. Mutual fund positions are priced as of the official market close (typically 4p.m.) and prices are generally available between 5 p.m. and 6p.m.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. No Transaction Fee funds are available without paying a transaction fee. No Transaction Fee funds will also be offered without a load or on a load waived basis. However, the fund may charge a short term trading fee or a redemption fee. Other fees and expenses, including those which apply to a continued investment in the fund, are described in the fund's current prospectus. Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC ("FBS"), or its affiliates, receives compensation in connection with (i) access to, purchase or redemption of, and/or maintenance of positions in mutual funds and other investment products ("funds"), (ii) infrastructure needed to support such funds as well as additional compensation for shareholder services, start-up fees, infrastructure support and maintenance, and other programs and/or (iii) a fund's attendance at events for FBS's clients and/or representatives, and opportunities for the fund to promote its products and services. This compensation may take the form of sales loads and 12b-1 fees described in the prospectus and/or additional compensation paid by the fund, its investment adviser or an affiliate. Additional information about the source(s) and amount(s) of this compensation as well as any other remuneration received by FBS or its affiliates will be furnished upon request.
2. The funds on the Fund Picks From Fidelity® list are selected based on certain selection criteria. Fund Picks From Fidelity is not a personalized recommendation or endorsement of any fund for an investor's individual circumstances.
3. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated.  Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.
4. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
5. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
6. Initial minimum investments into group retirement accounts such as Fidelity Simplified Employee Pension-IRA, Keogh, Self-Employed 401(k), and Non-Fidelity Prototype Retirement accounts are $500 or higher. Additional investments into Regular, IRA, and Group accounts are $250 or higher.
7. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
8. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
9. StyleMap® depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
10. Please note Regional Diversification information is based on the equity components only.
11. Expense caps and waivers are limits that the fund company has placed on the level of the expenses borne by the fund until 3/31/2018 and indicates the maximum level of expenses (with certain exceptions) that the fund would be paying until that time. After the expiration date, the expense cap and/or waiver may be terminated or revised, which may lower the fund's yield and return.


Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.  Although Fidelity believes the data gathered from these third-party sources is reliable, it does not review such information and cannot warrant it to be accurate, complete or timely.  Fidelity is not responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this third-party information.

Fund Objective: Seeks total return.


Distribution Yield: The distribution yield measures the percentage return in the form of dividends. It is calculated daily by annualizing the most recent dividend distribution and dividing by the daily share price (NAV or POP). If the Fund did not make a distribution as of the latest scheduled distribution date, "N/A" will be displayed.
12-month Yield: The 12-month yield measures the percentage return in the form of dividends. It is calculated monthly by taking the sum of the trailing 12-month dividend payments divided by the last month's ending share price (NAV or POP) plus any capital gains distributed over previous 12 months. If the Fund did not make any distributions over the previous 12 months, "N/A" will be displayed.
The SEC 30-day Yield is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share for the first 30 days of the month by the offering price per share at the end of that period. The yield reflects the dividends and interest earned during the period, after the deduction of the Fund's expenses. Yield reflects a fee waiver and/or expense limitation agreement without which the 30-day SEC Yield would have been lower.
Dividend distributions are the distribution of a dividend to mutual fund shareholders as of a certain date. The following Funds declare daily dividends: MainStay California Tax Free Opportunities, MainStay Floating Rate, MainStay High Yield Municipal Bond, MainStay Money Market, MainStay New York Tax Free Opportunities, MainStay Tax Advantaged Short Term Bond, and MainStay Tax Free Bond.

Expenses for MainStay Cushing Renaissance Advantage Fund are as of March 31, 2017.Total and Net Expense Ratio shown are from the most recent Fund prospectus fee table.

Before You Invest
The Fund’s investments will be concentrated issuers in the energy sector. Because the Fund will be concentrated in the energy sector, it may be subject to more risks than if it were broadly diversified over numerous industries and sectors of the economy.
All mutual funds are subject to market risk, including possible loss of principal.
Before considering an investment in the Fund, you should understand that you could lose money.
Securities purchased by the Fund that are liquid at the time of purchase may subsequently become illiquid due to, among other things, events relating to the issuer of the securities, market events, economic conditions, investor perceptions, or lack of market participants. The lack of an active trading market may make it difficult to obtain an accurate price for a security. As a result, an investor could pay more than the market value when buying Fund shares or receive less than the market value when selling Fund shares.
The Fund is a non-diversified, open-end management investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”). Accordingly, the Fund may invest a greater portion of its assets in a more limited number of issuers than a diversified fund. There are currently approximately 120 publicly traded MLPs. The Fund will select its investments in MLPs from this small pool of issuers together with securities issued by any newly public MLPs, and may invest in securities of private MLPs, affiliates of MLPs, and non-MLP issuers, consistent with its investment objective and policies. An investment in the Fund may present greater risk to an investor than an investment in a diversified portfolio because changes in the financial condition or market assessment of a single issuer may cause greater fluctuations in the value of the Fund’s shares.
Small- and mid-cap stocks are often more volatile and less liquid than large-cap stocks. Smaller companies generally face higher risks due to their limited product lines, markets, and financial resources.
The investment strategies, practices, and risk analysis used by the subadvisor may not produce the desired results.
Disclosure1. POP (Public Offering Price) is the NAV (Net Asset Value) plus a sales charge. All POPs are subject to revision and include the maximum sales charge.2. Average annual total returns include the change in share price and reinvestment of dividends and capital gain distributions. Effective after the close of business 7/11/14, Cushing® Renaissance Advantage Fund was renamed MainStay Cushing Renaissance Advantage Fund. Performance for Class A, C, and I shares reflect the performance of the then-existing Class A, C, and I shares of Cushing Renaissance Advantage Fund (which was subject to a different fee structure) for periods prior to 7/11/14, restated to reflect current sales charges. Performance for Investor Class shares reflects the historical performance of Class A shares adjusted to reflect differences in fees and expenses. Unadjusted, the performance of the new class would likely have been different. Class I shares are generally available only to corporate and institutional investors.4. No sales charge applies to Class A and Investor Class share investments of $1,000,000 or more ($250,000 or more with respect to MainStay California Tax Free Opportunities Fund, MainStay High Yield Municipal Bond Fund, MainStay New York Tax Free Opportunities Fund, MainStay Tax Advantaged Short Term Bond Fund, and MainStay Tax Free Bond Fund; or $500,000 or more with respect to MainStay Floating Rate Fund and MainStay Short Duration High Yield Fund). Effective January 1, 2017, a CDSC of 1% may be imposed on certain redemptions of such shares within 24 months of the date of purchase.Investment Definitions
The S&P 500® Index is an unmanaged index and is widely regarded as the standard for measuring large-cap U.S. stock-market performance. Index results assume the reinvestment of all capital gain and dividend distributions. The securities holdings and volatility of the Fund differ significantly from the stocks that make up the S&P 500 Index. An investment cannot be made directly into an index.The P/E Ratio (price-to-earnings) denotes the weighted average of all the P/Es of the securities in the Fund's portfolio. The P/B Ratio (price-to-book) is the weighted average of all the P/Bs of the securities in the Fund's portfolio. Return on Equity (ROE) is the weighted average of all the ROEs of the securities in the Fund's portfolio. ROE is calculated by dividing net income by book value. Standard deviation measures how widely dispersed a fund's returns have been over a specified period of time. A high standard deviation indicates that the range is wide, implying greater potential for volatility. Beta is a measure of historical volatility relative to an appropriate index (benchmark) based on its investment objective. A beta greater than 1.00 indicates volatility greater than the benchmark's. Alpha measures a fund's risk-adjusted performance and is expressed as an annualized percentage. R-Squared measures the percentage of a fund's movements that result from movements in the index. The Sharpe Ratio shown is calculated for the past 36-month period by dividing annualized excess returns by annualized standard deviation. The Annual Turnover Rate is as of the most recent annual shareholder report. Upside/Downside Market Capture measures a manager's performance in up/down markets relative to the Fund's benchmark.

The Energy Renaissance

The U.S. is home to some of the largest oil and natural gas reserves in the world. However, much of those reserves are trapped in layers of sedimentary rock, sometimes referred to as shale. It wasn’t until advances in shale drilling technology that it became possible and cost-efficient to extract these natural resources.
These advancements in shale drilling technology have allowed the U.S. to increase production of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids. This is creating a competitive cost advantage for the U.S. economy as energy prices here are considerably lower than in Europe, Asia, and most of the rest of the world. We believe this domestic energy advantage will benefit the U.S. economy, including industrial, manufacturing, engineering, and construction companies. In fact, many experts believe that advancements in these technologies create the potential for the U.S. to become energy independent by 2020.1 As more energy resources are tapped, infrastructure will need to expand in order to handle the increased volume.

The U.S. Is Producing More Crude Oil and Natural Gas

New York Life Investments engages the services of Cushing® Asset Management, LP, an unaffiliated, federally registered investment advisor, to subadvise the Funds.

All mutual funds are subject to market risk, including possible loss of principal. Before considering an investment in the Funds, you should understand that you could lose money.

Under normal circumstances, the Fund concentrates its investments in companies in the energy sector. Energy Companies are subject to certain risks as described in the prospectus.

The Funds are non-diversified, open-end management investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”). Accordingly, the Funds may invest a greater portion of their assets in a more limited number of issuers than a diversified fund. There are currently approximately 120 publicly traded MLPs. The Funds will select their investments in MLPs from this small pool of issuers together with securities issued by any newly public MLPs, and may invest in securities of private MLPs, affiliates of MLPs, and non-MLP issuers, consistent with their investment objectives and policies. An investment in the Funds may present greater risk to an investor than an investment in a diversified portfolio because changes in the financial condition or market assessment of a single issuer may cause greater fluctuations in the value of the Funds’ shares. The investment strategies, practices, and risk analysis used by the subadvisor may not produce the desired results.

MainStay Cushing MLP Premier Fund—MLPs and Other Natural Resources Sector Companies Risks: Under normal circumstances, the Fund concentrates its investments in the natural resources sector, with an emphasis on securities issued by MLPs. MLPs and other natural resources sector companies are subject to certain risks, including, but not limited to, the following:

– fluctuations in the prices of commodities;

– the highly cyclical nature of the natural resources sector may adversely affect the earnings or operating cash flows of the issuers in which the Fund will invest;

– a significant decrease in the production of energy commodities would reduce the revenue, operating income, and operating cash flows of MLPs and other natural resources sector companies and, therefore, their ability to make distributions or pay dividends;

– construction risk, development risk, acquisition risk or other risks arising from their specific business strategies;

– extreme weather conditions could adversely affect their securities;

– the amount of cash that the Fund has available to distribute to shareholders will depend on the ability of the companies in which the Fund has an interest to make distributions or pay dividends to their investors, the tax character of those distributions or dividends, and the U.S. federal, state, and local income taxes imposed on the Fund as a regular corporation (or “C” corporation);

– the profitability of MLPs and other natural resources sector companies are subject to significant foreign, federal, state, and local regulation in virtually every aspect of their operations and could be adversely affected by changes in the regulatory environment;

– there is an inherent risk that MLPs may incur environmental costs and liabilities due to the nature of their businesses and the substances they handle and the possibility exists that stricter laws, regulations, or enforcement policies could significantly increase the compliance costs of MLPs, and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary, which MLPs may not be able to recover from insurance;

– the operations of MLPs and other natural resources sector companies are subject to many hazards inherent in their business and since the September 11th terrorist attacks, the U.S. government has issued warnings that energy assets, specifically U.S. pipeline infrastructure, may be targeted in future terrorist attacks.

MainStay Cushing Renaissance Advantage Fund and MainStay Cushing Energy Income Fund—Concentration Risk: The Funds’ investments will be concentrated in issuers in the energy sector. Because the Funds will be concentrated in the energy sector, they may be subject to more risks than if they were more broadly diversified over numerous industries and sectors of the economy. MainStay Cushing Energy Income Fund and MainStay Cushing MLP Premier Fund: Holders of MLP units are subject to certain risks inherent in the structure of MLPs, including (i) tax risks, (ii) the limited ability to elect or remove management or the general partner or managing member, (iii) limited voting rights, except with respect to extraordinary transactions, and (iv) conflicts of interest between the general partner or managing member and its affiliates, on the one hand, and the limited partners or members, on the other hand, including those arising from incentive distribution payments or corporate opportunities.

The investment strategy of investing primarily in MLPs and being treated as a regular corporation, or “C” corporation, rather than electing to be treated as a regulated investment company for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is a relatively new investment strategy for open-end registered investment companies such as the Funds. This strategy involves complicated and in some cases unsettled accounting, tax, and net asset and share valuation aspects that cause MainStay Cushing Energy Income Fund and MainStay Cushing MLP Premier Fund to differ significantly from most other open-end registered investment companies. This may result in unexpected and potentially significant accounting, tax, and valuation consequences for the Funds and for their shareholders. In addition, accounting, tax, and valuation practices in this area are still developing, and there may not always be a clear consensus among industry participants as to the most appropriate approach, which may result in changes over time in the practices applied by the Funds, which, in turn, could have material adverse consequences on the Funds and their shareholders.

MainStay Cushing Renaissance Advantage Fund: Small- and mid-cap stocks are often more volatile and less liquid than large-cap stocks. Smaller companies generally face higher risks due to their limited product lines, markets, and financial resources.

MainStay Cushing Energy Income Fund: Unlike U.S. royalty trusts, Canadian royalty trusts and exploration and production companies may engage in the acquisition, development and production of natural gas and crude oil to replace depleting reserves. They may have employees, issue new shares, borrow money, acquire additional properties, and may manage the resources themselves. As a result, Canadian royalty trusts and Canadian exploration and production companies are exposed to commodity risk and production and reserve risk, as well as operating risk.

For more information about MainStay Funds,® call 800-MAINSTAY (624-6782) for a prospectus or summary prospectus. Investors are asked to consider the investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses of the investment carefully before investing. The prospectus or summary prospectus contains this and other information about the investment company. Please read the prospectus or summary prospectus carefully before investing.
