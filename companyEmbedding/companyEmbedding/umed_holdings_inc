P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Change from Last Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report. Exchanges report short interest twice a month. Percent of Float Total short positions relative to the number of shares available to trade.      Short Interest ()   N/A      ?    Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.

Partner to Deploy Proprietary Software in Order to Commercialize an Undeveloped Market in Oil and Gas IndustryHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreYahooSearchSearchSkip to NavigationSkip to Main ContentSkip to Related Content0UMED Holdings, Inc. and Rig Support Services, Inc. Partner to Deploy Proprietary Software in Order to Commercialize an Undeveloped Market in Oil and Gas IndustryMarketwire•October 23, 2012FORT WORTH, TX--(Marketwire - Oct 23, 2012) -  UMED Holdings, Inc. (  PINKSHEETS :  UMED ), a Texas Corporation, and Rig Support Services, Inc. (RSSI), reported today that the companies are partnering to deploy innovative software to commercialize an undeveloped market within the oil and gas industry.Currently, the oil and gas industry has exceptional technology for real time, down-hole operations and analysis. However, RSSI has identified industry shortcomings in maintaining the drilling rigs and the capturing/reporting of daily operations. Parts and services are still ordered manually, and current reporting practices are severely lacking. When service and new parts are needed, the resulting down-time creates losses measured in the tens of thousands of dollars per day or more in some cases. RSSI's proprietary software fills this technology gap with online infrastructure and support to bring independent drilling companies essential data leading to savings through shortening the down-time and saving cost on the replacement parts. Presently, we know of no similar solution that is available to independent oil and gas operators. "RSSI's easy to use online portal provides instant insight into parts order status and review, rig performance, production comparisons between rigs, spending analysis, employee productivity, and much, much more," said Ryan Wester, President of RSSI "Current users of our system report they are drilling faster and saving money which tells us our product works.""Oil and gas operators estimate between $50,000 and $80,000 per day is spent on services and parts per onshore rig. With over 1,800 rigs in operation in the US, 1,200 in Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana alone, RSSI has identified a critical segment of the operations and provided a solution that has an immediate, positive impact on the bottom line for these operators," said Kevin Bentley, CEO of UMED "With the majority of these operators being located in our backyard, we believe RSSI will grow rapidly now that word has spread about the effectiveness of our proprietary software solution."About UMED Holdings, Inc.
