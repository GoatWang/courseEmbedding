Electrical and Dyeing are sometimes collectively referred to as the “Huayang Companies.”  

Our Operations
            Our operations are based in Wuxi China. The operations include two business segments:

Forged rolled rings and related products 

Products for the wind  power industry  

Using precision forging technology we deliver high  quality, large forged rolled rings, yaw bearings and shafts for use in  large-scale windmills. We believe the combination of our advanced technological  expertise, a state-of-the-art production facility, and a well-established  long-term customer network sets us apart from our competitors. As a key  industry player, we are well-positioned to become a leading global wind  components supplier in the years to come. 

Products for other  industries

In addition to serving the needs of the wind industry, we  also manufacture and supply various types of heavy duty precision forgings,  fabricated components, and assemblies to other clean technology industries.

            Our operations feature a 4,500-ton press and a ring-rolling mill, employing our  advanced axial close-die forging technology, to manufacture rolled rings  measuring up to 6.3 meters in diameter and a cross section up to 700mm and  shafts used in wind turbine units, measuring 1MW-3MW. We also have a series of  workshops dedicated for fabrication, welding, machining and assembly of high  strength materials. We are ISO9001:2000 certified supplier and have strong  international management, engineering and technical capabilities, ensuring our  ability to meet the requirements of the most demanding global customers. 

Dyeing and Finishing Equipment


Products for the dyeing  and finishing operations of the textile industry.  

We design, manufacture and distribute a line of  proprietary high and low temperature dyeing and finishing machinery. We believe  that we are one of the leading domestic Chinese manufacturers of textile dyeing  machines, and our Huayang brand is nationally recognized. 
We have won local manufacturing awards for this business  and we hold six Chinese patents that cover an innovative production technique  enabling more-effective cloth washing in dyeing machines under high temperature  and pressure, the dyeing liquid mixing device, dyeing liquid atomizing device,  horizontal manipulated devices, mechanical seal and atomizer of the airflow  dyeing machine.  

We currently have the capacity to manufacture and  assemble approximately 550 textile-dyeing machines annually. Our  state-of-the-art and automated production line enables us to manufacture our  products efficiently, with lower labor and energy costs compared to traditional  manufacturing methods. As part of our manufacturing process, we make  corrosion-resistant stainless steel pumps and pressure vessels, which are not  only critical components for our dyeing and finishing products but have other  industrial applications as well.

Our dyeing and finishing products are generally compact  in design compared with alternatives on the market and feature a high degree of  both automation and mechanical-electrical integration. Our products are used in  dyeing yarns such as pure cotton, cotton-polyester, terylene, polyester wool,  poly-acrylic fiber, nylon, cotton ramie, and wool yarn. In 2010, we introduced  an advanced dyeing technology enabling a quick, economic and  environment-friendly operation designed for optimal performance. The liquid  pressure and quantity are adjusted to the respective type and quantity of  fabric. The special layout of the pressure pump circuit is designed to provide  constant and safe operations of the machine reducing resources wastage and  enhancing performance.
Our latest product innovations include a new  model of dyeing machine – high (low) temperature airflow dyeing machine to meet  the latest industrial environmental standards and a new after-treatment drying  and compacting machine which is used in the final finishing of knitted  material, such as cotton, and is designed to improve the softness, reduce  shrinkage and ensure better dimensional stability.  We are currently developing a new garment  washing machine for denim, capable of stone wash, enzyme wash and other water  washing techniques. 
Our Facilities
          Our operations feature a 4,500-ton press and a ring-rolling mill, employing our advanced axial close-die forging technology, to manufacture rolled rings measuring up to 6.3 meters in diameter and a cross section up to 700mm and shafts used in wind turbine units, measuring 1MW-3MW. We also have a series of workshops dedicated for fabrication, welding, machining and assembly of high strength materials. We are ISO9001:2000 certified supplier and have strong international management, engineering and technical capabilities, ensuring our ability to meet the requirements of the most demanding global customers.
The melting, forging, heat-treating and machining  capability at our facility allows for the manufacturing of a wide range of  custom-forged products. Multi-diameter shafts, gear blanks, mandrel-forged  rings and specialized shapes, are available in a wide range of sizes and  weights ranging from a few hundred pounds to over 25,000 pounds. Most popular  carbon and alloy AISI/SAE grades such as 1026, 1045, 4140, 4150F, 4340, and  8620 are readily available. We also have experience with the melting and  forming of specialized alloys. We believe that we are capable of producing  components that meet various industry specifications as well as  product-specific specifications.

Our manufacturing site covers over 1.1 million square feet.  In addition to our forging operation we have established state-of-the-art  fabrication, machining, assembly and finishing workshops to meet the  manufacturing needs of our clean technology focused customer base.

Cleantech Solutions International  is a manufacturer of high precision metal components and assemblies. The Company supplies fabricated products and machining services to a range of customers.  Many of these customers supply clean technology equipment such as wind turbines or require increasingly energy efficient equipment for their own manufacturing processes such as dyeing and finishing machines.  The Companyâs success has been built upon:

World Class Provider of Precision Forged and Fabricated Solutions

Leading-Edge Technology
          For our dyeing and finishing equipment customers in the textile industry, we design, manufacture and distribute a line of proprietary high and low temperature dyeing and finishing machinery. Our products feature a high degree of both automation and mechanical-electrical integration. Our products are widely used in dyeing yarns such as pure cotton, cotton-polyester, terylene, polyester wool, poly-acrylic fiber, nylon, cotton ramie, and wool yarn.  Our latest airflow dyeing units use air instead of water, enabling our customers to meet stricter environmental standards, reduce their input costs, and produce textiles with fewer wrinkles and less fabric damage.
For our wind power and customers in other industries, we manufacture and supply rolled rings and other related components. We use the latest axial close-die forging technology to manufacture rotary precision forgings, using forging equipment which we manufactured for our own use. The axial close-die forging technology reduces the use of raw materials by as much as 35%, provides a high precision and surface flatness, reduces the cutting output, has excellent mechanical strength and high flexibility, and is a fully automatic operation.

Welcome to Cleantech Solutions International, Inc         http://www.cleantechsolutionsinternational.com/ Cleantech Solutions International is a manufacturer of high precision metal components and assemblies. The Company supplies fabricated products and machining services to a range of customers. Many of these customers supply clean technology equipment such as wind turbines or require increasingly energy efficient equipment for their own manufacturing processes such as dyeing and finishing machines. The Company’s success has been built upon:  World Class Provider of Precision Forged and Fabricated Solutions  Leading-Edge Technology For our dyeing and finishing equipment customers in the textile industry, we design, manufacture and distribute a line of proprietary high and low temperature dyeing and finishing machinery. Our products feature a high degree of both automation and mechanical-electrical integration. Our products are widely used in dyeing yarns such as pure cotton, cotton-polyester, terylene, polyester wool, poly-acrylic fiber, nylon, cotton ramie, and wool yarn. Our latest airflow dyeing units use air instead of water, enabling our customers to meet stricter environmental standards, reduce their input costs, and produce textiles with fewer wrinkles and less fabric damage. For our wind power and customers in other industries, we manufacture and supply rolled rings and other related components. We use the latest axial close-die forging technology to manufacture rotary precision forgings, using forging equipment which we manufactured for our own use. The axial close-die forging technology reduces the use of raw materials by as much as 35%, provides a high precision and surface flatness, reduces the cutting output, has excellent mechanical strength and high flexibility, and is a fully automatic operation.  High-Quality and Outstanding Performance We believe top-quality is a must. Our impeccable reputation for delivering flawless precision components and assemblies is a result of our rigorous internal quality control process which exceeds even the most stringent quality requirements of our customers. Our leading technology and high-quality manufacturing facility enables us to deliver superior quality, high performance forged products and industrial machinery and components.

Die Forging for Greater Strength and Flexibility  We employ axial close-die forging technology in producing precision forgings, a technology for producing rotary precision forgings. We made the forging machine ourselves, providing a strong advantage in machine maintenance and cost compared to other companies using foreign equipment. Our rolled rings are essentially hollow cylindrical sections forged from a stainless steel stock of varying thickness and height. The rings are called rolled rings because of the nature of the forging process. Forging is a manufacturing process where metal is pressed, pounded or squeezed under great pressure to create high strength parts. Rolled ring forging turns a hollow round piece of metal under extreme pressure against a rotating roller, thereby squeezing out a single-piece ring without any welding required.  Although rings can also be manufactured through machining or casting, we believe that forging produces a finished product with greater strength and flexibility. A ring’s strength affects its fatigue resistance, and is determined by the orientation of the grain flow of the ring’s metal material. Unlike the machining process, which creates a unidirectional grain flow, or the casting process, which creates no grain flow, the forging process is designed to cause alignment and orientation of the grain flow in a direction creating maximum strength, thereby providing maximum fatigue resistance. This high strength property also reduces sectional thickness and overall weight of the ring without compromising the overall integrity of the finished product.  The Many Uses of Rolled Forged Rings High tangential strength and ductility make forged rings well-suited for torque- and pressure-resistant components, such as gears, engine bearings for aircraft, wheel bearings, couplings, rotor spacers, sealed discs and cases, flanges, pressure vessels and valve bodies. As such, rolled rings have a wide variety of applications. Presently, the majority of Chinese rolled ring producers rely on technologies such as the steam hammer and friction press, which consume large amounts of energy and cause pollution, and which, we believe, generate a less desirable product. Yaw bearings, which are found in every wind turbine, are made from rolled rings. Essentially, a yaw bearing is a large ring with teeth, all of which are either pointing outward or inward. The teeth allow the yaw bearing to engage with a smaller wheel attached to the yaw motor. The yaw motor turns the wind turbine so that the rotor (to which blades are attached) faces the wind in order to optimize electricity generation. The yaw bearing is used by the yaw motor to turn the wind turbine. Dyeing and Finishing Equipment Segment We design, manufacture and distribute a line of proprietary high and low temperature dyeing and finishing machinery to the textile industry. Our products feature a high degree of both automation and mechanical-electrical integration. Our products are widely used in dyeing yarns such as pure cotton, cotton-polyester, terylene, polyester wool, poly-acrylic fiber, nylon, cotton ramie, and wool yarn. Environmentally Friendly Airflow Dyeing Machines We now design and produce airflow dyeing machines, which use air instead of water. Water is used in the traditional dyeing process. We believe that our air-flow technology, which is designed to enable users to meet the stricter environmental standards, results in reduced input costs, fewer wrinkles, less damage to the textile, and reduced emissions. With the growing acceptance of our new dyeing technology and the China government’s mandate to phase out older machinery in China’s textile industry that does not meet the new environmental standards, we expect further success in the future. After Treatment Compacting Machines Our new after-treatment drying and compacting machine is used in the final finishing of knitted material, such as cotton, and is designed to improve the softness, reduce shrinkage and ensure better dimensional stability. We believe that our equipment offers performance similar to German and US imports at a more attractive price. Garment Washing Machines for Denim We are currently developing a new garment washing machine for denim. Made of stainless steel and customized for use by Chinese jeans manufacturers, the machine is capable of stone wash, enzyme wash and other water washing techniques. We believe that our machine will offer superior quality and performance at an attractive price relative to machines imported from Germany and the US, and expect it to be well received by potential customers.  Operations Our manufacturing site covers over 1.1 million square feet. We have established state-of-the-art fabrication, machining, assembly and finishing workshops and a state-of-the-art forging facility with a 4,500-ton press and a ring-rolling mill that employs our advanced axial close-die forging technology. This facility has an annual capacity of 50,000 tons.  We are leading specialists in the manufacturing of:  · Proprietary high and low temperature dyeing and finishing machinery to the textile industry 	· Large forged rolled rings, yaw bearings, tower flanges and shafts used in large-scale windmills 	· Stainless steel pressure vessel/chambers used in the manufacturing of multi-crystalline solar  wafers 	· Specialty, high tolerance, fabricated components and assemblies used in various clean technology  industries 	· Other fabricated and machined components, assemblies and equipment requiring high precision  manufacturing  Due to our extensive manufacturing capabilities that are especially well-suited for components required in wind turbine manufacture, we believe that we are a major Chinese manufacturer of important components for that industry including:   · Large forged rolled rings 	· Yaw bearings 	· Tower flanges and 	· Shafts used in large-scale windmills  At this facility we can manufacture rolled rings measuring up to 6.3 meters in diameter and a cross section up to 700mm and shafts used in wind turbine units, measuring 1MW-3MW. The melting, forging, heat-treating and machining capability at Cleantech Solutions International allows for the manufacturing of a wide range of custom-forged products. Multi-diameter shafts, gear blanks, mandrel-forged rings and specialized shapes, are available in a wide range of sizes and weights ranging from a few hundred pounds to over 25,000 pounds. Most popular carbon and alloy AISI/SAE grades such as 1026, 1045, 4140, 4150F, 4340, and 8620 are readily available. We also have experience with the melting and forming of specialized alloys. Cleantech Solutions International is capable of producing components that meet various industry specifications such as ASTM, ASME, ABS and AMS, as well as product-specific specifications.

The Exchange Traded Funds prospectus contains its investment objectives, risks, charges, expenses and other important information you should read and consider carefully prior to making an investment decision.
        Please review the current prospectus, available from the Prospectus link on www.motifinvesting.com, by phone at 1-855-586-6843, or in writing at Motif Investing, Inc., P.O. Box 3548, Rancho Cordova, CA  95741.
ETFs have unique features that you should be aware of, which can include distribution of any gains, risks related to securities within the portfolio, and tax consequences. The data quoted herein represents past performance and is not indicative of future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that your investment, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original value. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data provided.  Please review the prospectus or other research tools provided on this site for more recent information. Contact Motif Investing at 1-855-586-6843 to obtain the most recent month-end performance data.
The 30-Day SEC Yield reflects the dividends and interest earned during the past 30 days after the deduction of the ETF’s expenses.  The 30-day SEC Yield is an annual percentage rate based on the ETF's share price and is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share for the 30 days ended on the date of calculation by that day’s maximum share price.  The Distribution Yield is the trailing 12-Month End Yield derived by adding the trailing 12-month's income distributions and dividing the total by the last month's ending share price. Income refers to interest payments from fixed-income ETFs and dividend payments from stock-based ETFs.
The ETF prospectus is provided by DFS (http://www.rrdonnelley.com/financial-services/). The use of this prospectus is restricted solely to the website of Motif Investing and may not be redistributed, copied or otherwise made available without the express written consent of DFS. Donnelley Financial, LLC. d/b/a EDGAR Online and the information providers herein make no claims concerning the validity of the information provided hereby and will not be held liable for any use of this information.

Fixed income investments are subject to various unique risks, including changes in credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption,
    corporate events, tax ramifications, and other factors. Fixed income securities are subject to increased loss of principal during periods of rising interest rates.


The 1-Year Return/Return Since Inception indicates the performance of this particular motif over the last 12 months or, if the motif was created within the past 12 months, since the date the motif was created. See how we calculate returns.


The Motif Index level represents the performance of a benchmark motif (a motif in our catalog) over time. It is set at 
1000 on the date of inception of the motif. For example, a Motif Index of 1100 represents a 10% return since inception. Similarly, the change in the Index over a 
specified period represents the period return on the portfolio holding the same share weights as the benchmark motif.
The Motif Index is a measure created and maintained by the firm, which has the discretion to change the holdings that comprise the index and to make alterations to a particular Motif Index.


Popularity shows you how much interest a motif is attracting, compared to other motifs. We base this score on a proprietary formula that uses factors like how many people are viewing the motif, and how much conversation about it is happening in the community, in a range from Low-to-High.
The Volatility measurement for a Motif represents the annualized standard deviation of daily returns on a portfolio holding the same share weights as the Motif, and is measured in a range from Low to High. Since the standard deviation of returns are commonly used as a measure of portfolio risk, a Volatility measurement that is High is indicative of the fact that holding the motif in the past subjected the holder to larger fluctuations or higher risk.
The Valuation metric represents the present valuation of the stocks in the motif relative to the broader equity market. The Valuation metric is calculated as the composite Price-to-Earnings ratio for the stocks in the motif weighted by their respective share weights in a range from Low to High.


Standard pricing: $9.95 total commission per motif transaction. Other fees may apply. For details on fees and commissions, please

Why Cleantech Solutions (CLNT) Stock Is Soaring Today
Cleantech Solutions (CLNT) soared Monday after the metal components manufacturer reported its fourth-quarter results. Revenue increased 29.4% year over year to $22.8 million from $17.6 million mostly due to sales of the company's dyeing and finishing equipment thanks to the demand for Cleantech's low-emission airflow dyeing machines. Net income increased to $2.1 million, or 60 cents per basic and diluted share, from $0.5 million, or 17 cents per basic and diluted share, in the same period one year earlier. Operating expenses decreased 10.7% year over year to $3.1 million from $3.5 million, while operating income increased to $2.8 million from $0.7 million. Operating margin was 12.2% compared to 4.1% in the same period one year earlier. Adjusted EBIDTA rose year over year to $7.3 million from $4.8 million.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.
