SAN DIEGO, March 23, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Mirati Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:    MRTX) today announced the promotion of Jamie A. Donadio to Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, effective as of March 21, 2016. 
Mr. Donadio first joined Mirati in 2013 serving as Vice President of Finance. In his new role, he will be responsible for all corporate finance and accounting activities for the Company.








"We are pleased to expand Jamie's role," said Charles M. Baum, M.D., Ph.D., president and CEO of Mirati. "Since joining the Company in 2013 Jamie has been instrumental in building out our finance capabilities. As our pipeline progresses and our business continues to grow, sound financial planning and discipline will become even more important as we work to advance our rich pipeline of targeted cancer therapies. With over 15 years of experience in the bio-pharmaceutical industry and a deep understanding of our business we believe that Jamie is uniquely suited to lead our finance team moving forward."
Prior to joining Mirati, Mr. Donadio spent 12 years at Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Inc., most recently serving as Senior Director of Finance, where he was responsible for corporate finance activities including financial planning and analysis, treasury and capital formation strategy. Mr. Donadio has an additional five years of experience in corporate finance, having held previous roles at Novatel Wireless and Ernst & Young.   
About Mirati Therapeutics                                                                              Mirati Therapeutics develops molecularly targeted, single agent and immuno-oncology combination therapies intended to treat cancer. Mirati's approach combines the three most important factors in oncology drug development, 1) researching and developing drug candidates that target genetic and epigenetic drivers of cancer, 2) designing creative and agile clinical development strategies that select for patients whose tumors are dependent on specific driver alterations, and 3) leveraging a highly accomplished oncology precision medicine leadership team. The Mirati team uses a blueprint – proven by their prior work – for developing potential breakthrough cancer therapies, with accelerated development paths, in order to improve outcomes for patients. Mirati is advancing three drug candidates through clinical development for multiple oncology indications. More information is available at www.mirati.com.
