competitiveness in changing markets, structured portfolios through M&A and organic actions, and shaped cultures to attract, develop and retain key talent. As the first woman to lead a major national security corporation, Linda has transformed careers, companies and industries.  

 Previous to founding The Cardea Group, Linda served as President and CEO of BAE Systems, Inc. until Jan. 2014, where she led a global, U.S.-based defense, aerospace, and security company, wholly owned by London-based BAE Systems plc, with approximately 40,000 employees and $12.75 billion in annual revenue.​ She also served as an executive director on the BAE Systems, Inc. and BAE Systems plc board of directors. Prior to becoming CEO, Linda was president of BAE Systems' Land & Armaments operating group, the world`s largest military vehicle and equipment business, with operations around the world. Before joining BAE Systems, she served for seven years as an officer and vice president of the General Dynamics Corporation and was president of General Dynamics Armament and Technical Products. ​ ​Linda held a variety of senior management positions in engineering, production operations, program management, and business development during a period of significant consolidation in the defense industry. Beginning her career with the Harris Corporation and Ford Aerospace, she led organizations at Martin Marietta through the Lockheed Martin merger and a subsequent divestiture to General Dynamics. ​​​Selected to receive the USO’s 2011 Woman of the Year Distinguished Service Award, Linda has received numerous accolades and recognitions for her professional accomplishments and philanthropic activities. Recognized as an innovative leader and trailblazer, she has been featured in numerous periodicals such as the 
         Washington Post, 
         Wall Street Journal, 
         New York Times, and 
         Forbes. The London 
         Sunday Times proclaimed her “the first lady of defense.” 
         Currently, Linda is a director on the boards of the Bank of America, Southern Company and Ingersoll Rand. She currently serves on the non-profit boards of the University of Florida Foundation, Wake Forest University Charlotte Center, and Center for a New American Security, a bipartisan national security think tank. She is a member of the International Women's Forum and C200, the premier global organization of women business leaders.  Linda received C200’s 2011 Luminary Award for Corporate Innovation. She has been cited as one of Fortune Magazine`s 50 Most Powerful Women in Business and one of 
         Washingtonian Magazine’s 100 Most Powerful Women in Washington. 
         Washington Business Journal has named her one of its Power 100 and one of the Most Admired CEOs. She was inducted into the Washington Business Hall of Fame in Dec. 2013. Also in 2013, Linda received the Association of the US Army’s Dixon award for her industry leadership and contribution to national security. The Charlotte Business Journal honored her with their Lifetime Achievement Award in June 2015.​A graduate of the University of Florida, Linda earned her bachelor's degree in Systems Engineering with honors. She remains active in the alumni and athletic associations and serves on advisory boards for the College of Engineering.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/22/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.

Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes.
