1FSGCO–T’s NAV per common share as of the date indicated is the NAV determined by FSGCO–T for purposes of complying with the requirements of Section 23(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and has not been approved by FSGCO–T’s board of trustees. FSGCO–T’s NAV per common share may increase or decrease in the future and any such change may be material.
        

2The annualized distribution rate shown is expressed as a percentage equal to the projected annualized distribution amount per share (which is calculated by annualizing the regular weekly cash distribution per share as of the date indicated, without compounding), divided by FSGCO–T’s net asset value per share as of the date indicated. The annualized distribution rate shown may be rounded. The payment of future distributions on FSGCO–T’s common shares is subject to the discretion of FSGCO–T’s board of trustees and applicable legal restrictions and, therefore, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of any such future distributions. The sources of FSGCO–T’s cash distributions for the period from June 1, 2016 (Commencement of Operations) to December 31, 2016 were as follows: net investment income: 100%, expense reimbursement from FS Investments: <1%. The determination of the tax attributes of FSGCO–T’s distributions is made annually as of the end of FSGCO–T’s fiscal year based upon FSGCO–T’s taxable income for the full year and distributions paid for the full year. Therefore, a determination made on an interim basis may not be representative of the actual tax attributes of FSGCO–T’s distributions for a full year. The actual tax characteristics of distributions to shareholders are reported to shareholders annually on Form 1099-DIV.

1Shareholder returns (without sales charge) are the total returns an investor received for the highlighted period taking into account all distributions paid during such period, compounded monthly. The calculation of the shareholder returns (without sales charge) (during the period FSGCO–T offered shares to the public in its public offering), assumes that the investor purchased shares at FSGCO–T’s public offering price, excluding selling commissions and dealer manager fees, as applicable, at the beginning of the applicable period and reinvested all cash distributions pursuant to its distribution reinvestment plan (“DRP”). Valuation as of the end of each period is the repurchase price pursuant to FSGCO–T’s share repurchase program on such date and does not reflect any applicable contingent deferred sales charge (“CDSC”). Shareholder returns (without sales charge) do not include selling commissions and dealer manager fees, which could have totaled up to 4% of FSGCO–T’s public offering price, or any CDSC. Had such selling commissions, dealer manager fees and CDSC been included, performance would be lower. Upon liquidation or redemption, market conditions may cause the actual values to be more or less than the values shown. 
FSGCO–T is closed to new investors. FSGCO–T’s total operating expenses as a percentage of average net assets was 1.00% for the year ended December 31, 2016. Shareholders of FSGCO–T indirectly bear the expenses of the Fund, as FSGCO–T’s assets are invested in the Fund. The Fund’s total operating expenses as a percentage of average net assets was 4.61% for the year ended December 31, 2016.


2Shareholder return (with sales charge) is the total return an investor received since inception taking into account all distributions paid during such period, compounded monthly. The calculation assumes that the investor purchased shares at FSGCO–T’s public offering price, including the maximum selling commissions and dealer manager fees, at inception and reinvested all distributions pursuant to FSGCO–T’s DRP. Valuation as of the end of the period assumes such investor tendered all shares of FSGCO–T pursuant to its share repurchase program at the repurchase price on such date and was subject to the applicable CDSC. Had the investor not tendered his or her shares at the end of the period (and was therefore not subject to the CDSC), the Shareholder return (with sales charge) would be 13.7%. Upon liquidation or repurchase, market conditions may cause the actual values to be more or less than the values shown.
              

3Cumulative cash distributions per share reflect the total regular cash distributions paid since inception on a per share basis as of May 31, 2017. The payment of future distributions on FSGCO–T’s shares is subject to the discretion of FSGCO–T’s board
of trustees and applicable legal restrictions and, therefore, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of any such future distributions.

      View risk factors disclosure




Investments in FSGCO are made indirectly through FSGCO–T. FSGCO is a separate non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that carries out the investment strategies generally described herein. An investment in FSGCO–T involves a high degree of risk and may be considered speculative. The following are some of the risks an investment in FSGCO–T’s common shares involves; however, investors should carefully consider all of the risks discussed in FSGCO–T’s reports filed with the SEC.

An investment in common shares is not suitable for an investor if they need access to the money they invest.
Shareholders should consider that they may not have access to the money they invest for an indefinite period of time.
Unlike an investor in most closed-end funds, FSGCO–T’s shareholders should not expect to be able to sell their common shares regardless of how FSGCO–T performs.
If a shareholder is able to sell their common shares, the shareholder will likely receive less than their purchase price and the then-current NAV per common share.
Investors in the FSGCO–T’s common shares are subject to an annual distribution fee of 1.33% of the NAV of the common shares, which will ﻿begin accruing on July 1, 2017, and also will be subject to a contingent deferred sales charge if they tender their common shares for repurchase by FSGCO–T at any time prior to the third anniversary of the date on which the distribution fee begins to accrue. The maximum contingent deferred sales charge is 1.00%, which assumes a shareholder tenders his or her common shares prior to the first anniversary of the date on which the distribution fee begins to accrue.
Unlike most closed-end funds, FSGCO–T’s common shares are not listed on any securities exchange and FSGCO–T intends to evaluate completing a liquidity event within seven years following December 12, 2013, the date on which FSGCO commenced investment operations. The distribution fee will terminate for all shareholders upon the occurrence of a liquidity event. As such, there may be a conflict of interest relating to the timing with which FS Global Advisor, LLC seeks to complete a liquidity event for shareholders.
To provide shareholders with limited liquidity, FSGCO–T intends to conduct quarterly repurchases of shares. Although FSGCO–T has implemented a share repurchase program, it may be discontinued at any time and only a limited number of shares are eligible for repurchase. In addition, shares may be subject to a contingent deferred sales charge.
FSGCO–T’s distributions may be funded from unlimited amounts of offering proceeds or borrowings, which may constitute a return of capital and reduce the amount of capital available to FSGCO–T for investment. Any capital returned to shareholders through distributions will be distributed after payment of fees and expenses, as well as the sales load.
FSGCO–T’s and FSGCO’s previous distributions to shareholders were funded in significant part from the reimbursement of certain expenses, including through the waiver of certain investment advisory fees, and additional support payments that may be subject to repayment to FSGCO–T’s and FSGCO’s affiliate, FS Investments, and FSGCO–T's and FSGCO's future distributions may be funded from such waivers, reimbursements or payments. Significant portions of these distributions were not based on FSGCO's investment performance, and such waivers, reimbursements and payments by FS Investments may not continue in the future. If FS Investments had not agreed to reimburse certain of FSGCO–T’s or FSGCO’s expenses, including through the waiver of certain advisory fees payable by FSGCO, and provide additional support payments, significant portions of FSGCO–T's and FSGCO's distributions would have come from offering proceeds or borrowings. The repayment of any amounts owed to FS Investments will reduce the future distributions to which FSGCO–T's shareholders would otherwise be entitled.
Even if FSGCO does eventually list its shares, shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount to NAV, and this creates a risk of loss for investors who purchase shares at the offering price. This risk is separate and distinct from the risk that FSGCO–T’s NAV will decrease.
FSGCO’s investments in securities and other obligations of companies that are experiencing distress involve a substantial degree of risk, require a high level of analytical sophistication for successful investment and require active monitoring.
FSGCO’s investments in various types of debt securities and instruments may be secured, unsecured, rated or unrated, are subject to non-payment risk, and may be speculative in nature.
Below investment grade instruments (commonly referred to as “high yield” securities or “junk bonds”) may be particularly susceptible to economic downturns, which could cause losses.
FSGCO may invest in illiquid and restricted securities that may be difficult to dispose of at a fair price.
FSGCO’s use of leverage could result in special risks for FSGCO’s shareholders, including FSGCO–T, and can magnify the effect of any losses.
Investments in certain securities or other instruments of non-U.S. issuers or borrowers may involve factors not typically associated with investing in the United States or other developed countries.
Securities or other instruments of non-U.S. securities may be traded in underdeveloped, inefficient and less liquid markets and may experience greater price volatility, illiquidity and changes in value.
FS Global Advisor, LLC, GSO Capital Partners LP and certain of their affiliates may experience conflicts of interest in connection with the management of FSGCO.
FSGCO–T and FSGCO have limited operating histories and are subject to the business risks and uncertainties associated with any new business.
FSGCO seeks to achieve its investment objectives by focusing on a limited number of opportunities across the investment universe.

1Shareholder Returns (Without Sales Charge) are the total returns an investor received for the highlighted period taking into account all distributions paid during such period, compounded monthly. The calculation assumes that the investor purchased
shares at FSGCO-T2’s public offering price, excluding selling commissions and dealer manager fees, at the beginning of the applicable period and reinvested all cash distributions pursuant to FSGCO-T2’s distribution reinvestment plan (“DRP”).
Valuation as of the end of each period is the repurchase price pursuant to FSGCO-T2’s share repurchase program on such date and does not reflect any applicable contingent deferred sales charge (“CDSC”). Shareholder returns (without sales charge)
do not include selling commissions and dealer manager fees, which could total up to 4.0% of FSGCO-T2’s public offering price or any CDSC. Had such selling commissions, dealer manager fees and CDSC been included, performance would be lower.
Upon liquidation or repurchase, market conditions may cause the actual values to be more or less than the values shown.FSGCO-T2’s total operating expenses as a percentage of average net assets was 1.00% for the period from June 1, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December
31, 2016. Shareholders of FSGCO-T2 indirectly bear the expenses of the Fund, as FSGCO-T2’s assets are invested in the Fund. The Fund’s total operating expenses as a percentage of average net assets was 4.61% for the year ended December 31,
2016. See FSGCO-T2's prospectus for additional information regarding applicable fees and expenses, including additional annual expenses to which shareholders of FSGCO-T2 are subject.
              

2Shareholder Return (With Sales Charge) is the total return an investor received since inception taking into account all distributions paid during such period, compounded monthly. The calculation assumes that the investor purchased shares
at FSGCO-T2’s public offering price, including the maximum selling commissions and dealer manager fees, at inception and reinvested all distributions pursuant to FSGCO-T2’s DRP. Valuation as of the end of the period assumes such investor tendered
all shares of FSGCO-T2 pursuant to its share repurchase program at the repurchase price on such date and was subject to the applicable CDSC, as further described in FSGCO-T2’s prospectus. Had the investor not tendered his or her shares at the
end of the period (and was therefore not subject to the CDSC), the Shareholder return (with sales charge) would be 13.7%. Upon liquidation or repurchase, market conditions may cause the actual values to be more or less than the values shown.
              

3Cumulative cash distributions per share reflect the total regular cash distributions paid since inception on a per share basis as of May 31, 2017. The payment of future distributions on FSGCO-T2’s shares is subject to the discretion of FSGCO-T2’s board
of trustees and applicable legal restrictions and, therefore, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of any such future distributions.

1Registered shares means the shares registered on the registration statement relating to FSGCO–T2’s initial public offering that was initially declared effective by the SEC on June 20, 2017, as amended.
        

2Total AUM represents the total assets of FSGCO. Investments in FSGCO are made indirectly through FSGCO–A, FSGCO–D, FSGCO–T, FSGCO–ADV and FSGCO–T2.
        

3Sponsor commitment means the aggregate investments in FSGCO–T2, FSGCO–T, FSGCO–A, FSGCO–D and FSGCO–ADV made by investors affiliated with FS Global Advisor, LLC and GSO Capital Partners LP, including members of FSGCO–T2’s board of trustees.
        

4Calculated as a percentage of fair value. Fair value is determined by FSGCO’s board of trustees.
        

5The payment of distributions on FSGCO–T2’s common shares is subject to the discretion of FSGCO–T2’s board of trustees and applicable legal restrictions and, therefore, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of any such distributions.
        

6FSGCO–T2 intends to repurchase a limited number of shares pursuant to its share repurchase program. FSGCO–T2 may amend, suspend or terminate its share repurchase program at any time. FSGCO–T2 will offer to repurchase common shares at a price equal to NAV per common share in effect on each date of repurchase; however, common shares will be subject to a contingent deferred sales charge if they are tendered within a certain period of time. See FSGCO–T2’s prospectus for additional information regarding the share repurchase program.
        







      View risk factors disclosure




Investments in FSGCO are made indirectly through FSGCO–T2, which invests substantially all of the net proceeds from its public offering in common shares of FSGCO. FSGCO is a separate non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that carries out the investment strategies generally described herein. An investment in FSGCO–T2 involves a high degree of risk and may be considered speculative. The following are some of the risks an investment in FSGCO–T2’s common shares involves; however, investors should carefully consider all of the risks discussed in FSGCO–T2’s prospectus, including the risk factors set forth under the heading entitled “Types of Investments and Related Risks,” before deciding to invest in FSGCO–T2’s common shares.An investment in common shares is not suitable for an investor if they need access to the money they invest.Shareholders should consider that they may not have access to the money they invest for an indefinite period of time.Unlike an investor in most closed-end funds, FSGCO–T2’s shareholders should not expect to be able to sell their common shares regardless of how FSGCO–T2 performs.If a shareholder is able to sell their common shares, the shareholder will likely receive less than their purchase price and the then-current NAV per common share.Investors in the FSGCO–T2’s common shares are subject to an annual distribution fee of 1.33% of the NAV of the common shares, which will begin to accrue on the first day of the first fullcalendar month following the final weekly closing in FSGCO–T2’s offering, and also will be subject to a contingent deferred sales charge if they tender their common shares for repurchase by FSGCO–T2 at any time prior to the third anniversary of the date on which the distribution fee begins to accrue. The maximum contingent deferred sales charge is 1.00%, which assumes a shareholder tenders his or her common shares prior to the first anniversary of the date on which the distribution fee begins to accrue.Unlike most closed-end funds, FSGCO–T2’s common shares are not listed on any securities exchange and FSGCO–T2 intends to evaluative completing a liquidity event within-seven years following December 12, 2013, the date on which FSGCO commenced investment operations. The distribution fee will terminate for all shareholders upon the occurrence of a liquidity event. As such, there may be a conflict of interest relating to the timing with which FS Global Advisor, LLC seeks to complete a liquidity event for shareholders.To provide shareholders with limited liquidity, FSGCO–T2 intends to conduct quarterly repurchases of shares. Although FSGCO–T2 has implemented a share repurchase program, it may be discontinued at any time and only a limited number of shares are eligible for repurchase.FSGCO–T2’s distributions may be funded from unlimited amounts of offering proceeds or borrowings, which may constitute a return of capital and reduce the amount of capital available to FSGCO–T2 for investment. Any capital returned to shareholders through distributions will be distributed after payment of fees and expenses, as well as the sales load.FSGCO’s previous distributions to shareholders were funded in significant part from the reimbursement of certain expenses, including through the waiver of certain investment advisory fees, and additional support payments that may be subject to repayment to FSGCO–T2’s and FSGCO’s affiliate, FS Investments, and FSGCO–T2’s and FSGCO’s future distributions may be funded from such waivers, reimbursements or payments. Significant portions of these distributions were not based on FSGCO’s investment performance, and such waivers, reimbursements and payments by FS Investments may not continue in the future. If FS Investments had not agreed to reimburse certain of FSGCO–T2’s or FSGCO’s expenses, including through the waiver of certain advisory fees payable by FSGCO, and provide additional support payments, significant portions of FSGCO’s distributions would have come from offering proceeds or borrowings. The repayment of any amounts owed to FS Investments will reduce the future distributions to which FSGCO–T2’s shareholders would otherwise be entitled.Even if FSGCO does eventually list its shares, shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount to NAV, and this creates a risk of loss for investors who purchase shares at the offering price. This risk is separate and distinct from the risk that FSGCO–T2's﻿ NAV will decrease.FSGCO’s investments in securities and other obligations of companies that are experiencing distress involve a substantial degree of risk, require a high level of analytical sophistication for successful investment and require active monitoring.FSGCO’s investments in various types of debt securities and instruments may be secured, unsecured, rated or unrated, are subject to non-payment risk, and may be speculative in nature. Below investment grade instruments (commonly referred to as “high yield” securities or “junk bonds”) may be particularly susceptible to economic downturns, which could cause losses. FSGCO may invest in illiquid and restricted securities that may be difficult to dispose of at a fair price.FSGCO’s use of leverage could result in special risks for FSGCO’s shareholders, including FSGCO–T2, and can magnify the effect of any losses.Investments in certain securities or other instruments of non-U.S. issuers or borrowers may involve factors not typically associated with investing in the United States or other developed countries.Securities or other instruments of non-U.S. securities may be traded in underdeveloped, inefficient and less liquid markets and may experience greater price volatility, illiquidity and changes in value.FS Global Advisor, LLC, GSO Capital Partners LP and certain of their affiliates may experience conflicts of interest in connection with the management of FSGCO.FSGCO–T2 has no operating history and FSGCO has a limited operating history and are subject to the business risks and uncertainties associated with any new business.FSGCO seeks to achieve its investment objectives by focusing on a limited number of opportunities across the investment universe.The public offering by FSGCO–T2 is being made on a “best efforts” basis. To the extent that less than the maximum number of common shares is subscribed for, the opportunity for the allocation of FSGCO’s investments among various issuers and industries may be decreased, and the returns achieved on those investments may be reduced as a result of allocating all of FSGCO’s expenses over a smaller capital base.







To invest in FSGCO–T2, an investor must have either (i) a net worth (not including home, furnishings and personal automobiles) of at least $70,000 and an annual gross income of at least $70,000, or (ii) a net worth (not including home, furnishings and personal automobiles) of at least $250,000. Please consult the prospectus for a detailed description of the suitability standards imposed on investors.Corporate governanceFS Investment Solutions, LLC | 201 Rouse Boulevard | Philadelphia, PA 19112877-372-9880 | Member FINRA/SIPC
