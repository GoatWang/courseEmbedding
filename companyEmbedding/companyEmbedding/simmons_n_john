John Simmons



John Simmons, GNP Comedy



Born
Fort Belvoir, Virginia, United States


John Simmons (born in Fort Belvoir, Virginia) is an American actor, comedian, founder Gross National Product Comedy[1] and Washington, D.C.'s Scandal Tours.[2]
Gross National Product Comedy is a comedy production company whose troupes have appeared on TV and radio, in their own PBS comedy specials and stage shows in New York and Los Angeles, and have been called Washington D.C.'s "comic monument" and "the capital's resident satirical gang".[citation needed]
John Simmons, son of a National Security Agency (NSA) employee, supposedly grew up amid the spy community in Washington, D.C. during the Cold War. It was life as normal, as far as he knew, to live at remote electronic listening posts, to "pop in and out of Washington every once in a while," to attend a different school and make new friends every two years. That didn't bother him at all. "It was fun, and it helped me prepare for this wacky life style."[citation needed]
He attended the University of North Carolina and then spent a year abroad at the University of Kent in Canterbury. He studied theatre and history ("not theatre history", he emphasizes), then ended up dropping the theatre and graduating in history and journalism. "I like history more than anything. I think that may be why I make fun of the news. The kind of stupidity that's going on now has just been repeated through the centuries; it's nothing new."[citation needed]
The idea of becoming involved in comedy goes bock to Simmons' very early years; he never really wanted to do anything else. "I wanted to have a comedy group, but it didn't seem right. It didn't seem like it was attainable, for some reason. There's no career path for comedy, is there? You don't go to Slapstick University. Comedy was a real fringe area when I was growing up; stand-up comedy wasn't especially popular then. And improv comedy today is still considered a stepchild to stand-up."
In 1980, following the year abroad, he got a job as a reporter for CCH (Commerce Clearing House), a "really boring" law publications company, and formed Gross National Product (under another name) for excitement and fun. "I lived this kind of Clark Kent existence. But it was a really great cover. I could go in, look at the Wire service, and if nothing was going on I'd just go home and go to bed. It did give me access to press conferences at the White House and lots of government agencies, but to translate what really goes on at that bureaucratic level is impossible. It's so inside the Beltway that you can't really make fun of it, so you go after what's in the news." GNP was one of the first comedy groups in Washington DC. "There was no venue for comedy then; we played in rock clubs." They did a lot of revues, performed in all the clubs in DC and Baltimore, MD, and developed a loyal following. In 1982, while continuing in DC, they started performing in clubs all over New York City. Then Simmons put GNP on hiatus for a two-year interval, 1984–86, when he came to Los Angeles to "check it out". His stay in Los Angeles included engagements at the Cast Theatre, The Comedy Store, and as understudy to John Roarke in the Odyssey Theatre's[3] RAP MASTER RONNIE. The satirical and political theme of his comedy continued regardless of location. Upon returning to Washington, D.C., he revived GNP with a new cast and their popularity resumed. The original 80-seat space eventually proved to be too small, and in 1988 they moved to a larger 300-seat venue at The Bayou, the largest night club in Washington DC. Also in 1988, GNP inaugurated their Scandal Tours, an irreverent bus tour of the notorious scandal spots in DC.[2]
What might explain the transition from a patriotic, NSA-oriented young boy to someone who looks at the political and social world with such a cynical eye? "Washingtonians are pretty cynical people: it's the political people and the people who work for them who are usually serious. I'm the product of a very cynical age. When I was in high school, the Watergate scandal was happening. The people that I associated with were the sons and daughters of reporters and that ilk, so we had a good time during Watergate. When you live in Washington and see this parade of "out-of-towners" every four years, you make fun of them. Some of them are real dorks, many of them are there because of political-favor appointments, and they always roll in with this sense of greatness. People in Washington are up on what's happening and they want to make fun. So we started to make fun of Congress and the Executive Branch."
Just as Simmons grew up with Watergate, GNP grew up with President Ronald Reagan, their favorite target for several years. "But we make fun of liberals, too. It depends on who's in power." The ability to adapt to a constantly changing world keeps GNP's revues up to the minute in content. For example: "The LA situation cannot be ignored. Right now, right here, the entire focus of a political debate has shifted. We're in the center at what's going on. It's a tragedy, just like the Contra thing, but somehow it's government with their pants down, and they look foolish."

Press Release
Simmons Launches Bold New Beautyrest® And Comforpedic® Collections, Completing Company Transformation Begun In 2011





Simmons
January 27, 2013













Simmons caps company transformation with history-making product launch
(ATLANTA – Jan. 28, 2013) - Simmons Bedding Companyʼs transformation is now officially complete – with the occasion marked by one of the largest and most significant product launches in company history. Simmons is announcing the new BEAUTYREST® and COMFORPEDIC FROM BEAUTYREST™ collections at this weekʼs Las Vegas Furniture Market. This launch builds on the extremely successful BEAUTYREST TruEnergy® and COMFORPEDIC lines that were launched in the past year and unveils new innovations in nearly seventy percent of the product offering.
“Simmonsʻ transformation is now complete,” says CEO Gary Fazio, “and we are firmly Moving Forward Fully Charged. Though our commitment to consumer-driven innovation, we have developed product lines whose success has reestablished Simmons as a leader in the premium bedding market – a success  that we will continue to build on going forward.”
Beyond product innovation, the company intends to continue its investment in brand building, with a commitment to deliver a stunning two billion consumer impressions through national advertising in 2013 – almost twice the amount delivered in 2012.  The advertising will continue to build on the “Recharge” message started in 2012, challenging consumers to Live Life Fully Charged™.
New BEAUTYREST Collections Deliver Recharging Sleep 
The BEAUTYREST RECHARGE™ and BEAUTYREST RECHARGE WORLD CLASS™ collections combine the conforming back support of BEAUTYREST POCKETED COIL® technology with the cool sleeping comfort of AIRCOOL® foams to deliver Recharging Sleep™ so that consumers can Live Fully Charged™. Striking aesthetics and luxurious fabrics reflect the advanced design and craftsmanship that are hallmarks of the new collections.
Simmons was one of the first companies to challenge industry convention by incorporating memory foam and pocketed coils into one design with their TRUENERGY line - a design that is now being mimicked by others in the industry. These new collections build on that success by both refining this technology and expanding it to a broader range of price points.
Additionally, as a pledge of confident allegiance to the line, Simmons is proud to announce that it is extending its limited warranty to 25 years across the full BEAUTYREST line.
The RECHARGE WORLD CLASS collection has 14 models with a suggested retail price range of $1,399 to $1,999. The line features 1,000 density BEAUTYREST POCKETED COIL springs for conforming back support and exceptional comfort, and all models feature TRUTEMP™ Gel to absorb, store and release excessive warmth to help provide for comfortable temperature zone. The RECHARGE WORLD CLASS collection also offers AIRCOOL Memory Foam in all models.
All upper-end RECHARGE WORLD CLASS models feature AIRCOOL Memory Foam with Micro GelTouch™ foam, which provide conformance, pressure relief, temperature management and good airflow, and 2,000 density BEAUTYREST POCKETED COIL springs via a micro POCKETED COIL® construction that provides an extra layer of micro POCKETED COIL springs for enhanced pressure relief with a luxurious feel, providing the ultimate individualized, luxurious sleep experience.
The BEAUTYREST RECHARGE collection has 14 models with a suggested retail price range of $699 to $1,299 and features 800 density BEAUTYREST POCKETED COIL springs. AIRCOOL Foam, AIRCOOL Memory Foam and GelTouch™ foams, which provide pressure relief and promote freedom of movement and a comfortable sleeping temperature, are available on select models.
The new lines are visually striking with ribbon accents and handles of rich blues inspired by the colors of night, featuring luxurious fabrics that complement the overall feel and comfort of the mattresses. This refreshing, fashion-forward look speaks to the craftsmanship that goes into each and every BEAUTYREST.
“This is a significant launch for us because weʼre not only building on what we learned in 2012 about combining AIRCOOL foams and POCKETED COIL SPRiNGS from our TRUENERGY lines, but weʼre now making this innovation available at even more accessible price points to reach a broader market,” said Rolf Sannes, Vice President of BEAUTYREST Brand Management. “With 28 new models between our two collections, weʼre giving retailers a wide range of options that have been designed to deliver Recharging Sleep to consumers.”
New COMFORPEDIC High-End Models Build on “The Better Memory Foam” Heritage
Simmons expands on the tremendous success of COMFORPEDIC products by offering a new level of comfort and style through the addition of four new mattresses to the COMFORPEDIC high-end line.  The addition of the high-end models adds to the four models introduced at High Point Market last October and now completes the new eight- product line.
The new line features renowned luxury AIRCOOL Memory Foam and high-density AIRCOOL Memory Foam with TRUTEMP Gel. The breakthrough TRUTEMP Gel innovation, which absorbs, stores, and releases excess warmth, was unveiled last October by the award winning COMFORPEDIC line. The profile of the TRUTEMP Gel layer has now been increased 100 percent in these four new products and, in conjunction with proprietary AIRCOOL Memory Foam and AIRCOOL Design, helps with temperature consistency and provides for the ultimate in sleeping comfort.
Engineered into the four new beds is a proprietary Multi-Action Support Layer™, an enhanced system designed to provide the legendary support that BEAUTYREST is known for, along with superb airflow for more comfortable sleep. Each of the four beds offers a unique feel to accommodate consumersʼ individual comfort preference.
“The performance of the COMFORPEDIC line we launched in October has exceeded our expectations, and weʼre excited to extend the collection with new high-end models that will continue to elevate COMFORPEDICʼs position in the industry.  Drawing on our proprietary formulation and then blending in new innovations, this launch institutes a new level of comfort, performance, and elegance,” said Brad Hill, Senior Vice President, General Manager Specialty Products. “COMFORPEDIC truly gives consumers the ultimate in luxurious bedding options.”
The new luxurious knit panel fabric is accented with a BEAUTYREST logo-inspired wave border design. This stylish wave design, in a chocolate brown performance fabric, is tastefully tailored with ribbon detailing that brings an elevated level of luxurious sophistication to the aesthetics of the line. This sumptuous look complements the other products in the COMFORPEDIC line and extends to the NUFLEX™ Foundation from BEAUTYREST for the ultimate standard in stylish luxury and comfort.
To enhance the consumersʼ overall sleep experience, COMFORPEDIC is also introducing the new RESTORED COMFORT™ pillow. This new pillow includes AIRCOOL Memory Foam with TRUTEMP Gel that conforms and promotes pressure relief while helping to keep you in a comfortable temperature zone. This oversize queen pillow fits either a queen or king pillowcase and comes with a three-year limited warranty.
These four new high-end additions to the COMFORPEDIC line have a suggested retail price of $2,999 and above.
