Green Dot Corporation is an issuer of prepaid MasterCard and Visa cards in the United States. These products are available at more than 60,000 retail stores,[1] including CVS, Rite Aid, Walgreens, RadioShack, and Dollar Tree; as well as with discounted offerings at Meijer and Walmart. Green Dot also transfers individuals' direct deposit funds (such as Social Security payments) from the US government to personal bank accounts.
The cards may be used like normal debit or credit cards, but they are not backed by a checking account or line of credit. Purchases are deducted from the balance stored on the card. The user can add more money to the card by paying cash at a retail store's point of sale, or in certain cases from their paycheck.
Green Dot is headquartered in Pasadena, California, and it was formerly known as Next Estate Communications. The company provides co-branded card programs to Walmart, Boost Mobile, AT&T and Citibank. In 2007, Green Dot raised $20M in funding,[2] including Sequoia Capital as an investor. In 2008, Green Dot ceased to offer prepaid Discover cards.[3]

History[edit]
The Green Dot corporation was founded in 1999 by Steve Streit. Green Dot was formerly known as Next Estate Communications. The first debit card to be sold was I-GEN in the year 2000. It was geared toward teenagers and Internet users. In 2001 the first I-GEN MasterCard was sold at a Rite Aid in Virginia. In 2002 the first Green Dot debit cards were sold at more Rite Aid stores as well as CVS Pharmacy, and Pantry Convenience stores. In 2003, the I-GEN card was sold in over 18,000 stores nationwide and geared toward adults. In the year 2004, I-GEN officially changed its name to Green Dot and started the first cash-accepting network for reloading the debit cards. In 2005, Green Dot created additional debit cards for everyone's needs. Finally, by May 2006, Green Dot sold more than two million cards nationwide and opened more retailers to issue more cards internationally.
The company tendered an initial public offering in 2010 and reached a peak stock price in early 2011.[1] As of March 2013, the company's stock is trading at 60% below its initial offering price.[1]
On September 24, 2014, Walmart announced it would be partnering with Green Dot Bank to begin offering Walmart customers checking accounts. The accounts will be provided through GoBank, Green Dot’s mobile checking service[4]
On January 30, 2017, it was reported that UniRush LLC would be sold to Green Dot Corp. in a deal valued around $147 million. The deal, to close at the end of the quarter, was said to add around 750,000 cardholders to Green Dot's network.[5]
Cards[edit]
Green Dot debit cards are available in many stores, including CVS Pharmacy, Kmart, 7-Eleven and Walgreens.[6] This is only a temporary card which does not have the customer's actual name on it; instead it says "Valued Customer". Temporary cards are not re-loadable However, if the customer opts in to receive a personalized card, which is free of cost, in 7 to 10 business days it will arrive in mail with his or her name on it. Personalized cards are re-loadable in a variety of ways. There is a monthly charge of $7.95, unless the customer makes more than 30 purchases in a month or loads the card with more than $1000 in that month.
Reloading process[edit]
The personalized card can be reloaded using MoneyPak, which is available in the same stores GreenDot prepaid is. Most stores charge $4.95 for reloading.[7] Card users can also opt to have their payroll transferred directly to the card through direct deposit[8] and the card acting as their checking account. Additionally, the cards may be re-loaded using ACH transfers online directly from a bank account and even from PayPal.[9] PayPal in 2014 discontinued accepting MoneyPak cards due to high volume of unsatisfactory ratings of Green Dot and its products.

Majority of unfavorable returns, listed in the sites above and other review sites, complain of Green Dot limiting access to a positive balance in the card, even though the funds have been added to the card with a cash purchase. The reviews also underscore the unwillingness or incapacity of Green Dot customer service to resolve these issues.
Security concerns[edit]
While convenient, Green Dot's MoneyPak cards lack the security measures such as identity verification found in credit cards, limited cardholder liability, and the ability to dispute fraudulent charges so that money lost due to fraud cannot be recovered.[14][15][16]

In March 2010, the Better Business Bureau reported a rise in scams involving MoneyPak where unsuspecting victims would pay for items by loading a MoneyPak card, emailing the number to the "seller" only to have the "seller" drain the account and never deliver the promised product.[17]
In June 2011, the Better Business Bureau and the Minnesota Department of Public Safety issued warnings regarding the illegal use of Green Dot's MoneyPak cards to defraud consumers.[15]
In January 2012, The office of New York State Senator Martin Golden issued an alert from Con Edison regarding various scams, including "Green Dot scams."[18]
In March 2012, Time magazine reported on how the 419 scam was now being adapted to the relative anonymity of MoneyPak cards.[19] The AARP Issued a warning on the rise of MoneyPak fraud in 2012[20] that followed the decline in MoneyGram fraud after MoneyGram was fined 18 million dollars "to settle FTC charges that it allowed its money transfer system to be used for fraud".[21]
In August 2012, the FBI also issued a warning that scammers were taking advantage of MoneyPak's untraceability to coerce unwitting victims into paying a "ransom" to unlock their computers infected with malware.[22] AVG Technologies notes that in some cases (like the FBI scam), criminals are using malware to deceive victims into thinking their computer has been flagged for serious crimes, after which the relatively easy anonymity of MoneyPak cards is taken advantage of to allow for "untraceable" extortions.[23]
Beginning in mid-2013, Green Dot MoneyPak cards were being used to commit fraud, with persons asking callers under the guise of a customer service agent for a utility company such as a power or gas provider asking for immediate payment under threat of disconnection using a personal card or asking the caller to head to a store selling Green Dot cards and giving them the card number the funds were placed on.[24]
In September 2013, several Walgreens and other large chain drug stores through the United States were evacuated because of bomb threats called into the stores, with the caller asking for a 'ransom' from the stores of multiple Green Dot cards with large amounts activated using store registers which would then be placed in an unmonitored location for the culprits to pick up, or the numbers read through the phone.[25][26]
In 2015, scammers were taking advantage of Green Dot cards when filing false income tax returns using compromised Social Security numbers. The criminal opens a Green Dot account in the victim's name, making that account the payee for a refund claimed on the fraudulent tax return. The stolen SSN is used both to file the false tax return and to open the Green Dot account, which is emptied if the refund is paid. The victim receives an unexpected letter containing a permanent (embossed with the victim's name) Green Dot card for the account, a probable indicator of SSN compromise and attempted fraud.[27]

On January 30, 2017, it was reported that UniRush LLC would be sold to Green Dot Corp. in a deal valued around $147 million. The deal, to close at the end of the quarter, was said to add around 750,000 cardholders to Green Dot's network.[5]
Cards[edit]
Green Dot debit cards are available in many stores, including CVS Pharmacy, Kmart, 7-Eleven and Walgreens.[6] This is only a temporary card which does not have the customer's actual name on it; instead it says "Valued Customer". Temporary cards are not re-loadable However, if the customer opts in to receive a personalized card, which is free of cost, in 7 to 10 business days it will arrive in mail with his or her name on it. Personalized cards are re-loadable in a variety of ways. There is a monthly charge of $7.95, unless the customer makes more than 30 purchases in a month or loads the card with more than $1000 in that month.
Reloading process[edit]
The personalized card can be reloaded using MoneyPak, which is available in the same stores GreenDot prepaid is. Most stores charge $4.95 for reloading.[7] Card users can also opt to have their payroll transferred directly to the card through direct deposit[8] and the card acting as their checking account. Additionally, the cards may be re-loaded using ACH transfers online directly from a bank account and even from PayPal.[9] PayPal in 2014 discontinued accepting MoneyPak cards due to high volume of unsatisfactory ratings of Green Dot and its products.
Reputation[edit]
As of November 2013, Green Dot has the following ratings:


Web Site
Rating (out of 5)
Notes


Yelp
1
All reviews received 1 star[10]


Amazon

75% of reviews received 1 star[11]


Credit Karma
2
73% of reviews received 1 star[12]


Consumer Affairs

91% of reviews received 1 star[13]


Majority of unfavorable returns, listed in the sites above and other review sites, complain of Green Dot limiting access to a positive balance in the card, even though the funds have been added to the card with a cash purchase. The reviews also underscore the unwillingness or incapacity of Green Dot customer service to resolve these issues.
Security concerns[edit]
While convenient, Green Dot's MoneyPak cards lack the security measures such as identity verification found in credit cards, limited cardholder liability, and the ability to dispute fraudulent charges so that money lost due to fraud cannot be recovered.[14][15][16]

In March 2010, the Better Business Bureau reported a rise in scams involving MoneyPak where unsuspecting victims would pay for items by loading a MoneyPak card, emailing the number to the "seller" only to have the "seller" drain the account and never deliver the promised product.[17]
In June 2011, the Better Business Bureau and the Minnesota Department of Public Safety issued warnings regarding the illegal use of Green Dot's MoneyPak cards to defraud consumers.[15]
In January 2012, The office of New York State Senator Martin Golden issued an alert from Con Edison regarding various scams, including "Green Dot scams."[18]
In March 2012, Time magazine reported on how the 419 scam was now being adapted to the relative anonymity of MoneyPak cards.[19] The AARP Issued a warning on the rise of MoneyPak fraud in 2012[20] that followed the decline in MoneyGram fraud after MoneyGram was fined 18 million dollars "to settle FTC charges that it allowed its money transfer system to be used for fraud".[21]
In August 2012, the FBI also issued a warning that scammers were taking advantage of MoneyPak's untraceability to coerce unwitting victims into paying a "ransom" to unlock their computers infected with malware.[22] AVG Technologies notes that in some cases (like the FBI scam), criminals are using malware to deceive victims into thinking their computer has been flagged for serious crimes, after which the relatively easy anonymity of MoneyPak cards is taken advantage of to allow for "untraceable" extortions.[23]
Beginning in mid-2013, Green Dot MoneyPak cards were being used to commit fraud, with persons asking callers under the guise of a customer service agent for a utility company such as a power or gas provider asking for immediate payment under threat of disconnection using a personal card or asking the caller to head to a store selling Green Dot cards and giving them the card number the funds were placed on.[24]
In September 2013, several Walgreens and other large chain drug stores through the United States were evacuated because of bomb threats called into the stores, with the caller asking for a 'ransom' from the stores of multiple Green Dot cards with large amounts activated using store registers which would then be placed in an unmonitored location for the culprits to pick up, or the numbers read through the phone.[25][26]
In 2015, scammers were taking advantage of Green Dot cards when filing false income tax returns using compromised Social Security numbers. The criminal opens a Green Dot account in the victim's name, making that account the payee for a refund claimed on the fraudulent tax return. The stolen SSN is used both to file the false tax return and to open the Green Dot account, which is emptied if the refund is paid. The victim receives an unexpected letter containing a permanent (embossed with the victim's name) Green Dot card for the account, a probable indicator of SSN compromise and attempted fraud.[27]

Every time I call to inquire about my replacement card I get a different shipping date, this (first call) has been going on since June 8, 2017. I called again last week and was told they have mailed the replacement on 2 different occasions and for me to complain to the post office because it's their fault. All...

Green Dot Corporation is an issuer of prepaid MasterCard and Visa cards in the United States. These products are available at more than 60,000 retail stores,[1] including CVS, Rite Aid, Walgreens, RadioShack, and Dollar Tree; as well as with discounted offerings at Meijer and Walmart. Green Dot also transfers individuals' direct deposit funds (such as Social Security payments) from the US government to personal bank accounts.
The cards may be used like normal debit or credit cards, but they are not backed by a checking account or line of credit. Purchases are deducted from the balance stored on the card. The user can add more money to the card by paying cash at a retail store's point of sale, or in certain cases from their paycheck.
Green Dot is headquartered in Pasadena, California, and it was formerly known as Next Estate Communications. The company provides co-branded card programs to Walmart, Boost Mobile, AT&T and Citibank. In 2007, Green Dot raised $20M in funding,[2] including Sequoia Capital as an investor. In 2008, Green Dot ceased to offer prepaid Discover cards.[3]

History[edit]
The Green Dot corporation was founded in 1999 by Steve Streit. Green Dot was formerly known as Next Estate Communications. The first debit card to be sold was I-GEN in the year 2000. It was geared toward teenagers and Internet users. In 2001 the first I-GEN MasterCard was sold at a Rite Aid in Virginia. In 2002 the first Green Dot debit cards were sold at more Rite Aid stores as well as CVS Pharmacy, and Pantry Convenience stores. In 2003, the I-GEN card was sold in over 18,000 stores nationwide and geared toward adults. In the year 2004, I-GEN officially changed its name to Green Dot and started the first cash-accepting network for reloading the debit cards. In 2005, Green Dot created additional debit cards for everyone's needs. Finally, by May 2006, Green Dot sold more than two million cards nationwide and opened more retailers to issue more cards internationally.
The company tendered an initial public offering in 2010 and reached a peak stock price in early 2011.[1] As of March 2013, the company's stock is trading at 60% below its initial offering price.[1]
On September 24, 2014, Walmart announced it would be partnering with Green Dot Bank to begin offering Walmart customers checking accounts. The accounts will be provided through GoBank, Green Dot’s mobile checking service[4]
On January 30, 2017, it was reported that UniRush LLC would be sold to Green Dot Corp. in a deal valued around $147 million. The deal, to close at the end of the quarter, was said to add around 750,000 cardholders to Green Dot's network.[5]
Cards[edit]
Green Dot debit cards are available in many stores, including CVS Pharmacy, Kmart, 7-Eleven and Walgreens.[6] This is only a temporary card which does not have the customer's actual name on it; instead it says "Valued Customer". Temporary cards are not re-loadable However, if the customer opts in to receive a personalized card, which is free of cost, in 7 to 10 business days it will arrive in mail with his or her name on it. Personalized cards are re-loadable in a variety of ways. There is a monthly charge of $7.95, unless the customer makes more than 30 purchases in a month or loads the card with more than $1000 in that month.
Reloading process[edit]
The personalized card can be reloaded using MoneyPak, which is available in the same stores GreenDot prepaid is. Most stores charge $4.95 for reloading.[7] Card users can also opt to have their payroll transferred directly to the card through direct deposit[8] and the card acting as their checking account. Additionally, the cards may be re-loaded using ACH transfers online directly from a bank account and even from PayPal.[9] PayPal in 2014 discontinued accepting MoneyPak cards due to high volume of unsatisfactory ratings of Green Dot and its products.

Majority of unfavorable returns, listed in the sites above and other review sites, complain of Green Dot limiting access to a positive balance in the card, even though the funds have been added to the card with a cash purchase. The reviews also underscore the unwillingness or incapacity of Green Dot customer service to resolve these issues.
Security concerns[edit]
While convenient, Green Dot's MoneyPak cards lack the security measures such as identity verification found in credit cards, limited cardholder liability, and the ability to dispute fraudulent charges so that money lost due to fraud cannot be recovered.[14][15][16]

In March 2010, the Better Business Bureau reported a rise in scams involving MoneyPak where unsuspecting victims would pay for items by loading a MoneyPak card, emailing the number to the "seller" only to have the "seller" drain the account and never deliver the promised product.[17]
In June 2011, the Better Business Bureau and the Minnesota Department of Public Safety issued warnings regarding the illegal use of Green Dot's MoneyPak cards to defraud consumers.[15]
In January 2012, The office of New York State Senator Martin Golden issued an alert from Con Edison regarding various scams, including "Green Dot scams."[18]
In March 2012, Time magazine reported on how the 419 scam was now being adapted to the relative anonymity of MoneyPak cards.[19] The AARP Issued a warning on the rise of MoneyPak fraud in 2012[20] that followed the decline in MoneyGram fraud after MoneyGram was fined 18 million dollars "to settle FTC charges that it allowed its money transfer system to be used for fraud".[21]
In August 2012, the FBI also issued a warning that scammers were taking advantage of MoneyPak's untraceability to coerce unwitting victims into paying a "ransom" to unlock their computers infected with malware.[22] AVG Technologies notes that in some cases (like the FBI scam), criminals are using malware to deceive victims into thinking their computer has been flagged for serious crimes, after which the relatively easy anonymity of MoneyPak cards is taken advantage of to allow for "untraceable" extortions.[23]
Beginning in mid-2013, Green Dot MoneyPak cards were being used to commit fraud, with persons asking callers under the guise of a customer service agent for a utility company such as a power or gas provider asking for immediate payment under threat of disconnection using a personal card or asking the caller to head to a store selling Green Dot cards and giving them the card number the funds were placed on.[24]
In September 2013, several Walgreens and other large chain drug stores through the United States were evacuated because of bomb threats called into the stores, with the caller asking for a 'ransom' from the stores of multiple Green Dot cards with large amounts activated using store registers which would then be placed in an unmonitored location for the culprits to pick up, or the numbers read through the phone.[25][26]
In 2015, scammers were taking advantage of Green Dot cards when filing false income tax returns using compromised Social Security numbers. The criminal opens a Green Dot account in the victim's name, making that account the payee for a refund claimed on the fraudulent tax return. The stolen SSN is used both to file the false tax return and to open the Green Dot account, which is emptied if the refund is paid. The victim receives an unexpected letter containing a permanent (embossed with the victim's name) Green Dot card for the account, a probable indicator of SSN compromise and attempted fraud.[27]

In August 2012, the FBI also issued a warning that scammers were taking advantage of MoneyPak's untraceability to coerce unwitting victims into paying a "ransom" to unlock their computers infected with malware.[22] AVG Technologies notes that in some cases (like the FBI scam), criminals are using malware to deceive victims into thinking their computer has been flagged for serious crimes, after which the relatively easy anonymity of MoneyPak cards is taken advantage of to allow for "untraceable" extortions.[23]
Beginning in mid-2013, Green Dot MoneyPak cards were being used to commit fraud, with persons asking callers under the guise of a customer service agent for a utility company such as a power or gas provider asking for immediate payment under threat of disconnection using a personal card or asking the caller to head to a store selling Green Dot cards and giving them the card number the funds were placed on.[24]
In September 2013, several Walgreens and other large chain drug stores through the United States were evacuated because of bomb threats called into the stores, with the caller asking for a 'ransom' from the stores of multiple Green Dot cards with large amounts activated using store registers which would then be placed in an unmonitored location for the culprits to pick up, or the numbers read through the phone.[25][26]
In 2015, scammers were taking advantage of Green Dot cards when filing false income tax returns using compromised Social Security numbers. The criminal opens a Green Dot account in the victim's name, making that account the payee for a refund claimed on the fraudulent tax return. The stolen SSN is used both to file the false tax return and to open the Green Dot account, which is emptied if the refund is paid. The victim receives an unexpected letter containing a permanent (embossed with the victim's name) Green Dot card for the account, a probable indicator of SSN compromise and attempted fraud.[27]

About Us
Our Products



Our Products
At Green Dot Corporation, we’re boldly surpassing the boundaries of what banking technology can do as we invent—and reinvent—a suite of products that continue to revolutionize an industry. As you explore our products, we hope you’ll recognize all the immense possibilities for you to contribute, to create, and to innovate here. 




TO INNOVATION AND BEYOND
From concept to completion, every product at Green Dot Corporation is a marvel of precision and collaboration. Our innovations are powered by hands-on dedication and people who care about the details. Whether it’s the Product Development & Design team hatching next-gen personal banking products, or the Infrastructure, IT & Data Support group ensuring that our highly transactional environment stays safe and secure, we’re doing work that’s disruptive and pushing the limits in cutting-edge functionality development.




General Purpose Reloadable (GPR) prepaid cards




Picture yourself on the team responsible for our General Purpose Reloadable (GPR) prepaid cards and cash reload network. Our reloadable prepaid debit cards are designed for long-term, general spending and budgeting purposes and can be used for purchases everywhere that MasterCard® or Visa® debit cards are accepted. Think, just for a moment, about the opportunity that comes with advancing something as intimate as a person’s wallet. Massive amounts of technical genius and teamwork are required to bring these cards to market and keep them running seamlessly and securely.






GoBank®




All this talk about our products wouldn’t be complete without a hale and hearty shout out to mobile technology. We recently unveiled GoBank®, a one-of-a-kind product built from the ground up to be opened and used on a mobile device. Think of it as a bank account designed for use on your mobile phone, with no overdraft or penalty fees. We like to call it fast, fair and feature-rich, as it allows consumers to interact with their money in a way that’s immediate, intuitive and intimate. How cool is that? Imagine working on a mobile application that makes it easy to send and deposit money, build a budget, and find an ATM among a massive network of more than 42,000 fee-free ATMS. Our GoBankers are driven by dedication and passion for everything mobile, and you can be part of this ever-growing team.






The Bottom Line




The bottom line is simple: Green Dot Corporation has the kinds of products—and challenges—that some professionals wait an entire career to work on. So what are you waiting for? Find the work that you were meant to do.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Growth Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Zacks Equity Research reports, or ZER for short, are our in-house, independently produced research reports.
The ever popular one-page Snapshot reports are generated for virtually every single Zacks Ranked stock. It's packed with all of the company's key stats and salient decision making information. Including the Zacks Rank, Zacks Industry Rank, Style Scores, the Price, Consensus & Surprise chart, graphical estimate analysis and how a stocks stacks up to its peers.
The detailed multi-page Analyst report does an even deeper dive on the company's vital statistics. In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Green dot Corp & Greendot MONEYPAK refill cards are nothing but scam artists but on a much larger scale...the money Pak refill cards you load money on to add to a prepaid card is just a way to steal your money...they will shut your account down if they think you use them 2 much and keep the money...try getting it back is laughable...you can't even check the validity of the card b/c you can no longer call customer service b/c there's not any...since you can only load so much, I had to get it on 4 separate cards to load to the prepaid card for my bills, they decide that loading 4 refill cards seemed excessive and it was violation of terms (it clearly was not b/c the amount didn't exceed the limit) they shut my account down, refused to give a refund even with my receipts...well that was 2k gone...I had to call Green dot (the prepaid card issuer...and was told they had nothing to do with the refill cards put out by GREENDOT CORP) It's not the 1st time having issues...but a refill card try to load it to be told it's invalid...well with no way to contact MONEYPAK, & they say they have nothing to do with the refill cards and no way of contacting them...there went that money...many of my friends had the same problems and lost hundreds...I STRONGLY recommend to NEVER go near greendot or its products & services.There are some *** for real...
They are making millions by scamming ppl with the refill cards & their prepaid cards not to mention the $9.95 a month service charge and the $5.95 fee for the MONEYPAK refill card...It's practically legalized theft. Not to mention that you can no longer just call a number to add the refill card to a prepaid card...you have to register online just to use the refill having 2 provide your birthday name & social security number ( well that's all they need to steal more from you and that's after you already have to give all your info 4 the prepaid card...you used to be able to load a MONEYPAK on most prepaid cards but now only a select few so they are probably getting kickbacks from those companies that also charge outrageous fees per month & some charge both a monthly fee, a per transaction fee and some even charge a fee if you call the automated system to hear your balance...SMH They need to be permanently shut down & banned from doing business as a different company by changing the name...
Everyone who has ever had a issue with their money being kept by them should file lawsuits 4 their money back plus interest and punitive damages...No telling how many people were late paying bills or been stranded b/c of them...
