Rent-A-Center Uses Logz.io Cognitive Insights to Uncover Irregularities in Log Data
Jan 24 17
Rent-A-Center has placed Cognitive Insights, Logz.io's revolutionary AI-powered IT analytics platform, at the core of its digital transformation strategy. Cognitive Insights uses machine learning to analyze human interaction with log data to uncover irregularities in IT environments. After embarking on this new system, RAC reported that Cognitive Insights helped the company to properly detect potential threats before they impact customers. As RAC began its digital transformation, the use of the open source ELK Stack was the obvious software to choose to centralize and monitor log data. The platform removes the necessity for developers and engineers to log directly into the production systems to view log data.


Logz.Io Appoints Jim Baum to its Board
Nov 17 16
Logz.io announced that Jim Baum, venture partner at OpenView, joins the company's board of directors. Baum currently serves as Executive Chairman of the board for Dyn and previously served as President and CEO of Netezza.


Logz.io Releases Cognitive Insights™
Aug 16 16
Logz.io released Cognitive Insights™. This new analytics solution is powered by artificial intelligence that identifies critical events in IT environments before they cause further damage to the bottom line. With the growing amount of machine-generated Big Data within organizations, it is unrealistic to expect human beings to look at every piece of information. This causes most companies to face the challenge of detecting critical events in their increasingly complex IT environments early enough in order to take corrective actions. Cognitive Insights proactively alerts IT managers to problems before they outwardly affect the business. At the heart of the Logz.io Cognitive Insights platform is the patent-pending Logz.io Unified Machine Intelligence (UMI™) engine, which leverages hundreds of different data sources to understand how humans are interacting with data. Logz.io UMI operates similarly to Google's PageRank algorithm and Amazon's product recommendations. The engine includes supervised machine-learning algorithms that piece together human interactions with log data as well as social threads, discussion forums, and open source repositories to create a living data pool of hundreds of thousands of known, important, and relevant insights that may even contain resolutions to critical issues.

                You acknowledge that LogsHero may establish, including without limitation with respect to each of the

                you acknowledge that when your Subscription Plan is changed from a Trial Plan or a Paid Plan (as such
                terms are defined below), the maximum volume of User Data that may be transmitted or stored by the
                Services may be reduced, and We reserve the right to remove or delete such portion of your User Data
                which exceed the maximum volume of User Data applicable to your then current Subscription Plan. You

Account Registration and Fees


                In order to gain access to certain features of the Website, you must register and create an account with
                LogsHero on the Website (an “Account”). You agree to provide accurate, current and complete
                information
                during the registration process and to update such information to keep it accurate, current and
                complete. LogsHero reserves the right to suspend or terminate your Account at any time, including if any
                information provided during the registration process or thereafter proves to be inaccurate, not current
                or incomplete. You are solely responsible for safeguarding your Account’s password. You agree that you
                will not disclose your Account’s password to any third party other than within your company and that you
                will take sole responsibility for any activities or actions under your Account, whether or not you have
                authorized such activities or actions. You will immediately notify LogsHero of any unauthorized use of
                your Account. An administrator of an Account may authorize an unlimited number of authorized users per
                Account; provided, however, that an administrator will add authorized users by providing such user’s
                username, e-mail address and password to LogsHero. The User who created the Account as an administrator
                will administer the use of such Account by such authorized users.

            


                LogsHero offers trial, free and paid subscription plans (a “Trial Plan”, “Free Plan” and “Paid
                Plan”,
                respectively, and collectively, the “Subscription Plans”) for all Accounts.  A description of the
                features associated with these subscription plans is available on the Website.
            

                All new Accounts start with a Trial Plan. Following the applicable trial period under a Trial Plan, a
                Free Plan will automatically apply to an Account, unless you select to subscribe to a Paid Plan. If at
                any time you select to subscribe to a Paid Plan, you agree to pay the applicable subscription fee and
                any taxes and other fees that may accrue in relation to your use of the Services. When you select a Paid
                Plan, you will be required to provide a credit card number and customary billing information such as
                name and billing address. If you select monthly payments, you will automatically be charged the
                subscription fee for the month on each prior month’s anniversary date of when you registered (the
                “Monthly Anniversary Date”). If you do not want to be charged for a month, you must cancel your
                Account
                at least thirty (30) days prior to the next Monthly Anniversary Date.
            

                All fees are non-refundable. All fees and applicable taxes, if any, are payable in United States
                dollars. All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities, and you
                shall be responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies, or duties. LogsHero is not responsible for
                any expenses or third party charges (including, without limitation, any charges with respect to clearing
                or billing services) you incur resulting from being billed by LogsHero in accordance with these Terms.
                LogsHero also reserves the right, at any time, to impose or restructure any fees charged for your use of
                the Services. LogsHero will notify you in advance of any changes with respect to fees it chooses to
                impose.
            

                If you are subscribed to a Free Plan and you do not access your Account for 30 days or longer, LogsHero
                may cancel your Account. If LogsHero decides to cancel your Account, LogsHero may, at its discretion,
                provide you with notice via e-mail. If LogsHero receives a bounce-back from an e-mail account to which
                LogsHero sent notice regarding the cancelation of your Account, LogsHero is under no obligation to
                provide you with further notice.

                Website. Please note that LogsHero does not, and shall not, assume any responsibility or liability with
                respect to any Shipper or other third party software its integrity, completeness, accuracy, reliability

                ERROR FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED OR THAT ALL ERRORS WILL BE CORRECTED.

            

                A number of factors may impact the quality of your communications and use of the Services, and may
                result in the failure of your communications including, without limitation, your use of Shippers or

                YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE SERVICES AND DATA ARE HOSTED ON A THIRD PARTY HOSTING FACILITY, AND THAT

                Services and with other persons with whom you communicate or interact as a result of your use of the
                Services. For example, Users may participate in a user-to-user forum. You understand that LogsHero does
                not screen or inquire into the background of any users of the Services, nor does LogsHero make any

                OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES, OR FROM
                ANY COMMUNICATIONS, INTERACTIONS OR MEETINGS WITH OTHER USERS OF THE WEBSITE, SERVICES OR OTHER PERSONS

                ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND
                WHETHER OR NOT LOGSHERO HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, EVEN IF A LIMITED REMEDY
                SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

            

                IN NO EVENT WILL LOGSHERO’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OF USE
                OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES EXCEED THE AMOUNTS YOU HAVE PAID TO LOGSHERO FOR USE

                THE BASIS FOR THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN LOGSHERO AND YOU.

            



Governing Law; Jurisdiction
        


                By using or accessing the Services, you agree that the laws of the State of Israel, without regard to
                principles of conflict of laws and regardless of your location, will govern these Terms and any dispute
                of any sort that might arise between you and LogsHero. Any claim or dispute between you and LogsHero
                that arises in whole or in part from your use of the Services shall be decided exclusively by a court of
                competent jurisdiction located in Tel-Aviv, Israel, to the exclusion of any other courts, and you hereby
                consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non-convenient with
                respect to venue and jurisdiction in the courts of Tel-Aviv, Israel. YOU AND LOGSHERO AGREE THAT ANY
                CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SERVICES MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE
                CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.

            



Integration and Severability
        


                These Terms of Use are the entire agreement between you and LogsHero with respect to the Services, and
                supersede and replace all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether oral, written
                or electronic, between you and LogsHero with respect to the Services. If any provision of these Terms of
                Use is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum
                extent necessary so that these Terms of Use will otherwise remain in full force and effect and
                enforceable. The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall
                not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. The waiver of any such right or provision will
                be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of LogsHero. Except as
                expressly set forth in these Terms of Use, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under
                these Terms of Use will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms of Use or
                otherwise.

            



Assignment


                You may not assign or transfer these Terms of Use, by operation of law or otherwise, without LogsHero’s
                prior express written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms of Use, without such
                consent, will be null and of no effect. LogsHero may assign or transfer these Terms of Use, in its sole
                discretion, without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms of Use will bind and inure to the
                benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.

LogsHero Ltd. (“LogsHero”, “We” or “Us”) provides this Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personally identifiable information received from Users of the Services. For the avoidance of doubt, this Privacy Policy only applies to the Website, services and applications included within “Services” and does not apply to any third-party websites, services, or applications, even if they are accessible through our Services. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, capitalized terms used in this Privacy Policy shall have the same meaning as in our Terms of Use. Please note that the term “you” also includes the company which is our customer and for which you are accepting the Terms of Use.
Information Collection and Use
Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Services, to administer your use of the Services (including your Account if applicable) and to enable you to enjoy and easily navigate our Services.
Account Information. When you create an Account, we will collect certain information that can be used to identify you, such as name, email address, postal address, username, phone number, billing information and the name of the company for which you are accepting these terms, as applicable (“Personally Identifiable Information”). We may also collect certain information that is not Personally Identifiable Information because it cannot be used by itself to identify you. Please note that your billing information, to the extent provided by you, is forwarded directly to a third party billing and/or clearing service/company engaged by Us, and is not kept by Us. LogsHero will not share, rent or sell Personally Identifying Information to any third party, except as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
User Data. In order to perform our Services, we may also collect from you data that you have sent to us (“User Data”) via electronic means to Internet addresses that we provide to you. Such User Data may include records of operations of your applications and systems and other information relating to your actions. LogsHero will never share your User Data with other Users or with any other third party, except as set forth in this Privacy Policy. However, LogsHero reserves the right to analyze User Data in order to provide its Services to you and improve its Services. LogsHero reserves the right to disclose anonymized and/or aggregated versions of the User Data to third parties in connection with the use, development, improvement and marketing of the Services, provided that such anonymized or aggregated User Data shall not personally identify you. We may create statistical, aggregated data relating to our users and the Website for analytical purposes and offer such data to our users and other third parties. Aggregated data may be derived from User Data, or other Data but in its aggregated and anonymized form that will not identify any individual. This data is used to understand our users needs and to develop, improve and market the Service.
Use of Services. Our servers automatically record certain information about how a User uses our Services (“Log Data”).

We use this information to administer the Services and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) this information to improve and enhance the Services by expanding their features and functionality and tailoring them to our Users’ needs and preferences. We may use a person’s IP address to fight spam, malware and identity theft. We also use the IP Address to generate aggregate, non Personally Identifiable Information about how the Services are used.
User Support.

If you send us a request, we reserve the right to publish your request in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other Users.
Cookies. We collect certain information through the use of “cookies,” which are small text files that are saved by your browser when you access the Services. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to identify that you have logged in to the Services and to tell us how and when you interact with our Services. We may also use cookies to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our Services and to customize and improve our Services. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted when you log off from the Services and close your browser. Although most browsers automatically accept cookies, you can change your browser options to stop automatically accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting cookies. Please note, however, that if you don’t accept cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of the Services. Some third party services providers that we engage may also place their own cookies on your browser. Note that this Privacy Policy covers only our use of cookies and does not include use of cookies by such third parties.

LogsHero may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in LogsHero’s sole discretion. Any information that We collect is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected. LogsHero encourages Users to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If We make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, We will notify you of such changes by posting them on the Services or by sending you an email or other notification, and We will indicate when such changes will become effective. Your continued use of the Website and/or Services after we have notified you of any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
Information Sharing and Disclosure
Service Providers. We may engage third party service providers to work with us to administer and provide the Services. These third party services providers have access to your Personally Identifiable Information only for the purpose of performing services on our behalf and are expressly obligated not to disclose or use your Personally Identifiable Information for any other purpose. Some of these service providers may be located outside of your home country; by using the Services, you consent to the transfer of such Personally Identifiable Information to such third party services providers.
User Forums. As part of the Services, Users may communicate with other Users in User forums (“Forum Information”). “Forum Information” may consist of, for example, User comments regarding and tips for utilizing the Services. Such Forum Information may be collected and analyzed by LogsHero for the purpose of providing the Services and supporting you or other Users. Other Users will see your “User Name” when you participate in a Users forum. Providing other Users with any information on a Users forum is voluntary and should correlate with the degree of interaction you want to have with the other Users. We recommend that you guard your anonymity and sensitive information so that you do not allow others to identify you.
Compliance with Laws. We may disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as We, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of LogsHero or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.
Transfer of Personally Identifiable Information. In the event We are acquired as a result of a transaction such as a merger, acquisition or asset sale, your Personally Identifiable Information may be disclosed, transferred or assigned to the third party acquirer in connection with the transaction.
Publicity. We may use your Personally-Identifiable Information for the purpose of solely identifying you as a LogsHero customer on the Website, client lists, press releases and/or other marketing documents.
Security
We take precautions to ensure the security of your Personally Identifiable Information. However, we cannot guarantee that hackers or unauthorized personnel will not gain access to your Personally Identifiable Information despite our efforts. You should note that in using our Services, your information will travel through third party infrastructures which are not under our control. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while We strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personally Identifiable Information, We cannot guarantee its absolute security. While We do not require Users to send their User Data to us via encrypted transit, we encourage all Users to do so.
We cannot protect, nor does this Privacy Policy apply to, any information that you transmit to other Users of the Website. You should never transmit personal or identifying information to other Users.

If you request a deletion of such information, your Account may become deactivated. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor your request. We have the right to retain an archived copy of your Personally Identifying Information as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.
International Transfer
Your information may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide your Personally Identifiable Information to us, we may transfer your Personally Identifying Information to the United States and process it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy, as represented by your continued use of the Website and/or Services, followed by your submission of any Personally Identifying Information represents your agreement to that transfer.
