MWM Print and Design : Watkiss

MWM Print and Design
Greenwich printer finds ways to make forms printing pay – with the help of a new Watkiss collator.
MWM Print and Design is involved in what many would call the most challenging of print markets. Although the Greenwich based company undertakes a range of commercial print, its specialist niche is sheetfed carbonless form sets – and its primary collating system is a new Watkiss Vario, ideally suited to the carbonless market due in part to the incorporation of air-assisted friction bins.



 
 






The new Vario is a 5-station model, replacing an 8 station Vario machine which has been in action at MWM since 1993. Neil Mathieson is the company’s collator expert in his capacity as production manager. “The Watkiss machine delivered day in, day out for the best part of two decades,” he says,” but it finally reached the end of its working life. Because we had ample proof of the Vario’s quality and durability, Watkiss were always our first choice for a replacement machine. We looked at the competition and still couldn’t see a better option.”
To run a machine for such a length of time, Neil had an “if it ain’t broke, why fix it” philosophy, and was impressed when Watkiss took this motto to heart when installing the new machine. “The delivery module on the old Vario was still working fine. I’m sure some manufacturers would insist on a new replacement delivery in order to maximize profit, but at our request, Watkiss saved us money by fitting the old delivery to the new machine. Aside from the financial benefit we thought this revealed a healthy environmental policy, plus of course it highlights the advantage of the Vario as a modular system.”
How does the latest Vario compare with the 1993 version? “The most obvious change is the touch screen control system,” says Neil. “When I first saw it I was a little daunted because it was unfamiliar, but it literally took just five minutes to learn, and now it’s second nature. The other main difference is the automation in general, the old machine needed some attention when running, but with this one, you just load up the bins, start it up and walk away.”
Another difference with MWM’s new Vario was the number of bins – the new machine has only 5, whereas the old one had 8. “Nearly all our form sets are four parts, so what we ordered was four plus a spare,” says Neil. “The Vario’s modularity means that if our work profile changes we can always add new bins.”
Partner Stuart Mathieson admits that form set work has been a shrinking market over the past decade.
“There was talk of paperless offices in the 1990s, and though that will never become a reality, a lot of admin tasks that used to be done using paper are now done electronically,” he says. “We have also had to deal with a change in customer buying patterns over the past few years. Companies delay ordering and want lower quantities when they order.”
This changing landscape has led many forms printers to disappear altogether, but MWM has not only survived, it has seen improved turnover figures in recent years. Stuart Mathieson says the company has achieved this not only through hard work, but by being adaptable and willing to innovate.
One of the company’s most successful schemes which separated it from its less successful rivals was an online ordering system, which could be customized to suit the requirements of each customer. “We became vendor-managed inventory company managing client’s stocks, not an on demand printer,” says Mr Mathieson. “This has allowed us to sell more to our major accounts. By closely monitoring their form usage, we anticipate demand, print in advance and guarantee next day delivery on stock forms.”
This approach works best for MWM’s larger customers. “When we started out in the late 1970s, all our customers were small businesses. Over time some disappeared, some stayed small, but some grew into big international companies with turnovers of £500m and above. This experience has given us some insight not only into client requirements at different stages of their development, and how to manage big accounts, we also got a feel for the type of company which rely on business forms as an integral part of their communications. We now focus our marketing in those areas, and this targeted approach has paid off.”
“For instance,” he continues, “health and safety legislation means that risk assessments are a day-to-day reality in industries such as construction, and overwhelmingly this involves form filling on site as a legal requirement.”
The adoption of digital print technology has helped this process, a move made at the start of 2011 when MWM joined forces with a digital printer who brought Xerox machines into the company’s 3,000sq ft works, allowing both companies to pool resources. “We’ve always run single and two colour litho, plus numbering and perforating,” says Mr Mathieson, “but digital has given us new options. We found a new revenue stream in producing a standard form layout which can be digitally overprinted with customer logos and details. Digital has also brought new possibilities using variable data, including barcodes.”
“We also designed our own form creation software which customers can use to design their own products. The result looks simple but it was actually quite hard to write and is one of the more sophisticated systems out there.”
MWM prints more than just forms – 40% of its workload is in general commercial print, and the company has a wide range of customers “from chip shops to blue chips,” according to Stuart Mathieson. Surviving the downturn has not been a painless process. “It’s not been an easy few years for us, our customers or the industry as a whole,” says Mr Mathieson. “We have had to make some hard decisions but we are emerging leaner and fitter.”
