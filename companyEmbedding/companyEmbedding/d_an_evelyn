Crabtree & Evelyn Review – Right For You?
Crabtree & Evelyn is a company that uses natural essences from various plants and flowers to create high-quality bath and fragrance products. This is our review.
What is Crabtree & Evelyn?
What you put on your body is just as important as what you put into your body. Even with balanced nutrition and adequate hydration, you still need products to nourish and protect your skin. However, the value brands at the store are hardly the indulgent products you need to endure a long work week or a stressful afternoon. Luckily, Crabtree & Evelyn has created a line of products to meet those needs.
Crabtree & Evelyn started as a simple family business, which was established in 1972 by Cyrus Harvey. He chose the name to be reminiscent of John Evelyn, a botanist from the 17th century who inspired Cyrus, and the crabapple, which is commonly used in apothecaries. However, crabapples are not used in the formulas offered by Crabtree & Evelyn. It seems that the name was chosen to reflect the company’s mission to make products that are pure and strategically made.
When the company first began, it created luxury soaps that were made from ingredients around the world. However, in spite of their high-quality products, they were only featured in small shops. From there, it has developed into a company that makes products to nourish your body and enhance your home. The products are presently available in over 65 countries around the world.
The first products available were Meal Soaps, which are still available with the company today. Featuring conditioning properties, these soaps don’t wash you out the same way that value brands will. You are just left with soft skin. The production of these soaps inspired colognes, women’s fragrances, and candles as well. Soon, the company started creating food products as well.
Crabtree & Evelyn precedes the “natural” movement, making formulas that include the essences of fruit, flowers, and other plants. With traditional but updated recipes, you are able to enjoy indulgent, spa-quality products, but with naturally safe ingredients.
Crabtree & Evelyn Products
Each one of the products is carefully concocted, based on Cyrus’s knowledge of botany. The products focus on hydrating and moisturizing the skin. If the product isn’t designed for the care of your skin, it is still designed with safe products that can enhance your outward appeal.
As an incentive to encourage consumers to make a bigger purchase on the website, the company offers free shipping for any order over $75. The shipping fees come off automatically, so you don’t need a coupon code at checkout.
Hand Care
The hand products are designed to help moisturize and treat your hands for soft skin. Your hands have the toughest skin of any place on your body, which makes it that much more important to nourish them. Once you get the soft hands you need, the company includes everything you need to make them beautiful as well, like nail lacquer and cuticle cream. Overall, this category includes:

Hand creams

Award winners: Gardeners; Citrus, Honey, & Coriander; Avocado, Olive, & Basil
Price range: $9-$32


Hand washes

Price range: $18-$30


Scrubs

Price range: $22-$26


60-Second Fix for Hands

Features four different scents

Gardeners
La Source
Rosewater
Citron, Honey, & Coriander


Price range: $14-$39


Nail care

Includes nail lacquers, cuticle cream, and other essential nail care products
Price range: $4.95-$22



Fragrance
The fragrances available are for both men and women to enjoy. The range includes body mists, flower waters, and more. The price range is $20 to $198, depending on the type of product you’re seeking. The most expensive products are the Night Garden line of Eau de Parfum. Since most people base their fragrance choices from how they smell in person, you may find it difficult to order without that ability. Luckily, the website offers a “fragrance finder,” which helps you to determine your new signature scent.
Bath & Body
This category basically includes every area of your skin, with the exception of your hands. The products in this category treat your hair, your body, and your lips. However, facial skincare is not offered in this category. Most of the products are available as a value size or a travel size, along with the regular size offered. With all pricing based on the size of the bottle you choose, this category includes:

Bath & shower gels ($6-$22)
Shampoos & conditioners ($30, with the exception of the Daily Moisturizing Products)
Scrubs ($28)
Soaps ($8-$26)
Salts, soaks & oils ($26)
Lotions & creams ($6-$40)
Powders ($19-$24)
Lip care ($4-$9)

At Home



This category includes products that are not designed to be topically moisturizing to your skin. You can choose from a variety of candles and diffusers, helping to give a relaxing and pleasant aroma in your home. Additionally, this is where you will find all the food products that the company advertises, like fudge or shortbread cookies. Candles are priced at $15 typically, while the diffusers earn a $45 price tag. The food is individually priced.
For Him
Even though many of the men’s products are already listed, the company separates this category to show consumers that there are several products available for men. This decision is probably an effort to express to men that their website isn’t just for women who enjoy a spa day. In this listing, you will find:

Fragrances ($45-$198)
Shave creams & soaps ($6-$25)
Post shave ($16-$32)
Body cleansers ($6-$55)

Crabtree & Evelyn Membership Program
Crabtree & Evelyn has a membership rewards program called Platinum Rewards for consumers, which allows them to be privy to the different incentives and specials. Unfortunately, this page may be under construction, since there is no additional information available about the program.
Contacting Crabtree & Evelyn
With so many items and the rewards program, it’s understandable to have questions about this company. You can email them directly by sending a message to [email protected] However, you can also fill in your contact information on the form available on the contact us page. There is no indication of how long it will take to get a reply.
Conclusion
Crabtree & Evelyn has grown a lot since the original line of soaps they offered. With a wealth of high-quality ingredients at fair prices, you won’t ever need a trip to the spa again.

Our story
From a small, family-run business to an international luxury brand, we’ve stayed true to our vision of transforming everyday rituals into extraordinarily pleasurable experiences.



Crabtree & Evelyn was founded in 1972 by Cyrus Harvey. The name Crabtree & Evelyn was inspired by John Evelyn, a 17th century botanist, and the English Crabapple tree, known for its beauty and use in home apothecary. Initially a small, family run business, the first store specialised in fine soaps sourced from around the world. 
One man's passion for travel coupled with an inherent desire for natural products, set the foundation for creating an international brand renowned the world over for its fragrances, body care products, fine foods and beautifully packaged gifts.
Cyrus collected soaps and lotions made by small manufacturers around the world.  What started as a vocation soon became a strong business proposition with customers delighting in the interesting and unique products available.  From this one small shop selling an eclectic collection of fine soaps, Crabtree & Evelyn now has a strong retail presence in more than 65 countries including over 200 wholly owned branded retail stores.
Creating the Crabtree & Evelyn brand was borne out of Cyrus' passion but he drew his inspiration from the life of John Evelyn, who was one of the first naturalists and conservationists and a visionary of his time.  It was Evelyn's personal motto 'explore everything, keep the best' that resonated with Cyrus and remains at the heart of the brand today.  



Meal Soaps were the first products to be launched under the Crabtree & Evelyn brand and these have evolved over the years into a range of Heritage soaps which are still available today.  These conditioning and rich-lathering soaps feature unique fragrance combinations from Crabapple & Mulberry to Black Sea Mud & Seaweed.  From here the product portfolio expanded to include English Flower Waters and Toilet Waters, Bath Gels and Men's Colognes.  The use of natural ingredients continued with the introduction of preserves, biscuits, teas and confectionery and Crabtree & Evelyn became known for its gourmet products in beautiful, botanically inspired packaging.
Long before the 'natural' and 'wellness' movements became popular, Crabtree & Evelyn was producing ranges featuring fruit, flower and plant essences.  The company continues to draw on its rich heritage and knowledge of plants and botanicals whilst embracing new discoveries.
Today the Crabtree & Evelyn product range comprises fragrances, bath and shower gels, soaps, home spa products, body lotions, hand creams and home fragrance. 
The ethos of the company remains, seeking out the most beneficial ingredients inspired by nature to create a range of products which make a world of difference.  A blend of the very best of nature and science coupled with tradition and innovation.
