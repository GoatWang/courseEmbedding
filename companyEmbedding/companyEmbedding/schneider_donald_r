Job Details
               Company Size: $5 mil to less than $10 mil - Employee Range: 25 to less than 100. We are pleased to announce that Roedel Parsons will serve as legal counsel to the New Orleans Aviation Board in connection with the RFP and Construction Manager at Risk process for the New Terminal Project at the Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport (Project). Our firm is grateful to work on such a significant Project with a lasting economic and tourism impact on our City, Region and State. The New Terminal will be completed in 2018 to mark the 300th Anniversary of the City of New Orleans. CJ Blache and Larry Roedel co-lead the legal team at Roedel Parsons with able assistance from Ben Hunter, David Fleshman and Ryan Brown. We are pleased to announce that Ryan Brown has received the Judge Joseph Keogh Memorial Award for his community service. The Baton Rouge Bar Association has again recognized Ryan's exemplary service to our profession and to those who are less fortunate. Ryan recently co chaired the Baton Rouge Law Day event and he leads the Just Cause organization which operates year round to help others with meals, medical supplies and other necessities. Congratulations Ryan, well deserved! Roedel Parsons and Just Cause combined forces again this season to distribute Thanksgiving dinners to families in need in the Greater Baton Rouge area. The chilly Thanksgiving morning was offset by the warm hospitality and talented leadership shown of Ryan Brown (President) and Josh Zelden (Vice President) as some 25 plus parents, children and grandchildren participated in delivering the meals . The Firm again thanks Just Cause for its continuing commitment to civic and charitable causes in our City and Region. Congratulations to Tom Balhoff and Trey Jones who recently concluded the successful defense of Turner Industries Group, LLC in a jury trial in St. John The Baptist Parish arising out of construction activities in 2009. Plaintiff worked for another contractor, and was working at an elevation high above ground in a pipe rack under construction when he was injured. The plaintiff suffered serious back and knee injuries, and his attorney asked the jury for more than $1.6 million in closing. Turner was the only defendant. The jury was out for only 30 minutes before returning with a zero defense verdict. Roedel Parsons announces the election of 3 new members of the Management Committee(MC) for 2 year terms effective January 1, 2014. They are Carlton (Trey) Jones; Scott Kirkpatrick; and Luke Piontek. Mr. Jones' practice includes commercial and casualty litigation. Mr. Kirkpatrick's practice includes governmental relations and administrative law. Mr. Piontek's practice includes expropriation litigation and Public Service Commission matters. The Firm thanks Tom Balhoff, Andre Bourgeois and Dave Woolridge for their leadership on the MC as they rotate off the committee after serving well for many years. The firm is pleased to announce its retention as legal counsel to the Louisiana International Gulf Transfer Terminal Authority (LIGTT), which is a political subdivision created by the Louisiana Legislature to help facilitate the construction and operation of a deep water cargo terminal at Mile 0 of the Mississippi River near Southwest Pass. The facility will be the first of its kind in the United States and will allow for the off loading of large "Panama Canal--sized" container vessels and then the subsequent transshipment of those containers up the Mississippi River, into its tributaries and then throughout the United States. The LIGTT and this Project are under the direction of its Board and its President, Senator A. G. Crowe. Our firm is grateful for the opportunity to work on a Project of such economic significance for the region and state. Roedel Parsons has achieved a Tier 1 ranking for 2014 by "Best Lawyers in America" as published by US News & World Report. This recognition is based on peer review and client evaluations. It reflects quality work by dedicated professionals over the firm's 25 year history. We appreciate the honor and recognition by our peers and clients. The Firm is pleased to announce that Johanna Posada Kyles has been elected to the Southern University Law Review. Johanna is a fulltime legal assistant in our Baton Rouge office and attends law school at night. She carries a straight "A" average and is currently ranked 3rd in her law school class. She is scheduled to graduate in December 2014. Congratulations Johanna on your excellent achievements and your obvious time management skills. As we mark our 25 th Anniversary on July 1, we are pleased to announce the arrival of 2 shareholders (Wayne Fontana and Richard Seelman) and 3 associates (Skye Fantaci, Shannon Frese and Jennifer Lewis) who will bring their litigation and workers compensation practice to our New Orleans office at 1515 Poydras Street, Suite 2330. Under the excellent leadership of Wayne Fontana, the attorneys of Fontana & Seelman will be joining Roedel Parsons and providing depth of experience and talent to our New Orleans team. Wayne will serve as the Managing Shareholder of the Firm's New Orleans office. Our Firm's long term commitment to the Greater New Orleans Area and the Southeast Louisiana Region has been significantly enhanced by the addition of these five professionals and their staff personnel. Shelley Ann McGlathery of our Baton Rouge office was a featured speaker at the May 1st CLE seminar in Lafayette entitled "What You Need To Know About Public Records and Open Meetings". As a current litigator and former journalist, she has the unique perspective of seeing these issues from all sides of the process. Her talk was very beneficial to the attorneys and journalists in attendance. Congratulations on an informative and timely presentation. We are pleased to announce that Ryan Brown of our Baton Rouge office has been selected by the Louisiana State Bar Association to receive its Pro Bono Service Award for the Young Lawyers Division at the 2013 Bench Bar Summer conference in Destin, Florida. Ryan has set an excellent example as he humbly and sacrificially serves our community and profession. Cori Blache and Ryan Brown of our Baton Rouge office were recognized for their volunteer service to the community by the Baton Rouge Bar Association in the April 2013 "Around the Bar" publication. Thank you for your dedication to those in need of a helping hand. Roedel Parsons Expropriation Team Secures Litigation Victory at the Fourth Circuit: Our Expropriation Litigation Team (Luke Piontek, Shelley Ann McGlathery, Gayle Busch, Kent Parsons and Christian Rhodes) secured another significant victory on February 27, 2013 with the Medical Center of Louisiana Project in the Fourth Circuit decision of Orleans Parish School Board versus State of Louisiana, et al.The Fourth Circuit affirmed the ruling by Judge Paulette Irons of the Civil District Court granting LSU a Summary Judgment as a matter of law regarding the evaluation methodology for certain property within the footprint of the project. This latest decision, among others, helps assure the orderly process leading toward the timely construction and opening of the new Medical Center. The Firm is pleased to announce that Ryan Brown has been nominated by the Baton Rouge Bar Association for the Pro Bono service award given annually by the Louisiana State Bar Association. Ryan helps lead the firm's service outreach to our community through the Baton Rouge Bar Association and Just Cause La, Inc. Thank you Ryan for your leadership and example to others. Roedel Parsons announces the formation of the Louisiana Sports Law Association ("Association"). This Association brings together professionals in the sports law field and sports industry with a focus on Louisiana based legal and business issues dealing with sports teams (high school, college and professional) and sports facilities. Within our firm, Larry Roedel and David Hardy serve as initial Directors. The Association's newsletter is published by the firm through attorneys, Brent Bourgeois, Ryan Brown, David Fleshman and Ben Hunter (as Editor) and Janice Reese (as our legal assistant). The Association will sponsor events throughout the year at well known sports facilities including CLE programs and other networking opportunities. Roedel Parsons teams with Just Cause to serve Thanksgiving meals: Under the direction of Ryan Brown and Joshua Zelden, the firm assisted Just Cause La., Inc. in serving meals to some 85 folks in the Baton Rouge area on Thanksgiving morning. This rewarding event marked the second annual Thanksgiving outreach in partnership with Just Cause La., Inc., a service organization lead by Ryan Brown of our Baton Rouge office. Thanks to Ryan and all who participated in this worthy project. Roedel Parsons has been named as a Tier 1 Firm by the "Best Lawyers in America" as published by US News & World Report. This recognition is based on peer review and client evaluations and is limited to a small percentage of firms in the country. It is a reflection and by product of high caliber work by quality lawyers over our 25 year history. In addition, Luke Piontek and Larry Roedel have been recognized by the Best Lawyers organization as leaders in their respective fields-Mr. Piontek in Public Utility Law and Mr. Roedel in Civil Litigation. Those individual honors are also the by product of quality work by the team of lawyers whom Mr. Piontek and Mr. Roedel help lead on a daily basis. The credit belongs to the team. Roedel Parsons Expropriation team secures litigation victory in Fourth Circuit and Louisiana Supreme Court: Our expropriation litigation team (Christi Peck, Luke Piontek, Ben Hunter and Christian Rhodes) secured a major victory on July 25, 2012 for the Medical Center of Louisiana Project in the Fourth Circuit decision of Alderice vs. Board of Supervisors for Louisiana State University, et al. The Fourth Circuit recognized and affirmed the constitutional authority of LSU to expropriate property under the "quick take" statutory provisions. The Lousiana Supreme Court has now denied the writ application by Alderice. This final decision, among others, helps assure the orderly process leading toward the timely construction of the new Medical Center. Roedel Parsons enters its 25th Year of Practice: "Our firm has now entered its 25th year of legal practice. July 1, 1988 seems like a distant memory, but that day marked the "opening of our doors for business" here in Baton Rouge. We are very grateful for our client base, our attorneys and staff, the families they represent, and the opportunity to contribute to a worthy profession. Our "doors are now also open" in New Orleans and Lafayette and we value the community relationships that have been cultivated over this near quarter century. As we look toward our official 25th anniversary-July 1, 2013-- we count our blessings and say "thank you" to everyone who has played any role in helping our firm be successful." Our law partner, David Hardy, has been engaged by the Tiger Athletic Foundation to help lead the legal team on the South Stadium Expansion Project which will add new scoreboards, box suites and seats to Tiger Stadium, boosting the overall capacity to 99,500, thus making Tiger Stadium the 7 th largest on campus stadium in the country. The anticipated project completion date is August, 2014. David leads the firm's Sports Facility Practice Group. We appreciate David's legal leadership and the opportunity to work on such a significant project. On March 22d, the Firm was recognized by LSU as one of the " Top 100 Fastest Growing Tiger Businesses" primarily owned by LSU graduates. This is the second consecutive year that our firm has received this recognition. In the small business category (less than 50 principals) we had the largest percentage of LSU graduates among the companies receiving these honors. We thank LSU for establishing the Top 100 Program. The firm is grateful to count the LSU Foundation and the Tiger Athletic Foundation among its clients. Wayne Fontana (Managing Shareholder in our New Orleans Office) will be taking a leadership role in speaking and teaching on workers' compensation issues over the next several months including: the Risk Insurance Management Society - New Orleans Chapter; the International Association of Rehabilitation Professionals; Louisiana Claims Association; the Louisiana Association of Business Industry; and the nationally recognized Certification Program for Workers' Compensation Professionals through the Louisiana Association of Self Insured Employers. In addition, Mr. Fontana regularly testifies before the Joint House and Senate Committees on workers' compensation and tort reform, the jury trial threshold and judicial transparency.

Schneider 3Staff 2Punctuality 2Helpfulness 3KnowledgeReally dislike this practice. Dr. Donald is okay, but I disagree with some of his treatment suggestions. They do not have modern billing practices and you cannot use an FSA card. In 2016 this is unacceptable. I have to move on. Was this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted April 18, 2016 1Staff 3Punctuality 4Helpfulness 4KnowledgeDr Schneider has been our doctor for 5 yrs. I like him but the staff is horrible! The manager is rude, argues, doesn't listen, and has questionable billing practices per my ins co customer service. My son went for a flu shot and they charged us $20 when my ins says it should have been free. When I questioned I was told that since my son had a fever they had to talk to the doctor before giving the shot. When I said that all they did was ask me how he was feeling as I carried him back, had me put him down in the hall, injected him and said we could go she said that it must have been an error with the computer but wouldn't give me my money back. They told me that I owed them $20 for a phone call since it went "beyond normal" even though I was never told while I talking to them (my copay is only $15). They scheduled my daughters one yr check up on her bday and yelled at me because that wasn't allowed (my ins says it's fine). Their staff should know that. Also charged $4 to file the claim.Was this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted July 15, 2014 5Staff 5Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeMy son just loves Dr. Schneider. He is the only doctor my child feels comfortable seeing. When we had a temporary insurance change, and had to see another doctor, he had a melt down. He does not have these melt downs when he knows he is seeing Dr. Schneider. The staff is very welcoming and the waiting room is a fun play area. I am a nurse and I find Dr. Schneider to be very knowledgable and reassuring.Was this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted October 21, 2013 1Staff 3Punctuality 1Helpfulness 3KnowledgeDr. Scheider was on call for my Pediatrician (who accepts my insurance as well as the hospital) the day my daughter was to be released from hospital the day after she was born. Apparently Dr. Schneider does not take my insurance. I was not told until after the statute of limitations for a claim was up with my insurance company that they would not file on my behalf. so now my insurance co says it is too late and they will not pay. Why does he pay his staff if they don't do their job and submit claims? I didn't pick him, I didn't go to his office. I wasn't thinking about insurance the day after I gave birth. Shame on you and your office!Was this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted September 13, 2012 5Staff 5Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeDr. Schneider is the best, my children love him!! He has always been very helpful and correct with his diagnosis!Was this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted October 6, 2009 4Staff 3Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeI have four children and I don't know how I would have made it all these years without him. I value his expertise with child behaviour.Was this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted March 3, 2009 4Staff 5Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeDr. Schneider has been our chidlren's pediatrician for over 10 years -- WE LOVE HIM! We moved from the area a few years ago but still travel 40 mins to see him and will continue to until the last one turns 18. If you have concerns between visits you can leave a message in voicemail that he will return within 24 hours and most often the same day. He has a nurse practitioner, Jane Roach, who is also wonderful. One of my son's was sick on New Year's Eve. She not only waited for us to get there (closing early that day for the holiday) she gave me her home number if he got worst over the holiday. You can't get better service than that. As someone else mentioned, the office manager has some less than considerate of people's time policies on paperwork (will not mail anything out, must be picked up). But since she is also his wife I don't think that is going to change anytime soon.Was this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted August 26, 2008 5Staff 4Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeDr. Schneider is the BEST! I have know him for 27 years! I hope he doesn't retire before I have Grandchildren. I can't imagine anyone else taking care of them. They will deserve the best just as MY children have received all their lives.Was this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted May 21, 2008 Staff 3Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeI ALWAYS have to wait a substantial amount of time for Dr. Schneider on routine visits, but that is ok! If my daughter is VERY sick he will take her in first, and I understand this. They are always able to squeeze me in when I need it. Dr. Schneider is the best. A couple of times I doubted his diagnosis or didn't agree with his views and in the end, he always turns up right. He is very knowledgable but also very intuitive. I like his straight forward manner and my 4 yr old daughter is in love with him. His staff can get tedious at times, but I can deal with that. I reccomend him especially for asthmatics!Was this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted November 1, 2006 Staff 5Punctuality 4Helpfulness 5Knowledgevery knowledgeable, up to date, great with childrenWas this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted October 12, 2006 Rate this DoctorDr. Donald R.

Specialties & ExpertiseDr. Donald Schneider has the following 1 specialty.                     Family Medicine
    A family practitioner is a doctor who specializes in caring for people of all ages, at all stages of life. Rather than focusing on the treatment of one disease or patient population, family practitioners are often the doctors that people see for their everyday ailments, like cold and flu or respiratory infections, and health screenings. When necessary, family practitioners will provide referrals for conditions that require the expertise of another specialist.


    The doctors may also provide physicals, inoculations, prenatal care, treat chronic diseases, like diabetes and asthma, and provide advice on disease prevention.
