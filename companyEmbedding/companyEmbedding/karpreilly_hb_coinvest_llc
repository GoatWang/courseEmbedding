 Prospectus Supplement To Prospectus
Dated December 28, 2015
  
 Filed Pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3)
Registration No. 333-208576
 The Habit Restaurants, Inc. 
Up to 14,501,236 Shares of Class A Common Stock   
  This prospectus supplement supplements the prospectus
dated December 28, 2015, of The Habit Restaurants, Inc., which is part of a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-208576) (the Prospectus) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the public
offering and sale of securities by the selling stockholders as described therein. This prospectus supplement should be read in conjunction with the Prospectus, as supplemented to date, and this prospectus supplement is qualified by reference to the
Prospectus, as supplemented to date, except to the extent that the information provided by this prospectus supplement supersedes the information contained in the Prospectus. 
This prospectus supplement is provided solely to update the selling stockholder table included in the Prospectus with respect to the number of shares of
Class A and Class B common stock, as well as the number of LLC Units beneficially owned by (i) investment funds affiliated with KarpReilly, LLC, and (ii) investment funds affiliated with BlackRock, Inc., along with other selling
stockholders.  This prospectus supplement is not complete without, and may not be delivered or utilized except in connection with, the Prospectus dated
December 28, 2015, with respect to the securities described above, including any amendments or supplements thereto.  Investing in our securities
involves risks. You should carefully consider the risk factors beginning on page 4 of the Prospectus and set forth in the documents incorporated by reference therein before making any decision to invest in our securities. 
Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved of these securities or passed upon the
adequacy or accuracy of this prospectus supplement. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.  The date of this
prospectus supplement is August 19, 2016. 


ABOUT THIS PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT 
This prospectus supplement is being filed to amend, supplement and correct the information that appears under the caption Selling Stockholders in
the Prospectus. Capitalized terms that are not defined in this prospectus supplement are defined in the Prospectus. 


SELLING STOCKHOLDERS 
The selling stockholders named below may offer from time to time in the future up to an aggregate of 9,514,327 shares of our Class A common stock, as of
August 15, 2016. As of August 15, 2016, the selling stockholders collectively hold 8,032,000 LLC Units in The Habit Restaurants, LLC and 1,482,327 restricted shares of Class A common stock. Pursuant to the terms of the LLC Agreement,
each LLC Unit of The Habit Restaurants, LLC held by the selling stockholders is exchangeable for, generally, at the option of The Habit Restaurants, Inc. (such determination to be made by the disinterested members of our board of directors),
(i) shares of our Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to customary conversion rate adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends and reclassifications or (ii) cash consideration (generally calculated based on the
volume-weighted average price of the Class A common stock of The Habit Restaurants, Inc., as displayed under the heading Bloomberg VWAP on the Bloomberg page designated for the Class A common stock of The Habit Restaurants, Inc. for the 15
trading days immediately prior to the delivery date of a notice of exchange). At any time that an effective registration statement is on file with the SEC with respect to the shares of Class A Common Stock to be issued upon an exchange, The
Habit Restaurants, Inc. may not provide cash consideration upon an exchange to a Continuing LLC Owner without the Continuing LLC Owners prior consent. 
The following table sets forth the selling stockholders beneficial ownership of our Class A common stock as of August 15, 2016. Each selling
stockholder has the right to exchange any (but no less than 1,000 LLC Units, except with our consent) or all of such selling stockholders LLC Units in accordance with the LLC Agreement. The number and percentage of shares beneficially owned
after this offering for each selling stockholder assumes the exchange by the selling stockholders of all LLC Units owned by them for the equivalent number of our shares of Class A common stock and sale of all such shares offered by the selling
stockholders and that each selling stockholder does not acquire any additional shares or units. Information in the table below with respect to beneficial ownership has been furnished by each of the selling stockholders. Beneficial ownership is
determined in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC.  The selling stockholders listed in the table below may have sold, transferred,
otherwise disposed of or purchased, or may sell, transfer, otherwise dispose of or purchase, at any time and from time to time, LLC Units or shares of our Class A common stock in transactions exempt from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act or in the open market after the date on which they provided the information set forth in the table below. The maximum number of shares of Class A common stock offered hereby assumes the selling stockholders exchange all of their
LLC Units held on the date on which they provided the information set forth in the table below and we elect to satisfy all exchange requests by issuing only shares of Class A common stock. Assuming we do issue shares of our Class A common
stock to a holder of LLC Units upon an exchange, such holder may offer for sale all, some or none of such shares of Class A common stock. Therefore, it is difficult to estimate with any degree of certainty the aggregate number of shares that
the selling stockholders will ultimately offer pursuant to this prospectus or that the selling stockholders will ultimately own upon completion of the offering to which this prospectus relates. The following table does not take into effect any
restrictions on ownership or transfer as described in Description of Capital Stock.  Information about additional selling stockholders, if
any, including their identities and the Class A common stock to be registered on their behalf, may be set forth in a prospectus supplement, in a post-effective amendment or in filings that we make with the SEC under the Exchange Act, which are
incorporated by reference in this prospectus. Information concerning the selling stockholders may change from time to time. Any changes to the information provided below will be set forth in a supplement to this prospectus, in a post-effective
amendment or in filings we make with the SEC under the Exchange Act, which are incorporated by reference into this prospectus if and when necessary. 


The selling stockholders named below and their permitted transferees, pledgees, orderees or other successors may
from time to time offer the shares of our Class A common stock offered by this prospectus:

For purposes of this offer, qualifying balances are calculated by adding total incoming assets or transfers (including cash, securities and/or margin debit balance transfers) from external accounts, and subtracting assets withdrawn or transferred out of the account within the 90-day holding period.
Assets of $20,000 to $49,999 in cash and/or securities receive $100; for $50,000-$99,999 receive $150; for $100,000-$199,999 receive $250; for $200,000 or more receive $600. You must have the qualifying balance 90 days after funding.

Please remember there's always the potential of losing money when you invest in securities. 
			
			Before you invest in a Section 529 plan, request the plan's official statement from your Financial Solutions Advisor and read it carefully. The official statement contains more complete information, including investment objectives, charges, expenses and risks of investing in the 529 plan, which you should consider carefully before investing. You should also consider whether your home state or your beneficiary's home state offers any state tax or other benefits that are only available for investments in such state's 529 plan. Section 529 plans are not guaranteed by any state or federal agency.

1 To be eligible for favorable tax treatment afforded to any earnings portion of withdrawals from Section 529 accounts, such withdrawals must be used for "qualified higher education expenses," as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. Any earnings withdrawn that are not used for such expenses are subject to federal income tax and may be subject to a 10% additional federal tax, as well as applicable state and local income taxes. 
			
2 Section 529 plans are established by various states and are offered to residents of all states. Depending on the laws of the customer's home state, favorable tax treatment for investing in a Section 529 plan may be limited to investments made in a Section 529 plan offered by the customer's home state. Neither Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated nor any of its subsidiaries are tax or legal advisors. We suggest you consult your personal tax or legal advisor before making tax or legal-related investment decisions.

Frequently Asked Questions 




What is an IRA?


							An Individual Retirement Account (IRA) may provide either a tax-deferred or tax-free way for you to save for retirement.  There are many different types of IRAs but Roth, Traditional and Rollover IRAs are the most common.
						






How does an IRA work?


							IRAs rely on long-term, tax-deferred compounding to provide your retirement savings the opportunity to grow more quickly than in a taxable account.  When you earn interest, receive a dividend or sell an investment (such as a mutual fund) for a gain, you don't pay taxes that year on the earnings.  Instead, all taxes are deferred until you withdraw those earnings in retirement.
						






Why is an IRA important now?


							In retirement you may need as much as 100% of your current after-tax income (take-home pay) minus any amount you are saving for retirement each year.  This makes it all the more important to start saving sooner rather than later, and an IRA can help you get started.
						






What are the ways I can invest in an IRA?


							You can choose from investment products such as mutual funds, stocks, bonds and ETFs, as well as bank products like CDs and money market savings.
						






What are the contribution deadlines?

You can make contributions to an IRA for a given tax year until the tax return filing deadline of the following year.






How do I convert to a Roth IRA?

A Roth IRA Conversion could help grow your retirement assets federally income tax-free. To help you convert to a Merrill Edge Roth IRA, call us at 888.637.3343 for one-on-one assistance and we'll guide you every step of the way. We're here 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.






What are my options for converting a 401(k) to an IRA?

You have several choices when it comes to your old 401(k). Typically known as a rollover IRA, you can opt to transfer your money into an IRA. Another option is keeping the current 401(k) with your old employer or transfer it to a new employer plan.

Frequently Asked Questions 




SEP IRA



Do I have to contribute annually?
                                No. A SEP IRA gives you the flexibility to decide each year whether to contribute and at what rate. That could mean contributing more during profitable years and less or nothing at all during less profitable years.
                            
Is it difficult to administer a SEP IRA?
                                SEP IRAs have little to no paperwork and administration and don't require filing with the IRS. Plus, a Small Business Financial Solutions Advisor can help you get started.
                            
Is there investment research I can review? 
                                Yes. As a Merrill Edge client, you get access to BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research (rated #1 by Institutional InvestorFootnote 2)-as well as research from other industry leaders-to gain investing knowledge and market
                                insights that can help inform your investment strategy.
                            




SIMPLE IRA



Is there a mandatory employer match? 
                                Yes. With a SIMPLE IRA, you must contribute either 2% of compensation for each eligible employee, regardless of participation, or a dollar-for-dollar match of employee salary deferral contributions, capped at 3% of compensation (which may be reduced to as low as 1% in any two years during a 5-year period).
                            
What if my business grows beyond 100 employees?
                                You may need to consider establishing a small business 401(k) plan when your business grows to more than 100 employees. A Small Business Financial Solutions Advisor can help you consider your options. Please note: If you decide to establish a 401(k) plan, you would stop contributions to the SIMPLE IRA plan and then start the 401(k). Participants that have been in the SIMPLE IRA plan for over two years may roll their SIMPLE IRA assets over to the new 401(k) if it allows for rollovers. Before making any decisions, you should speak with your tax and legal advisor about your situation and the requirements for terminating a plan and establishing a new one.
                            
Is it difficult to administer a SIMPLE IRA? 
                                We have many ways to make managing your retirement plan easier. Our Merrill Lynch E-Contribs for Small Business Retirement Accounts™ provides small business owners with a convenient web-based solution for making contributions to retirement plan accounts, while the Automated Investment Program provides a systematic way to invest in mutual funds on a schedule based on your needs.
                                
                                SIMPLE IRA contributions will be made through your payroll company and you will be required to send an annual notice to your employees. You do not file IRS Form 5500 as you would with a 401(k) plan.

Each choice may offer different investment options and services, fees and expenses, withdrawal options, required minimum distributions, tax treatment and provide different protection from creditors and legal judgments.
