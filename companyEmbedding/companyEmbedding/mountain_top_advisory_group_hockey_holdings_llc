Computer Repair reviews in Mountain Top

        Real People ~ Real Reviews ~ Real Results      




Provider name locked. won my business because he was: 
1. Available - easily reached via phone/text/email;  
2. Knowledgeable- about the products and their application; 
3: Cost Conscious - wanting to do the best job and also keep things under budget; 
4: Accommodating - was able to provide services that fit my odd work hours; 
5: Earnest and Friendly - was excited about helping, wanted to get things done to my satisfaction.
I'm pretty particular and try to know as much as I can about AV products. Provider name locked. was more than willing to discuss my ideas an provide answers.
Provider name locked. and Provider name locked. showed up promptly on-time of appointment, were neat and kept things clean at install sites, Provider name locked. did great job with wire management and electrical installation. I am happy with the quality of the work and the finished product. Quality communication and service. I strongly encourage others to consider Provider name locked. for their AV, WiFi, Video needs.
 

            - DANIEL U.          





    <Provider name locked. >Promised computer next day, was told it was ready but he couldn't deliver it so made appointment next morning 9 am. At 9 am he couldn't drive to my home so I said I would drive to his home. I was almost there when he called and said computer not finished. He needed another hour.  I went to my appointments an and let him know I was on my way back ( 2 hours later) but he needed more time. 3 hours later I get the computer. When I set it up at home, found out he did not do any microsoft updates  and never put in the numbers so I would have been locked out of microsoft in 3 days. He did not complete his work. I asked for some money back, he agreed but never kept his promise. Provider name locked. >

 

            - monica L.          




Promptly returned my call. He was not sure he could help but said he would try and if he could not fix the problem he would not take a fee. He called back several times although some calls were not timely and did fix the problem. Much more time was spent than I paid for, until the problem was fixed. This fix was done remotely by phone so no on site work was required.
 

            - Edward D.

Paxos Appoints Former NYSE CEO Duncan L. Niederauer to Board of Directors








Tweet












Nov 29, 2016 | By Paxos

NEW YORK, Nov. 29, 2016 -- Paxos™, a financial technology company delivering revolutionary blockchain solutions for global financial institutions, today announced the appointment of Duncan L. Niederauer, the former Chief Executive Officer of The New York Stock Exchange, to the company's Board of Directors.

Niederauer joins the company's experienced leadership team, including fellow board members former FDIC Chairman Sheila C. Bair, former U.S. Sen. Bill Bradley, former FASB Chairman Robert H. Herz, and former Chairman, President and CEO of Lotus Development Corporation Jim Manzi.
"Duncan is an exceptional addition to our board and we will benefit from his over 30 years of leadership experience in developing products and building companies in financial services," said Paxos CEO Charles Cascarilla. "Duncan has been at the forefront of innovation and transformation in capital markets and will be instrumental as we continue to grow."
"I'm delighted to join the Paxos Board of Directors during a time of evolution within capital markets. Blockchain technology promises to revolutionize post-trade clearing infrastructure and Paxos' Bankchain platform is poised to offer unique market efficiencies and automation for the benefit of all investors. I'm excited to join a team of distinguished board members and work with the Paxos management team," said Duncan Niederauer.
Niederauer served as CEO of NYSE from 2007-2014. He was a partner at Goldman Sachs, where he worked from 1985-2007. He is co-founder of the Mountain Top Advisory Group, a managing member of 555 Capital, and the non-executive chairman of Scenic Advisement, LLC. He also sits on the boards of First Republic Bank, Realogy Holdings and Colgate University.
The appointment follows a series of strategic collaborations strengthening Paxos' position as a global leader in blockchain post-trade settlement. Paxos and Euroclear, one of the world's largest settlement houses, recently announced a collaboration to create Euroclear Bankchain, a blockchain settlement service for the gold market. The next-generation service brings instant settlement and true DvP (Delivery versus Payment) to the London bullion market for the first time. Paxos also announced a collaboration with EY on similar blockchain settlement initiatives.
