You can be on the lake this year. Come check out this beautiful waterfront cottage on cayuga lake. Perfect combination of natural shoreline and seawall in front of the cottage makes for the best of both worlds: level yard and great walk in lakefront. 126 ft total lake frontage with dock included. Remodeled cottage features cherry kitchen, refinished wood floors, charming stone fireplace with a gas insert to take the chill off, and vaulted ceilings, with great views! A great way to get a nice lakefront property in the finger lakes priced under assessed value. Enjoyable lakefront property with storage shed above and below with ample parking above.

Have you been looking for a fairly priced 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom, 2 car garage caged pool home in a deed restricted neighbor hood in Sarasota? Well, this is it. Wonderful curb appeal, great layout. Longwood Run is close to everything including the UTC Mall. Very well maintained neighborhood. This home is located on a quiet cul de sac. The backyard backs up to a nature preserve so it is very private.
