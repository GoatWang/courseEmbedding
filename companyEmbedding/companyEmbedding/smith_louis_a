Treevon Prater, East St. Louis Football


Paul Kopsky



















































































































On the surface, Syracuse and the St. Louis area don't have much in common.Dig a little deeper and there's DeAndre Smith, the running backs coach for the Orange.It's a bit of a surprise to see Syracuse pop up on the list of schools area players are considering, because it wasn't a place that had received much attention before. But Smith, who went to University City for three years and finished at Berkeley High before playing at Missouri State, plans to have a big presence. 
This season was the first in upstate New York, after coaching stops at the University of Nevada Las Vegas, Illinois, New Mexico and Northern Illinois."St. Louis kids fit our profile," Smith said. "Good football players who are tough." 
Smith spent about six weekends in the area mining for prospects and found a good one in Treevon Prater of East St. Louis. The year before, even with a late start, area players Mitch Kimble, a quarterback from Jerseyville, and Corey Winfield, a wide receiver from Riverview Gardens, inked with the Orange.
Smith says the Orange plan to play Prater at the cornerback. He had seven interceptions for the Flyers as a senior and made 70 tackles. He also scored eight touchdowns as a wideout."Right now, we like him at DB," Smith said. "He's what we call a three-fer — a kid who can play three different positions. He's very talented, and his defensive ball skills fit the scheme we want."Listed at 6-foot and 185-pounds, Prater is a good-sized corner but still has the speed to stick at the position. If he adds some size, he would slot well at safety."We're very glad to have him. We hope it starts a trend. We'll sell the things we feel make this university unique," Smith said. "Hopefully some more of the St. Louis area kids will like what they see."

        W.H. Smith buys LaBarge Products assets
    


FROM STAFF REPORTS

W.H. Smith Co. has acquired the use of a website, trade name and other intellectual property from LaBarge Products Inc.
The West Virginia-based manufacturer of hose assemblies said it closed last month on the purchase of intellectual property and related assets from St. Louis-based LaBarge Products, a manufacturer of systems and components for military operations that ceased operations in recent months.

Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. 
The acquisition includes the domain site www.labargepro.com, proprietary drawings, tooling and related fixtures and the LaBarge Products trade name. 


Eric Jenkusky, W.H. Smith's director of business development, said LaBarge Products is now operating as a division of W.H. Smith.
LaBarge Products was previously based at 3445 Bent Avenue in St. Louis. Upon purchasing the assets, LaBarge Products did not have any employees, Jenkusky said. 
EDITOR'S NOTE: This story was updated on March 22 to remove the corporate logo of LaBarge Inc. that was mistakenly attached to the story. LaBarge Inc. is not related to LaBarge Products.

Delicious Products with the Highest Quality












No one knows what made John and Peter Schmid borrow $300 from a neighbor to buy a dairy that first day of 1909. Whatever the reason, the two sons of a Swiss immigrant took the money and purchased two horses, two wagons, an assortment of milk bottles, cans, dippers, and a hand-crank ice cream freezer. Thus, Smith Dairy was born.








Since 1909, quality has been the discerning trademark of “The Dairy in the Country”. Every aspect of business was performed with personal pride and close attention to each detail. From the first day, the Schmid brothers had to exercise this care in their daily chores. A monotonous task like handwashing the milk bottles could have easily been neglected or hurried. The Schmids took the time each day to ensure cleanliness. This practice is the foundation upon which the quality tradition at Smith Dairy was born.
The company joined the Quality Chekd organization in 1947. This prestigious dairy association is committed to ensuring high quality and exacting standards in dairy production. We have earned numerous awards since joining Quality Chekd, each one demonstrating our long-standing commitment to excellence.
QUALITY CHEKD HAS JUST RECENTLY NAMED SMITH DAIRY PRODUCTS CO. PLANT AS A FINALIST FOR THE PRODUCTION EXCELLENCE AWARD IN THE MILK CATEGORY.

White Glove Shipping
Appropriate for large or fragile items.

      Costs range from $100 for smaller items delivered locally to $1,000+ for extra large
      items transported across the Continental United States. Final cost depends on the size of the items and the
      buyer's location.
    

      Local deliveries typically take about 2 weeks and longer
      distance deliveries typically take about 3-6 weeks.
    
Flat Rate Shipping

      Shipment through recognized carriers such as UPS, FedEx, and USPS. Appropriate for smaller items, most
      accessories and some small furniture.
    

      Costs range from $9 to $299 and up, depending on the size and weight of the item.
    
Delivery is typically 7-10 days
Local Pickup

      Local pickup allows a buyer to avoid shipping costs by picking up an item in person. The buyer must contact the
      seller within five business days of their purchase to coordinate a pickup date and time. Delays may result in
      additional charges.
    
Local Delivery

      As a lower cost alternative, some of our sellers offer local curbside delivery within a limited geography around
      their location. The buyer must contact the seller within five business days of their purchase to coordinate a
      delivery date and time. Delays may result in additional charges.
    

      If additional labor is required to move the item inside or upstairs, buyers should make sure to plan accordingly.
    




Returns & Cancellations

        Except for Local Pickup and Local Delivery, buyers have 48 hours after delivery to inspect
        their item(s) and contact support@chairish.com if they wish
        to return an item. There are no restocking fees, but we deduct outbound and return shipping charges from the
        buyer's original purchase price (+ taxes when applicable). Buyers may not be reimbursed for returns that are not
        received in original condition.

HOW TO PICK THE PERFECT VINTAGE SIDE TABLE
Nothing adds vibrato to a room like a vintage side table. While it’s certainly not the elephant in the room (we’ll leave that business to the sofa), vintage side tables are an easy way to plug a space with texture and score extra storage space in the process. And who doesn’t love that? 
Perfect for housing drinks and table lamps, vintage side tables (also known as accent tables or end tables) befriend club chairs effortlessly and add supreme function to a couch. Although they often come in matching sets, be aware that pairs do have a knack for making a room look overtly formal. So if Scarlett O’Hara isn’t your muse and you favor a bohemian or shabby chic vibe, try mixing and matching used side tables. By sticking to a similar color palette and general sense of scale it’s surprisingly easy to nail a look that looks expertly curated.
Prior to buying, it’s also wise to consider how a vintage end table will be used. Oftentimes—and especially if storage is a must—a vintage accent table can be fashioned out of an unexpected item. Below, we’ve broken down some types of vintage side tables to consider, including some objects that might not be traditionally considered.
PICK YOUR SIDES
Nesting Tables 
Ah, the nesting table. Maybe it’s their sweet and homey name or the fact that they feel undeniably BOGO-like, but these dainty tables pull at our heartstrings. Typically consisting of a larger table that houses one or two smaller tables in its canopy, vintage nesting tables come in all styles, ranging from English traditional to contemporary. These theatrical tables are perfect for grand sofas that would easily dwarf a more petite side table, or space-pressed interiors where a coffee table might not be in the cards. Pull the smallest of your nesters from its pack and place in front of the sofa for an instant cocktail table.
Bar Cart 
True, the average side table can butler a drink just dandy, but by upgrading to a bar cart you’ll have all of your spirits within arm’s reach too! In addition to holding your bottles, bar carts are also an excellent place to stow pretty coffee table books or magazines. Best yet, most bar carts have rails surrounding each shelf, making them ideal for minimizing party mishaps.
Nightstand

When you figure that nightstands stand alert on either side of the bed quite impressively, why not translate them to the living room? Nightstands typically come equipped with drawers or an interior cabinet, which colors them perfect for relaxed living rooms that double as playrooms. One imperative to keep in mind when using a vintage nightstand? Scale. Nightstands tend to be blockier than your average vintage accent table, so ensure that you’re not overpowering your other furniture by measuring twice and buying once. To help aid your search, keep an eye out for leggy nightstands. The longer a table’s legs, the less likely it will be to add mass to a sofa.
Garden Stool 
Bring the outdoors in with a vintage garden stool. These versatile stools—usually crafted of ceramic—are essential for a room in need of a bolt of color. We love the look of a deep, turquoise-washed stool next to a clean white sofa, though cobalt blue or red would work magic as well. Garden stools might not offer up a bounty of surface space, but fanciful details like cut-outs and textural hobnails make them serious room jewelry. As a bonus, they also can double as seating.

Once you’ve decided on your side table it’s time to layer on the details. We’re talking the obvious—lamps—and the not-so obvious—ever notice that an end table is the perfect place to lean a small-scale painting? Other items we love are coasters stacked at the ready (opt for coasters with pretty finished rims to ensure that they look just as great stacked as they do laid out for mugs of tea), candles, and greenery. Alternatively, a large bone or Lucite tray that’s flush with your accent table’s top can make protecting a precious surface like wood or marble terrifically easy, while also providing a glamorous touch. And lastly, adding a lidded basket or lacquer box to hide those unsightly remotes?— Well, that’s just ingenious.

Shipping & Returns Policy
  View complete shipping
  and returns policy & FAQs.

        


White Glove Shipping
Appropriate for large or fragile items.

      Costs range from $100 for smaller items delivered locally to $1,000+ for extra large
      items transported across the Continental United States. Final cost depends on the size of the items and the
      buyer's location.
    

      Local deliveries typically take about 2 weeks and longer
      distance deliveries typically take about 3-6 weeks.
    
Flat Rate Shipping

      Shipment through recognized carriers such as UPS, FedEx, and USPS. Appropriate for smaller items, most
      accessories and some small furniture.
    

      Costs range from $9 to $299 and up, depending on the size and weight of the item.
    
Delivery is typically 7-10 days
Local Pickup

      Local pickup allows a buyer to avoid shipping costs by picking up an item in person. The buyer must contact the
      seller within five business days of their purchase to coordinate a pickup date and time. Delays may result in
      additional charges.
    
Local Delivery

      As a lower cost alternative, some of our sellers offer local curbside delivery within a limited geography around
      their location. The buyer must contact the seller within five business days of their purchase to coordinate a
      delivery date and time. Delays may result in additional charges.
    

      If additional labor is required to move the item inside or upstairs, buyers should make sure to plan accordingly.
    




Returns & Cancellations

        Except for Local Pickup and Local Delivery, buyers have 48 hours after delivery to inspect
        their item(s) and contact support@chairish.com if they wish
        to return an item. There are no restocking fees, but we deduct outbound and return shipping charges from the
        buyer's original purchase price (+ taxes when applicable). Buyers may not be reimbursed for returns that are not
        received in original condition.

HOW TO PICK THE PERFECT VINTAGE SIDE TABLE
Nothing adds vibrato to a room like a vintage side table. While it’s certainly not the elephant in the room (we’ll leave that business to the sofa), vintage side tables are an easy way to plug a space with texture and score extra storage space in the process. And who doesn’t love that? 
Perfect for housing drinks and table lamps, vintage side tables (also known as accent tables or end tables) befriend club chairs effortlessly and add supreme function to a couch. Although they often come in matching sets, be aware that pairs do have a knack for making a room look overtly formal. So if Scarlett O’Hara isn’t your muse and you favor a bohemian or shabby chic vibe, try mixing and matching used side tables. By sticking to a similar color palette and general sense of scale it’s surprisingly easy to nail a look that looks expertly curated.
Prior to buying, it’s also wise to consider how a vintage end table will be used. Oftentimes—and especially if storage is a must—a vintage accent table can be fashioned out of an unexpected item. Below, we’ve broken down some types of vintage side tables to consider, including some objects that might not be traditionally considered.
PICK YOUR SIDES
Nesting Tables 
Ah, the nesting table. Maybe it’s their sweet and homey name or the fact that they feel undeniably BOGO-like, but these dainty tables pull at our heartstrings. Typically consisting of a larger table that houses one or two smaller tables in its canopy, vintage nesting tables come in all styles, ranging from English traditional to contemporary. These theatrical tables are perfect for grand sofas that would easily dwarf a more petite side table, or space-pressed interiors where a coffee table might not be in the cards. Pull the smallest of your nesters from its pack and place in front of the sofa for an instant cocktail table.
Bar Cart 
True, the average side table can butler a drink just dandy, but by upgrading to a bar cart you’ll have all of your spirits within arm’s reach too! In addition to holding your bottles, bar carts are also an excellent place to stow pretty coffee table books or magazines. Best yet, most bar carts have rails surrounding each shelf, making them ideal for minimizing party mishaps.
Nightstand

When you figure that nightstands stand alert on either side of the bed quite impressively, why not translate them to the living room? Nightstands typically come equipped with drawers or an interior cabinet, which colors them perfect for relaxed living rooms that double as playrooms. One imperative to keep in mind when using a vintage nightstand? Scale. Nightstands tend to be blockier than your average vintage accent table, so ensure that you’re not overpowering your other furniture by measuring twice and buying once. To help aid your search, keep an eye out for leggy nightstands. The longer a table’s legs, the less likely it will be to add mass to a sofa.
Garden Stool 
Bring the outdoors in with a vintage garden stool. These versatile stools—usually crafted of ceramic—are essential for a room in need of a bolt of color. We love the look of a deep, turquoise-washed stool next to a clean white sofa, though cobalt blue or red would work magic as well. Garden stools might not offer up a bounty of surface space, but fanciful details like cut-outs and textural hobnails make them serious room jewelry. As a bonus, they also can double as seating.
MAKE IT YOUR OWN WITH INSTA-WORTHY DETAILS
Once you’ve decided on your side table it’s time to layer on the details. We’re talking the obvious—lamps—and the not-so obvious—ever notice that an end table is the perfect place to lean a small-scale painting? Other items we love are coasters stacked at the ready (opt for coasters with pretty finished rims to ensure that they look just as great stacked as they do laid out for mugs of tea), candles, and greenery. Alternatively, a large bone or Lucite tray that’s flush with your accent table’s top can make protecting a precious surface like wood or marble terrifically easy, while also providing a glamorous touch. And lastly, adding a lidded basket or lacquer box to hide those unsightly remotes?— Well, that’s just ingenious.

Sisense Review By Louis Smith, Product Owner of Business Intelligence | IT Central Station







Sign InReporting Tools » Sisense » Version 5.7 » ReviewSisense ReviewEasy to Deploy, Easy to Manage, Easy for End-Users; Sisense represents what a BI company should be: Intuitive and scaleable for large sets of data. 1,688LinkedInTweet ItValuable Features:

Time to deployment was one of our most critical factors in choosing a BI vendor, and I am not sure you can get to deployment faster than Sisense. On day one, I was able to download it, connect two disparate data sources with multiple tables, and build meaningful dashboards. 
Other features that I found very valuable:
Query Speed: Querying a data source with more than 180 million records took on average less than 5 seconds after initial load. 
Speed of Development: It took less than a month to configure single- sign on, be fully embedded within our web product, and to build a comprehensive data cube that covered all of our metrics.
Ease of use for end-users: Building meaningful dashboards is no longer an IT task. Sisense has done a great job at not over complicating dashboard building

Improvements to My Organization:

We are no longer in the business of report changes and making a slight change to a report for a specific customer. Sisense is already reducing our development workload since customers are building their own reports instead of waiting on us.

Room for Improvement:

Users with viewer access have less capabilities than similar users in Tableau. For example, data discovery would be difficult with only a viewer license. 
Sisense limits the cube building to a very visual display that can get hard to analyze when you bring in many data sources. It would be nice to have either an "advanced" view or alternate view that helps with many tables.
They do not currently have support for R, but I hear that is coming in 6.0. 

Use of Solution:

About 6 months.

Deployment Issues:

None.

Stability Issues:

None so far.

Scalability Issues:

Not yet, but we did just start rolling this out

Customer Service:

Excellent. I am confident I will receive a response within the same day and usually much sooner than that. 

Technical Support:

Technical support has been superb. We had a fairly complicated security implementation, and they helped guide our developers through all the nuances. 

Previous Solutions:

We previously were on Pentaho, and we switched because we needed an easier platform to develop on. Building complex dashboards required a great deal of training and Pentaho experience.

Initial Setup:

The initial setup could not have been any easier.

Implementation Team:

In-house

Other Solutions Considered:

Qlik and Tableau

Other Advice:

The sales process was excellent. We opted to do a proof of concept, and we were able to test all of our requested functionality prior to buying the product. They also guided us through the proof of concept, and offered a great deal of support. The sales process was one of the best sales experiences we went through.
Our customers love the product. When we demonstrate Sisense's capability against their data, they wonder how they existed without Sisense.
