													FINANCIAL PLANNING FOR PHYSICIANS											


Physician Retirement Planning
Successfully navigate through your many financial options
Larson Financial is a comprehensive financial planning firm offering concierge financial solutions for doctors- from residency to retirement. Through our collaborative environment Larson Financial Group helps individual physicians and their medical practices succeed in the highly competitive and regulated health care environment.

Another benefit is one-stop access to resources, such as medical practice and business consultants, accountants, attorneys, insurance carriers and information technology specialists.
Mid Career Practitioners:  Breaking Through
Physicians have a distinct disadvantage in meeting mid-life financial demands because of delayed entry into the workforce. Doctors are challenged to pay down hefty student loan debt while making up for the earning-time gap. They need expert financial advice to cover mid-life household expenses and avoid a major shortfall at retirement.

 

Working with Larson Financial Group, mid-career doctors can develop detailed cash-flow plans, formulate strategies to maximize after-tax returns on their investments and monitor their continual progress.

Late Career Practitioners:  Meaningful Wealth
Doctors nearing retirement prefer to have a firm grasp of the financial and tax implications of winding down their careers, as well as estate planning and securing adequate resources to enjoy a comfortable retirement. Making realistic assumptions about the future is a key attribute of a quality long-term retirement plan.

													UPCOMING EVENTS – FINANCIAL ADVICE FOR DOCTORS											

Larson Financial Group is committed to providing venues for physicians and dentists to attend presentations to learn about financial topics. These presentations range from seminars on specific topics such as retirement planning and education savings to dinners that cover the broad “whole picture” view of what a financial plan should look like. These are educational based seminars, not sales presentations; therefore, we do not discuss any specific products or give out any specific recommendations. Every physician has a unique financial and family situation that should be discussed thoroughly with their own personal advisor.
				





Attend a Financial Service Event In Your Area
To learn more about our financial planning strategies, we invite you to attend an upcoming financial education seminar or join us for a complimentary dinner discussion. If you do not see a dinner or workshop in your area, please contact us about our “webinars” that we host periodically for our clients outside our regional areas. Also, we welcome you to schedule a complimentary consultation at a time that is convenient for you.

Physician Financial Services 



		 


As a physician, you may be at a disadvantage when it comes to personal financial management. Even if you received the best medical education in the world, chances are your training did not provide you with the tools necessary to address the business realities of the practice of medicine or your financial well-being.

The results of poor planning not only affect the doctor’s family but also their professional relationships with colleagues, partners and hospitals.  Physician Financial Services was formed to bring a complete package of insurance and investment products and services to members of the medical profession.

 We understand that you are very busy with professional and personal obligations and need reliable answers from someone that you can trust. Through access to a network of experienced professionals in all areas of financial services, we can help make recommendations that are appropriate for your needs together with quality products from a range of independent companies to help you achieve your financial goals.

Our Credentials
 CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™ professional or CFP® professional 
 
CFP® practitioners must pass a comprehensive two-day, 10-hour CFP® Certification Examination that tests their ability to apply financial planning knowledge in an integrated format.  Based on regular research of what planners do, the exam covers the financial planning process, tax planning, employee benefits and retirement planning, estate planning, investment management and insurance.  Most people think that all financial planners are "certified" but this isn't true.  Anyone can call himself or herself a "financial planner".  Only those who have fulfilled the certification and renewal requirements of CFP board can display the CFP certification marks.  When selecting a financial planner, you need to feel confident that the person you choose to help you plan for your future is competent and ethical.  The CFP® certification provides that sense of security by allowing only those who meet the education, examination, experience and ethics requirements the right to use the CFP certification marks.Read the Article "Sweating the CFP® Exam" from Registered Rep Magazine Read the Article "Is Your Adviser Pumping Up His Credentials? from the Wall Street Journal"  CLU®,  (Chartered Life Underwriter) 
The Chartered Life Underwriter (CLU) designation is the undisputed professional credential for persons involved in the protection, accumulation, preservation, and distribution of the economic values of human life. Since the first examinations were held in 1928, more than 85,000 men and women have met the educational, experience, and ethics mandates needed to earn the CLU designation. The CLU program provides insights into the life insurance business, its importance to the economy, its operation and distribution systems, and its resurging importance for safe and secure investments. For agents, field managers, home office personnel, and others involved in providing life insurance products to the public, the CLU designation is the common bond for continuing growth and commitment to professionalism.    
 
 ChFC®,  (Chartered Financial Consultant)
 
The Chartered Financial Consultant (ChFC) designation focuses on the comprehensive financial planning process as an organized way to collect and analyze information on a client's total financial situation; to identify and establish specific financial goals; and to formulate, implement, and monitor a comprehensive plan to achieve those goals. The ChFC program provides financial planners and others in the financial services industry with in-depth knowledge of the skills needed to perform comprehensive financial planning for their clients. Since its inception in 1982, more than 32,000 men and women have met the educational, experience, and ethics mandates needed to earn the ChFC designation.    RHU®, (Registered Health Underwriter)The Registered Health Underwriter (RHU) designation demonstrates that the student has successfully completed a rigorous three-course program, met experience requirements, maintains ethical standards, and has agreed to comply with The American College's Code of Ethics and Procedures and recertification/continuing education requirements. The focus of this designation is to prepare professionals to advise clients on their health insurance needs.  LUTCF (The LUTC Fellow Designation) For insurance professionals, agents and managers looking to get their career off to a solid start, the Life Underwriter Training Council program focuses on providing the skills and knowledge needed to excel in the financial services industry by addressing current product knowledge coupled with vital sales skills.  The American College The American College is the nation's oldest and largest nontraditional institution for higher learning devoted exclusively to academic studies on the financial services. Founded in 1927, The College is accredited by the Commission on Higher Education of the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools.   Links to other sites are for your convenience in locating related information and services.

Insurance sounds boring and dreary to most people. Not for us at Physicians Financial Services, however. While it is a serious business, we do not see insurance as boring - it is after all the business of keeping people in their homes, from going out of business and getting back on the road – essentially helping people lead normal lives and recover from disaster. This is interesting stuff! We are partnered with the right insurance carrier/s, people we have been doing business with for years. This enables us to comparison shop and gets you (our client) the best deal available. And the best deal is not always about price – but, hey – price is a big factor and we will never stop fighting to get you the best price. We help our clients with all kinds of insurance, but here are the main insurance types our agency focuses on -

Auto insurance – do you know what coverage you have? Most of our clients gloss over when we start talking liability, collision, comprehensive insurance coverages. And why do the limits have to be different based on your specific needs? Rest assured, we understand what is needed to operate a vehicle in and around Atlanta, GA and will handle all the details for you.
Business Insurance – own or operate a business? Do you need insurance before you can execute on a job/contract? Not sure what type of insurance you need? Do you just need the minimum or are you thinking about future exposure to lawsuits and injury claims? Our commercial insurance agents are standing by to help you get the right policy to help your business succeed.
Homeowners insurance – who knows where the value lies in an insurance policy when it comes to something as local-specific as insurance for a structure, building, home in a specific location – your local insurance agent – that’s who! Let us showcase our knowledge of the area in and around Atlanta, GA. You will be confident that you found the best local partner for your insurance needs.
Call us – let’s chat – 678-579-0484

													FINANCIAL PLANNING FOR PHYSICIANS											


Physician Retirement Planning
Successfully navigate through your many financial options
Larson Financial is a comprehensive financial planning firm offering concierge financial solutions for doctors- from residency to retirement. Through our collaborative environment Larson Financial Group helps individual physicians and their medical practices succeed in the highly competitive and regulated health care environment.

Another benefit is one-stop access to resources, such as medical practice and business consultants, accountants, attorneys, insurance carriers and information technology specialists.
Mid Career Practitioners:  Breaking Through
Physicians have a distinct disadvantage in meeting mid-life financial demands because of delayed entry into the workforce. Doctors are challenged to pay down hefty student loan debt while making up for the earning-time gap. They need expert financial advice to cover mid-life household expenses and avoid a major shortfall at retirement.

 

Working with Larson Financial Group, mid-career doctors can develop detailed cash-flow plans, formulate strategies to maximize after-tax returns on their investments and monitor their continual progress.

Late Career Practitioners:  Meaningful Wealth
Doctors nearing retirement prefer to have a firm grasp of the financial and tax implications of winding down their careers, as well as estate planning and securing adequate resources to enjoy a comfortable retirement. Making realistic assumptions about the future is a key attribute of a quality long-term retirement plan.

													UPCOMING EVENTS – FINANCIAL ADVICE FOR DOCTORS											

Larson Financial Group is committed to providing venues for physicians and dentists to attend presentations to learn about financial topics. These presentations range from seminars on specific topics such as retirement planning and education savings to dinners that cover the broad “whole picture” view of what a financial plan should look like. These are educational based seminars, not sales presentations; therefore, we do not discuss any specific products or give out any specific recommendations. Every physician has a unique financial and family situation that should be discussed thoroughly with their own personal advisor.
				





Attend a Financial Service Event In Your Area
To learn more about our financial planning strategies, we invite you to attend an upcoming financial education seminar or join us for a complimentary dinner discussion. If you do not see a dinner or workshop in your area, please contact us about our “webinars” that we host periodically for our clients outside our regional areas. Also, we welcome you to schedule a complimentary consultation at a time that is convenient for you.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
