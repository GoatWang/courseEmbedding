What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

A quarter of S&P 500’s 2017 climb due to five stocks (yes, those five)
              
              Throughout 2017, there’s one acronym that investors have in particular been sinking their teeth into: FAANG.              
              
            

5:22 p.m. July 27, 2017






Amazon earnings fall 77%, shares drop
              
              Amazon.com Inc.  reported much lower earnings than expected Thursday, and shares declined more than 2% in late trading. The e-commerce giant reported net income of $197 million, or 40 cents a share, on sales of $38 billion, a profit decline of 77% from the same quarter a year ago. Analysts on average expected Amazon to report earnings of $1.41 a share on sales of $37.2 billion. The company's spending cut into profit, as fulfillment costs -- the amount Amazon spends to fulfill customers' orders on its e-commerce platform -- rose about 33% from a year ago and spending on technology and content increased by about 43%. Amazon stock traded at all-time highs this week, making Amazon the fourth U.S. company with a market capitalization of $500 billion and briefly giving Chief Executive Jeff Bezos the title of richest man in the world, but shares declined about 2% in immediate after-hours action.

              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Overview






Chemical Substances and Materials as well as their Uses Are Regulated Worldwide.




There are numerous regulatory areas for chemicals – for example the REACH regulation in the EU, TSCA (Toxic Substances Control Act) in the USA or international agreements such as the Montreal Protocol for ozone depleting substances and the Rotterdam Convention concerning the international trade with certain hazardous chemicals and pesticides (PIC). At the same time, the use of chemicals may be restricted for certain applications by legislation such as those falling within the EU RoHS directive for the electronic industry or the End of Life Vehicles directive for the automotive industry or CPSC (Consumer Product Safety Commission) in the USA.  Additionally some industry-wide standards such as IMDS/GADSL or IEC 62474 harmonize substance declaration in their respective branches.The Covestro Product Safety and Regulatory Affairs group supports the customers by providing product statements for national and international requirements. Please follow the links on the regional icons for easy download.
