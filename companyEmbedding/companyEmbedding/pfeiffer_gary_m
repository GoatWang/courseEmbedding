Petition ClosedPetitioning  The Christiana Care Board of Directors and 1 otherDecision makersThe Christiana Care Board of DirectorsGary M. PfeifferDo not close the Herman Rosenblum, M.D., Adolescent Centerjake sobolesky New Castle, DEjake soboleskyNew Castle, DE1,966SupportersRecent news has revealed that Christiana Care will stop supporting The Herman Rosenblum, M.D., Adolescent Center, and therefore will close it. People will be referred to the Rockford center, or Meadowood Center instead. This is a serious problem. I have been to the Rockford Inpatient and Outpatient program, along with the Rosenblum program and with my experience, this is a terrible decision. These centers are behavioral and psychiatric treatment centers, but with first hand experience, it does not seem like it. They are different in almost every single virtue except that. Rosenblum is a day program meant for adolescents and adults who need counseling, a friendly environment, and most important of all: other people around their age whom they can relate to. Rosenblum is for Non-Violent kids, and as the therapists I have talked to have said; Rockford is a last resort, it is for kids who are violent, and usually suicidal. My sixth grade year was hard. I had many problems adapting to the environment of middle school. This stress proved to be too much for me at that time. One day I went into a sort of fit of rage (I will refer to it as an episode) and My parents were scared, and didn't know what to do. When I was enrolled into Rockford, My parents did not know where to go. The only choice they knew of at that time was the Rockford center. Meadowood (A nearby mental health center) did not have an adolescent program at that time, and when they went there they were sent to Rockford. I began in the outpatient program, but after having an "episode" I was admitted to the Inpatient program. I wasn't even thirteen years old and I was forced to stay there. The experience was beyond traumatic. I have never been to a juvenile correctional facility, but I believe that to be a close relative. You were not allowed shoes with laces, No metal objects, etc. you were assigned a room and a roommate. The rooms each had a shower / bathroom. my room had one window that was very thick. and contained multiple panes of what I believe was security glass. When you took showers, you were given shampoo and soap in a dixie cup. This was because of the potential for someone to drink soap or shampoo (An attempt at suicide). The nurses there were nice people. That is the only positive thing I can say. The counselors I was assigned were terrible. They didn't seem like counselors; They seemed like parole officers. When we were given school work, it was in a classroom type room. The work they had was reminiscent of kindergarten work. At night, the lights were turned out, and you were required to be in your room, in bed. The doors weren't locked, but if you left your room, you would be in trouble. I forget the frequency of visits, but every now and then you were allowed a half an hour to an hour of time in a supervised waiting room type area with your family. This was the only time I got to see my parents face to face. Throughout the week (most likely 8 or nine days, But again, I do not remember that) I was repeatedly told how rules / laws / regulations made it so that anyone who is admitted to the inpatient program was required to stay for at least 7 days. I found out later on that the "rules" say it is actually only 72 hours. I Never was truly suicidal, but if there was one time where I would have considered it more than anything else, it was when I was in there. To this day I have unmeasurable amounts of hate for Rockford. I know hate can be a strong word, But in this case it is a weak word. I could go into more detail about my experience, but this half of the story seems long enough.
My Experience at Rosenblum was more recent. I was struggling in Eighth grade, not as much as sixth, but it was still problematic. It was brung up by my therapist that there was a program similar to Rockford (the similarities were as small as an atom) called the Herman Rosenblum, M.D., Adolescent Center. Before you are admitted, there is an interview you go through. Going to the program for the interview, I was amazed. Rockford had multiple doors that were like prison doors requiring key cards. Rosenblum had a few doors like that, but they were obviously for security from outside threats. My interview was done in a calm relaxed atmosphere. I sat on a couch, and talked to Doug, the kind of administrator there (but he was more like a therapist). He was nice, friendly, and open to questions. On my first day, I was shown the room that the day was carried out in. There was a cafe area (It had fooseball, a TV, etc.) That was for lunch / free time. Every day there was a group therapy session, a class period (They contacted your school and got the exact work they were doing at your school) and some days we walked to the local YMCA and play games, or simply go on a walk through the local park. The experience was like being at home.
My story is not a rare one. Many kids go to Rosenblum and it helps them just as it helped me. Rockford did almost nothing to help me, Rosenblum helped me in ways that to this day are still beneficial. But the Christiana Care board of directors has decided to stop funding the Rosenblum center, and Start referring people to rockford or meadowood only. This decision is almost unfathomable to me, and I'm not the only one. Closing the Herman Rosenblum, M.D., Adolescent Center would mean forcing adolescents to go to a center that is most likely not what they need. They will have no other way of getting help like that. It does not make sense... This petition was delivered to:The Christiana Care Board of DirectorsGary M. PfeifferRead the letterLetter toThe Christiana Care Board of DirectorsGary M.
