Private practice[edit]
Bingham McCutchen gained Marshall as a partner when it acquired Swidler Berlin, where he had been a partner since 2003. In addition to counseling clients, Marshall provided internal advice to Swidler Berlin on ethics compliance and corporate governance. He became a managing director of Swidler Berlin's Harbour Group in 2005. [1]. He is now part of Bingham McCutchen’s Government Affairs practice, counseling clients on relations with Congress, the Executive Branch and independent regulatory agencies. He has provided legislative and regulatory counsel on corporate mergers, professional and amateur sports, commercial aviation, utilities and banking regulation, and legal process reforms.
Marshall has been named one of Washington's top campaign and election lawyers by Washingtonian Magazine, a leading lawyer in government relations law by The Best Lawyers in America[citation needed], and included on the Best Lawyers List of the Washington Post Magazine[citation needed]. Newsweek named him one of the 100 people to watch in the new century[citation needed].
Government service[edit]
Marshall came to Swidler Berlin from the Clinton Administration, where he had served since 1997 as Assistant to the President and White House Cabinet Secretary. In that role, he managed White House relations with the executive departments; his responsibilities included organizing cabinet meetings and briefings, compiling a daily update of cabinet department activities, and coordinating responses to natural and transportation disasters. As vice chair of the White House Olympic Task Force, he coordinated federal government’s preparations for the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games. He was also a member of the Interagency Task Force on U.S. Coast Guard Roles and Missions. [2]
President Clinton named Marshall to the Presidential Delegation to the Inauguration of South African President Nelson Mandela in 1994. Marshall also served as a member of the Presidential Election Observer Delegation to Bosnia in 1998. That delegation was led by Ambassador Robert Gelbard. Marshall was a member of the United States Delegation to the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney Australia.
He had previously served as Director of Legislative Affairs and Deputy Counsel to Vice President Al Gore, for whom he had previously worked in the United States Senate and as Deputy Campaign Manager of the Gore For President Campaign in 1988 and as traveling policy advisor on the Clinton-Gore Presidential Campaign.
Early in his career, Marshall clerked for United States District Judge Barrington D. Parker and then served as a Counsel to Senator Edward M. Kennedy with the Senate's Judiciary Committee; Counsel to Senator Ernest F. Hollings and Senator Albert Gore Jr. with the Senate's Commerce, Science & Transportation Committee; and Counsel to Senator Albert Gore Jr. with the Senate's Governmental Affairs Committee.
Personal life and civic involvement[edit]
Marshall is currently a senior advisor to AllAmerica Political action committee, a political organization set up by Senator Evan Bayh, who briefly sought the 2008 Democratic Presidential nomination. [3] Marshall also the Director of Congressional Relations for the Wesley Clark for President Campaign in 2004. He has been involved with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, serving on the board of the Foundation for eight years and promoting environmental science and other science education. He also volunteers at a local food bank and other community service outlets in the Washington, D.C. area.
Marshall is member of the following boards: United States Postal Service Board of Governors [4], Ford Foundation [5], Corrections Corporation of America [6], Genesco [7], The Third Way [8], National Women's Law Center, the University of Arkansas Clinton School of Public Service [9], and the Supreme Court Historical Society [10]. He has been a member of the Ethics Advisory Committee of the United States Olympic Committee [11] since its inception in 2001 and chairs the Advisory Commission of the American Bar Association Standing Committee on Election Law [12].
He has participated on election and election law observer missions to Bosnia, Chile, Ecuador, and Nicaragua. Marshall is also a veteran of U.S. presidential campaigns including Gore '88 and Clinton '92 and Clark '04.
Marshall was born in New York City and earned a Juris Doctor at the University of Virginia School of Law in 1981 and a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Virginia in 1978. He graduated from The Phillips Exeter Academy and attended school at Georgetown Day School in Washington, D.C. and the Dalton School in New York City.
Of his father's legacy, Marshall has said "One, he was part of a group of people... who all came together at the right time to steer the country on the right course with regard to equality, especially in education," and "I also like to think of his legacy as one of encouraging lawyers of every color to contribute their skills to society." [4] Marshall's experiences growing up at the Supreme Court were recounted in USA Today in a story about Chief Justice Roberts. (June 26, 2006)
He is the son of Justice Thurgood Marshall, the first African American to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court, and a Filipino American mother, Cecilia Suyat Marshall. [13] He is also the brother of John W. Marshall, a former Virginia Secretary of Public Safety and former U.S. Marshals Service Director.
Marshall and his wife Teddi Levy Marshall (Vice President and Founder of Rolling Greens Inc.)[13] were married on April 25, 2008. They were married at the Supreme Court of the United States and Associate Justice Stephen G. Breyer performed the ceremony. The couple lives in the Washington, D.C. area and they have two sons, Thurgood William and Edward Patrick Marshall.

Thurgood Marshall (July 2, 1908 – January 24, 1993) was an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, serving from October 1967 until October 1991. Marshall was the Court's 96th justice and its first African-American justice.
Before becoming a judge, Marshall was a lawyer who was best known for his high success rate in arguing before the Supreme Court and for the victory in Brown v. Board of Education, a 1954 decision that ruled that segregated public schools were unconstitutional. He served on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit after being appointed by President John F. Kennedy. He was appointed as the Solicitor General by President Lyndon Johnson in 1965. President Johnson nominated him to the United States Supreme Court in 1967 and he was approved by the Senate.

Early life




Henry Highland Garnet School (P.S. 103), where Marshall attended elementary school


Marshall was born in Baltimore, Maryland, on July 2, 1908. One of his great-grandfathers was born in the modern-day Democratic Republic of the Congo, captured, and was taken to the United States as a slave;[2][3] Marshall's paternal grandfather had also been enslaved.[4] His original name was Thoroughgood, but he shortened it to Thurgood.[3] His father, William Marshall, worked as a railroad porter, and his mother Norma, as a teacher; they instilled in him an appreciation for the United States Constitution and the rule of law.[5]
Marshall attended Frederick Douglass High School in Baltimore and was placed in the class with the best students. He graduated a year early in 1925 with a B-grade average, and placed in the top third of the class. He went to Lincoln University. It is commonly reported that he intended to study medicine and become a dentist.
But according to his application to Lincoln University,[6] Marshall said his goal was to become a lawyer. Among his classmates were poet Langston Hughes and musician Cab Calloway. Initially he did not take his studies seriously, and was suspended twice for hazing and pranks against fellow students.[7][8] He was not politically active at first, becoming a "star" of the debating team.[8]
In his freshman year he opposed the integration of African-American professors at the university.[7] Hughes later described Marshall as "rough and ready, loud and wrong".[9] In his second year Marshall participated in a sit-in protest against segregation at a local movie theater. In that year, he was initiated as a member of Alpha Phi Alpha, the first fraternity founded by and for blacks.[10] His marriage to Vivien Burey in September 1929 encouraged him to take his studies seriously, and he graduated from Lincoln with honors (cum laude) Bachelor of Arts in Humanities, with a major in American literature and philosophy.[8]
Marshall wanted to study in his hometown law school, the University of Maryland School of Law, but did not apply because of the school's segregation policy. Marshall instead attended Howard University School of Law, where he worked harder than he had at Lincoln and his views on discrimination were heavily influenced by the dean Charles Hamilton Houston.[8] In 1933, he graduated first in his class at Howard.[11]
Law career




Thurgood Marshall in 1936 at the beginning of his career with the NAACP


After graduating from law school, Marshall started a private law practice in Baltimore. He began his 25-year affiliation with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1934 by representing the organization in the law school discrimination suit Murray v. Pearson. In 1936, Marshall became part of the national staff of the NAACP.[11]
In Murray v. Pearson, Marshall represented Donald Gaines Murray, a black Amherst College graduate with excellent credentials, who was denied admission to the University of Maryland Law School because of its segregation policy. Black students in Maryland wanting to study law had to attend segregated establishments, Morgan College, the Princess Anne Academy, or out-of-state black institutions. Using the strategy developed by Nathan Margold, Marshall argued that Maryland's segregation policy violated the "separate but equal" doctrine of Plessy v. Ferguson because the state did not provide a comparable educational opportunity at a state-run black institution.[12] The Maryland Court of Appeals ruled against the state of Maryland and its Attorney General, who represented the University of Maryland, stating, "Compliance with the Constitution cannot be deferred at the will of the state. Whatever system is adopted for legal education must furnish equality of treatment now."[13]
Chief Counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund
At the age of 32, Marshall won U.S. Supreme Court case Chambers v. Florida, 309 U.S. 227 (1940). That same year, he founded and became the executive director of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund.[14] As the head of the Legal Defense Fund, he argued many other civil rights cases before the Supreme Court, most of them successfully, including Smith v. Allwright, 321 U.S. 649 (1944); Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1 (1948); Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U.S. 629 (1950); and McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents, 339 U.S. 637 (1950). His most famous case as a lawyer was Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), the case in which the Supreme Court ruled that "separate but equal" public education, as established by Plessy v. Ferguson, was not applicable to public education because it could never be truly equal. In total, Marshall won 29 out of the 32 cases he argued before the Supreme Court.
During the 1950s, Thurgood Marshall developed a friendly relationship with J. Edgar Hoover, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In 1956, for example, he privately praised Hoover's campaign to discredit T.R.M. Howard, a maverick civil rights leader from Mississippi. During a national speaking tour, Howard criticized the FBI's failure to seriously investigate cases such as the 1955 killers of George W. Lee and Emmett Till. In a private letter to Hoover, Marshall "attacked Howard as a 'rugged individualist' who did not speak for the NAACP."[15] Two years earlier Howard arranged for Marshall to deliver a well-received speech at a rally of his Regional Council of Negro Leadership in Mound Bayou, Mississippi only days before the Brown decision.[16] According to historians David T. Beito and Linda Royster Beito, "Marshall's disdain for Howard was almost visceral. [He] 'disliked Howard's militant tone and maverick stance' and 'was well aware that Hoover's attack served to take the heat off the NAACP and provided opportunities for closer collaboration [between the NAACP and the FBI] in civil rights.'"[15]
Court of Appeals and Solicitor General
President John F. Kennedy appointed Marshall to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in 1961 to a new seat created on May 19, 1961, by 75 Stat. 80. A group of Senators from the South, led by Mississippi's James Eastland, held up his confirmation, so he served for the first several months under a recess appointment. Marshall remained on that court until 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed him to be the United States Solicitor General, the first African American to hold the office.[17] At the time, this made him the highest-ranking black government official in American history, surpassing Robert C. Weaver, Johnson's first secretary of housing and urban development.[18] As Solicitor General, he won 14 out of the 19 cases that he argued for the government.
U.S. Supreme Court

On June 13, 1967, President Johnson nominated Marshall to the Supreme Court following the retirement of Justice Tom C. Clark, saying that this was "the right thing to do, the right time to do it, the right man and the right place." Marshall was confirmed as an Associate Justice by a Senate vote of 69–11 on August 30, 1967.[19] He was the 96th person to hold the position, and the first African American.
Marshall once bluntly described his legal philosophy as this: "You do what you think is right and let the law catch up",[20] a statement which his conservative detractors argued was a sign of his embracement of judicial activism.[21][22]
Marshall served on the Court for the next 24 years, compiling a liberal record that included strong support for Constitutional protection of individual rights, especially the rights of criminal suspects against the government. His most frequent ally on the Court (the pair rarely voted at odds) was Justice William Brennan, who consistently joined him in supporting abortion rights and opposing the death penalty. Brennan and Marshall concluded in Furman v. Georgia that the death penalty was, in all circumstances, unconstitutional, and never accepted the legitimacy of Gregg v. Georgia, which ruled four years later that the death penalty was constitutional in some circumstances. Thereafter, Brennan or Marshall dissented from every denial of certiorari in a capital case and from every decision upholding a sentence of death.[citation needed]
In 1987, Marshall gave a controversial speech on the occasion of the bicentennial celebrations of the Constitution of the United States.[23] Marshall stated:

The government they devised was defective from the start, requiring several amendments, a civil war, and major social transformations to attain the system of constitutional government and its respect for the freedoms and individual rights, we hold as fundamental today.[24]

In conclusion Marshall stated:

Some may more quietly commemorate the suffering, struggle, and sacrifice that has triumphed over much of what was wrong with the original document, and observe the anniversary with hopes not realized and promises not fulfilled. I plan to celebrate the bicentennial of the Constitution as a living document, including the Bill of Rights and the other amendments protecting individual freedoms and human rights.[24]

Although best remembered for jurisprudence in the fields of civil rights and criminal procedure, Marshall made significant contributions to other areas of the law as well. In Teamsters v. Terry, he held that the Seventh Amendment entitled the plaintiff to a jury trial in a suit against a labor union for breach of duty of fair representation. In TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., he articulated a formulation for the standard of materiality in United States securities law that is still applied and used today. In Cottage Savings Association v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, he weighed in on the income tax consequences of the Savings and Loan crisis, permitting a savings and loan association to deduct a loss from an exchange of mortgage participation interests. In Personnel Administrator MA v. Feeney, Marshall wrote a dissent saying that a law that gave hiring preference to veterans over non-veterans was unconstitutional because of its inequitable impact on women.
Among his many law clerks were attorneys who went on to become judges themselves, such as Judge Douglas Ginsburg of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals; Judge Ralph Winter of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit; Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan; as well as notable law professors Susan Low Bloch, Elizabeth Garrett (President of Cornell University), Paul Gewirtz, Dan Kahan, Randall L. Kennedy, Eben Moglen, Rick Pildes, Louis Michael Seidman,[25] Cass Sunstein, and Mark Tushnet (editor of Thurgood Marshall: His Speeches, Writings, Arguments, Opinions and Reminiscences); and law school deans Paul Mahoney of University of Virginia School of Law, Martha Minow of Harvard Law School, and Richard Revesz of New York University School of Law.
Marshall retired from the Supreme Court in 1991 due to declining health. In his retirement press conference on June 28, 1991, he expressed his view that race should not be a factor in choosing his successor, and he denied circulating claims that he was retiring because of frustration or anger over the conservative direction in which the Court was heading."[26] He was reportedly unhappy that it would fall to President George H. W. Bush to name his replacement.[27] Bush nominated Clarence Thomas to replace Marshall.

Marshall died of heart failure at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, at 2:58 pm on January 24, 1993, at the age of 84. He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery.[28] His second wife and their two sons survived him.
Marshall left all his personal papers and notes to the Library of Congress. The Librarian of Congress, James H. Billington, opened Marshall's papers for immediate use by scholars, journalists and the public, insisting that this was Marshall's intent. The Marshall family and several of his close associates disputed this claim.[29] The decision to make the documents public was supported by the American Library Association.[30] A list of the archived manuscripts is available.[31]
There are numerous memorials to Marshall. One, an eight-foot statue, stands in Lawyers Mall adjacent to the Maryland State House. The statue, dedicated on October 22, 1996, depicts Marshall as a young lawyer and is placed just a few feet away from where the Old Maryland Supreme Court Building stood; the court where Marshall argued discrimination cases leading up to the Brown decision.[32] The primary office building for the federal court system, located on Capitol Hill in Washington D.C., is named in honor of Justice Marshall and contains a statue of him in the atrium. In 1976, Texas Southern University renamed its law school after the sitting justice.[33] In 1980, the University of Maryland School of Law opened a new library which it named the Thurgood Marshall Law Library.[34] In 2000, the historic Twelfth Street YMCA Building located in the Shaw neighborhood of Washington, D.C. was renamed the Thurgood Marshall Center. The major airport serving Baltimore and the Maryland suburbs of Washington, DC, was renamed the Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport on October 1, 2005. The 2009 General Convention of the Episcopal Church added Marshall to the church's liturgical calendar of "Holy Women, Holy Men: Celebrating the Saints," designating May 17 as his feast day.[35] His membership of the Lincoln University fraternity Alpha Phi Alpha is to be memorialized by a sculpture by artist Alvin Pettit in 2013.[36]
The University of California, San Diego, renamed its Third College after Thurgood Marshall in 1993.[37] Marshall Middle School in Olympia, Washington, is also named after Thurgood Marshall, as is Thurgood Marshall Academy in Washington, D.C.
In 2006, Thurgood, a one-man play written by George Stevens, Jr., premiered at the Westport Country Playhouse, starring James Earl Jones and directed by Leonard Foglia.[38] Later it opened Broadway at the Booth Theatre on April 30, 2008, starring Laurence Fishburne.[39] On February 24, 2011, HBO screened a filmed version of the play which Fishburne performed at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. The production was described by the Baltimore Sun as "one of the most frank, informed and searing discussions of race you will ever see on TV.".[40][41] On February 16, 2011, a screening of the film was hosted by the White House as part of its celebrations of Black History Month[42][43] A painting of Justice Thurgood by Chaz Guest currently hangs at the White House.[44][45] Also, a new film titled Marshall, is being made, with actor Chadwick Boseman as Thurgood Marshall, and directed by Reginald Hudlin.[citation needed]
Marriage and family
Marshall was married twice. He married Vivien "Buster" Burey in 1929. After her death in February 1955, Marshall married Cecilia Suyat in December of that year. They were married until he died in 1993, having two sons together:[46] Thurgood Marshall, Jr., a former top aide to President Bill Clinton; and John W. Marshall, a former United States Marshals Service Director and Virginia Secretary of Public Safety.
Thurgood Marshall Award
The Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico instituted[47] in 1993 the annual Thurgood Marshall Award, given to the top student in civil rights at each of Puerto Rico's four law schools. It includes a $500 monetary award. The awardees are selected by the Commonwealth's Attorney General.

Thurgood Marshall (July 2, 1908 – January 24, 1993) was an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, serving from October 1967 until October 1991. Marshall was the Court's 96th justice and its first African-American justice.
Before becoming a judge, Marshall was a lawyer who was best known for his high success rate in arguing before the Supreme Court and for the victory in Brown v. Board of Education, a 1954 decision that ruled that segregated public schools were unconstitutional. He served on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit after being appointed by President John F. Kennedy. He was appointed as the Solicitor General by President Lyndon Johnson in 1965. President Johnson nominated him to the United States Supreme Court in 1967 and he was approved by the Senate.

Early life




Henry Highland Garnet School (P.S. 103), where Marshall attended elementary school


Marshall was born in Baltimore, Maryland, on July 2, 1908. One of his great-grandfathers was born in the modern-day Democratic Republic of the Congo, captured, and was taken to the United States as a slave;[2][3] Marshall's paternal grandfather had also been enslaved.[4] His original name was Thoroughgood, but he shortened it to Thurgood.[3] His father, William Marshall, worked as a railroad porter, and his mother Norma, as a teacher; they instilled in him an appreciation for the United States Constitution and the rule of law.[5]
Marshall attended Frederick Douglass High School in Baltimore and was placed in the class with the best students. He graduated a year early in 1925 with a B-grade average, and placed in the top third of the class. He went to Lincoln University. It is commonly reported that he intended to study medicine and become a dentist.
But according to his application to Lincoln University,[6] Marshall said his goal was to become a lawyer. Among his classmates were poet Langston Hughes and musician Cab Calloway. Initially he did not take his studies seriously, and was suspended twice for hazing and pranks against fellow students.[7][8] He was not politically active at first, becoming a "star" of the debating team.[8]
In his freshman year he opposed the integration of African-American professors at the university.[7] Hughes later described Marshall as "rough and ready, loud and wrong".[9] In his second year Marshall participated in a sit-in protest against segregation at a local movie theater. In that year, he was initiated as a member of Alpha Phi Alpha, the first fraternity founded by and for blacks.[10] His marriage to Vivien Burey in September 1929 encouraged him to take his studies seriously, and he graduated from Lincoln with honors (cum laude) Bachelor of Arts in Humanities, with a major in American literature and philosophy.[8]
Marshall wanted to study in his hometown law school, the University of Maryland School of Law, but did not apply because of the school's segregation policy. Marshall instead attended Howard University School of Law, where he worked harder than he had at Lincoln and his views on discrimination were heavily influenced by the dean Charles Hamilton Houston.[8] In 1933, he graduated first in his class at Howard.[11]
Law career




Thurgood Marshall in 1936 at the beginning of his career with the NAACP


After graduating from law school, Marshall started a private law practice in Baltimore. He began his 25-year affiliation with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1934 by representing the organization in the law school discrimination suit Murray v. Pearson. In 1936, Marshall became part of the national staff of the NAACP.[11]
In Murray v. Pearson, Marshall represented Donald Gaines Murray, a black Amherst College graduate with excellent credentials, who was denied admission to the University of Maryland Law School because of its segregation policy. Black students in Maryland wanting to study law had to attend segregated establishments, Morgan College, the Princess Anne Academy, or out-of-state black institutions. Using the strategy developed by Nathan Margold, Marshall argued that Maryland's segregation policy violated the "separate but equal" doctrine of Plessy v. Ferguson because the state did not provide a comparable educational opportunity at a state-run black institution.[12] The Maryland Court of Appeals ruled against the state of Maryland and its Attorney General, who represented the University of Maryland, stating, "Compliance with the Constitution cannot be deferred at the will of the state. Whatever system is adopted for legal education must furnish equality of treatment now."[13]
Chief Counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund
At the age of 32, Marshall won U.S. Supreme Court case Chambers v. Florida, 309 U.S. 227 (1940). That same year, he founded and became the executive director of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund.[14] As the head of the Legal Defense Fund, he argued many other civil rights cases before the Supreme Court, most of them successfully, including Smith v. Allwright, 321 U.S. 649 (1944); Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1 (1948); Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U.S. 629 (1950); and McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents, 339 U.S. 637 (1950). His most famous case as a lawyer was Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), the case in which the Supreme Court ruled that "separate but equal" public education, as established by Plessy v. Ferguson, was not applicable to public education because it could never be truly equal. In total, Marshall won 29 out of the 32 cases he argued before the Supreme Court.
During the 1950s, Thurgood Marshall developed a friendly relationship with J. Edgar Hoover, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In 1956, for example, he privately praised Hoover's campaign to discredit T.R.M. Howard, a maverick civil rights leader from Mississippi. During a national speaking tour, Howard criticized the FBI's failure to seriously investigate cases such as the 1955 killers of George W. Lee and Emmett Till. In a private letter to Hoover, Marshall "attacked Howard as a 'rugged individualist' who did not speak for the NAACP."[15] Two years earlier Howard arranged for Marshall to deliver a well-received speech at a rally of his Regional Council of Negro Leadership in Mound Bayou, Mississippi only days before the Brown decision.[16] According to historians David T. Beito and Linda Royster Beito, "Marshall's disdain for Howard was almost visceral. [He] 'disliked Howard's militant tone and maverick stance' and 'was well aware that Hoover's attack served to take the heat off the NAACP and provided opportunities for closer collaboration [between the NAACP and the FBI] in civil rights.'"[15]
Court of Appeals and Solicitor General
President John F. Kennedy appointed Marshall to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in 1961 to a new seat created on May 19, 1961, by 75 Stat. 80. A group of Senators from the South, led by Mississippi's James Eastland, held up his confirmation, so he served for the first several months under a recess appointment. Marshall remained on that court until 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed him to be the United States Solicitor General, the first African American to hold the office.[17] At the time, this made him the highest-ranking black government official in American history, surpassing Robert C. Weaver, Johnson's first secretary of housing and urban development.[18] As Solicitor General, he won 14 out of the 19 cases that he argued for the government.
U.S. Supreme Court

On June 13, 1967, President Johnson nominated Marshall to the Supreme Court following the retirement of Justice Tom C. Clark, saying that this was "the right thing to do, the right time to do it, the right man and the right place." Marshall was confirmed as an Associate Justice by a Senate vote of 69–11 on August 30, 1967.[19] He was the 96th person to hold the position, and the first African American.
Marshall once bluntly described his legal philosophy as this: "You do what you think is right and let the law catch up",[20] a statement which his conservative detractors argued was a sign of his embracement of judicial activism.[21][22]
Marshall served on the Court for the next 24 years, compiling a liberal record that included strong support for Constitutional protection of individual rights, especially the rights of criminal suspects against the government. His most frequent ally on the Court (the pair rarely voted at odds) was Justice William Brennan, who consistently joined him in supporting abortion rights and opposing the death penalty. Brennan and Marshall concluded in Furman v. Georgia that the death penalty was, in all circumstances, unconstitutional, and never accepted the legitimacy of Gregg v. Georgia, which ruled four years later that the death penalty was constitutional in some circumstances. Thereafter, Brennan or Marshall dissented from every denial of certiorari in a capital case and from every decision upholding a sentence of death.[citation needed]
In 1987, Marshall gave a controversial speech on the occasion of the bicentennial celebrations of the Constitution of the United States.[23] Marshall stated:

The government they devised was defective from the start, requiring several amendments, a civil war, and major social transformations to attain the system of constitutional government and its respect for the freedoms and individual rights, we hold as fundamental today.[24]

In conclusion Marshall stated:

Some may more quietly commemorate the suffering, struggle, and sacrifice that has triumphed over much of what was wrong with the original document, and observe the anniversary with hopes not realized and promises not fulfilled. I plan to celebrate the bicentennial of the Constitution as a living document, including the Bill of Rights and the other amendments protecting individual freedoms and human rights.[24]

Although best remembered for jurisprudence in the fields of civil rights and criminal procedure, Marshall made significant contributions to other areas of the law as well. In Teamsters v. Terry, he held that the Seventh Amendment entitled the plaintiff to a jury trial in a suit against a labor union for breach of duty of fair representation. In TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., he articulated a formulation for the standard of materiality in United States securities law that is still applied and used today. In Cottage Savings Association v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, he weighed in on the income tax consequences of the Savings and Loan crisis, permitting a savings and loan association to deduct a loss from an exchange of mortgage participation interests. In Personnel Administrator MA v. Feeney, Marshall wrote a dissent saying that a law that gave hiring preference to veterans over non-veterans was unconstitutional because of its inequitable impact on women.
Among his many law clerks were attorneys who went on to become judges themselves, such as Judge Douglas Ginsburg of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals; Judge Ralph Winter of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit; Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan; as well as notable law professors Susan Low Bloch, Elizabeth Garrett (President of Cornell University), Paul Gewirtz, Dan Kahan, Randall L. Kennedy, Eben Moglen, Rick Pildes, Louis Michael Seidman,[25] Cass Sunstein, and Mark Tushnet (editor of Thurgood Marshall: His Speeches, Writings, Arguments, Opinions and Reminiscences); and law school deans Paul Mahoney of University of Virginia School of Law, Martha Minow of Harvard Law School, and Richard Revesz of New York University School of Law.
Marshall retired from the Supreme Court in 1991 due to declining health. In his retirement press conference on June 28, 1991, he expressed his view that race should not be a factor in choosing his successor, and he denied circulating claims that he was retiring because of frustration or anger over the conservative direction in which the Court was heading."[26] He was reportedly unhappy that it would fall to President George H. W. Bush to name his replacement.[27] Bush nominated Clarence Thomas to replace Marshall.

U.S. Senator Ben Cardin (left) and Maryland Attorney General Doug Gansler talk in Lawyer's Mall, near a statue of Thurgood Marshall (October 2007).


Marshall died of heart failure at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, at 2:58 pm on January 24, 1993, at the age of 84. He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery.[28] His second wife and their two sons survived him.
Marshall left all his personal papers and notes to the Library of Congress. The Librarian of Congress, James H. Billington, opened Marshall's papers for immediate use by scholars, journalists and the public, insisting that this was Marshall's intent. The Marshall family and several of his close associates disputed this claim.[29] The decision to make the documents public was supported by the American Library Association.[30] A list of the archived manuscripts is available.[31]
There are numerous memorials to Marshall. One, an eight-foot statue, stands in Lawyers Mall adjacent to the Maryland State House. The statue, dedicated on October 22, 1996, depicts Marshall as a young lawyer and is placed just a few feet away from where the Old Maryland Supreme Court Building stood; the court where Marshall argued discrimination cases leading up to the Brown decision.[32] The primary office building for the federal court system, located on Capitol Hill in Washington D.C., is named in honor of Justice Marshall and contains a statue of him in the atrium. In 1976, Texas Southern University renamed its law school after the sitting justice.[33] In 1980, the University of Maryland School of Law opened a new library which it named the Thurgood Marshall Law Library.[34] In 2000, the historic Twelfth Street YMCA Building located in the Shaw neighborhood of Washington, D.C. was renamed the Thurgood Marshall Center. The major airport serving Baltimore and the Maryland suburbs of Washington, DC, was renamed the Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport on October 1, 2005. The 2009 General Convention of the Episcopal Church added Marshall to the church's liturgical calendar of "Holy Women, Holy Men: Celebrating the Saints," designating May 17 as his feast day.[35] His membership of the Lincoln University fraternity Alpha Phi Alpha is to be memorialized by a sculpture by artist Alvin Pettit in 2013.[36]
The University of California, San Diego, renamed its Third College after Thurgood Marshall in 1993.[37] Marshall Middle School in Olympia, Washington, is also named after Thurgood Marshall, as is Thurgood Marshall Academy in Washington, D.C.
In 2006, Thurgood, a one-man play written by George Stevens, Jr., premiered at the Westport Country Playhouse, starring James Earl Jones and directed by Leonard Foglia.[38] Later it opened Broadway at the Booth Theatre on April 30, 2008, starring Laurence Fishburne.[39] On February 24, 2011, HBO screened a filmed version of the play which Fishburne performed at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. The production was described by the Baltimore Sun as "one of the most frank, informed and searing discussions of race you will ever see on TV.".[40][41] On February 16, 2011, a screening of the film was hosted by the White House as part of its celebrations of Black History Month[42][43] A painting of Justice Thurgood by Chaz Guest currently hangs at the White House.[44][45] Also, a new film titled Marshall, is being made, with actor Chadwick Boseman as Thurgood Marshall, and directed by Reginald Hudlin.[citation needed]
Marriage and family
Marshall was married twice. He married Vivien "Buster" Burey in 1929. After her death in February 1955, Marshall married Cecilia Suyat in December of that year. They were married until he died in 1993, having two sons together:[46] Thurgood Marshall, Jr., a former top aide to President Bill Clinton; and John W. Marshall, a former United States Marshals Service Director and Virginia Secretary of Public Safety.
Thurgood Marshall Award
The Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico instituted[47] in 1993 the annual Thurgood Marshall Award, given to the top student in civil rights at each of Puerto Rico's four law schools. It includes a $500 monetary award. The awardees are selected by the Commonwealth's Attorney General.

Thurgood Marshall (July 2, 1908 – January 24, 1993) was an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, serving from October 1967 until October 1991. Marshall was the Court's 96th justice and its first African-American justice.
Before becoming a judge, Marshall was a lawyer who was best known for his high success rate in arguing before the Supreme Court and for the victory in Brown v. Board of Education, a 1954 decision that ruled that segregated public schools were unconstitutional. He served on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit after being appointed by President John F. Kennedy. He was appointed as the Solicitor General by President Lyndon Johnson in 1965. President Johnson nominated him to the United States Supreme Court in 1967 and he was approved by the Senate.

Early life




Henry Highland Garnet School (P.S. 103), where Marshall attended elementary school


Marshall was born in Baltimore, Maryland, on July 2, 1908. One of his great-grandfathers was born in the modern-day Democratic Republic of the Congo, captured, and was taken to the United States as a slave;[2][3] Marshall's paternal grandfather had also been enslaved.[4] His original name was Thoroughgood, but he shortened it to Thurgood.[3] His father, William Marshall, worked as a railroad porter, and his mother Norma, as a teacher; they instilled in him an appreciation for the United States Constitution and the rule of law.[5]
Marshall attended Frederick Douglass High School in Baltimore and was placed in the class with the best students. He graduated a year early in 1925 with a B-grade average, and placed in the top third of the class. He went to Lincoln University. It is commonly reported that he intended to study medicine and become a dentist.
But according to his application to Lincoln University,[6] Marshall said his goal was to become a lawyer. Among his classmates were poet Langston Hughes and musician Cab Calloway. Initially he did not take his studies seriously, and was suspended twice for hazing and pranks against fellow students.[7][8] He was not politically active at first, becoming a "star" of the debating team.[8]
In his freshman year he opposed the integration of African-American professors at the university.[7] Hughes later described Marshall as "rough and ready, loud and wrong".[9] In his second year Marshall participated in a sit-in protest against segregation at a local movie theater. In that year, he was initiated as a member of Alpha Phi Alpha, the first fraternity founded by and for blacks.[10] His marriage to Vivien Burey in September 1929 encouraged him to take his studies seriously, and he graduated from Lincoln with honors (cum laude) Bachelor of Arts in Humanities, with a major in American literature and philosophy.[8]
Marshall wanted to study in his hometown law school, the University of Maryland School of Law, but did not apply because of the school's segregation policy. Marshall instead attended Howard University School of Law, where he worked harder than he had at Lincoln and his views on discrimination were heavily influenced by the dean Charles Hamilton Houston.[8] In 1933, he graduated first in his class at Howard.[11]
Law career




Thurgood Marshall in 1936 at the beginning of his career with the NAACP


After graduating from law school, Marshall started a private law practice in Baltimore. He began his 25-year affiliation with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1934 by representing the organization in the law school discrimination suit Murray v. Pearson. In 1936, Marshall became part of the national staff of the NAACP.[11]
In Murray v. Pearson, Marshall represented Donald Gaines Murray, a black Amherst College graduate with excellent credentials, who was denied admission to the University of Maryland Law School because of its segregation policy. Black students in Maryland wanting to study law had to attend segregated establishments, Morgan College, the Princess Anne Academy, or out-of-state black institutions. Using the strategy developed by Nathan Margold, Marshall argued that Maryland's segregation policy violated the "separate but equal" doctrine of Plessy v. Ferguson because the state did not provide a comparable educational opportunity at a state-run black institution.[12] The Maryland Court of Appeals ruled against the state of Maryland and its Attorney General, who represented the University of Maryland, stating, "Compliance with the Constitution cannot be deferred at the will of the state. Whatever system is adopted for legal education must furnish equality of treatment now."[13]
Chief Counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund
At the age of 32, Marshall won U.S. Supreme Court case Chambers v. Florida, 309 U.S. 227 (1940). That same year, he founded and became the executive director of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund.[14] As the head of the Legal Defense Fund, he argued many other civil rights cases before the Supreme Court, most of them successfully, including Smith v. Allwright, 321 U.S. 649 (1944); Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1 (1948); Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U.S. 629 (1950); and McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents, 339 U.S. 637 (1950). His most famous case as a lawyer was Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), the case in which the Supreme Court ruled that "separate but equal" public education, as established by Plessy v. Ferguson, was not applicable to public education because it could never be truly equal. In total, Marshall won 29 out of the 32 cases he argued before the Supreme Court.
During the 1950s, Thurgood Marshall developed a friendly relationship with J. Edgar Hoover, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In 1956, for example, he privately praised Hoover's campaign to discredit T.R.M. Howard, a maverick civil rights leader from Mississippi. During a national speaking tour, Howard criticized the FBI's failure to seriously investigate cases such as the 1955 killers of George W. Lee and Emmett Till. In a private letter to Hoover, Marshall "attacked Howard as a 'rugged individualist' who did not speak for the NAACP."[15] Two years earlier Howard arranged for Marshall to deliver a well-received speech at a rally of his Regional Council of Negro Leadership in Mound Bayou, Mississippi only days before the Brown decision.[16] According to historians David T. Beito and Linda Royster Beito, "Marshall's disdain for Howard was almost visceral. [He] 'disliked Howard's militant tone and maverick stance' and 'was well aware that Hoover's attack served to take the heat off the NAACP and provided opportunities for closer collaboration [between the NAACP and the FBI] in civil rights.'"[15]
Court of Appeals and Solicitor General
President John F. Kennedy appointed Marshall to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in 1961 to a new seat created on May 19, 1961, by 75 Stat. 80. A group of Senators from the South, led by Mississippi's James Eastland, held up his confirmation, so he served for the first several months under a recess appointment. Marshall remained on that court until 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed him to be the United States Solicitor General, the first African American to hold the office.[17] At the time, this made him the highest-ranking black government official in American history, surpassing Robert C. Weaver, Johnson's first secretary of housing and urban development.[18] As Solicitor General, he won 14 out of the 19 cases that he argued for the government.
U.S. Supreme Court

On June 13, 1967, President Johnson nominated Marshall to the Supreme Court following the retirement of Justice Tom C. Clark, saying that this was "the right thing to do, the right time to do it, the right man and the right place." Marshall was confirmed as an Associate Justice by a Senate vote of 69–11 on August 30, 1967.[19] He was the 96th person to hold the position, and the first African American.
Marshall once bluntly described his legal philosophy as this: "You do what you think is right and let the law catch up",[20] a statement which his conservative detractors argued was a sign of his embracement of judicial activism.[21][22]
Marshall served on the Court for the next 24 years, compiling a liberal record that included strong support for Constitutional protection of individual rights, especially the rights of criminal suspects against the government. His most frequent ally on the Court (the pair rarely voted at odds) was Justice William Brennan, who consistently joined him in supporting abortion rights and opposing the death penalty. Brennan and Marshall concluded in Furman v. Georgia that the death penalty was, in all circumstances, unconstitutional, and never accepted the legitimacy of Gregg v. Georgia, which ruled four years later that the death penalty was constitutional in some circumstances. Thereafter, Brennan or Marshall dissented from every denial of certiorari in a capital case and from every decision upholding a sentence of death.[citation needed]
In 1987, Marshall gave a controversial speech on the occasion of the bicentennial celebrations of the Constitution of the United States.[23] Marshall stated:

The government they devised was defective from the start, requiring several amendments, a civil war, and major social transformations to attain the system of constitutional government and its respect for the freedoms and individual rights, we hold as fundamental today.[24]

In conclusion Marshall stated:

Some may more quietly commemorate the suffering, struggle, and sacrifice that has triumphed over much of what was wrong with the original document, and observe the anniversary with hopes not realized and promises not fulfilled. I plan to celebrate the bicentennial of the Constitution as a living document, including the Bill of Rights and the other amendments protecting individual freedoms and human rights.[24]

Although best remembered for jurisprudence in the fields of civil rights and criminal procedure, Marshall made significant contributions to other areas of the law as well. In Teamsters v. Terry, he held that the Seventh Amendment entitled the plaintiff to a jury trial in a suit against a labor union for breach of duty of fair representation. In TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., he articulated a formulation for the standard of materiality in United States securities law that is still applied and used today. In Cottage Savings Association v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, he weighed in on the income tax consequences of the Savings and Loan crisis, permitting a savings and loan association to deduct a loss from an exchange of mortgage participation interests. In Personnel Administrator MA v. Feeney, Marshall wrote a dissent saying that a law that gave hiring preference to veterans over non-veterans was unconstitutional because of its inequitable impact on women.
Among his many law clerks were attorneys who went on to become judges themselves, such as Judge Douglas Ginsburg of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals; Judge Ralph Winter of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit; Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan; as well as notable law professors Susan Low Bloch, Elizabeth Garrett (President of Cornell University), Paul Gewirtz, Dan Kahan, Randall L. Kennedy, Eben Moglen, Rick Pildes, Louis Michael Seidman,[25] Cass Sunstein, and Mark Tushnet (editor of Thurgood Marshall: His Speeches, Writings, Arguments, Opinions and Reminiscences); and law school deans Paul Mahoney of University of Virginia School of Law, Martha Minow of Harvard Law School, and Richard Revesz of New York University School of Law.
Marshall retired from the Supreme Court in 1991 due to declining health. In his retirement press conference on June 28, 1991, he expressed his view that race should not be a factor in choosing his successor, and he denied circulating claims that he was retiring because of frustration or anger over the conservative direction in which the Court was heading."[26] He was reportedly unhappy that it would fall to President George H. W. Bush to name his replacement.[27] Bush nominated Clarence Thomas to replace Marshall.

Marshall died of heart failure at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, at 2:58 pm on January 24, 1993, at the age of 84. He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery.[28] His second wife and their two sons survived him.
Marshall left all his personal papers and notes to the Library of Congress. The Librarian of Congress, James H. Billington, opened Marshall's papers for immediate use by scholars, journalists and the public, insisting that this was Marshall's intent. The Marshall family and several of his close associates disputed this claim.[29] The decision to make the documents public was supported by the American Library Association.[30] A list of the archived manuscripts is available.[31]
There are numerous memorials to Marshall. One, an eight-foot statue, stands in Lawyers Mall adjacent to the Maryland State House. The statue, dedicated on October 22, 1996, depicts Marshall as a young lawyer and is placed just a few feet away from where the Old Maryland Supreme Court Building stood; the court where Marshall argued discrimination cases leading up to the Brown decision.[32] The primary office building for the federal court system, located on Capitol Hill in Washington D.C., is named in honor of Justice Marshall and contains a statue of him in the atrium. In 1976, Texas Southern University renamed its law school after the sitting justice.[33] In 1980, the University of Maryland School of Law opened a new library which it named the Thurgood Marshall Law Library.[34] In 2000, the historic Twelfth Street YMCA Building located in the Shaw neighborhood of Washington, D.C. was renamed the Thurgood Marshall Center. The major airport serving Baltimore and the Maryland suburbs of Washington, DC, was renamed the Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport on October 1, 2005. The 2009 General Convention of the Episcopal Church added Marshall to the church's liturgical calendar of "Holy Women, Holy Men: Celebrating the Saints," designating May 17 as his feast day.[35] His membership of the Lincoln University fraternity Alpha Phi Alpha is to be memorialized by a sculpture by artist Alvin Pettit in 2013.[36]
The University of California, San Diego, renamed its Third College after Thurgood Marshall in 1993.[37] Marshall Middle School in Olympia, Washington, is also named after Thurgood Marshall, as is Thurgood Marshall Academy in Washington, D.C.
In 2006, Thurgood, a one-man play written by George Stevens, Jr., premiered at the Westport Country Playhouse, starring James Earl Jones and directed by Leonard Foglia.[38] Later it opened Broadway at the Booth Theatre on April 30, 2008, starring Laurence Fishburne.[39] On February 24, 2011, HBO screened a filmed version of the play which Fishburne performed at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. The production was described by the Baltimore Sun as "one of the most frank, informed and searing discussions of race you will ever see on TV.".[40][41] On February 16, 2011, a screening of the film was hosted by the White House as part of its celebrations of Black History Month[42][43] A painting of Justice Thurgood by Chaz Guest currently hangs at the White House.[44][45] Also, a new film titled Marshall, is being made, with actor Chadwick Boseman as Thurgood Marshall, and directed by Reginald Hudlin.[citation needed]
Marriage and family
Marshall was married twice. He married Vivien "Buster" Burey in 1929. After her death in February 1955, Marshall married Cecilia Suyat in December of that year. They were married until he died in 1993, having two sons together:[46] Thurgood Marshall, Jr., a former top aide to President Bill Clinton; and John W. Marshall, a former United States Marshals Service Director and Virginia Secretary of Public Safety.

Board of Education, a 1954 decision that ruled that segregated public schools were unconstitutional. He served on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit after being appointed by President John F. Kennedy. He was appointed as the Solicitor General by President Lyndon Johnson in 1965. President Johnson nominated him to the United States Supreme Court in 1967 and he was approved by the Senate.

Early life




Henry Highland Garnet School (P.S. 103), where Marshall attended elementary school


Marshall was born in Baltimore, Maryland, on July 2, 1908. One of his great-grandfathers was born in the modern-day Democratic Republic of the Congo, captured, and was taken to the United States as a slave;[2][3] Marshall's paternal grandfather had also been enslaved.[4] His original name was Thoroughgood, but he shortened it to Thurgood.[3] His father, William Marshall, worked as a railroad porter, and his mother Norma, as a teacher; they instilled in him an appreciation for the United States Constitution and the rule of law.[5]
Marshall attended Frederick Douglass High School in Baltimore and was placed in the class with the best students. He graduated a year early in 1925 with a B-grade average, and placed in the top third of the class. He went to Lincoln University. It is commonly reported that he intended to study medicine and become a dentist.
But according to his application to Lincoln University,[6] Marshall said his goal was to become a lawyer. Among his classmates were poet Langston Hughes and musician Cab Calloway. Initially he did not take his studies seriously, and was suspended twice for hazing and pranks against fellow students.[7][8] He was not politically active at first, becoming a "star" of the debating team.[8]
In his freshman year he opposed the integration of African-American professors at the university.[7] Hughes later described Marshall as "rough and ready, loud and wrong".[9] In his second year Marshall participated in a sit-in protest against segregation at a local movie theater. In that year, he was initiated as a member of Alpha Phi Alpha, the first fraternity founded by and for blacks.[10] His marriage to Vivien Burey in September 1929 encouraged him to take his studies seriously, and he graduated from Lincoln with honors (cum laude) Bachelor of Arts in Humanities, with a major in American literature and philosophy.[8]
Marshall wanted to study in his hometown law school, the University of Maryland School of Law, but did not apply because of the school's segregation policy. Marshall instead attended Howard University School of Law, where he worked harder than he had at Lincoln and his views on discrimination were heavily influenced by the dean Charles Hamilton Houston.[8] In 1933, he graduated first in his class at Howard.[11]
Law career




Thurgood Marshall in 1936 at the beginning of his career with the NAACP


After graduating from law school, Marshall started a private law practice in Baltimore. He began his 25-year affiliation with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1934 by representing the organization in the law school discrimination suit Murray v. Pearson. In 1936, Marshall became part of the national staff of the NAACP.[11]
In Murray v. Pearson, Marshall represented Donald Gaines Murray, a black Amherst College graduate with excellent credentials, who was denied admission to the University of Maryland Law School because of its segregation policy. Black students in Maryland wanting to study law had to attend segregated establishments, Morgan College, the Princess Anne Academy, or out-of-state black institutions. Using the strategy developed by Nathan Margold, Marshall argued that Maryland's segregation policy violated the "separate but equal" doctrine of Plessy v. Ferguson because the state did not provide a comparable educational opportunity at a state-run black institution.[12] The Maryland Court of Appeals ruled against the state of Maryland and its Attorney General, who represented the University of Maryland, stating, "Compliance with the Constitution cannot be deferred at the will of the state. Whatever system is adopted for legal education must furnish equality of treatment now."[13]
Chief Counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund
At the age of 32, Marshall won U.S. Supreme Court case Chambers v. Florida, 309 U.S. 227 (1940). That same year, he founded and became the executive director of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund.[14] As the head of the Legal Defense Fund, he argued many other civil rights cases before the Supreme Court, most of them successfully, including Smith v. Allwright, 321 U.S. 649 (1944); Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1 (1948); Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U.S. 629 (1950); and McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents, 339 U.S. 637 (1950). His most famous case as a lawyer was Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), the case in which the Supreme Court ruled that "separate but equal" public education, as established by Plessy v. Ferguson, was not applicable to public education because it could never be truly equal. In total, Marshall won 29 out of the 32 cases he argued before the Supreme Court.
During the 1950s, Thurgood Marshall developed a friendly relationship with J. Edgar Hoover, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In 1956, for example, he privately praised Hoover's campaign to discredit T.R.M. Howard, a maverick civil rights leader from Mississippi. During a national speaking tour, Howard criticized the FBI's failure to seriously investigate cases such as the 1955 killers of George W. Lee and Emmett Till. In a private letter to Hoover, Marshall "attacked Howard as a 'rugged individualist' who did not speak for the NAACP."[15] Two years earlier Howard arranged for Marshall to deliver a well-received speech at a rally of his Regional Council of Negro Leadership in Mound Bayou, Mississippi only days before the Brown decision.[16] According to historians David T. Beito and Linda Royster Beito, "Marshall's disdain for Howard was almost visceral. [He] 'disliked Howard's militant tone and maverick stance' and 'was well aware that Hoover's attack served to take the heat off the NAACP and provided opportunities for closer collaboration [between the NAACP and the FBI] in civil rights.'"[15]
Court of Appeals and Solicitor General
President John F. Kennedy appointed Marshall to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in 1961 to a new seat created on May 19, 1961, by 75 Stat. 80. A group of Senators from the South, led by Mississippi's James Eastland, held up his confirmation, so he served for the first several months under a recess appointment. Marshall remained on that court until 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed him to be the United States Solicitor General, the first African American to hold the office.[17] At the time, this made him the highest-ranking black government official in American history, surpassing Robert C. Weaver, Johnson's first secretary of housing and urban development.[18] As Solicitor General, he won 14 out of the 19 cases that he argued for the government.
U.S. Supreme Court

On June 13, 1967, President Johnson nominated Marshall to the Supreme Court following the retirement of Justice Tom C. Clark, saying that this was "the right thing to do, the right time to do it, the right man and the right place." Marshall was confirmed as an Associate Justice by a Senate vote of 69–11 on August 30, 1967.[19] He was the 96th person to hold the position, and the first African American.
Marshall once bluntly described his legal philosophy as this: "You do what you think is right and let the law catch up",[20] a statement which his conservative detractors argued was a sign of his embracement of judicial activism.[21][22]
Marshall served on the Court for the next 24 years, compiling a liberal record that included strong support for Constitutional protection of individual rights, especially the rights of criminal suspects against the government. His most frequent ally on the Court (the pair rarely voted at odds) was Justice William Brennan, who consistently joined him in supporting abortion rights and opposing the death penalty. Brennan and Marshall concluded in Furman v. Georgia that the death penalty was, in all circumstances, unconstitutional, and never accepted the legitimacy of Gregg v. Georgia, which ruled four years later that the death penalty was constitutional in some circumstances. Thereafter, Brennan or Marshall dissented from every denial of certiorari in a capital case and from every decision upholding a sentence of death.[citation needed]
In 1987, Marshall gave a controversial speech on the occasion of the bicentennial celebrations of the Constitution of the United States.[23] Marshall stated:

The government they devised was defective from the start, requiring several amendments, a civil war, and major social transformations to attain the system of constitutional government and its respect for the freedoms and individual rights, we hold as fundamental today.[24]

In conclusion Marshall stated:

Some may more quietly commemorate the suffering, struggle, and sacrifice that has triumphed over much of what was wrong with the original document, and observe the anniversary with hopes not realized and promises not fulfilled. I plan to celebrate the bicentennial of the Constitution as a living document, including the Bill of Rights and the other amendments protecting individual freedoms and human rights.[24]

Although best remembered for jurisprudence in the fields of civil rights and criminal procedure, Marshall made significant contributions to other areas of the law as well. In Teamsters v. Terry, he held that the Seventh Amendment entitled the plaintiff to a jury trial in a suit against a labor union for breach of duty of fair representation. In TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., he articulated a formulation for the standard of materiality in United States securities law that is still applied and used today. In Cottage Savings Association v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, he weighed in on the income tax consequences of the Savings and Loan crisis, permitting a savings and loan association to deduct a loss from an exchange of mortgage participation interests. In Personnel Administrator MA v. Feeney, Marshall wrote a dissent saying that a law that gave hiring preference to veterans over non-veterans was unconstitutional because of its inequitable impact on women.
Among his many law clerks were attorneys who went on to become judges themselves, such as Judge Douglas Ginsburg of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals; Judge Ralph Winter of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit; Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan; as well as notable law professors Susan Low Bloch, Elizabeth Garrett (President of Cornell University), Paul Gewirtz, Dan Kahan, Randall L. Kennedy, Eben Moglen, Rick Pildes, Louis Michael Seidman,[25] Cass Sunstein, and Mark Tushnet (editor of Thurgood Marshall: His Speeches, Writings, Arguments, Opinions and Reminiscences); and law school deans Paul Mahoney of University of Virginia School of Law, Martha Minow of Harvard Law School, and Richard Revesz of New York University School of Law.
Marshall retired from the Supreme Court in 1991 due to declining health. In his retirement press conference on June 28, 1991, he expressed his view that race should not be a factor in choosing his successor, and he denied circulating claims that he was retiring because of frustration or anger over the conservative direction in which the Court was heading."[26] He was reportedly unhappy that it would fall to President George H. W. Bush to name his replacement.[27] Bush nominated Clarence Thomas to replace Marshall.

Marshall died of heart failure at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, at 2:58 pm on January 24, 1993, at the age of 84. He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery.[28] His second wife and their two sons survived him.
Marshall left all his personal papers and notes to the Library of Congress. The Librarian of Congress, James H. Billington, opened Marshall's papers for immediate use by scholars, journalists and the public, insisting that this was Marshall's intent. The Marshall family and several of his close associates disputed this claim.[29] The decision to make the documents public was supported by the American Library Association.[30] A list of the archived manuscripts is available.[31]
There are numerous memorials to Marshall. One, an eight-foot statue, stands in Lawyers Mall adjacent to the Maryland State House. The statue, dedicated on October 22, 1996, depicts Marshall as a young lawyer and is placed just a few feet away from where the Old Maryland Supreme Court Building stood; the court where Marshall argued discrimination cases leading up to the Brown decision.[32] The primary office building for the federal court system, located on Capitol Hill in Washington D.C., is named in honor of Justice Marshall and contains a statue of him in the atrium. In 1976, Texas Southern University renamed its law school after the sitting justice.[33] In 1980, the University of Maryland School of Law opened a new library which it named the Thurgood Marshall Law Library.[34] In 2000, the historic Twelfth Street YMCA Building located in the Shaw neighborhood of Washington, D.C. was renamed the Thurgood Marshall Center. The major airport serving Baltimore and the Maryland suburbs of Washington, DC, was renamed the Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport on October 1, 2005. The 2009 General Convention of the Episcopal Church added Marshall to the church's liturgical calendar of "Holy Women, Holy Men: Celebrating the Saints," designating May 17 as his feast day.[35] His membership of the Lincoln University fraternity Alpha Phi Alpha is to be memorialized by a sculpture by artist Alvin Pettit in 2013.[36]
The University of California, San Diego, renamed its Third College after Thurgood Marshall in 1993.[37] Marshall Middle School in Olympia, Washington, is also named after Thurgood Marshall, as is Thurgood Marshall Academy in Washington, D.C.
In 2006, Thurgood, a one-man play written by George Stevens, Jr., premiered at the Westport Country Playhouse, starring James Earl Jones and directed by Leonard Foglia.[38] Later it opened Broadway at the Booth Theatre on April 30, 2008, starring Laurence Fishburne.[39] On February 24, 2011, HBO screened a filmed version of the play which Fishburne performed at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. The production was described by the Baltimore Sun as "one of the most frank, informed and searing discussions of race you will ever see on TV.".[40][41] On February 16, 2011, a screening of the film was hosted by the White House as part of its celebrations of Black History Month[42][43] A painting of Justice Thurgood by Chaz Guest currently hangs at the White House.[44][45] Also, a new film titled Marshall, is being made, with actor Chadwick Boseman as Thurgood Marshall, and directed by Reginald Hudlin.[citation needed]
Marriage and family
Marshall was married twice. He married Vivien "Buster" Burey in 1929. After her death in February 1955, Marshall married Cecilia Suyat in December of that year. They were married until he died in 1993, having two sons together:[46] Thurgood Marshall, Jr., a former top aide to President Bill Clinton; and John W. Marshall, a former United States Marshals Service Director and Virginia Secretary of Public Safety.
Thurgood Marshall Award
The Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico instituted[47] in 1993 the annual Thurgood Marshall Award, given to the top student in civil rights at each of Puerto Rico's four law schools. It includes a $500 monetary award. The awardees are selected by the Commonwealth's Attorney General.

Thurgood Marshall (July 2, 1908 – January 24, 1993) was an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, serving from October 1967 until October 1991. Marshall was the Court's 96th justice and its first African-American justice.
Before becoming a judge, Marshall was a lawyer who was best known for his high success rate in arguing before the Supreme Court and for the victory in Brown v. Board of Education, a 1954 decision that ruled that segregated public schools were unconstitutional. He served on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit after being appointed by President John F. Kennedy. He was appointed as the Solicitor General by President Lyndon Johnson in 1965. President Johnson nominated him to the United States Supreme Court in 1967 and he was approved by the Senate.

Early life




Henry Highland Garnet School (P.S. 103), where Marshall attended elementary school


Marshall was born in Baltimore, Maryland, on July 2, 1908. One of his great-grandfathers was born in the modern-day Democratic Republic of the Congo, captured, and was taken to the United States as a slave;[2][3] Marshall's paternal grandfather had also been enslaved.[4] His original name was Thoroughgood, but he shortened it to Thurgood.[3] His father, William Marshall, worked as a railroad porter, and his mother Norma, as a teacher; they instilled in him an appreciation for the United States Constitution and the rule of law.[5]
Marshall attended Frederick Douglass High School in Baltimore and was placed in the class with the best students. He graduated a year early in 1925 with a B-grade average, and placed in the top third of the class. He went to Lincoln University. It is commonly reported that he intended to study medicine and become a dentist.
But according to his application to Lincoln University,[6] Marshall said his goal was to become a lawyer. Among his classmates were poet Langston Hughes and musician Cab Calloway. Initially he did not take his studies seriously, and was suspended twice for hazing and pranks against fellow students.[7][8] He was not politically active at first, becoming a "star" of the debating team.[8]
In his freshman year he opposed the integration of African-American professors at the university.[7] Hughes later described Marshall as "rough and ready, loud and wrong".[9] In his second year Marshall participated in a sit-in protest against segregation at a local movie theater. In that year, he was initiated as a member of Alpha Phi Alpha, the first fraternity founded by and for blacks.[10] His marriage to Vivien Burey in September 1929 encouraged him to take his studies seriously, and he graduated from Lincoln with honors (cum laude) Bachelor of Arts in Humanities, with a major in American literature and philosophy.[8]
Marshall wanted to study in his hometown law school, the University of Maryland School of Law, but did not apply because of the school's segregation policy. Marshall instead attended Howard University School of Law, where he worked harder than he had at Lincoln and his views on discrimination were heavily influenced by the dean Charles Hamilton Houston.[8] In 1933, he graduated first in his class at Howard.[11]
Law career




Thurgood Marshall in 1936 at the beginning of his career with the NAACP


After graduating from law school, Marshall started a private law practice in Baltimore. He began his 25-year affiliation with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1934 by representing the organization in the law school discrimination suit Murray v. Pearson. In 1936, Marshall became part of the national staff of the NAACP.[11]
In Murray v. Pearson, Marshall represented Donald Gaines Murray, a black Amherst College graduate with excellent credentials, who was denied admission to the University of Maryland Law School because of its segregation policy. Black students in Maryland wanting to study law had to attend segregated establishments, Morgan College, the Princess Anne Academy, or out-of-state black institutions. Using the strategy developed by Nathan Margold, Marshall argued that Maryland's segregation policy violated the "separate but equal" doctrine of Plessy v. Ferguson because the state did not provide a comparable educational opportunity at a state-run black institution.[12] The Maryland Court of Appeals ruled against the state of Maryland and its Attorney General, who represented the University of Maryland, stating, "Compliance with the Constitution cannot be deferred at the will of the state. Whatever system is adopted for legal education must furnish equality of treatment now."[13]
Chief Counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund
At the age of 32, Marshall won U.S. Supreme Court case Chambers v. Florida, 309 U.S. 227 (1940). That same year, he founded and became the executive director of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund.[14] As the head of the Legal Defense Fund, he argued many other civil rights cases before the Supreme Court, most of them successfully, including Smith v. Allwright, 321 U.S. 649 (1944); Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1 (1948); Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U.S. 629 (1950); and McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents, 339 U.S. 637 (1950). His most famous case as a lawyer was Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), the case in which the Supreme Court ruled that "separate but equal" public education, as established by Plessy v. Ferguson, was not applicable to public education because it could never be truly equal. In total, Marshall won 29 out of the 32 cases he argued before the Supreme Court.
During the 1950s, Thurgood Marshall developed a friendly relationship with J. Edgar Hoover, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In 1956, for example, he privately praised Hoover's campaign to discredit T.R.M. Howard, a maverick civil rights leader from Mississippi. During a national speaking tour, Howard criticized the FBI's failure to seriously investigate cases such as the 1955 killers of George W. Lee and Emmett Till. In a private letter to Hoover, Marshall "attacked Howard as a 'rugged individualist' who did not speak for the NAACP."[15] Two years earlier Howard arranged for Marshall to deliver a well-received speech at a rally of his Regional Council of Negro Leadership in Mound Bayou, Mississippi only days before the Brown decision.[16] According to historians David T. Beito and Linda Royster Beito, "Marshall's disdain for Howard was almost visceral. [He] 'disliked Howard's militant tone and maverick stance' and 'was well aware that Hoover's attack served to take the heat off the NAACP and provided opportunities for closer collaboration [between the NAACP and the FBI] in civil rights.'"[15]
Court of Appeals and Solicitor General
President John F. Kennedy appointed Marshall to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in 1961 to a new seat created on May 19, 1961, by 75 Stat. 80. A group of Senators from the South, led by Mississippi's James Eastland, held up his confirmation, so he served for the first several months under a recess appointment. Marshall remained on that court until 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed him to be the United States Solicitor General, the first African American to hold the office.[17] At the time, this made him the highest-ranking black government official in American history, surpassing Robert C. Weaver, Johnson's first secretary of housing and urban development.[18] As Solicitor General, he won 14 out of the 19 cases that he argued for the government.
U.S. Supreme Court

On June 13, 1967, President Johnson nominated Marshall to the Supreme Court following the retirement of Justice Tom C. Clark, saying that this was "the right thing to do, the right time to do it, the right man and the right place." Marshall was confirmed as an Associate Justice by a Senate vote of 69–11 on August 30, 1967.[19] He was the 96th person to hold the position, and the first African American.
Marshall once bluntly described his legal philosophy as this: "You do what you think is right and let the law catch up",[20] a statement which his conservative detractors argued was a sign of his embracement of judicial activism.[21][22]
Marshall served on the Court for the next 24 years, compiling a liberal record that included strong support for Constitutional protection of individual rights, especially the rights of criminal suspects against the government. His most frequent ally on the Court (the pair rarely voted at odds) was Justice William Brennan, who consistently joined him in supporting abortion rights and opposing the death penalty. Brennan and Marshall concluded in Furman v. Georgia that the death penalty was, in all circumstances, unconstitutional, and never accepted the legitimacy of Gregg v. Georgia, which ruled four years later that the death penalty was constitutional in some circumstances. Thereafter, Brennan or Marshall dissented from every denial of certiorari in a capital case and from every decision upholding a sentence of death.[citation needed]
In 1987, Marshall gave a controversial speech on the occasion of the bicentennial celebrations of the Constitution of the United States.[23] Marshall stated:

The government they devised was defective from the start, requiring several amendments, a civil war, and major social transformations to attain the system of constitutional government and its respect for the freedoms and individual rights, we hold as fundamental today.[24]

In conclusion Marshall stated:

Some may more quietly commemorate the suffering, struggle, and sacrifice that has triumphed over much of what was wrong with the original document, and observe the anniversary with hopes not realized and promises not fulfilled. I plan to celebrate the bicentennial of the Constitution as a living document, including the Bill of Rights and the other amendments protecting individual freedoms and human rights.[24]

Although best remembered for jurisprudence in the fields of civil rights and criminal procedure, Marshall made significant contributions to other areas of the law as well. In Teamsters v. Terry, he held that the Seventh Amendment entitled the plaintiff to a jury trial in a suit against a labor union for breach of duty of fair representation. In TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., he articulated a formulation for the standard of materiality in United States securities law that is still applied and used today. In Cottage Savings Association v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, he weighed in on the income tax consequences of the Savings and Loan crisis, permitting a savings and loan association to deduct a loss from an exchange of mortgage participation interests. In Personnel Administrator MA v. Feeney, Marshall wrote a dissent saying that a law that gave hiring preference to veterans over non-veterans was unconstitutional because of its inequitable impact on women.
Among his many law clerks were attorneys who went on to become judges themselves, such as Judge Douglas Ginsburg of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals; Judge Ralph Winter of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit; Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan; as well as notable law professors Susan Low Bloch, Elizabeth Garrett (President of Cornell University), Paul Gewirtz, Dan Kahan, Randall L. Kennedy, Eben Moglen, Rick Pildes, Louis Michael Seidman,[25] Cass Sunstein, and Mark Tushnet (editor of Thurgood Marshall: His Speeches, Writings, Arguments, Opinions and Reminiscences); and law school deans Paul Mahoney of University of Virginia School of Law, Martha Minow of Harvard Law School, and Richard Revesz of New York University School of Law.
Marshall retired from the Supreme Court in 1991 due to declining health. In his retirement press conference on June 28, 1991, he expressed his view that race should not be a factor in choosing his successor, and he denied circulating claims that he was retiring because of frustration or anger over the conservative direction in which the Court was heading."[26] He was reportedly unhappy that it would fall to President George H. W. Bush to name his replacement.[27] Bush nominated Clarence Thomas to replace Marshall.

Marshall's grave at Arlington National Cemetery

U.S. Senator Ben Cardin (left) and Maryland Attorney General Doug Gansler talk in Lawyer's Mall, near a statue of Thurgood Marshall (October 2007).


Marshall died of heart failure at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, at 2:58 pm on January 24, 1993, at the age of 84. He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery.[28] His second wife and their two sons survived him.
Marshall left all his personal papers and notes to the Library of Congress. The Librarian of Congress, James H. Billington, opened Marshall's papers for immediate use by scholars, journalists and the public, insisting that this was Marshall's intent. The Marshall family and several of his close associates disputed this claim.[29] The decision to make the documents public was supported by the American Library Association.[30] A list of the archived manuscripts is available.[31]
There are numerous memorials to Marshall. One, an eight-foot statue, stands in Lawyers Mall adjacent to the Maryland State House. The statue, dedicated on October 22, 1996, depicts Marshall as a young lawyer and is placed just a few feet away from where the Old Maryland Supreme Court Building stood; the court where Marshall argued discrimination cases leading up to the Brown decision.[32] The primary office building for the federal court system, located on Capitol Hill in Washington D.C., is named in honor of Justice Marshall and contains a statue of him in the atrium. In 1976, Texas Southern University renamed its law school after the sitting justice.[33] In 1980, the University of Maryland School of Law opened a new library which it named the Thurgood Marshall Law Library.[34] In 2000, the historic Twelfth Street YMCA Building located in the Shaw neighborhood of Washington, D.C. was renamed the Thurgood Marshall Center. The major airport serving Baltimore and the Maryland suburbs of Washington, DC, was renamed the Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport on October 1, 2005. The 2009 General Convention of the Episcopal Church added Marshall to the church's liturgical calendar of "Holy Women, Holy Men: Celebrating the Saints," designating May 17 as his feast day.[35] His membership of the Lincoln University fraternity Alpha Phi Alpha is to be memorialized by a sculpture by artist Alvin Pettit in 2013.[36]
The University of California, San Diego, renamed its Third College after Thurgood Marshall in 1993.[37] Marshall Middle School in Olympia, Washington, is also named after Thurgood Marshall, as is Thurgood Marshall Academy in Washington, D.C.
In 2006, Thurgood, a one-man play written by George Stevens, Jr., premiered at the Westport Country Playhouse, starring James Earl Jones and directed by Leonard Foglia.[38] Later it opened Broadway at the Booth Theatre on April 30, 2008, starring Laurence Fishburne.[39] On February 24, 2011, HBO screened a filmed version of the play which Fishburne performed at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. The production was described by the Baltimore Sun as "one of the most frank, informed and searing discussions of race you will ever see on TV.".[40][41] On February 16, 2011, a screening of the film was hosted by the White House as part of its celebrations of Black History Month[42][43] A painting of Justice Thurgood by Chaz Guest currently hangs at the White House.[44][45] Also, a new film titled Marshall, is being made, with actor Chadwick Boseman as Thurgood Marshall, and directed by Reginald Hudlin.[citation needed]
Marriage and family
Marshall was married twice. He married Vivien "Buster" Burey in 1929. After her death in February 1955, Marshall married Cecilia Suyat in December of that year. They were married until he died in 1993, having two sons together:[46] Thurgood Marshall, Jr., a former top aide to President Bill Clinton; and John W. Marshall, a former United States Marshals Service Director and Virginia Secretary of Public Safety.
Thurgood Marshall Award
The Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico instituted[47] in 1993 the annual Thurgood Marshall Award, given to the top student in civil rights at each of Puerto Rico's four law schools. It includes a $500 monetary award. The awardees are selected by the Commonwealth's Attorney General.

Thurgood Marshall (July 2, 1908 – January 24, 1993) was an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, serving from October 1967 until October 1991. Marshall was the Court's 96th justice and its first African-American justice.
Before becoming a judge, Marshall was a lawyer who was best known for his high success rate in arguing before the Supreme Court and for the victory in Brown v. Board of Education, a 1954 decision that ruled that segregated public schools were unconstitutional. He served on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit after being appointed by President John F. Kennedy. He was appointed as the Solicitor General by President Lyndon Johnson in 1965. President Johnson nominated him to the United States Supreme Court in 1967 and he was approved by the Senate.

Early life




Henry Highland Garnet School (P.S. 103), where Marshall attended elementary school


Marshall was born in Baltimore, Maryland, on July 2, 1908. One of his great-grandfathers was born in the modern-day Democratic Republic of the Congo, captured, and was taken to the United States as a slave;[2][3] Marshall's paternal grandfather had also been enslaved.[4] His original name was Thoroughgood, but he shortened it to Thurgood.[3] His father, William Marshall, worked as a railroad porter, and his mother Norma, as a teacher; they instilled in him an appreciation for the United States Constitution and the rule of law.[5]
Marshall attended Frederick Douglass High School in Baltimore and was placed in the class with the best students. He graduated a year early in 1925 with a B-grade average, and placed in the top third of the class. He went to Lincoln University. It is commonly reported that he intended to study medicine and become a dentist.
But according to his application to Lincoln University,[6] Marshall said his goal was to become a lawyer. Among his classmates were poet Langston Hughes and musician Cab Calloway. Initially he did not take his studies seriously, and was suspended twice for hazing and pranks against fellow students.[7][8] He was not politically active at first, becoming a "star" of the debating team.[8]
In his freshman year he opposed the integration of African-American professors at the university.[7] Hughes later described Marshall as "rough and ready, loud and wrong".[9] In his second year Marshall participated in a sit-in protest against segregation at a local movie theater. In that year, he was initiated as a member of Alpha Phi Alpha, the first fraternity founded by and for blacks.[10] His marriage to Vivien Burey in September 1929 encouraged him to take his studies seriously, and he graduated from Lincoln with honors (cum laude) Bachelor of Arts in Humanities, with a major in American literature and philosophy.[8]
Marshall wanted to study in his hometown law school, the University of Maryland School of Law, but did not apply because of the school's segregation policy. Marshall instead attended Howard University School of Law, where he worked harder than he had at Lincoln and his views on discrimination were heavily influenced by the dean Charles Hamilton Houston.[8] In 1933, he graduated first in his class at Howard.[11]
Law career




Thurgood Marshall in 1936 at the beginning of his career with the NAACP


After graduating from law school, Marshall started a private law practice in Baltimore. He began his 25-year affiliation with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1934 by representing the organization in the law school discrimination suit Murray v. Pearson. In 1936, Marshall became part of the national staff of the NAACP.[11]
In Murray v. Pearson, Marshall represented Donald Gaines Murray, a black Amherst College graduate with excellent credentials, who was denied admission to the University of Maryland Law School because of its segregation policy. Black students in Maryland wanting to study law had to attend segregated establishments, Morgan College, the Princess Anne Academy, or out-of-state black institutions. Using the strategy developed by Nathan Margold, Marshall argued that Maryland's segregation policy violated the "separate but equal" doctrine of Plessy v. Ferguson because the state did not provide a comparable educational opportunity at a state-run black institution.[12] The Maryland Court of Appeals ruled against the state of Maryland and its Attorney General, who represented the University of Maryland, stating, "Compliance with the Constitution cannot be deferred at the will of the state. Whatever system is adopted for legal education must furnish equality of treatment now."[13]
Chief Counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund
At the age of 32, Marshall won U.S. Supreme Court case Chambers v. Florida, 309 U.S. 227 (1940). That same year, he founded and became the executive director of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund.[14] As the head of the Legal Defense Fund, he argued many other civil rights cases before the Supreme Court, most of them successfully, including Smith v. Allwright, 321 U.S. 649 (1944); Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1 (1948); Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U.S. 629 (1950); and McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents, 339 U.S. 637 (1950). His most famous case as a lawyer was Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), the case in which the Supreme Court ruled that "separate but equal" public education, as established by Plessy v. Ferguson, was not applicable to public education because it could never be truly equal. In total, Marshall won 29 out of the 32 cases he argued before the Supreme Court.
During the 1950s, Thurgood Marshall developed a friendly relationship with J. Edgar Hoover, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In 1956, for example, he privately praised Hoover's campaign to discredit T.R.M. Howard, a maverick civil rights leader from Mississippi. During a national speaking tour, Howard criticized the FBI's failure to seriously investigate cases such as the 1955 killers of George W. Lee and Emmett Till. In a private letter to Hoover, Marshall "attacked Howard as a 'rugged individualist' who did not speak for the NAACP."[15] Two years earlier Howard arranged for Marshall to deliver a well-received speech at a rally of his Regional Council of Negro Leadership in Mound Bayou, Mississippi only days before the Brown decision.[16] According to historians David T. Beito and Linda Royster Beito, "Marshall's disdain for Howard was almost visceral. [He] 'disliked Howard's militant tone and maverick stance' and 'was well aware that Hoover's attack served to take the heat off the NAACP and provided opportunities for closer collaboration [between the NAACP and the FBI] in civil rights.'"[15]
Court of Appeals and Solicitor General
President John F. Kennedy appointed Marshall to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in 1961 to a new seat created on May 19, 1961, by 75 Stat. 80. A group of Senators from the South, led by Mississippi's James Eastland, held up his confirmation, so he served for the first several months under a recess appointment. Marshall remained on that court until 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed him to be the United States Solicitor General, the first African American to hold the office.[17] At the time, this made him the highest-ranking black government official in American history, surpassing Robert C. Weaver, Johnson's first secretary of housing and urban development.[18] As Solicitor General, he won 14 out of the 19 cases that he argued for the government.
U.S. Supreme Court

On June 13, 1967, President Johnson nominated Marshall to the Supreme Court following the retirement of Justice Tom C. Clark, saying that this was "the right thing to do, the right time to do it, the right man and the right place." Marshall was confirmed as an Associate Justice by a Senate vote of 69–11 on August 30, 1967.[19] He was the 96th person to hold the position, and the first African American.
Marshall once bluntly described his legal philosophy as this: "You do what you think is right and let the law catch up",[20] a statement which his conservative detractors argued was a sign of his embracement of judicial activism.[21][22]
Marshall served on the Court for the next 24 years, compiling a liberal record that included strong support for Constitutional protection of individual rights, especially the rights of criminal suspects against the government. His most frequent ally on the Court (the pair rarely voted at odds) was Justice William Brennan, who consistently joined him in supporting abortion rights and opposing the death penalty. Brennan and Marshall concluded in Furman v. Georgia that the death penalty was, in all circumstances, unconstitutional, and never accepted the legitimacy of Gregg v. Georgia, which ruled four years later that the death penalty was constitutional in some circumstances. Thereafter, Brennan or Marshall dissented from every denial of certiorari in a capital case and from every decision upholding a sentence of death.[citation needed]
In 1987, Marshall gave a controversial speech on the occasion of the bicentennial celebrations of the Constitution of the United States.[23] Marshall stated:

The government they devised was defective from the start, requiring several amendments, a civil war, and major social transformations to attain the system of constitutional government and its respect for the freedoms and individual rights, we hold as fundamental today.[24]

In conclusion Marshall stated:

Some may more quietly commemorate the suffering, struggle, and sacrifice that has triumphed over much of what was wrong with the original document, and observe the anniversary with hopes not realized and promises not fulfilled. I plan to celebrate the bicentennial of the Constitution as a living document, including the Bill of Rights and the other amendments protecting individual freedoms and human rights.[24]

Although best remembered for jurisprudence in the fields of civil rights and criminal procedure, Marshall made significant contributions to other areas of the law as well. In Teamsters v. Terry, he held that the Seventh Amendment entitled the plaintiff to a jury trial in a suit against a labor union for breach of duty of fair representation. In TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., he articulated a formulation for the standard of materiality in United States securities law that is still applied and used today. In Cottage Savings Association v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, he weighed in on the income tax consequences of the Savings and Loan crisis, permitting a savings and loan association to deduct a loss from an exchange of mortgage participation interests. In Personnel Administrator MA v. Feeney, Marshall wrote a dissent saying that a law that gave hiring preference to veterans over non-veterans was unconstitutional because of its inequitable impact on women.
Among his many law clerks were attorneys who went on to become judges themselves, such as Judge Douglas Ginsburg of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals; Judge Ralph Winter of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit; Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan; as well as notable law professors Susan Low Bloch, Elizabeth Garrett (President of Cornell University), Paul Gewirtz, Dan Kahan, Randall L. Kennedy, Eben Moglen, Rick Pildes, Louis Michael Seidman,[25] Cass Sunstein, and Mark Tushnet (editor of Thurgood Marshall: His Speeches, Writings, Arguments, Opinions and Reminiscences); and law school deans Paul Mahoney of University of Virginia School of Law, Martha Minow of Harvard Law School, and Richard Revesz of New York University School of Law.
Marshall retired from the Supreme Court in 1991 due to declining health. In his retirement press conference on June 28, 1991, he expressed his view that race should not be a factor in choosing his successor, and he denied circulating claims that he was retiring because of frustration or anger over the conservative direction in which the Court was heading."[26] He was reportedly unhappy that it would fall to President George H. W. Bush to name his replacement.[27] Bush nominated Clarence Thomas to replace Marshall.

Marshall died of heart failure at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, at 2:58 pm on January 24, 1993, at the age of 84. He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery.[28] His second wife and their two sons survived him.
Marshall left all his personal papers and notes to the Library of Congress. The Librarian of Congress, James H. Billington, opened Marshall's papers for immediate use by scholars, journalists and the public, insisting that this was Marshall's intent. The Marshall family and several of his close associates disputed this claim.[29] The decision to make the documents public was supported by the American Library Association.[30] A list of the archived manuscripts is available.[31]
There are numerous memorials to Marshall. One, an eight-foot statue, stands in Lawyers Mall adjacent to the Maryland State House. The statue, dedicated on October 22, 1996, depicts Marshall as a young lawyer and is placed just a few feet away from where the Old Maryland Supreme Court Building stood; the court where Marshall argued discrimination cases leading up to the Brown decision.[32] The primary office building for the federal court system, located on Capitol Hill in Washington D.C., is named in honor of Justice Marshall and contains a statue of him in the atrium. In 1976, Texas Southern University renamed its law school after the sitting justice.[33] In 1980, the University of Maryland School of Law opened a new library which it named the Thurgood Marshall Law Library.[34] In 2000, the historic Twelfth Street YMCA Building located in the Shaw neighborhood of Washington, D.C. was renamed the Thurgood Marshall Center. The major airport serving Baltimore and the Maryland suburbs of Washington, DC, was renamed the Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport on October 1, 2005. The 2009 General Convention of the Episcopal Church added Marshall to the church's liturgical calendar of "Holy Women, Holy Men: Celebrating the Saints," designating May 17 as his feast day.[35] His membership of the Lincoln University fraternity Alpha Phi Alpha is to be memorialized by a sculpture by artist Alvin Pettit in 2013.[36]
The University of California, San Diego, renamed its Third College after Thurgood Marshall in 1993.[37] Marshall Middle School in Olympia, Washington, is also named after Thurgood Marshall, as is Thurgood Marshall Academy in Washington, D.C.
In 2006, Thurgood, a one-man play written by George Stevens, Jr., premiered at the Westport Country Playhouse, starring James Earl Jones and directed by Leonard Foglia.[38] Later it opened Broadway at the Booth Theatre on April 30, 2008, starring Laurence Fishburne.[39] On February 24, 2011, HBO screened a filmed version of the play which Fishburne performed at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. The production was described by the Baltimore Sun as "one of the most frank, informed and searing discussions of race you will ever see on TV.".[40][41] On February 16, 2011, a screening of the film was hosted by the White House as part of its celebrations of Black History Month[42][43] A painting of Justice Thurgood by Chaz Guest currently hangs at the White House.[44][45] Also, a new film titled Marshall, is being made, with actor Chadwick Boseman as Thurgood Marshall, and directed by Reginald Hudlin.[citation needed]
Marriage and family
Marshall was married twice. He married Vivien "Buster" Burey in 1929. After her death in February 1955, Marshall married Cecilia Suyat in December of that year. They were married until he died in 1993, having two sons together:[46] Thurgood Marshall, Jr., a former top aide to President Bill Clinton; and John W. Marshall, a former United States Marshals Service Director and Virginia Secretary of Public Safety.
Thurgood Marshall Award
The Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico instituted[47] in 1993 the annual Thurgood Marshall Award, given to the top student in civil rights at each of Puerto Rico's four law schools. It includes a $500 monetary award. The awardees are selected by the Commonwealth's Attorney General.

It tells us how deeply rooted habits of prejudice are.”“What's wrong with me? I'm old! I'm getting old and coming apart.

We got here because somebody—a parent, a teacher, an Ivy League crony or a few nuns—bent down and helped us pick up our boots.”“The measure of a country's greatness is its ability to retain compassion in times of crisis.”Thurgood MarshallSynopsisBorn on July 2, 1908, in Baltimore, Maryland, Thurgood Marshall studied law at Howard University. As counsel to the NAACP, he utilized the judiciary to champion equality for African Americans. In 1954, he won the Brown v. Board of Education case, in which the Supreme Court ended racial segregation in public schools. Marshall was appointed to the Supreme Court in 1967, and served for 24 years. He died in Maryland on January 24, 1993.Early LifeThurgood Marshall was born on July 2, 1908, in Baltimore, Maryland. His father, William Marshall, the grandson of a slave, worked as a steward at an exclusive club. His mother, Norma, was a kindergarten teacher. One of William Marshall's favorite pastimes was to listen to cases at the local courthouse before returning home to rehash the lawyers' arguments with his sons. Thurgood Marshall later recalled, "Now you want to know how I got involved in law? I don't know. The nearest I can get is that my dad, my brother, and I had the most violent arguments you ever heard about anything. I guess we argued five out of seven nights at the dinner table." Marshall attended Baltimore's Colored High and Training School (later renamed Frederick Douglass High School), where he was an above-average student and put his finely honed skills of argument to use as a star member of the debate team. The teenaged Marshall was also something of a mischievous troublemaker. His greatest high school accomplishment, memorizing the entire United States Constitution, was actually a teacher's punishment for misbehaving in class. After graduating from high school in 1926, Marshall attended Lincoln University, a historically black college in Pennsylvania. There, he joined a remarkably distinguished student body that included Kwame Nkrumah, the future president of Ghana; Langston Hughes, the great poet; and Cab Calloway, the famous jazz singer. After graduating from Lincoln with honors in 1930, Marshall applied to the University of Maryland Law School. Despite being overqualified academically, Marshall was rejected because of his race. This firsthand experience with discrimination in education made a lasting impression on Marshall and helped determine the future course of his career. Instead of Maryland, Marshall attended law school in Washington, D.C. at Howard University, another historically black school. The dean of Howard Law School at the time was the pioneering civil rights lawyer Charles Houston. Marshall quickly fell under the tutelage of Houston, a notorious disciplinarian and extraordinarily demanding professor. Marshall recalled of Houston, "He would not be satisfied until he went to a dance on the campus and found all of his students sitting around the wall reading law books instead of partying." Marshall graduated magna cum laude from Howard in 1933.Murray v. PearsonAfter graduating from law school, Marshall briefly attempted to  establish his own practice in Baltimore, but without experience he  failed to land any significant cases. In 1934, he began working for the  Baltimore branch of the National Association for the Advancement of  Colored People. In one of Marshall's first cases—which he argued  alongside his mentor, Charles Houston—he defended another well-qualified  undergraduate, Donald Murray, who like himself had been denied entrance  to the University of Maryland Law School. Marshall and Houston won  Murray v. Pearson in January 1936, the first in a long string of cases  designed to undermine the legal basis for de jure racial segregation in  the United States.Chambers v. Florida & Smith v. AllwrightLater in 1936, Marshall moved to New York City to work full time as   legal counsel for the NAACP. Over the following decades, Marshall argued   and won a variety of cases to strike down many forms of legalized   racism, helping to inspire the American Civil Rights Movement.   Marshall's first victory before the Supreme Court came in Chambers v.  Florida (1940),  in which he successfully defended four black men who had  been  convicted of murder on the basis of confessions coerced from them  by  police. Another crucial Supreme Court victory came in the 1944 case  of Smith v. Allwright, in which the Court struck down the Democratic  Party's use of whites-only primary elections in various Southern states.Brown v. Board of EducationHowever, the great achievement of Marshall's career as a civil-rights   lawyer was his victory in the landmark 1954 Supreme Court case Brown v.  Board of Education of Topeka.  The class action lawsuit was filed on behalf of a  group of black  parents in Topeka, Kansas on behalf of their children  forced to attend  all-black segregated schools. Through Brown v. Board,  one of the  most important cases of the 20th century, Marshall challenged head-on  the legal underpinning of racial  segregation, the doctrine of "separate  but equal" established by the  1896 Supreme Court case Plessy v. Ferguson. On May 17, 1954, the Supreme  Court unanimously ruled that "separate  educational facilities are  inherently unequal," and therefore racial  segregation of public schools  violated the equal protection clause of  the 14th Amendment. While  enforcement of the Court's ruling  proved to be uneven and painfully  slow, Brown v. Board provided  the legal foundation, and much of the  inspiration, for the American  Civil Rights Movement that unfolded over  the next decade. At the same  time, the case established Marshall as one of the most successful and  prominent lawyers in  America.Circuit Court Judge & Solicitor GeneralIn 1961, then-newly elected President John F. Kennedy appointed   Thurgood  Marshall as a judge for the U.S. Second Circuit Court of   Appeals. Serving as a circuit court judge over the next four years,   Marshall issued more than 100 decisions, none of which was overturned by   the Supreme Court. Then, in 1965, Kennedy's successor, Lyndon B.   Johnson,  appointed Marshall to serve as the first black U.S. solicitor  general,  the attorney designated to argue on behalf of the federal   government before the Supreme Court. During his two years as solicitor   general, Marshall won 14 of the 19 cases that he argued before the Supreme   Court.Supreme Court JusticeFinally, in 1967, President Johnson nominated Marshall to serve on  the bench before which he had successfully argued so many times before—the United States Supreme Court. On October 2, 1967, Marshall  was sworn in as a Supreme Court justice, becoming the first African American to  serve on the nation's highest court. Marshall joined a liberal Supreme Court headed by Chief Justice Earl Warren, which aligned with Marshall's views on politics  and the Constitution. As a Supreme Court justice, Marshall consistently  supported rulings upholding a strong protection of individual rights and liberal interpretations of controversial social issues. He was part of  the majority that ruled in favor of the right to abortion in the  landmark 1973 case Roe v. Wade, among several other cases. In the 1972 case Furman v.  Georgia, which led to a de facto moratorium on the death penalty,  Marshall articulated his opinion that the death penalty was  unconstitutional in all circumstances. Throughout Marshall's 24-year tenure on the Court, Republican  presidents appointed eight consecutive justices, and Marshall gradually  became an isolated liberal member of an increasingly conservative  Court. For the latter part of his time on the bench, Marshall was  largely relegated to issuing strongly worded dissents, as the Court  reinstated the death penalty and limited affirmative action measures and  abortion rights. Marshall retired from the Supreme Court in  1991; Justice Clarence Thomas replaced him.Death and LegacyThurgood Marshall died on January 24, 1993, at the age of 84. Thurgood Marshall stands alongside Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm  X as one of the greatest and most important figures of the American Civil Rights Movement. And although he may be the least popularly  celebrated of the three, Marshall was arguably the most instrumental in  the movement's achievements toward racial equality. Marshall's strategy  of attacking racial inequality through the courts represented a third  way of pursuing racial equality, more pragmatic than King's soaring  rhetoric and less polemical than Malcolm X's strident separatism. In the  aftermath of Marshall's death, an obituary read: "We make movies about  Malcolm X, we get a holiday to honor Dr. Martin Luther King, but every  day we live with the legacy of Justice Thurgood Marshall."Personal LifeMarshall married Vivian "Buster" Burey in 1929, and the couple  remained married until her death in 1955. Shortly thereafter, Marshall  married Cecilia Suyat, his secretary at the NAACP; they had two sons,  Thurgood Jr. and John Marshall.Videos

Brown   August 18, 2016  Follow @DeNeenLBrown        Cecilia Marshall, 88, the widow of Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, is pictured in the home where they both lived with their two sons in Falls Church, Va. (Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post)   WASHINGTON — Cecilia “Cissy” Marshall sinks into a red wingback chair in her Northern Virginia living room. All around her are memories of her late husband, Thurgood Marshall, the great litigator for the NAACP who helped win the landmark case that ended legal segregation in America’s public schools. Visitors to the Smithsonian’s new National Museum of African American History and Culture, which opens Sept. 24, will find Thurgood Marshall’s image and words featured inside. But Cissy Marshall’s living room is its own museum, featuring front-page newspaper stories, letters from presidents, and a black-and-white photo of Cissy reaching up to help him with his robe as the grandson of a slave became the country’s first African American on the U.S. Supreme Court in 1967. She had a flower in her hair. He wore his trademark black horn-rimmed glasses and gazed down at her. She was a 4-foot-11 woman of Philippine descent married to a black legal giant. “He was 6-foot-2. He would always say, ‘How’s the weather down there, gal?’ I’d say, ‘Same as up there, man!’ I’d keep telling him: ‘I don’t care how tall you are. I could still beat you up. I’ll get on a chair,’ ” she says, laughing. She relishes telling stories about the man she married when she was 26 and he was 46. He would come home from the nation’s high court in the evenings and cook fabulous meals for her and their two sons. “Chicken. Chitlins. He would use every pot in the kitchen,” she recalls. “I learned early. I would be right behind him in the kitchen, with a rag cleaning up. He was a great cook.” They had one car — a Cadillac. “Ever since he was a young man, he wanted a Cadillac,” she says. “He needed room.” By contrast, she had to sit on pillows to see over the steering wheel. At 88, Cissy Marshall has been a widow for more than two decades. Thurgood Marshall retired from the court in 1991 and died in 1993. She visits his grave at Arlington National Cemetery as often as possible. At their home, he remains ever present.  [Historically Black: Collecting artifacts of the African American experience]  She’s sitting where she and Thurgood used to spend their evenings watching television. Well, she watched TV. He was usually thinking about cases, she says, though he never discussed the court’s inner workings or decisions with her.  “Sometimes, I’d say, ‘Why did you do that?’ ” He would raise his hand. “He would say he couldn’t even discuss it with me,” she remembers.  It’s a hot afternoon in Falls Church, Va., where they moved more than 30 years ago. At the time, they were the only nonwhite family on their block, she says. The floor-to-ceiling curtains in her sunroom are pulled apart, and she has a view of Lake Barcroft across the street. Her sons, Thurgood Marshall Jr., a lawyer who served in the Clinton White House, and John W. Marshall, a former Virginia secretary of public safety and U.S. Marshals Service director, live in the area. Cissy’s journey here was an unlikely one. Born in Hawaii to immigrant parents, Cecilia “Cissy” Suyat moved to New York after her father balked at her marrying a Filipino whose family spoke a different dialect. “For my father, that was a no-no,” she said. “Imagine that? Another dialect, instead of another race?” “So he said, ‘You go to New York with your aunt and uncle and take some business courses. And if you still love him in a year, come back and marry him.’ ” Instead, she says, she decided she wanted to stay in New York. Her father agreed but told her, “You’ve got to support yourself.” She went to the employment office. “The clerk, she saw my dark skin, and she sent me to the national office of the NAACP,” she says. “That is the only reason I can think of that she sent me to the NAACP for my first job. And to this day, I thank her, because had it not been for her, I wouldn’t have known anything about a race problem.” She also wouldn’t have met Thurgood Marshall, the head of the NAACP’s legal team. In 1948, she started working as a stenographer, then was promoted to be the secretary to the director of the NAACP’s branch offices. She earned $35 a week and played a supporting role in the historic Brown v. Board of Education decision.     From left, George E.C. Hayes, Thurgood Marshall and James M. Nabrit join hands outside the U.S. Supreme Court on May 17, 1954. The three NAACP lawyers led the fight for abolition of segregation in public schools in Brown v. Board of Education. (AP)     Thurgood Marshall, who led the NAACP’s legal team, and his wife, Cecilia, leave the Supreme Court after the high court ordered the Little Rock School Board to proceed with integration at Central High School. (UPI)    The NAACP’s legal department spent four years honing its arguments. Cissy typed and retyped briefs. She would take notes as the lawyers practiced their oral presentations, both in New York and in Washington at Howard University Law School. “We would have mock court trials. They’d have so-called judges sitting there, and lawyers would argue their cases as though they were arguing before the Supreme Court, so they could get hints as to where to improve, what to say, what not to say and how to say it better, right there at Howard University. We would work until midnight.” The legal team argued the case for the first time before the Supreme Court in 1952 and again in 1953. Thurgood Marshall led the arguments on behalf of black children denied access to all-white schools, challenging the “separate but equal” legal doctrine that stood since 1896 with the Supreme Court ruling in Plessy v. Ferguson. In her wingback chair, she opens a book to a page showing the famous black-and-white photo of him running up the steps to the Supreme Court, rushing to hear the Brown ruling. It was May 17, 1954.  [Cissy Marshall recalls day of Brown v. Board of Education decision]  Chief Justice Earl Warren delivered the unanimous ruling that forever changed the country: “We conclude that, in the field of public education, the doctrine of ‘separate but equal’ has no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.” The triumphant NAACP lawyers flew back to New York later that day. “Everybody celebrated in the office,” Cissy recalls, though she doesn’t remember any toasts with sparkling wine. “I don’t think anybody had any money for champagne.” After a couple of hours of jubilation, Thurgood headed back to his office. He knew the fight to desegregate schools was just beginning, Cissy says. “ ‘I don’t know about you fools,’ ” she says he told his co-workers, “ ‘but I’m going back to work. Because our work has just begun.’ ”  [On Brown v. Board anniversary, new evidence schools are resegregating ]  Nine months after the Brown decision, his first wife, Vivian “Buster” Burey, died of cancer at the age of 44. One of the country’s most accomplished black men was suddenly a widower. He soon began courting Cissy, who resisted when he proposed. “I said, ‘No way. No way. People will think you are marrying a foreigner,’ ” she says. Her own family would raise objections, too. “He said, ‘I don’t care what people think. I’m marrying you.’ He was so persuasive. So we got married. And, actually, there was no repercussion because people knew me.” On Dec. 17, 1955, Roy Wilkins, then executive secretary of the NAACP, gave her away at St. Philip’s Episcopal Church in Harlem. At their New York apartment, the couple’s visitors included the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks.    Cissy Marshall holds a 1965 photo of her family at the White House with President Lyndon B. Johnson, when he appointed Thurgood Marshall as solicitor general. (Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post)  In 1961, President John F. Kennedy appointed Thurgood Marshall to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit. In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson named him solicitor general. Cissy picks up a faded photo from that day. “This is the photo with Justice Hugo Black swearing him in,” she says. It was ironic because Black, she notes, had been a member of the Ku Klux Klan when he was young. “Then when he got into the court, he turned out to be one of the most liberal justices.” Thurgood Marshall joined Black on the Supreme Court in 1967. The morning of his swearing in, Cissy chose a pink linen suit and put a flower in her hair. The Marshalls drove to the White House in their Cadillac. “I was numb,” she remembers. Her husband was making history again.    Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall.

Thurgood Marshall sits in Room 2228 of the New Senate Office Building on July 13, 1967, a month after Lyndon Johnson has named him to the United States Supreme Court. Facing him are, among others, four arch-segregationist Southerners on the Senate Judiciary Committee: John McClellan, Sam Ervin, Strom Thurmond and its chairman, James Eastland. Marshall is determined to become the first black man ever to sit on the nation’s highest court. The senators are equally determined to block him.If a photograph of the scene existed, it would be as indelible an image of the civil rights era as the fire hoses of Birmingham, the lunch counters of Greensboro or the “I Am a Man” protesters of Memphis. Instead, Marshall’s historic appointment, and the battle to confirm him, are almost entirely forgotten.The story gets lost, perhaps, amid Johnson’s other landmark achievements, notably the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of the following year. Perhaps it’s also because, like other black trailblazers — Walter White and A. Philip Randolph are just two — Marshall has been relegated to the shadow of Martin Luther King Jr., little mentioned nowadays except by Amtrak conductors approaching the Baltimore airport. Or perhaps it’s because Johnson’s principal biographer, Robert Caro, hasn’t yet reached that part of the story.But Wil Haygood now has. The outlines of the tale he tells in “Showdown” are beautifully captured by a photograph that does exist — in fact, it’s the first photograph in the book — showing Marshall and Johnson standing together the day the appointment was announced. It suggests their compatibility was not just physical — they were both large and shambling men — but temperamental: Each was wily and resourceful, rough-hewed and plain-­spoken. Johnson himself recognized as much. Continue reading the main story

“Thurgood, I’m nominating you because you’re a lot like me: Bigger than life, and we come from the same kind of people,” he told him. Because there had been no Supreme Court vacancies handy, Johnson, the consummate wheeler-­dealer, fashioned one, naming Ramsey Clark attorney general in order to induce his father, Justice Tom C. Clark, to quit. Johnson could then slide Marshall, solicitor general at the time, into Clark’s slot.

Before that, Marshall had been a federal appeals court judge in New York, begrudgingly named six years earlier by President Kennedy after Marshall had spurned his offer of a seat on the federal trial bench. (“My boiling point is too low for the trial court,” Marshall had explained. “I’d blow my stack and then get reversed.”) That initial offer had come from Robert Kennedy. “You don’t seem to understand,” he warned Marshall. “It’s this or nothing.”  “I do understand,” Marshall lectured him. “You don’t know what it means, but all I’ve had in my life is nothing. It’s not new to me, so goodbye.”For much of that life, Marshall had been the founder and principal litigator of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, fighting, against great odds and at enormous personal risk, to dismantle Jim Crow in Southern schools, courtrooms, lunch counters and voting booths — that is, when he wasn’t struggling frantically to spare individual indigent blacks from the electric chair or the rope. “Folks would come for miles, some of them on muleback or horseback, to see ‘the nigger lawyer’ who stood up in white men’s courtrooms,” an N.A.A.C.P. official would later recall. Not all of Marshall’s beneficiaries, though, were black: By helping to invalidate ­Texas’ whites-only primaries, thereby adding thousands of black voters to the rolls, he helped make Lyndon Johnson a senator.

“He is one of the most distinguished lawyers in the land,” Senator Jacob Javits of New York said in introducing Marshall to the Judiciary Committee. Javits’s words were echoed 24 years later when the first President Bush introduced Marshall’s replacement, Clarence Thomas. But in Marshall’s case, they were true.In what was really Marshall’s first victory over the segregationist senators, they did not dare challenge his civil rights work. Instead, seeking to exploit concerns about crime — riots in Detroit and elsewhere were taking place during the hearings — they asked him about (and, in effect, blamed him and people like him for) recent Supreme Court decisions expanding the rights of criminal defendants. At one point Senator Ervin, not yet the avuncular figure of the Watergate hearings, complained that the Fifth Amendment was never meant to invalidate “voluntary confessions.”“Well, Senator, the word ‘voluntary’ gets me in trouble,” Marshall replied. “I tried a case in Oklahoma where the man ‘voluntarily’ confessed after he was beaten up for six days.” The hearings, startlingly unscripted compared with today’s antiseptic proceedings, furnished one of the first debates on originalism — the idea that the Constitution was frozen in time rather than, as Marshall argued, a “living document” — and which, in this instance, was the refuge of bigots. They also featured Senator Thurmond trying to trip Marshall up on historical trivia that no one but a specialist, and certainly not Thurmond himself, could possibly have known.“Are you prejudiced against white people in the South?” Senator Eastland asked Marshall. It was not, as Haygood writes, the “penultimate” question, but it was the ultimate one, and Marshall handled it with aplomb. Shortly thereafter, he was overwhelmingly confirmed, and far more easily than Haygood leads us to expect he would be. Miraculously (though Haygood fails to point it out) only one Republican, Thurmond, voted against him. For all his fears, Lyndon Johnson was famously persuasive (and were Marshall to falter, he even had another black candidate, William Coleman, waiting in the wings). He could also count noses.Haygood, the author of previous biographies of Adam Clayton Powell Jr., Sammy Davis Jr. and Sugar Ray Robinson, is passionate and, at times, eloquent. But “Showdown” can be very rough going. There are spasms of bad writing, filled with tortured metaphors and redundancies: A “risky tightrope” and “Jewish synagogues” are but two. “The entire American federal judiciary was nearly all white,” he writes. Characters are continually reintroduced, characterizations and facts needlessly repeated. Grousing about such potholes can seem petty. But they’re distracting, and besides, a figure and a story this grand deserve better.Haygood hypes. He repeatedly and portentously calls Marshall “Thurgood Marshall,” in much the way Bill Clinton morphs into “William Jefferson Clinton” whenever he wants to sound solemn. He tells us such confirmation hearings were “gravely important, the highest mission for judiciary members,” only to concede later on that before Marshall came along, they were often perfunctory: For instance, both William J. Brennan Jr. and an earlier Johnson nominee, Abe Fortas, sailed through in under a day. And happy though he surely was at Marshall’s swearing in — it was no accident that Justice Hugo Black, once a member of the Ku Klux Klan, administered the oath — can one imagine Lyndon Johnson ever being “delirious with joy”?There are many mistakes. The Federal troops Dwight Eisenhower sent to Little Rock did not, as Haygood tells us, remain there “for an entire year.” Franklin Roose­velt wasn’t president — or Eleanor first lady — when World War II ended. Sometimes he seems tone-deaf. Even before Atticus Finch’s recent unmasking in “Go Set a Watchman,” can it really be true, as Haygood writes, that “Negroes would tell you Thurgood Marshall was Atticus Finch before Atticus Finch”?Inexplicably, the book omits Marshall’s oral argument in Brown v. Board of Education. And, apart from some condescension from Joseph Kraft of The Washington Post — Marshall “will not bring to the court penetrating analysis or distinction of mind,” he predicted — there’s next to nothing about press coverage of the hearings. Instead, Haygood relies almost entirely on transcripts for his account.

Haygood offers little meaningful eyewitness testimony. The endnotes confirm his dependence largely on previously published books; his account lacks the grit and specificity that comes with original research. How and with whom did Marshall prepare for the hearings? How was this outspoken and salty man — he later called Eastland “the meanest son of a bitch that ever walked the earth” — taught to hold his tongue? Which senators did Johnson lobby most aggressively, and how? It’s hard to believe that Johnson’s papers, which Haygood says he consulted, don’t provide at least some clues.One might think there was neither the time nor space for these queries, but that’s not it. Instead, the book subjects readers to something Marshall himself never faced: a filibuster. Or filibusters. Again and again Haygood detours, into everything from the flight of John ­Wilkes Booth to the making of “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner.” As interesting as these digressions — and digressions from digressions — can be, they don’t warrant the copious space he gives them. Though Haygood quite rightly loves his story, he also doesn’t love it enough; otherwise, he’d have stuck more closely to it.Haygood has done a great service by reminding us of an extraordinary man at an extraordinary moment. He correctly notes that someone even remotely like Marshall, with his liberal record and instincts, would never be confirmed today. But for the real inside story of how all this happened, we’ll just have to wait — for Robert Caro.SHOWDOWNThurgood Marshall and the Supreme Court Nomination That Changed AmericaBy Wil HaygoodIllustrated. 404 pp. Alfred A.

   Thurgood Marshall Biography      Thurgood Marshall, Supreme CourtJustice          Born in Baltimore, Maryland         on July 2, 1908, Thurgood Marshall was the grandson of a         slave. His father, William Marshall, instilled in him from         youth an appreciation for the United States Constitution and         the rule of law. After completing high school in 1925,         Thurgood followed his brother, William Aubrey Marshall, at         the historically black Lincoln University in Chester County,         Pennsylvania. His classmates at Lincoln included a         distinguished group of future Black leaders such as the poet         and author Langston Hughes, the future President of Ghana,         Kwame Nkrumah, and musician Cab Calloway. Just before         graduation, he married his first wife, Vivian "Buster"         Burey. Their twenty-five year marriage ended with her death         from cancer in 1955.              In 1930, he applied to the University of Maryland Law         School, but was denied admission because he was Black. This         was an event that was to haunt him and direct his future         professional life. Thurgood sought admission and was         accepted at the Howard University Law School that same year         and came under the immediate influence of the dynamic new         dean, Charles Hamilton Houston, who instilled in all of his         students the desire to apply the tenets of the Constitution         to all Americans. Paramount in Houston's outlook was the         need to overturn the 1898 Supreme Court ruling, Plessy v.         Ferguson which established the legal doctrine called,         "separate but equal." Marshall's first major court case came         in 1933 when he successfully sued the University of Maryland         to admit a young African American Amherst University         graduate named Donald Gaines Murray. Applauding Marshall's         victory, author H.L. Mencken wrote that the decision of         denial by the University of Maryland Law School was "brutal         and absurd," and they should not object to the "presence         among them of a self-respecting and ambitious young         Afro-American well prepared for his studies by four years of         hard work in a class A college." Thurgood Marshall followed his Howard University mentor,         Charles Hamilton Houston to New York and later became Chief         Counsel for the National Association for the Advancement of         Colored People (NAACP). During this period, Mr. Marshall was         asked by the United Nations and the United Kingdom to help         draft the constitutions of the emerging African nations of         Ghana and what is now Tanzania. It was felt that the person         who so successfully fought for the rights of America's         oppressed minority would be the perfect person to ensure the         rights of the White citizens in these two former European         colonies. After amassing an impressive record of Supreme         Court challenges to state-sponsored discrimination,         including the landmark Brown v. Board decision in 1954,         President John F. Kennedy appointed Thurgood Marshall to the         U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. In this         capacity, he wrote over 150 decisions including support for         the rights of immigrants, limiting government intrusion in         cases involving illegal search and seizure, double jeopardy,         and right to privacy issues. Biographers Michael Davis and         Hunter Clark note that, "none of his (Marshall's) 98         majority decisions was ever reversed by the Supreme Court."         In 1965 President Lyndon Johnson appointed Judge Marshall to         the office of U.S. Solicitor General. Before his subsequent         nomination to the United States Supreme Court in 1967,         Thurgood Marshall won 14 of the 19 cases he argued before         the Supreme Court on behalf of the government. Indeed,         Thurgood Marshall represented and won more cases before the         United States Supreme Court than any other American. Until his retirement from the highest court in the land,         Justice Marshall established a record for supporting the         voiceless American. Having honed his skills since the case         against the University of Maryland, he developed a profound         sensitivity to injustice by way of the crucible of racial         discrimination in this country. As an Associate Supreme         Court Justice, Thurgood Marshall leaves a legacy that         expands that early sensitivity to include all of America's         voiceless. Justice Marshall died on January 24, 1993.   A Thurgood Marshall timeline:  provided         by A         Deeper Shade of Black .         1930   Mr. Marshall graduates with honors from Lincoln                  U.

Access to Originals

Please use the following steps to determine whether you need to fill out a call slip in the Prints
    and Photographs Reading Room to view the original item(s). In some cases, a surrogate (substitute image) is
    available, often in the form of a digital image, a copy print, or microfilm.
    




Is the item digitized? (A thumbnail (small) image will be visible on the left.)



Yes, the item is digitized.
                Please use the digital image in preference to requesting the original. All images can be
                viewed at a large size when you are in any reading room at the Library of Congress.  In some
                cases, only thumbnail (small) images are available when you are outside the Library of
                Congress because the item is rights restricted or has not been evaluated for rights
                restrictions.
                
                As a preservation measure, we generally do not serve an original item when a digital image
                is available.  If you have a compelling reason to see the original, consult with a reference
                librarian.  (Sometimes, the original is simply too fragile to serve. For example, glass and
                film photographic negatives are particularly subject to damage. They are also easier to see
                online where they are presented as positive images.)
            

No, the item is not digitized. Please go to #2.
            




Do the Access Advisory or Call Number fields above indicate that a non-digital surrogate exists,
            such as microfilm or copy prints?



Yes, another surrogate exists. Reference staff can direct you to this
                surrogate.
            

No, another surrogate does not exist. Please go to #3.
            



        If you do not see a thumbnail image or a reference to another surrogate, please fill out a call slip in
        the Prints and Photographs Reading Room. In many cases, the originals can be served in a few minutes.
        Other materials require appointments for later the same day or in the future.  Reference staff can
        advise you in both how to fill out a call slip and when the item can be served.

of official segregation and the first black Justice of the Supreme Court, died today. A major figure in
American public life for a half-century, he was 84 years old. 
 Toni House, the Court's spokeswoman, said Justice Marshall died of heart failure at Bethesda Naval
Medical Center in Maryland at 2 P.M. 
 Justice Marshall, who retired from the High Court in 1991, had been scheduled to administer the oath
of office to Vice President Al Gore on Wednesday, but his failing health prevented him from doing so. 
 Thurgood Marshall was a figure of history well before he began his 24-year service on the Supreme
Court on Oct. 2, 1967. 
 During more than 20 years as director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, he
was the principal architect of the strategy of using the courts to provide what the political system would
not: a definition of equality that assured black Americans the full rights of citizenship. 
Landmark Triumph
in 1954

 His greatest legal victory came in 1954 with the Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of
Education, which declared an end to the "separate but equal" system of racial segregation then in effect in
the public schools of 21 states. 
 Despite the years of turmoil that followed the unanimous decision, the Court left no doubt that it was
bringing an end to the era of official segregation in all public institutions. Many questions lingered after so
monumental a transformation, and the Court continued to confront issues involving the legacy of
segregation even after Justice Marshall retired. 
 As a civil rights lawyer, Mr. Marshall devised the legal strategy and headed the team that brought the
school desegregation issue before the Court. An experienced Supreme Court advocate by that time, he
argued the case himself in the straightforward, plain-spoken manner that was the hallmark of his
courtroom style. Asked by Justice Felix Frankfurter during the argument what he meant by "equal," Mr.
Marshall replied, "Equal means getting the same thing, at the same time, and in the same place." 
 He won many other important civil rights cases, including a challenge to the whites-only primary elections
in Texas. This device was commonly used by white Southern politicians to disenfranchise blacks. 
 He also won a major Supreme Court case in which the Court declared that restrictive covenants that
barred blacks from buying or renting homes could not be enforced in state courts.
'Heroic Imagination' In
a Ruthless World 

 Mr. Marshall, who was born and reared in Baltimore, was excluded from the all-white law school at the
University of Maryland. Later he brought successful lawsuits that integrated not only that school but also
several other state university systems. He received his legal education at the law school of Howard
University in Washington, D.C., the nation's pre-eminent black university, where he graduated first in his
class in 1933 and made the personal and intellectual connections that shaped his future career. 

Years later, the University of Maryland named its law library for him, and the City of Baltimore honored
him by placing a bronze likeness, more than eight feet tall, outside the Federal courthouse. 

 "To do what he did required a heroic imagination," Paul Gewirtz, one of Justice Marshall's former law
clerks, wrote in a tribute published after the Justice retired from the Court. 
 The article by Mr. Gewirtz, the Potter Stewart Professor of Constitutional Law at Yale Law School,
continued: "He grew up in a ruthlessly discriminatory world -- a world in which segregation of the races
was pervasive and taken for granted, where lynching was common, where the black man's inherent
inferiority was proclaimed widely and wantonly. Thurgood Marshall had the capacity to imagine a
radically different world, the imaginative capacity to believe that such a world was possible, the strength
to sustain that image in the mind's eye and the heart's longing, and the courage and ability to make that
imagined world real." 
 Yet Justice Marshall was not satisfied with what he had achieved, believing that the Constitution's
promise of equality remained unfulfilled and that his work was therefore unfinished.
A Voice of Anger
And Disappointment 
 For much of his Supreme Court career, as the Court's majority increasingly drew back from affirmative
action and other remedies for discrimination that he believed were still necessary to combat the nation's
legacy of racism, Justice Marshall used dissenting opinions to express his disappointment and anger. 
In 1978, for example, in the Bakke case, in which the Court found it unconstitutional for a state-run
medical school to reserve 16 of 100 places in the entering class for black and other minority students,
Justice Marshall filed a separate 16-page opinion tracing the black experience in America. 
 "In light of the sorry history of discrimination and its devastating impact on the lives of Negroes," he
wrote, "bringing the Negro into the mainstream of American life should be a state interest of the highest
order. To fail to do so is to insure that America will forever remain a divided society." 
 He dissented in City of Richmond v. Croson, a 1989 ruling in which the Court declared unconstitutional a
municipal ordinance setting aside 30 percent of public contracting dollars for companies owned by blacks
or members of other minorities. The Court majority called the program a form of state-sponsored racism
that was no less offensive to the Constitution than a policy officially favoring whites. 
 In his dissenting opinion, Justice Marshall said that in reaching that conclusion "a majority of this Court
signals that it regards racial discrimination as largely a phenomenon of the past, and that government
bodies need no longer preoccupy themselves with rectifying racial injustice." 
 He added: "I, however, do not believe this nation is anywhere close to eradicating racial discrimination or
its vestiges. In constitutionalizing its wishful thinking, the majority today does a grave disservice not only
to those victims of past and present racial discrimination in this nation whom government has sought to
assist, but also to this Court's long tradition of approaching issues of race with the utmost sensitivity."
 'Great Dissenter' As Political Prophet 
Although he wrote a number of important majority opinions for the Court, his most powerful voice was in
dissent, and not only in the area of racial discrimination. Like his friend and closest ally, Justice William J.
Brennan Jr., who retired the year before he did, Justice Marshall believed that the death penalty was
unconstitutional under all circumstances. He dissented from all decisions in which the Court upheld
application of the death penalty, and he wrote more than 150 dissenting opinions in cases in which the
Court had refused to hear death penalty appeals. 
 In an article published after his retirement, Kathleen M. Sullivan, a Harvard Law School professor, called
Justice Marshall "the great dissenter." 
 "We may read his eloquent admonitions in dissent as prophecies for another (perhaps distant) era when
the political pendulum swings again," Professor Sullivan wrote. "With his departure goes part of the
conscience of the Court -- a reminder of the human consequences of legal decisions." 
 While the phrase "first black Supreme Court Justice" was attached so often to his name that it appeared
to be part of his official title, it was a partial definition at best, scarcely encompassing the unusual range of
legal experience that Justice Marshall brought to the Court. 
 By the time President Lyndon B. Johnson named him to succeed Justice Tom C. Clark, who had retired,
Mr. Marshall had argued 32 cases before the Supreme Court and won 29 of them. He argued 14 of
those cases as a private lawyer and 18 as Solicitor General of the United States, the Federal
Government's chief advocate in the Supreme Court. President Johnson had named him to that position in
1965, two years before nominating him to the Supreme Court. 
 From 1961 to 1965, Thurgood Marshall was a Federal appeals court judge, named by President John
F. Kennedy to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in Manhattan. He wrote 112
opinions on that court, none of which was overturned on appeal. Several of his dissenting opinions were
eventually adopted as majority opinions by the Supreme Court. 

He had at first been hesitant to accept President Kennedy's offer of a seat on the appeals court, fearing
that his allies in the civil rights movement would think that he was deserting the struggle. "I had to fight it
out with myself," he said in an interview some years ago. "But by then I had built up a staff -- a damned
good staff -- an excellent board, and the backing that would let them go ahead. And when one has an
opportunity to serve the Government, he should think twice before passing it up." 

 The Thurgood Marshall whom the public saw in his old age was a gruff, lumbering figure, his pace
slowed by extra pounds and shortness of breath, his eyesight impaired by glaucoma. Outspoken and
impolitic, he stirred up minor storms by making cutting remarks in public, highly unusual for a Supreme
Court Justice, about major public figures. 
 "I wouldn't do the job of dogcatcher for Ronald Reagan," he said in an interview in 1989. The next year,
referring to President Bush, he said in a televised interview: "It's said that if you can't say something good
about a dead person, don't say it. Well, I consider him dead."
 Behind the Mask, A Fine Storyteller 
 In the courtroom Justice Marshall's face was an inscrutable mask. He said little during the argument
sessions, growling occasionally at lawyers who were struggling lamely through their arguments and
sometimes training his sarcasm on his own colleagues. During a death penalty argument in 1981, William
H. Rehnquist, then an Associate Justice, suggested that the inmate's repeated appeals had cost the
taxpayers too much money. Justice Marshall interrupted, saying, "It would have been cheaper to shoot
him right after he was arrested, wouldn't it?" 
 But those who knew him well said that behind the mask was a man with an earthy sense of humor, a
spellbinding storyteller with an anecdote from his own long life for every occasion. 
Justice Brennan, in a tribute to his friend published in the Harvard Law Review, wrote about Justice
Marshall's storytelling abilities. "The locales are varied -- from dusty courtrooms in the Deep South, to a
confrontation with General MacArthur in the Far East, to the drafting sessions for the Kenyan
Constitution," Justice Brennan wrote. "They are brought to life by all the tricks of the storyteller's art: the
fluid voice, the mobile eyebrows, the sidelong glance, the pregnant pause and the wry smile." 

The stories were meant not only to entertain but also to serve "a deeper purpose," Justice Brennan said. 


"They are his way of preserving the past while purging it of its bleakest moments," he said. "They are also
a form of education for the rest of us. Surely, Justice Marshall recognized that the stories made us -- his
colleagues -- confront walks of life we had never known." 
 Many of his stories recalled the hostility, the harassment and, not infrequently, the danger he had faced as
a civil rights lawyer, traveling some 50,000 miles a year throughout the South representing black clients
and unpopular causes. One story he told was of being arrested on a trumped-up charge of drunken
driving while leaving a Tennessee town in which he and a colleague had just won an acquittal for a black
defendant. 

As Justice Marshall recounted the incident in an interview, he was brought before a magistrate, who told
him: "If you're not drunk, will you take my test? Will you blow in my face? I'm a teetotaler and I can smell
the least bit of whisky." 


"He was a short man," recalled Justice Marshall, who was himself 6 feet 2 inches tall and weighed well
over 200 pounds. "I put my hands on his shoulders and breathed just as hard as I could into the man's
face." The case was dismissed. 

 "We drove to Nashville," the Justice added. "And then, boy, I really wanted a drink!" 
Thurgood Marshall was born in Baltimore on July 2, 1908. His mother, the former Norma Williams,
was a teacher. His father, William Marshall, had once worked as a Pullman car waiter and later became
a steward at the exclusive, all-white Gibson Island Club on Chesapeake Bay. A great-grandfather had
been taken as a slave from the Congo to the Eastern Shore of Maryland, where the slaveholder
eventually freed him. 

Mr. Marshall was named for his paternal grandfather, who had chosen the name "Thoroughgood" when
he enlisted as a private in the Union Army during the Civil War. His grandson later explained that he
adopted the spelling "Thurgood" in grade school because he "got tired of spelling all that out." 

 He described himself as a "hell-raiser" in school, a circumstance that gave him exposure to the
Constitution and lifelong respect for it. "Instead of making us copy out stuff on the blackboard after
school when we misbehaved, our teacher sent us down into the basement to learn parts of the
Constitution," he once recalled. "I made my way through every paragraph." 
 In high school years in Baltimore, he worked as a delivery boy for a women's clothing store after classes.
He waited on tables to help pay the tuition at Lincoln University in Chester, Pa., where he said he
"majored in hell-raising." He was expelled once for hazing freshmen, but after being readmitted he
became a star debater and graduated with honors in 1930. 
 His mother wanted him to become a dentist, a safe and lucrative career for a black professional in those
days, but he was determined to become a lawyer. Enrolling at Howard University Law School meant a
long daily commute from Baltimore because he could not afford housing at the school. His mother
pawned her wedding and engagement rings to pay the law school's entrance fees. 
 At Howard he met a man who would influence the course of his life, Charles Hamilton Houston, then the
law school's vice dean. Mr. Houston, a Harvard Law School graduate who later served as chief counsel
to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and who became the first black
lawyer to win a case before the Supreme Court, imbued his students with the goal of using the law to
attack institutional racism. 

"Charlie Houston insisted that we be social engineers rather than lawyers," Justice Marshall said in an
interview published in the American Bar Association Journal in 1992. 


The Justice often credited Mr. Houston, who died in 1950 at the age of 54, as his mentor. Referring to
the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision, he said in the bar association interview: "The school
case was really Charlie's victory. He just never got a chance to see it." 
A Basic Strategy To End
Segregation 
 After earning his law degree Mr. Marshall opened a law office in Baltimore. The nation was in the fourth
year of the Depression. He found himself handling civil rights cases for impoverished clients and was soon
$1,000 in debt. But his courtroom victories, including his successful challenge to segregation at the
University of Maryland Law School, began to be noticed. In 1936 Mr. Houston, by then the chief
counsel of the N.A.A.C.P., recruited him for a $2,600-a-year job on the organization's legal staff in New
York. Two years later, when Mr. Houston returned to Washington, Mr. Marshall succeeded to the
chief counsel's title but continued to work closely with his mentor. 
 Pursuing a long-range strategy to eradicate segregation, the two men concentrated first on graduate and
professional schools, believing that white judges were most likely to be offended by segregation in that
setting and to sympathize with the ambitious young black college graduates who were the plaintiffs in the
cases. As successes mounted, the two turned their attention to segregation in public high schools and
elementary schools. 
 "Under Marshall, the N.A.A.C.P.'s legal staff became the model for public interest law firms," Mark
Tushnet, one of the Justice's biographers who was also one of his law clerks, wrote in the American Bar
Association Journal. "Marshall was thus one of the first public interest lawyers. His commitment to racial
justice led him and his staff to develop ways of thinking about constitutional litigation that have been
enormously influential far beyond the areas of segregation and discrimination." 
 In its public school cases, the initial focus of the N.A.A.C.P., and later of the NAACP Legal Defense
and Educational Fund, which became a separate entity in the 1940's, was to seek to equalize the
resources available to the all-black schools in segregated systems. Mr. Marshall persuaded the
organization's board to abandon that approach and to refuse to take on any cases that did not challenge
the fact of segregation itself. 

The new policy was controversial within the N.A.A.C.P. and prompted resignations by several black
lawyers on whom the organization had relied to handle cases in the South. Mr. Marshall was not
deterred, and took on many of the cases himself. He traveled constantly and was in charge of as many as
450 cases at a time. "I was on the verge of a nervous breakdown for a long time, but I never quite made
the grade," he once said. 

 Robert L. Carter, an associate of Mr. Marshall's from those days who later became a Federal district
judge in New York, recalled their travels through the South in an article published in The Harvard Law
Review. 
 "Having grown up in Maryland, Marshall had a slight Southern accent," Mr. Carter wrote. "But when
our opponents were Southern lawyers, which was virtually all the time, his accent would become much
more pronounced. Before and after the case was called, Marshall would joke with the opposing counsel
or exchange some pleasantry, all in a Southern accent so broad that he sounded as if he had lived all his
life in the deep rural South. The practice irritated me at first. The very lawyers Marshall's Southern
drawl would put at ease were defending a system we detested." 
 Mr. Carter wrote that he gradually understood that his friend "was attempting to communicate to these
men that, although we were on opposite sides of an emotionally charged lawsuit, we were lawyers
representing our clients and had no personal quarrel with each other."

'The Right Man And the Right
Place' 


By 1961, when President Kennedy named him to the Federal appeals court, Thurgood Marshall was
the best known black lawyer in the United States. A group of Southern senators held up his confirmation
for months, and he served initially under a special appointment made during a Congressional recess. Six
years later, President Johnson said that placing Judge Marshall on the Supreme Court was "the right
thing to do, the right time to do it, the right man and the right place." 

 Liberals still dominated the Court in the closing years of Chief Justice Earl Warren's tenure, and Justice
Marshall fit in comfortably with such colleagues as Justices Brennan and William O. Douglas. In his
early years on the Court, Justice Marshall cast only a handful of dissenting votes. 
 Inexorably, the ideological landscape changed. By the time Justice Marshall announced his retirement,
on June 27, 1991, he had served longer than all but one of the sitting Justices -- Byron R. White, who
was named by President Kennedy in 1962 -- and was more liberal than any of them. In his final term he
dissented in 25 of 112 cases. 
 Among Justice Marshall's important majority opinions for the Court was Amalgamated Food
Employees Union v. Logan Valley Plaza, in 1968, which held that a shopping center was a "public forum"
much like an old downtown city street, from which the private owners could not exclude picketers. 
 His majority opinion in Stanley v. Georgia, in 1969, held that the private possession of pornography
could not be subject to prosecution. "If the First Amendment means anything," he wrote in that case, "it
means that a state has no business telling a man, sitting alone in his own house, what books he may read
or what films he may watch." 
He wrote the majority opinion in Bounds v. Smith, a 1977 case holding that state prison systems are
constitutionally obliged to provide inmates with "adequate law libraries or adequate assistance from
persons trained in the law."
 A Vigorous Dissent In a Schools Case

One of his best known dissents was a 63-page opinion in a 1973 case, San Antonio School District v.
Rodriguez. The majority in that case held, by a 5-to-4 vote, that the Constitution's guarantee of equal
protection was not violated by the property tax system used by Texas and most other states to finance
public education. Under the system districts with generous tax bases can afford to provide better schools
than less wealthy districts. 

 In his dissenting opinion, Justice Marshall accused the majority of an "unsupportable acquiescence in a
system which deprives children in their earliest years of the chance to reach their full potential as citizens." 
 He argued that the right to an education should be regarded as a "fundamental" constitutional right, and
that state policies that have the effect of discriminating on the basis of wealth should be subject to
especially searching judicial scrutiny. 
 "In my judgment," he wrote, "the right of every American to an equal start in life, so far as the provision of
a state service as important as education is concerned, is far too vital to permit state discrimination on
grounds as tenuous as those presented by this record." 
 Justice Marshall had often said that he did not plan to retire, so his decision at the end of the 1990-91
term took both the Court and the country by surprise. 

One person familiar with the Court recalled that when Justice Marshall informed his colleagues of his
plan, at the Justices' final private conference of the term, even the members of the Court who had clashed
with him long and often on matters of law and policy were deeply moved. Exclaiming "Oh, Thurgood!"
Chief Justice Rehnquist embraced Justice Marshall in a bear hug. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wept. 
 Justice Marshall, a few days shy of his 83d birthday, gave health as the reason for his retirement. At a
news conference the next day he was asked, "What's wrong with you, sir?" 
 "What's wrong with me?" Justice Marshall replied. "I'm old. I'm getting old and coming apart." 
 Justice Marshall's first wife, the former Vivien Burey, whom he married in 1929, died of cancer in
February 1955. In December of that year he married Cecilia Suyat, known as Cissy. They had two sons,
Thurgood Jr., legislative-affairs coordinator for the Office of the Vice President and previously a lawyer
on the staff of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and John, a member of the Virginia state police. Back to the top of this page.Back to today's page.Go to another day.Copyright 2010 The New York Times CompanyChildren's Privacy Notice

Early life




Henry Highland Garnet School (P.S. 103), where Marshall attended elementary school


Marshall was born in Baltimore, Maryland, on July 2, 1908. One of his great-grandfathers was born in the modern-day Democratic Republic of the Congo, captured, and was taken to the United States as a slave;[2][3] Marshall's paternal grandfather had also been enslaved.[4] His original name was Thoroughgood, but he shortened it to Thurgood.[3] His father, William Marshall, worked as a railroad porter, and his mother Norma, as a teacher; they instilled in him an appreciation for the United States Constitution and the rule of law.[5]
Marshall attended Frederick Douglass High School in Baltimore and was placed in the class with the best students. He graduated a year early in 1925 with a B-grade average, and placed in the top third of the class. He went to Lincoln University. It is commonly reported that he intended to study medicine and become a dentist.
But according to his application to Lincoln University,[6] Marshall said his goal was to become a lawyer. Among his classmates were poet Langston Hughes and musician Cab Calloway. Initially he did not take his studies seriously, and was suspended twice for hazing and pranks against fellow students.[7][8] He was not politically active at first, becoming a "star" of the debating team.[8]
In his freshman year he opposed the integration of African-American professors at the university.[7] Hughes later described Marshall as "rough and ready, loud and wrong".[9] In his second year Marshall participated in a sit-in protest against segregation at a local movie theater. In that year, he was initiated as a member of Alpha Phi Alpha, the first fraternity founded by and for blacks.[10] His marriage to Vivien Burey in September 1929 encouraged him to take his studies seriously, and he graduated from Lincoln with honors (cum laude) Bachelor of Arts in Humanities, with a major in American literature and philosophy.[8]
Marshall wanted to study in his hometown law school, the University of Maryland School of Law, but did not apply because of the school's segregation policy. Marshall instead attended Howard University School of Law, where he worked harder than he had at Lincoln and his views on discrimination were heavily influenced by the dean Charles Hamilton Houston.[8] In 1933, he graduated first in his class at Howard.[11]
Law career




Thurgood Marshall in 1936 at the beginning of his career with the NAACP


After graduating from law school, Marshall started a private law practice in Baltimore. He began his 25-year affiliation with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1934 by representing the organization in the law school discrimination suit Murray v. Pearson. In 1936, Marshall became part of the national staff of the NAACP.[11]
In Murray v. Pearson, Marshall represented Donald Gaines Murray, a black Amherst College graduate with excellent credentials, who was denied admission to the University of Maryland Law School because of its segregation policy. Black students in Maryland wanting to study law had to attend segregated establishments, Morgan College, the Princess Anne Academy, or out-of-state black institutions. Using the strategy developed by Nathan Margold, Marshall argued that Maryland's segregation policy violated the "separate but equal" doctrine of Plessy v. Ferguson because the state did not provide a comparable educational opportunity at a state-run black institution.[12] The Maryland Court of Appeals ruled against the state of Maryland and its Attorney General, who represented the University of Maryland, stating, "Compliance with the Constitution cannot be deferred at the will of the state. Whatever system is adopted for legal education must furnish equality of treatment now."[13]
Chief Counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund
At the age of 32, Marshall won U.S. Supreme Court case Chambers v. Florida, 309 U.S. 227 (1940). That same year, he founded and became the executive director of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund.[14] As the head of the Legal Defense Fund, he argued many other civil rights cases before the Supreme Court, most of them successfully, including Smith v. Allwright, 321 U.S. 649 (1944); Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1 (1948); Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U.S. 629 (1950); and McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents, 339 U.S. 637 (1950). His most famous case as a lawyer was Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), the case in which the Supreme Court ruled that "separate but equal" public education, as established by Plessy v. Ferguson, was not applicable to public education because it could never be truly equal. In total, Marshall won 29 out of the 32 cases he argued before the Supreme Court.
During the 1950s, Thurgood Marshall developed a friendly relationship with J. Edgar Hoover, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In 1956, for example, he privately praised Hoover's campaign to discredit T.R.M. Howard, a maverick civil rights leader from Mississippi. During a national speaking tour, Howard criticized the FBI's failure to seriously investigate cases such as the 1955 killers of George W. Lee and Emmett Till. In a private letter to Hoover, Marshall "attacked Howard as a 'rugged individualist' who did not speak for the NAACP."[15] Two years earlier Howard arranged for Marshall to deliver a well-received speech at a rally of his Regional Council of Negro Leadership in Mound Bayou, Mississippi only days before the Brown decision.[16] According to historians David T. Beito and Linda Royster Beito, "Marshall's disdain for Howard was almost visceral. [He] 'disliked Howard's militant tone and maverick stance' and 'was well aware that Hoover's attack served to take the heat off the NAACP and provided opportunities for closer collaboration [between the NAACP and the FBI] in civil rights.'"[15]
Court of Appeals and Solicitor General
President John F. Kennedy appointed Marshall to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in 1961 to a new seat created on May 19, 1961, by 75 Stat. 80. A group of Senators from the South, led by Mississippi's James Eastland, held up his confirmation, so he served for the first several months under a recess appointment. Marshall remained on that court until 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed him to be the United States Solicitor General, the first African American to hold the office.[17] At the time, this made him the highest-ranking black government official in American history, surpassing Robert C. Weaver, Johnson's first secretary of housing and urban development.[18] As Solicitor General, he won 14 out of the 19 cases that he argued for the government.
U.S. Supreme Court

On June 13, 1967, President Johnson nominated Marshall to the Supreme Court following the retirement of Justice Tom C. Clark, saying that this was "the right thing to do, the right time to do it, the right man and the right place." Marshall was confirmed as an Associate Justice by a Senate vote of 69–11 on August 30, 1967.[19] He was the 96th person to hold the position, and the first African American.
Marshall once bluntly described his legal philosophy as this: "You do what you think is right and let the law catch up",[20] a statement which his conservative detractors argued was a sign of his embracement of judicial activism.[21][22]
Marshall served on the Court for the next 24 years, compiling a liberal record that included strong support for Constitutional protection of individual rights, especially the rights of criminal suspects against the government. His most frequent ally on the Court (the pair rarely voted at odds) was Justice William Brennan, who consistently joined him in supporting abortion rights and opposing the death penalty. Brennan and Marshall concluded in Furman v. Georgia that the death penalty was, in all circumstances, unconstitutional, and never accepted the legitimacy of Gregg v. Georgia, which ruled four years later that the death penalty was constitutional in some circumstances. Thereafter, Brennan or Marshall dissented from every denial of certiorari in a capital case and from every decision upholding a sentence of death.[citation needed]
In 1987, Marshall gave a controversial speech on the occasion of the bicentennial celebrations of the Constitution of the United States.[23] Marshall stated:

The government they devised was defective from the start, requiring several amendments, a civil war, and major social transformations to attain the system of constitutional government and its respect for the freedoms and individual rights, we hold as fundamental today.[24]

In conclusion Marshall stated:

Some may more quietly commemorate the suffering, struggle, and sacrifice that has triumphed over much of what was wrong with the original document, and observe the anniversary with hopes not realized and promises not fulfilled. I plan to celebrate the bicentennial of the Constitution as a living document, including the Bill of Rights and the other amendments protecting individual freedoms and human rights.[24]

Although best remembered for jurisprudence in the fields of civil rights and criminal procedure, Marshall made significant contributions to other areas of the law as well. In Teamsters v. Terry, he held that the Seventh Amendment entitled the plaintiff to a jury trial in a suit against a labor union for breach of duty of fair representation. In TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., he articulated a formulation for the standard of materiality in United States securities law that is still applied and used today. In Cottage Savings Association v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, he weighed in on the income tax consequences of the Savings and Loan crisis, permitting a savings and loan association to deduct a loss from an exchange of mortgage participation interests. In Personnel Administrator MA v. Feeney, Marshall wrote a dissent saying that a law that gave hiring preference to veterans over non-veterans was unconstitutional because of its inequitable impact on women.
Among his many law clerks were attorneys who went on to become judges themselves, such as Judge Douglas Ginsburg of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals; Judge Ralph Winter of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit; Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan; as well as notable law professors Susan Low Bloch, Elizabeth Garrett (President of Cornell University), Paul Gewirtz, Dan Kahan, Randall L. Kennedy, Eben Moglen, Rick Pildes, Louis Michael Seidman,[25] Cass Sunstein, and Mark Tushnet (editor of Thurgood Marshall: His Speeches, Writings, Arguments, Opinions and Reminiscences); and law school deans Paul Mahoney of University of Virginia School of Law, Martha Minow of Harvard Law School, and Richard Revesz of New York University School of Law.
Marshall retired from the Supreme Court in 1991 due to declining health. In his retirement press conference on June 28, 1991, he expressed his view that race should not be a factor in choosing his successor, and he denied circulating claims that he was retiring because of frustration or anger over the conservative direction in which the Court was heading."[26] He was reportedly unhappy that it would fall to President George H. W. Bush to name his replacement.[27] Bush nominated Clarence Thomas to replace Marshall.

Marshall died of heart failure at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, at 2:58 pm on January 24, 1993, at the age of 84. He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery.[28] His second wife and their two sons survived him.
Marshall left all his personal papers and notes to the Library of Congress. The Librarian of Congress, James H. Billington, opened Marshall's papers for immediate use by scholars, journalists and the public, insisting that this was Marshall's intent. The Marshall family and several of his close associates disputed this claim.[29] The decision to make the documents public was supported by the American Library Association.[30] A list of the archived manuscripts is available.[31]
There are numerous memorials to Marshall. One, an eight-foot statue, stands in Lawyers Mall adjacent to the Maryland State House. The statue, dedicated on October 22, 1996, depicts Marshall as a young lawyer and is placed just a few feet away from where the Old Maryland Supreme Court Building stood; the court where Marshall argued discrimination cases leading up to the Brown decision.[32] The primary office building for the federal court system, located on Capitol Hill in Washington D.C., is named in honor of Justice Marshall and contains a statue of him in the atrium. In 1976, Texas Southern University renamed its law school after the sitting justice.[33] In 1980, the University of Maryland School of Law opened a new library which it named the Thurgood Marshall Law Library.[34] In 2000, the historic Twelfth Street YMCA Building located in the Shaw neighborhood of Washington, D.C. was renamed the Thurgood Marshall Center. The major airport serving Baltimore and the Maryland suburbs of Washington, DC, was renamed the Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport on October 1, 2005. The 2009 General Convention of the Episcopal Church added Marshall to the church's liturgical calendar of "Holy Women, Holy Men: Celebrating the Saints," designating May 17 as his feast day.[35] His membership of the Lincoln University fraternity Alpha Phi Alpha is to be memorialized by a sculpture by artist Alvin Pettit in 2013.[36]
The University of California, San Diego, renamed its Third College after Thurgood Marshall in 1993.[37] Marshall Middle School in Olympia, Washington, is also named after Thurgood Marshall, as is Thurgood Marshall Academy in Washington, D.C.
In 2006, Thurgood, a one-man play written by George Stevens, Jr., premiered at the Westport Country Playhouse, starring James Earl Jones and directed by Leonard Foglia.[38] Later it opened Broadway at the Booth Theatre on April 30, 2008, starring Laurence Fishburne.[39] On February 24, 2011, HBO screened a filmed version of the play which Fishburne performed at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. The production was described by the Baltimore Sun as "one of the most frank, informed and searing discussions of race you will ever see on TV.".[40][41] On February 16, 2011, a screening of the film was hosted by the White House as part of its celebrations of Black History Month[42][43] A painting of Justice Thurgood by Chaz Guest currently hangs at the White House.[44][45] Also, a new film titled Marshall, is being made, with actor Chadwick Boseman as Thurgood Marshall, and directed by Reginald Hudlin.[citation needed]
Marriage and family
Marshall was married twice. He married Vivien "Buster" Burey in 1929. After her death in February 1955, Marshall married Cecilia Suyat in December of that year. They were married until he died in 1993, having two sons together:[46] Thurgood Marshall, Jr., a former top aide to President Bill Clinton; and John W. Marshall, a former United States Marshals Service Director and Virginia Secretary of Public Safety.
Thurgood Marshall Award
The Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico instituted[47] in 1993 the annual Thurgood Marshall Award, given to the top student in civil rights at each of Puerto Rico's four law schools. It includes a $500 monetary award. The awardees are selected by the Commonwealth's Attorney General.

Thurgood Marshall (July 2, 1908 – January 24, 1993) was an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, serving from October 1967 until October 1991. Marshall was the Court's 96th justice and its first African-American justice.
Before becoming a judge, Marshall was a lawyer who was best known for his high success rate in arguing before the Supreme Court and for the victory in Brown v. Board of Education, a 1954 decision that ruled that segregated public schools were unconstitutional. He served on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit after being appointed by President John F. Kennedy. He was appointed as the Solicitor General by President Lyndon Johnson in 1965. President Johnson nominated him to the United States Supreme Court in 1967 and he was approved by the Senate.

Early life




Henry Highland Garnet School (P.S. 103), where Marshall attended elementary school


Marshall was born in Baltimore, Maryland, on July 2, 1908. One of his great-grandfathers was born in the modern-day Democratic Republic of the Congo, captured, and was taken to the United States as a slave;[2][3] Marshall's paternal grandfather had also been enslaved.[4] His original name was Thoroughgood, but he shortened it to Thurgood.[3] His father, William Marshall, worked as a railroad porter, and his mother Norma, as a teacher; they instilled in him an appreciation for the United States Constitution and the rule of law.[5]
Marshall attended Frederick Douglass High School in Baltimore and was placed in the class with the best students. He graduated a year early in 1925 with a B-grade average, and placed in the top third of the class. He went to Lincoln University. It is commonly reported that he intended to study medicine and become a dentist.
But according to his application to Lincoln University,[6] Marshall said his goal was to become a lawyer. Among his classmates were poet Langston Hughes and musician Cab Calloway. Initially he did not take his studies seriously, and was suspended twice for hazing and pranks against fellow students.[7][8] He was not politically active at first, becoming a "star" of the debating team.[8]
In his freshman year he opposed the integration of African-American professors at the university.[7] Hughes later described Marshall as "rough and ready, loud and wrong".[9] In his second year Marshall participated in a sit-in protest against segregation at a local movie theater. In that year, he was initiated as a member of Alpha Phi Alpha, the first fraternity founded by and for blacks.[10] His marriage to Vivien Burey in September 1929 encouraged him to take his studies seriously, and he graduated from Lincoln with honors (cum laude) Bachelor of Arts in Humanities, with a major in American literature and philosophy.[8]
Marshall wanted to study in his hometown law school, the University of Maryland School of Law, but did not apply because of the school's segregation policy. Marshall instead attended Howard University School of Law, where he worked harder than he had at Lincoln and his views on discrimination were heavily influenced by the dean Charles Hamilton Houston.[8] In 1933, he graduated first in his class at Howard.[11]
Law career




Thurgood Marshall in 1936 at the beginning of his career with the NAACP


After graduating from law school, Marshall started a private law practice in Baltimore. He began his 25-year affiliation with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1934 by representing the organization in the law school discrimination suit Murray v. Pearson. In 1936, Marshall became part of the national staff of the NAACP.[11]
In Murray v. Pearson, Marshall represented Donald Gaines Murray, a black Amherst College graduate with excellent credentials, who was denied admission to the University of Maryland Law School because of its segregation policy. Black students in Maryland wanting to study law had to attend segregated establishments, Morgan College, the Princess Anne Academy, or out-of-state black institutions. Using the strategy developed by Nathan Margold, Marshall argued that Maryland's segregation policy violated the "separate but equal" doctrine of Plessy v. Ferguson because the state did not provide a comparable educational opportunity at a state-run black institution.[12] The Maryland Court of Appeals ruled against the state of Maryland and its Attorney General, who represented the University of Maryland, stating, "Compliance with the Constitution cannot be deferred at the will of the state. Whatever system is adopted for legal education must furnish equality of treatment now."[13]
Chief Counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund
At the age of 32, Marshall won U.S. Supreme Court case Chambers v. Florida, 309 U.S. 227 (1940). That same year, he founded and became the executive director of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund.[14] As the head of the Legal Defense Fund, he argued many other civil rights cases before the Supreme Court, most of them successfully, including Smith v. Allwright, 321 U.S. 649 (1944); Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1 (1948); Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U.S. 629 (1950); and McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents, 339 U.S. 637 (1950). His most famous case as a lawyer was Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), the case in which the Supreme Court ruled that "separate but equal" public education, as established by Plessy v. Ferguson, was not applicable to public education because it could never be truly equal. In total, Marshall won 29 out of the 32 cases he argued before the Supreme Court.
During the 1950s, Thurgood Marshall developed a friendly relationship with J. Edgar Hoover, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In 1956, for example, he privately praised Hoover's campaign to discredit T.R.M. Howard, a maverick civil rights leader from Mississippi. During a national speaking tour, Howard criticized the FBI's failure to seriously investigate cases such as the 1955 killers of George W. Lee and Emmett Till. In a private letter to Hoover, Marshall "attacked Howard as a 'rugged individualist' who did not speak for the NAACP."[15] Two years earlier Howard arranged for Marshall to deliver a well-received speech at a rally of his Regional Council of Negro Leadership in Mound Bayou, Mississippi only days before the Brown decision.[16] According to historians David T. Beito and Linda Royster Beito, "Marshall's disdain for Howard was almost visceral. [He] 'disliked Howard's militant tone and maverick stance' and 'was well aware that Hoover's attack served to take the heat off the NAACP and provided opportunities for closer collaboration [between the NAACP and the FBI] in civil rights.'"[15]
Court of Appeals and Solicitor General
President John F. Kennedy appointed Marshall to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in 1961 to a new seat created on May 19, 1961, by 75 Stat. 80. A group of Senators from the South, led by Mississippi's James Eastland, held up his confirmation, so he served for the first several months under a recess appointment. Marshall remained on that court until 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed him to be the United States Solicitor General, the first African American to hold the office.[17] At the time, this made him the highest-ranking black government official in American history, surpassing Robert C. Weaver, Johnson's first secretary of housing and urban development.[18] As Solicitor General, he won 14 out of the 19 cases that he argued for the government.
U.S. Supreme Court

On June 13, 1967, President Johnson nominated Marshall to the Supreme Court following the retirement of Justice Tom C. Clark, saying that this was "the right thing to do, the right time to do it, the right man and the right place." Marshall was confirmed as an Associate Justice by a Senate vote of 69–11 on August 30, 1967.[19] He was the 96th person to hold the position, and the first African American.
Marshall once bluntly described his legal philosophy as this: "You do what you think is right and let the law catch up",[20] a statement which his conservative detractors argued was a sign of his embracement of judicial activism.[21][22]
Marshall served on the Court for the next 24 years, compiling a liberal record that included strong support for Constitutional protection of individual rights, especially the rights of criminal suspects against the government. His most frequent ally on the Court (the pair rarely voted at odds) was Justice William Brennan, who consistently joined him in supporting abortion rights and opposing the death penalty. Brennan and Marshall concluded in Furman v. Georgia that the death penalty was, in all circumstances, unconstitutional, and never accepted the legitimacy of Gregg v. Georgia, which ruled four years later that the death penalty was constitutional in some circumstances. Thereafter, Brennan or Marshall dissented from every denial of certiorari in a capital case and from every decision upholding a sentence of death.[citation needed]
In 1987, Marshall gave a controversial speech on the occasion of the bicentennial celebrations of the Constitution of the United States.[23] Marshall stated:

The government they devised was defective from the start, requiring several amendments, a civil war, and major social transformations to attain the system of constitutional government and its respect for the freedoms and individual rights, we hold as fundamental today.[24]

In conclusion Marshall stated:

Some may more quietly commemorate the suffering, struggle, and sacrifice that has triumphed over much of what was wrong with the original document, and observe the anniversary with hopes not realized and promises not fulfilled. I plan to celebrate the bicentennial of the Constitution as a living document, including the Bill of Rights and the other amendments protecting individual freedoms and human rights.[24]

Although best remembered for jurisprudence in the fields of civil rights and criminal procedure, Marshall made significant contributions to other areas of the law as well. In Teamsters v. Terry, he held that the Seventh Amendment entitled the plaintiff to a jury trial in a suit against a labor union for breach of duty of fair representation. In TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., he articulated a formulation for the standard of materiality in United States securities law that is still applied and used today. In Cottage Savings Association v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, he weighed in on the income tax consequences of the Savings and Loan crisis, permitting a savings and loan association to deduct a loss from an exchange of mortgage participation interests. In Personnel Administrator MA v. Feeney, Marshall wrote a dissent saying that a law that gave hiring preference to veterans over non-veterans was unconstitutional because of its inequitable impact on women.
Among his many law clerks were attorneys who went on to become judges themselves, such as Judge Douglas Ginsburg of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals; Judge Ralph Winter of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit; Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan; as well as notable law professors Susan Low Bloch, Elizabeth Garrett (President of Cornell University), Paul Gewirtz, Dan Kahan, Randall L. Kennedy, Eben Moglen, Rick Pildes, Louis Michael Seidman,[25] Cass Sunstein, and Mark Tushnet (editor of Thurgood Marshall: His Speeches, Writings, Arguments, Opinions and Reminiscences); and law school deans Paul Mahoney of University of Virginia School of Law, Martha Minow of Harvard Law School, and Richard Revesz of New York University School of Law.
Marshall retired from the Supreme Court in 1991 due to declining health. In his retirement press conference on June 28, 1991, he expressed his view that race should not be a factor in choosing his successor, and he denied circulating claims that he was retiring because of frustration or anger over the conservative direction in which the Court was heading."[26] He was reportedly unhappy that it would fall to President George H. W. Bush to name his replacement.[27] Bush nominated Clarence Thomas to replace Marshall.

Marshall died of heart failure at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, at 2:58 pm on January 24, 1993, at the age of 84. He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery.[28] His second wife and their two sons survived him.
Marshall left all his personal papers and notes to the Library of Congress. The Librarian of Congress, James H. Billington, opened Marshall's papers for immediate use by scholars, journalists and the public, insisting that this was Marshall's intent. The Marshall family and several of his close associates disputed this claim.[29] The decision to make the documents public was supported by the American Library Association.[30] A list of the archived manuscripts is available.[31]
There are numerous memorials to Marshall. One, an eight-foot statue, stands in Lawyers Mall adjacent to the Maryland State House. The statue, dedicated on October 22, 1996, depicts Marshall as a young lawyer and is placed just a few feet away from where the Old Maryland Supreme Court Building stood; the court where Marshall argued discrimination cases leading up to the Brown decision.[32] The primary office building for the federal court system, located on Capitol Hill in Washington D.C., is named in honor of Justice Marshall and contains a statue of him in the atrium. In 1976, Texas Southern University renamed its law school after the sitting justice.[33] In 1980, the University of Maryland School of Law opened a new library which it named the Thurgood Marshall Law Library.[34] In 2000, the historic Twelfth Street YMCA Building located in the Shaw neighborhood of Washington, D.C. was renamed the Thurgood Marshall Center. The major airport serving Baltimore and the Maryland suburbs of Washington, DC, was renamed the Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport on October 1, 2005. The 2009 General Convention of the Episcopal Church added Marshall to the church's liturgical calendar of "Holy Women, Holy Men: Celebrating the Saints," designating May 17 as his feast day.[35] His membership of the Lincoln University fraternity Alpha Phi Alpha is to be memorialized by a sculpture by artist Alvin Pettit in 2013.[36]
The University of California, San Diego, renamed its Third College after Thurgood Marshall in 1993.[37] Marshall Middle School in Olympia, Washington, is also named after Thurgood Marshall, as is Thurgood Marshall Academy in Washington, D.C.
In 2006, Thurgood, a one-man play written by George Stevens, Jr., premiered at the Westport Country Playhouse, starring James Earl Jones and directed by Leonard Foglia.[38] Later it opened Broadway at the Booth Theatre on April 30, 2008, starring Laurence Fishburne.[39] On February 24, 2011, HBO screened a filmed version of the play which Fishburne performed at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. The production was described by the Baltimore Sun as "one of the most frank, informed and searing discussions of race you will ever see on TV.".[40][41] On February 16, 2011, a screening of the film was hosted by the White House as part of its celebrations of Black History Month[42][43] A painting of Justice Thurgood by Chaz Guest currently hangs at the White House.[44][45] Also, a new film titled Marshall, is being made, with actor Chadwick Boseman as Thurgood Marshall, and directed by Reginald Hudlin.[citation needed]
Marriage and family
Marshall was married twice. He married Vivien "Buster" Burey in 1929. After her death in February 1955, Marshall married Cecilia Suyat in December of that year. They were married until he died in 1993, having two sons together:[46] Thurgood Marshall, Jr., a former top aide to President Bill Clinton; and John W. Marshall, a former United States Marshals Service Director and Virginia Secretary of Public Safety.
Thurgood Marshall Award
The Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico instituted[47] in 1993 the annual Thurgood Marshall Award, given to the top student in civil rights at each of Puerto Rico's four law schools. It includes a $500 monetary award. The awardees are selected by the Commonwealth's Attorney General.

Thurgood Marshall (July 2, 1908 – January 24, 1993) was an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, serving from October 1967 until October 1991. Marshall was the Court's 96th justice and its first African-American justice.
Before becoming a judge, Marshall was a lawyer who was best known for his high success rate in arguing before the Supreme Court and for the victory in Brown v. Board of Education, a 1954 decision that ruled that segregated public schools were unconstitutional. He served on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit after being appointed by President John F. Kennedy. He was appointed as the Solicitor General by President Lyndon Johnson in 1965. President Johnson nominated him to the United States Supreme Court in 1967 and he was approved by the Senate.

Early life




Henry Highland Garnet School (P.S. 103), where Marshall attended elementary school


Marshall was born in Baltimore, Maryland, on July 2, 1908. One of his great-grandfathers was born in the modern-day Democratic Republic of the Congo, captured, and was taken to the United States as a slave;[2][3] Marshall's paternal grandfather had also been enslaved.[4] His original name was Thoroughgood, but he shortened it to Thurgood.[3] His father, William Marshall, worked as a railroad porter, and his mother Norma, as a teacher; they instilled in him an appreciation for the United States Constitution and the rule of law.[5]
Marshall attended Frederick Douglass High School in Baltimore and was placed in the class with the best students. He graduated a year early in 1925 with a B-grade average, and placed in the top third of the class. He went to Lincoln University. It is commonly reported that he intended to study medicine and become a dentist.
But according to his application to Lincoln University,[6] Marshall said his goal was to become a lawyer. Among his classmates were poet Langston Hughes and musician Cab Calloway. Initially he did not take his studies seriously, and was suspended twice for hazing and pranks against fellow students.[7][8] He was not politically active at first, becoming a "star" of the debating team.[8]
In his freshman year he opposed the integration of African-American professors at the university.[7] Hughes later described Marshall as "rough and ready, loud and wrong".[9] In his second year Marshall participated in a sit-in protest against segregation at a local movie theater. In that year, he was initiated as a member of Alpha Phi Alpha, the first fraternity founded by and for blacks.[10] His marriage to Vivien Burey in September 1929 encouraged him to take his studies seriously, and he graduated from Lincoln with honors (cum laude) Bachelor of Arts in Humanities, with a major in American literature and philosophy.[8]
Marshall wanted to study in his hometown law school, the University of Maryland School of Law, but did not apply because of the school's segregation policy. Marshall instead attended Howard University School of Law, where he worked harder than he had at Lincoln and his views on discrimination were heavily influenced by the dean Charles Hamilton Houston.[8] In 1933, he graduated first in his class at Howard.[11]
Law career




Thurgood Marshall in 1936 at the beginning of his career with the NAACP


After graduating from law school, Marshall started a private law practice in Baltimore. He began his 25-year affiliation with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1934 by representing the organization in the law school discrimination suit Murray v. Pearson. In 1936, Marshall became part of the national staff of the NAACP.[11]
In Murray v. Pearson, Marshall represented Donald Gaines Murray, a black Amherst College graduate with excellent credentials, who was denied admission to the University of Maryland Law School because of its segregation policy. Black students in Maryland wanting to study law had to attend segregated establishments, Morgan College, the Princess Anne Academy, or out-of-state black institutions. Using the strategy developed by Nathan Margold, Marshall argued that Maryland's segregation policy violated the "separate but equal" doctrine of Plessy v. Ferguson because the state did not provide a comparable educational opportunity at a state-run black institution.[12] The Maryland Court of Appeals ruled against the state of Maryland and its Attorney General, who represented the University of Maryland, stating, "Compliance with the Constitution cannot be deferred at the will of the state. Whatever system is adopted for legal education must furnish equality of treatment now."[13]
Chief Counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund
At the age of 32, Marshall won U.S. Supreme Court case Chambers v. Florida, 309 U.S. 227 (1940). That same year, he founded and became the executive director of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund.[14] As the head of the Legal Defense Fund, he argued many other civil rights cases before the Supreme Court, most of them successfully, including Smith v. Allwright, 321 U.S. 649 (1944); Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1 (1948); Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U.S. 629 (1950); and McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents, 339 U.S. 637 (1950). His most famous case as a lawyer was Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), the case in which the Supreme Court ruled that "separate but equal" public education, as established by Plessy v. Ferguson, was not applicable to public education because it could never be truly equal. In total, Marshall won 29 out of the 32 cases he argued before the Supreme Court.
During the 1950s, Thurgood Marshall developed a friendly relationship with J. Edgar Hoover, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In 1956, for example, he privately praised Hoover's campaign to discredit T.R.M. Howard, a maverick civil rights leader from Mississippi. During a national speaking tour, Howard criticized the FBI's failure to seriously investigate cases such as the 1955 killers of George W. Lee and Emmett Till. In a private letter to Hoover, Marshall "attacked Howard as a 'rugged individualist' who did not speak for the NAACP."[15] Two years earlier Howard arranged for Marshall to deliver a well-received speech at a rally of his Regional Council of Negro Leadership in Mound Bayou, Mississippi only days before the Brown decision.[16] According to historians David T. Beito and Linda Royster Beito, "Marshall's disdain for Howard was almost visceral. [He] 'disliked Howard's militant tone and maverick stance' and 'was well aware that Hoover's attack served to take the heat off the NAACP and provided opportunities for closer collaboration [between the NAACP and the FBI] in civil rights.'"[15]
Court of Appeals and Solicitor General
President John F. Kennedy appointed Marshall to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in 1961 to a new seat created on May 19, 1961, by 75 Stat. 80. A group of Senators from the South, led by Mississippi's James Eastland, held up his confirmation, so he served for the first several months under a recess appointment. Marshall remained on that court until 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed him to be the United States Solicitor General, the first African American to hold the office.[17] At the time, this made him the highest-ranking black government official in American history, surpassing Robert C. Weaver, Johnson's first secretary of housing and urban development.[18] As Solicitor General, he won 14 out of the 19 cases that he argued for the government.
U.S. Supreme Court

On June 13, 1967, President Johnson nominated Marshall to the Supreme Court following the retirement of Justice Tom C. Clark, saying that this was "the right thing to do, the right time to do it, the right man and the right place." Marshall was confirmed as an Associate Justice by a Senate vote of 69–11 on August 30, 1967.[19] He was the 96th person to hold the position, and the first African American.
Marshall once bluntly described his legal philosophy as this: "You do what you think is right and let the law catch up",[20] a statement which his conservative detractors argued was a sign of his embracement of judicial activism.[21][22]
Marshall served on the Court for the next 24 years, compiling a liberal record that included strong support for Constitutional protection of individual rights, especially the rights of criminal suspects against the government. His most frequent ally on the Court (the pair rarely voted at odds) was Justice William Brennan, who consistently joined him in supporting abortion rights and opposing the death penalty. Brennan and Marshall concluded in Furman v. Georgia that the death penalty was, in all circumstances, unconstitutional, and never accepted the legitimacy of Gregg v. Georgia, which ruled four years later that the death penalty was constitutional in some circumstances. Thereafter, Brennan or Marshall dissented from every denial of certiorari in a capital case and from every decision upholding a sentence of death.[citation needed]
In 1987, Marshall gave a controversial speech on the occasion of the bicentennial celebrations of the Constitution of the United States.[23] Marshall stated:

The government they devised was defective from the start, requiring several amendments, a civil war, and major social transformations to attain the system of constitutional government and its respect for the freedoms and individual rights, we hold as fundamental today.[24]

In conclusion Marshall stated:

Some may more quietly commemorate the suffering, struggle, and sacrifice that has triumphed over much of what was wrong with the original document, and observe the anniversary with hopes not realized and promises not fulfilled. I plan to celebrate the bicentennial of the Constitution as a living document, including the Bill of Rights and the other amendments protecting individual freedoms and human rights.[24]

Although best remembered for jurisprudence in the fields of civil rights and criminal procedure, Marshall made significant contributions to other areas of the law as well. In Teamsters v. Terry, he held that the Seventh Amendment entitled the plaintiff to a jury trial in a suit against a labor union for breach of duty of fair representation. In TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., he articulated a formulation for the standard of materiality in United States securities law that is still applied and used today. In Cottage Savings Association v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, he weighed in on the income tax consequences of the Savings and Loan crisis, permitting a savings and loan association to deduct a loss from an exchange of mortgage participation interests. In Personnel Administrator MA v. Feeney, Marshall wrote a dissent saying that a law that gave hiring preference to veterans over non-veterans was unconstitutional because of its inequitable impact on women.
Among his many law clerks were attorneys who went on to become judges themselves, such as Judge Douglas Ginsburg of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals; Judge Ralph Winter of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit; Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan; as well as notable law professors Susan Low Bloch, Elizabeth Garrett (President of Cornell University), Paul Gewirtz, Dan Kahan, Randall L. Kennedy, Eben Moglen, Rick Pildes, Louis Michael Seidman,[25] Cass Sunstein, and Mark Tushnet (editor of Thurgood Marshall: His Speeches, Writings, Arguments, Opinions and Reminiscences); and law school deans Paul Mahoney of University of Virginia School of Law, Martha Minow of Harvard Law School, and Richard Revesz of New York University School of Law.
Marshall retired from the Supreme Court in 1991 due to declining health. In his retirement press conference on June 28, 1991, he expressed his view that race should not be a factor in choosing his successor, and he denied circulating claims that he was retiring because of frustration or anger over the conservative direction in which the Court was heading."[26] He was reportedly unhappy that it would fall to President George H. W. Bush to name his replacement.[27] Bush nominated Clarence Thomas to replace Marshall.

U.S. Senator Ben Cardin (left) and Maryland Attorney General Doug Gansler talk in Lawyer's Mall, near a statue of Thurgood Marshall (October 2007).


Marshall died of heart failure at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, at 2:58 pm on January 24, 1993, at the age of 84. He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery.[28] His second wife and their two sons survived him.
Marshall left all his personal papers and notes to the Library of Congress. The Librarian of Congress, James H. Billington, opened Marshall's papers for immediate use by scholars, journalists and the public, insisting that this was Marshall's intent. The Marshall family and several of his close associates disputed this claim.[29] The decision to make the documents public was supported by the American Library Association.[30] A list of the archived manuscripts is available.[31]
There are numerous memorials to Marshall. One, an eight-foot statue, stands in Lawyers Mall adjacent to the Maryland State House. The statue, dedicated on October 22, 1996, depicts Marshall as a young lawyer and is placed just a few feet away from where the Old Maryland Supreme Court Building stood; the court where Marshall argued discrimination cases leading up to the Brown decision.[32] The primary office building for the federal court system, located on Capitol Hill in Washington D.C., is named in honor of Justice Marshall and contains a statue of him in the atrium. In 1976, Texas Southern University renamed its law school after the sitting justice.[33] In 1980, the University of Maryland School of Law opened a new library which it named the Thurgood Marshall Law Library.[34] In 2000, the historic Twelfth Street YMCA Building located in the Shaw neighborhood of Washington, D.C. was renamed the Thurgood Marshall Center. The major airport serving Baltimore and the Maryland suburbs of Washington, DC, was renamed the Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport on October 1, 2005. The 2009 General Convention of the Episcopal Church added Marshall to the church's liturgical calendar of "Holy Women, Holy Men: Celebrating the Saints," designating May 17 as his feast day.[35] His membership of the Lincoln University fraternity Alpha Phi Alpha is to be memorialized by a sculpture by artist Alvin Pettit in 2013.[36]
The University of California, San Diego, renamed its Third College after Thurgood Marshall in 1993.[37] Marshall Middle School in Olympia, Washington, is also named after Thurgood Marshall, as is Thurgood Marshall Academy in Washington, D.C.
In 2006, Thurgood, a one-man play written by George Stevens, Jr., premiered at the Westport Country Playhouse, starring James Earl Jones and directed by Leonard Foglia.[38] Later it opened Broadway at the Booth Theatre on April 30, 2008, starring Laurence Fishburne.[39] On February 24, 2011, HBO screened a filmed version of the play which Fishburne performed at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. The production was described by the Baltimore Sun as "one of the most frank, informed and searing discussions of race you will ever see on TV.".[40][41] On February 16, 2011, a screening of the film was hosted by the White House as part of its celebrations of Black History Month[42][43] A painting of Justice Thurgood by Chaz Guest currently hangs at the White House.[44][45] Also, a new film titled Marshall, is being made, with actor Chadwick Boseman as Thurgood Marshall, and directed by Reginald Hudlin.[citation needed]
Marriage and family
Marshall was married twice. He married Vivien "Buster" Burey in 1929. After her death in February 1955, Marshall married Cecilia Suyat in December of that year. They were married until he died in 1993, having two sons together:[46] Thurgood Marshall, Jr., a former top aide to President Bill Clinton; and John W. Marshall, a former United States Marshals Service Director and Virginia Secretary of Public Safety.
Thurgood Marshall Award
The Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico instituted[47] in 1993 the annual Thurgood Marshall Award, given to the top student in civil rights at each of Puerto Rico's four law schools. It includes a $500 monetary award. The awardees are selected by the Commonwealth's Attorney General.

About Thurgood Marshall


http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thurgood_Marshall
Thurgood Marshall (July 2, 1908 – January 24, 1993) was an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court, serving from October 1967 until October 1991. Marshall was the Court's 96th justice and its first African-American justice.
Before becoming a judge, Marshall was a lawyer who was best known for his high success rate in arguing before the Supreme Court and for the victory in Brown v. Board of Education, a decision that desegregated public schools. He served on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit after being appointed by President John F. Kennedy and then served as the Solicitor General after being appointed by President Lyndon Johnson in 1965. President Johnson nominated him to the United States Supreme Court in 1967.
Contents  [show]  Early life
Henry Highland Garnet School (P.S. 103), where Marshall attended elementary school Marshall was born in Baltimore, Maryland, on July 2, 1908. He was the great-grandson of a slave who was born in the modern-day Democratic Republic of the Congo;[2][3] his grandfather was also a slave.[4] His original name was Thoroughgood, but he shortened it to Thurgood in second grade because he disliked spelling it. His father, William Marshall, who was a railroad porter, and his mother Norma, a teacher, instilled in him an appreciation for the United States Constitution and the rule of law.[5]
Education Marshall attended Frederick Douglass High School in Baltimore and was placed in the class with the best students. He graduated a year early in 1925 with a B-grade average, and placed in the top third of the class. Subsequently he went to Lincoln University. It is commonly reported that he intended to study medicine and become a dentist. But according to his application to Lincoln University,[6] Marshall stated that his goal was to become a lawyer. Among his classmates were poet Langston Hughes and musician Cab Calloway. Initially he did not take his studies seriously, and was suspended twice for hazing and pranks against fellow students.[7][8] He was not politically active at first, becoming a "star" of the debating team[8] and in his freshman year opposed the integration of African-American professors at the university.[7] Hughes later described him as "rough and ready, loud and wrong".[9] In his second year he got involved in a sit-in protest against segregation at a local movie theatre. In this same year, he was initiated as a member of the first black fraternity, Alpha Phi Alpha.[10] His marriage to Vivien Burey in September 1929 encouraged him to take his studies seriously, and he graduated from Lincoln with honors (cum laude) Bachelor of Arts in Humanities, with a major in American literature and philosophy.[8]
Marshall wanted to study in his hometown law school, the University of Maryland School of Law, but did not apply because of the school's segregation policy. Marshall instead attended Howard University School of Law, where he worked harder than he had at Lincoln and his views on discrimination were heavily influenced by the dean Charles Hamilton Houston.[8] In 1933, he graduated first in his class at Howard.[11]
Marriage and family Marshall was married twice. He married Vivien "Buster" Burey in 1929. After her death in February 1955, Marshall married Cecilia Suyat in December of that year. They were married until he died in 1993, having two sons together:[12] Thurgood Marshall, Jr., a former top aide to President Bill Clinton; and John W. Marshall, a former United States Marshals Service Director and Virginia Secretary of Public Safety.
Law career
Thurgood Marshall in 1936 at the beginning of his career with the NAACP After graduating from law school, Marshall started a private law practice in Baltimore. He began his 25-year affiliation with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1934 by representing the organization in the law school discrimination suit Murray v. Pearson. In 1936, Marshall became part of the national staff of the NAACP.[11]
In Murray v. Pearson, Marshall represented Donald Gaines Murray, a black Amherst College graduate with excellent credentials, who was denied admission to the University of Maryland Law School because of its segregation policy. Black students in Maryland wanting to study law had to attend segregated establishments, Morgan College, the Princess Anne Academy, or out-of-state black institutions. Using the strategy developed by Nathan Margold, Marshall argued that Maryland's segregation policy violated the "separate but equal" doctrine of Plessy v. Ferguson because the state did not provide a comparable educational opportunity at a state-run black institution.[13] The Maryland Court of Appeals ruled against the state of Maryland and its Attorney General, who represented the University of Maryland, stating, "Compliance with the Constitution cannot be deferred at the will of the state. Whatever system is adopted for legal education must furnish equality of treatment now."[14]
Chief Counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund At the age of 32, Marshall won U.S. Supreme Court case Chambers v. Florida, 309 U.S. 227 (1940). That same year, he founded and became the executive director of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund.[15] As the head of the Legal Defense Fund, he argued many other civil rights cases before the Supreme Court, most of them successfully, including Smith v. Allwright, 321 U.S. 649 (1944); Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1 (1948); Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U.S. 629 (1950); and McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents, 339 U.S. 637 (1950). His most famous case as a lawyer was Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), the case in which the Supreme Court ruled that "separate but equal" public education, as established by Plessy v. Ferguson, was not applicable to public education because it could never be truly equal. In total, Marshall won 29 out of the 32 cases he argued before the Supreme Court.
During the 1950s, Thurgood Marshall developed a friendly relationship with J. Edgar Hoover, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In 1956, for example, he privately praised Hoover's campaign to discredit T.R.M. Howard, a maverick civil rights leader from Mississippi. During a national speaking tour, Howard criticized the FBI's failure to seriously investigate cases such as the 1955 killers of George W. Lee and Emmett Till. In a private letter to Hoover, Marshall "attacked Howard as a 'rugged individualist' who did not speak for the NAACP."[16] Two years earlier Howard arranged for Marshall to deliver a well-received speech at a rally of his Regional Council of Negro Leadership in Mound Bayou, Mississippi only days before the Brown decision.[17] According to historians David T. Beito and Linda Royster Beito, "Marshall's disdain for Howard was almost visceral. [He] 'disliked Howard's militant tone and maverick stance' and 'was well aware that Hoover's attack served to take the heat off the NAACP and provided opportunities for closer collaboration [between the NAACP and the FBI] in civil rights.'"[16]
Court of Appeals and Solicitor General President John F. Kennedy appointed Marshall to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in 1961 to a new seat created on May 19, 1961, by 75 Stat. 80. A group of Senators from the South, led by Mississippi's James Eastland, held up his confirmation, so he served for the first several months under a recess appointment. Marshall remained on that court until 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed him to be the United States Solicitor General, the first African American to hold the office.[18] As Solicitor General, he won 14 out of the 19 cases that he argued for the government.
U.S. Supreme Court
Thurgood Marshall photographed in 1967 in the Oval Office On June 13, 1967, President Johnson nominated Marshall to the Supreme Court following the retirement of Justice Tom C. Clark, saying that this was "the right thing to do, the right time to do it, the right man and the right place." Marshall was confirmed as an Associate Justice by a Senate vote of 69–11 on August 30, 1967.[19] He was the 96th person to hold the position, and the first African American. President Johnson confidently predicted to one biographer, Doris Kearns Goodwin, that a lot of black baby boys would be named "Thurgood" in honor of this choice.[20]
Marshall once bluntly described his legal philosophy as this: "You do what you think is right and let the law catch up",[21] a statement which his conservative detractors argued was a sign of his embracement of judicial activism.[22][23]
Marshall served on the Court for the next 24 years, compiling a liberal record that included strong support for Constitutional protection of individual rights, especially the rights of criminal suspects against the government. His most frequent ally on the Court (the pair rarely voted at odds) was Justice William Brennan, who consistently joined him in supporting abortion rights and opposing the death penalty. Brennan and Marshall concluded in Furman v. Georgia that the death penalty was, in all circumstances, unconstitutional, and never accepted the legitimacy of Gregg v. Georgia, which ruled four years later that the death penalty was constitutional in some circumstances. Thereafter, Brennan or Marshall dissented from every denial of certiorari in a capital case and from every decision upholding a sentence of death.[citation needed]
In 1987, Marshall gave a controversial speech on the occasion of the bicentennial celebrations of the Constitution of the United States.[24] Marshall stated:
The government they devised was defective from the start, requiring several amendments, a civil war, and major social transformations to attain the system of constitutional government and its respect for the freedoms and individual rights, we hold as fundamental today.[25]
In conclusion Marshall stated:
Some may more quietly commemorate the suffering, struggle, and sacrifice that has triumphed over much of what was wrong with the original document, and observe the anniversary with hopes not realized and promises not fulfilled. I plan to celebrate the bicentennial of the Constitution as a living document, including the Bill of Rights and the other amendments protecting individual freedoms and human rights.[25]
Although best remembered for jurisprudence in the fields of civil rights and criminal procedure, Marshall made significant contributions to other areas of the law as well. In Teamsters v. Terry, he held that the Seventh Amendment entitled the plaintiff to a jury trial in a suit against a labor union for breach of duty of fair representation. In TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., he articulated a formulation for the standard of materiality in United States securities law that is still applied and used today. In Cottage Savings Association v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, he weighed in on the income tax consequences of the Savings and Loan crisis, permitting a savings and loan association to deduct a loss from an exchange of mortgage participation interests. In Personnel Administrator MA v. Feeney, Marshall wrote a dissent saying that a law that gave hiring preference to veterans over non-veterans was unconstitutional because of its inequitable impact on women.
Among his many law clerks were attorneys who went on to become judges themselves, such as Judge Douglas Ginsburg of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals; Judge Ralph Winter of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit; Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan; as well as notable law professors Dan Kahan, Cass Sunstein, Eben Moglen, Susan Low Bloch, Rick Pildes, Paul Gewirtz, Randall L. Kennedy, and Mark Tushnet (editor of Thurgood Marshall: His Speeches, Writings, Arguments, Opinions and Reminiscences); and law school deans Paul Mahoney of University of Virginia School of Law, Martha Minow of Harvard Law School, and Richard Revesz of New York University School of Law.
Marshall retired from the Supreme Court in 1991 and was reportedly unhappy that it would fall to President George H. W. Bush to name his replacement.[26] Bush nominated Clarence Thomas to replace Marshall.

Marshall died of heart failure at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, at 2:58 pm on January 24, 1993, at the age of 84. He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery.[27] His second wife and their two sons survived him.
Marshall left all his personal papers and notes to the Library of Congress. The Librarian of Congress, James H. Billington, opened Marshall's papers for immediate use by scholars, journalists and the public, insisting that this was Marshall's intent. The Marshall family and several of his close associates disputed this claim.[28] The decision to make the documents public was supported by the American Library Association.[29] A list of the archived manuscripts is available.[30]
U.S. Senator Ben Cardin (left) and Maryland Attorney General Doug Gansler talk in Lawyer's Mall, near a statue of Thurgood Marshall (October 2007). There are numerous memorials to Marshall. One, an eight-foot statue, stands in Lawyers Mall adjacent to the Maryland State House. The statue, dedicated on October 22, 1996, depicts Marshall as a young lawyer and is placed just a few feet away from where the Old Maryland Supreme Court Building stood; the court where Marshall argued discrimination cases leading up to the Brown decision.[31] The primary office building for the federal court system, located on Capitol Hill in Washington D.C., is named in honor of Justice Marshall and contains a statue of him in the atrium. In 1976, Texas Southern University renamed its law school after the sitting justice.[32] In 1980, the University of Maryland School of Law opened a new library which it named the Thurgood Marshall Law Library.[33] In 2000, the historic Twelfth Street YMCA Building located in the Shaw neighborhood of Washington, D.C. was renamed the Thurgood Marshall Center. The major airport serving Baltimore and the Maryland suburbs of Washington, DC, was renamed the Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport on October 1, 2005. The 2009 General Convention of the Episcopal Church added Marshall to the church's liturgical calendar of "Holy Women, Holy Men: Celebrating the Saints," designating May 17 as his feast day.[34] His membership of the Lincoln University fraternity Alpha Phi Alpha is to be memorialized by a sculpture by artist Alvin Pettit in 2013.[35]
The University of California, San Diego, renamed its Third College after Thurgood Marshall in 1993.[36] Marshall Middle School in Olympia, Washington, is also named after Thurgood Marshall, as is Thurgood Marshall Academy in Washington, D.C.
In 2006, Thurgood, a one-man play written by George Stevens, Jr., premiered at the Westport Country Playhouse, starring James Earl Jones and directed by Leonard Foglia.[37] Later it opened Broadway at the Booth Theatre on April 30, 2008, starring Laurence Fishburne.[38] On February 24, 2011, HBO screened a filmed version of the play which Fishburne performed at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. The production was described by the Baltimore Sun as "one of the most frank, informed and searing discussions of race you will ever see on TV.".[39][40] On February 16, 2011, a screening of the film was hosted by the White House as part of its celebrations of Black History Month[41][42] A painting of Justice Thurgood by Chaz Guest currently hangs at the White House.[43][44]
Thurgood Marshall Award The Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico instituted[45] in 1993 the annual Thurgood Marshall Award, given to the top student in civil rights at each of Puerto Rico's four law schools. It includes a $500 monetary award. The awardees are selected by the Commonwealth's Attorney General.

Recently what has happened that my family lives in state A, and I am working in state B. My family could not move to state B because my sone is going to school. I have to pay alot of expenses to go back and fort from state B to A, like air ticket and cab ect. I talking to my compnay regarding this and they said that whatever are my expenses submit to every month end and he will send a check for those expenses which will be pre taxed amount. i.e. if my pre taxed salary is $ 5000 per-month , if I submit expense statemet for $500. Then my employer will send a check of 500 and paystub i.e. direct deposit after applying tax on $4500.   I am not sure whatever he is suggesting is good tyhing to do and it will not have any problem for me.  Go for it, I personally belive it is legal and unlikely to cause any problems with your H1.  Your paystub will still mention salary to be 5000, however it will show $500 in pretax expenses and so 4500 will be the amount deposited and taxed. For H1 purposes, you are still being paid $5000.  One thing I am not sure of: as mentioned in one of the posts above, can this be done more than one year? (i do not know the asnwer to this; clarify with your employer and their attorneys; it is not your headache anyway).  Good Luck. more...from Thurgood Marshall.cdin200007-19  09:57 AMIt depends on the hospital's immigration knowledge. Most of the hospitals in the NY/NJ/CT/MA/CA where there are a lot of immigrants are aware of EAD.  So they prefer EAD over H1/J1 as they can avoid the process of application.  This is from my personal experience. Some states like Maine, New Hampshre are not even aware of EAD. In such hospitals you can take a chance with the expectation of getting a Green card and convince them with the Social security number. Also apply for your social security number once you get your EAD. This really helps if you need to convince the hospital.  Overall having an EAD is a big plus when compared to H1. NEVER go for J1. The waivers are very difficult to get and you'd have a lot of mental tension. I dont think its worth it, if you are planning to stay in USA. My wife stayed home for a year, when she was matched for a J1 hospital. She again applied the next year and got a H1.hair thurgood marshall childhood thurgood marshall quotes.

For the locals, I think we're a lot more flexible. I would suggest a pre-xmas timing (mid to late dec). Right now, the fog on the bay is pretty bad, but toward xmas it usually lightens up. The weather will be chilly (esp. Marin & the seashore), but it never really gets cold here like those of you who have midwest or northeast winters. ;) Hotel rates should also be good. I'm looking forward to meeting any of you who can make it out here!  I've been trying to get the perfect bridge picture for a while, and we can continue that in Marin, and breakfast in Sausalito. We could hit the 'tourist' spots - Coit tower, Market street, pier 39, & the Presidio. If we want to go further afield, there are a host of parks and beaches immediately available. Point Reyes National Seashore is a two & a half hour drive north from SF. Tule Elk, shorebirds and sea lions. Point Ano Nuevo is an hour and a half south. Elephant Seals, birds and deer. I'm game for anything. I'm sure QJ will come up with an even better list and then we can discuss.girlfriend up the Thurgood Marshall thurgood marshall quotes.

As your own analysis shows -- the different sections of the bill need to be analyzed together.  Hold on to your horses.  best, Berkeleybeerock58107-18  01:38 AMWe filed I-140 on july 16th thru labour substitution. Expecting a receipt by july ending.Now I have a very serious concern regarding I-485 filing before Aug 17 2007, pls advice !!  My spouse is in india from August 17 2006 after already staying in US on H1B for 6 years.He's planning to come back here on dependant visa(L2) after 1 year out of country stay as he wants to reset his H1B clock (He plans to apply H1B in April 2008 quota).  If we want to apply for I-485 he needs to come here atleast by Aug 10 2007- to fulfill the medicals & sign the documents, to file by Aug 17th 2007 deadline. We are afraid to take chances this time, that if he just enters US before 1 year out of country stay, he may not be eligible for new H1B in 2008, if somthing happens to current filing.  Pls sincerely advice if he can still apply for H1B in April 2008, if he just missed 365 days out of country rule by 6 or 7 days (incase he comes back on Aug 10th 2007 for filing, he would fulfill 360 days out of country and not 365 as needed) ?

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Where you see wrong or inequality or injustice, speak out, because this is your country. This is your democracy. Make it. Protect it. Pass it on.
Thurgood Marshall


Speak,
Democracy,
Injustice



















None of us got where we are solely by pulling ourselves up by our bootstraps. We got here because somebody - a parent, a teacher, an Ivy League crony or a few nuns - bent down and helped us pick up our boots.
Thurgood Marshall


Teacher,
Parent,
Down
























I have a lifetime appointment and I intend to serve it. I expect to die at 110, shot by a jealous husband.
Thurgood Marshall


Husband,
Jealous,
Die



















Each of you, as an individual, must pick your own goals. Listen to others, but do not become a blind follower.
Thurgood Marshall


Goals,
You,
Blind



















In recognizing the humanity of our fellow beings, we pay ourselves the highest tribute.
Thurgood Marshall


Humanity,
Pay,
Tribute



















Today's Constitution is a realistic document of freedom only because of several corrective amendments. Those amendments speak to a sense of decency and fairness that I and other Blacks cherish.
Thurgood Marshall


Freedom,
Today,
Speak



















This is a great country, but fortunately for you, it is not perfect. There is much to be done to bring about complete equality. Remove hunger. Bring reality closer to theory and democratic principles.
Thurgood Marshall


Great,
Equality,
Not Perfect



















We deal here with the right of all of our children, whatever their race, to an equal start in life and to an equal opportunity to reach their full potential as citizens. Those children who have been denied that right in the past deserve better than to see fences thrown up to deny them that right in the future.
Thurgood Marshall


Life,
Future,
Children



















A child born to a Black mother in a state like Mississippi... has exactly the same rights as a white baby born to the wealthiest person in the United States. It's not true, but I challenge anyone to say it is not a goal worth working for.
Thurgood Marshall


Mother,
Challenge,
Goal
























Our whole constitutional heritage rebels at the thought of giving government the power to control men's minds.
Thurgood Marshall


Power,
Politics,
Men



















I never worked hard until I got to the Howard Law School and met Charlie Houston... I saw this man's dedication, his vision, his willingness to sacrifice, and I told myself, 'You either shape up or ship out.' When you are being challenged by a great human being, you know that you can't ship out.
Thurgood Marshall


Myself,
Great,
Vision



















Ending racial discrimination in jury selection can be accomplished only by eliminating peremptory challenges entirely.
Thurgood Marshall


Challenges,
Ending,
Jury



















What is the quality of your intent?
Thurgood Marshall


Quality,
Intent,
Your



















Surely the fact that a uniformed police officer is wearing his hair below his collar will make him no less identifiable as a policeman.
Thurgood Marshall


Hair,
Police,
Him



















Mere access to the courthouse doors does not by itself assure a proper functioning of the adversary process.
Thurgood Marshall


Process,
Doors,
Itself
























If the First Amendment means anything, it means that a state has no business telling a man, sitting alone in his house, what books he may read or what films he may watch.
Thurgood Marshall


Business,
Alone,
Man



















Sometimes history takes things into its own hands.
Thurgood Marshall


History,
Hands,
Sometimes



















It is important that the strongest pressures against the continuation of segregation, North or South, be continually and constantly manifested. Probably, as much as anything else, this is the key in the elimination of discrimination in the United States.
Thurgood Marshall


Important,
Discrimination



















Deciding not to decide is, of course, among the most important things done by the Supreme Court. It takes a lot of doing, but it can be done.
Thurgood Marshall


Important,
Done,
Doing



















We could get more action in the South because the Negroes had a feeling that they were being oppressed. But you take New York, for example: they'd give Negroes little five-cent jobs here and there - and they thought they had something. And the same in Chicago and any of the metropolitan areas.
Thurgood Marshall


Action,
Thought,
Chicago



















'Black' is an adjective, in my book, and the way I use it, sometimes I'll say 'black people.' But if I'm talking about a person, I'm going to say 'a Negro,' because I was taught to say that, and I don't see any reason to change it. I don't think that gives pride or anything else. I don't think you get pride by calling yourself this or that.
Thurgood Marshall


Change,
Yourself,
Pride



















It was taken for granted that we had to make something of ourselves. Not much was said about it; it was just in the atmosphere of the home.
Thurgood Marshall


Home,
Said,
Something
























My father had a flat rule. He believed that every man's house was his castle. He had a flat rule: no man could come in his house without his permission.
Thurgood Marshall


Father,
Man,
House



















When you hear a lot of stories about Africa, and you get to a place like Kenya and other countries like that, where they think the same way we do, I was happy to find that the Schedule of Rights that I drew for the Kenyan Government was working very well.
Thurgood Marshall


Happy,
Government,
Working



















As soon as I reach any town, I talk to the shoe-shine boys or the barbers or the people in the restaurants, because it's Mr. Joe Doakes who is very close to reality.
Thurgood Marshall


Reality,
People,
Reach
