Orthopedic Indications






Muscle injury due to total hip replacement
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common orthopedic problem affecting 10% of the population, half of them suffering from osteoarthritic changes in the hips. The only therapy for hip OA that has been proven to significantly decrease pain for the patient is the implantation of a total prosthesis, which means the replacement of both parts of the hip joint (acetabulum and femoral head) with prosthetic implants. Proper muscle function is crucial for the stabilization of the pelvis and early postoperative mobilization, which is strongly associated with improved patient outcomes. It is known that the poor functional outcome often seen following total hip replacement is particularly prevalent in older and overweight patients, and the poor outcome is presumed to have a muscular basis. It is our belief that cell therapies could significantly improve post-surgical outcomes for these patients by improving muscle regeneration.

Critical Limb Ischemia






In Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI), fatty deposits block arteries in the leg, leading to greatly reduced blood flow. This causes leg pain at rest, non-healing ulcers and gangrene. Patients with CLI are at an immediate risk for limb amputation and death. It is estimated that there are two million people in the United States with CLI, and this number is projected to grow to almost 2.8 million by 2020. In Western Europe, 3 million people have CLI. Reflecting the ageing population, and the increasing rate of diabetes, this number is projected to grow to 4 million by 2030.
While some non-surgical treatments exist to relieve pain and provide local ulcer care, most patients will ultimately need revascularization with vascular bypass surgery or an endovascular procedure to try to prevent a major limb amputation and prolong survival. Many patients, however, are not suitable candidates for revascularization, and have amputation rates of up to 39% at 6 months from diagnosis.
In view of the lack of suitable therapeutic options for the growing population of CLI patients, new approaches are warranted in order to reduce the number of amputations and their impact on quality of life and on life expectancy.

Acute Radiation Syndrome






Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS) is caused by exposure to a high dose of ionizing radiation over a short period of time, such as could occur after the meltdown of a nuclear reactor or the detonation of a “dirty bomb”. The acute signs and symptoms classically affect the hematologic, gastrointestinal, skin and central nervous systems.
The hematologic syndrome of ARS is characterized by severe decreases in the numbers of platelets and red and white blood cells due to the destruction of the bone marrow progenitor cells which produce these cells. Low numbers of these cells can result in uncontrollable bleeding, anemia, severe infection and death. PLX-R18 is being studied in collaboration with the U.S. National Institutes of Health’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) as a treatment for the hematological syndrome of ARS.

PLX Products






PLacental eXpanded (PLX) cells are placenta-derived, mesenchymal-like adherent stromal cells that are designed to be administered to patients without the need for tissue or genetic matching. These cells release soluble biomolecules, such as cytokines, chemokines and growth factors, which act in a paracrine or endocrine manner to facilitate healing of damaged tissue by stimulating the body’s own regenerative mechanisms.
PLX-PAD
PLX-PAD cells respond to chemical distress signals from tissues that have been damaged by ischemia (inadequate blood flow), muscle trauma, or inflammation, by secreting a range of therapeutic proteins that trigger the body’s own repair mechanisms. These secreted proteins drive the body to grow collateral blood vessels to bring oxygenated blood to ischemic tissue, heal damaged muscle, and dampen inflammation. PLX-PAD cells also modulate the immune system, which plays a central role in the body’s response to injuries.
PLX-PAD is being developed in clinical trials for Critical Limb Ischemia via accelerated regulatory pathways in both Europe and Japan. Pre-marketing “pivotal” trials are expected to start in both regions in 2016. Two completed Phase I trials of PLX-PAD in Critical Limb Ischemia produced positive results, and a randomized, double-blind Phase II study has demonstrated the safety and potential efficacy of PLX-PAD in treating muscle injury in the context of hip replacement surgery. The cells are also being studied in an ongoing Phase II trial in Intermittent Claudication, and are being evaluated for other indications including Preeclampsia.

PLX-R18 cells release a combination of therapeutic proteins in response to a damaged or poorly functioning hematopoietic system; this system creates the blood cells that protect us from infection, uncontrolled bleeding and anemia. The product is currently in development to treat incomplete engraftment of transplanted hematopoietic cells, and Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS). The U.S. National Institutes of Health’s NIAID is initiating dose evaluation studies of PLX-R18 in ARS as a basis for a potential pre-marketing trial in a large animal model. Positive data from that trial could allow Pluristem to apply for approval of PLX-R18 in this indication using the Animal Rule regulatory pathway. PLX-R18 is also being evaluated in preclinical studies to explore its therapeutic potential to treat a variety of other hematologic indications.

Corporate history[edit]
Pluristem was founded in 2001 by Shai Meretzki of the Technion, who made use of a stem cell patent which was developed during his Ph.D studies at The Rappaport Faculty Of Medicine, Technion, under the supervision of Dr. Shosh Merchav, together with Professors Dov Zipori and Avinoam Kadouri from the Weizmann Institute of Science.[5][6] In 2003, the NASDAQ-listed shell company A1 Software acquired all shares and patents belonging to Pluristem and changed its name to Pluristem Life Systems.[7][8] In 2007 the name was changed again, this time to Pluristem Therapeutics Inc.[5] Pluristem's shares are traded on the NASDAQ exchange and the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, as well as on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.
In 2007 Pluristem entered into a collaborative research agreement with the Charité medical school in Berlin for a period of five years. In 2012 Pluristem announced that the agreement had been renewed until 2017.[9] Pluristem was awarded an NIS9 million (US$2.4 million) grant from the Office of the Chief Scientist of Israel in January 2012.[10] In April of the same year the company announced the receipt of an additional grant from the Chief Scientist, this time of NIS11.8 million (US$3.2 million).[11][12]
In August of 2016, Europe’s Horizon 2020 Program awarded Pluristem an $8 million grant to cover a portion of its expenses in Europe for Pluristem’s Phase III study of PLX-PAD cells in the treatment of critical limb ischemia.[13]
Products[edit]
Pluristem is in the process of clinically testing the use of its PLX (PLacental eXpanded) cells in Phase I, Phase II and Phase III trials. A Phase III trial of PLX-(PAD)-peripheral arterial disease cells in the treatment of critical limb ischemia has been cleared to start enrolling patients by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.]The Phase III trial has also been cleared by regulators in Germany and the United Kingdom. Pluristem has completed enrollment of 172 patients in January of 2017 for a multinational Phase II clinical trial of its PLX-PAD treatment pertaining to intermittent claudication. Top line results are expected early in 2018. On October 27, 2014, it was reported that Case Western Reserve University will conduct a preclinical study of PLX-R18 cells in umbilical cord blood transplants for the treatment of blood cancers and genetic diseases.[15] Results from the study suggest that PLX-R18 is safe and may significantly improve outcomes after bone marrow failure or hematopoietic cell transplantation. The US FDA has also cleared Pluristem to commence patient enrollment in a Phase I trial of its PLX-R18 cells to treat insufficient hematopoietic recovery following bone marrow transplant.
The U.S. National Institutes of Health is currently evaluating Pluristem’s PLX-R18 cells as a treatment for acute radiation syndrome.[14] The dose finding portion of the study was successfully concluded and data showed that PLX-R18 treated subjects had an 85% survival rate compared to the placebo group which had a 50% survival rate. PLX-R18 can serve as a tool for governments to protect their citizens against potential exposure to nuclear radiation.[15]
The USFDA has conferred orphan drug status on Pluristem's PLX cells for the treatment of Buerger's disease (2011) and aplastic anemia (2013).[16]
Human applications[edit]
In May 2012, Pluristem reported that its experimental PLacental eXpanded cells were injected into the muscles of a 7-year-old Romanian girl undergoing treatment for bone marrow aplasia disease at the Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem. The girl had undergone two allogenic stem cell transplants since being admitted in August 2011, both of which failed to improve her condition. Two months thereafter, with the patient's condition deteriorating rapidly, the Director of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Cell Therapy and Transplantation Research Center at Hadassah felt that all available options had been exhausted and turned to Pluristem's PLX cells. The Helsinki committee at Israel's Ministry of Health approved the procedure under compassionate use. According to Pluristem CEO Zami Aberman, it was the first time ever that stem cells were injected into the muscle rather than into the body's blood system. Pluristem announced that the treatment led to a significant increase in the girl's red cells, white cells and platelets, effecting a reverse in her condition.[16][17][18][19][20] She was released from the hospital soon after Pluristem's announcement.[21]
In September 2012 Pluristem reported saving the life of a third bone marrow disease patient using its PLacental eXpanded cell treatment, again at Jerusalem's Hadassah Medical Center and again under the terms of compassionate use. The 45-year-old patient suffered from acute myeloid leukemia and pancytopenia, and his condition was determined to be life-threatening. After two intramuscular injections of Pluristem's PLX cells, the patient's condition improved significantly and he was released from the hospital.[22] This event has been used as a supporting reference to the medical potential of the PLX cells.
In January 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave Pluristem Therapeutics, the go-ahead to move forward with its innovative treatment approach for hematopoietic disorders. Pluristem was given permission to begin its Phase I trial of PLX-R18 cells to treat incomplete hematopoietic recovery following Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation. The clinical trial is expected to begin in the coming months.[2]
Later in 2016, Pluristem announced it had partnered with Japan's Fukushima Medical University to test its placental-derived cellular therapy for radiation treatment and has been asked to join the United States National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases program.[23]

Corporate history[edit]
Pluristem was founded in 2001 by Shai Meretzki of the Technion, who made use of a stem cell patent which was developed during his Ph.D studies at The Rappaport Faculty Of Medicine, Technion, under the supervision of Dr. Shosh Merchav, together with Professors Dov Zipori and Avinoam Kadouri from the Weizmann Institute of Science.[5][6] In 2003, the NASDAQ-listed shell company A1 Software acquired all shares and patents belonging to Pluristem and changed its name to Pluristem Life Systems.[7][8] In 2007 the name was changed again, this time to Pluristem Therapeutics Inc.[5] Pluristem's shares are traded on the NASDAQ exchange and the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, as well as on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.
In 2007 Pluristem entered into a collaborative research agreement with the Charité medical school in Berlin for a period of five years. In 2012 Pluristem announced that the agreement had been renewed until 2017.[9] Pluristem was awarded an NIS9 million (US$2.4 million) grant from the Office of the Chief Scientist of Israel in January 2012.[10] In April of the same year the company announced the receipt of an additional grant from the Chief Scientist, this time of NIS11.8 million (US$3.2 million).[11][12]
In August of 2016, Europe’s Horizon 2020 Program awarded Pluristem an $8 million grant to cover a portion of its expenses in Europe for Pluristem’s Phase III study of PLX-PAD cells in the treatment of critical limb ischemia.[13]
Products[edit]
Pluristem is in the process of clinically testing the use of its PLX (PLacental eXpanded) cells in Phase I, Phase II and Phase III trials. A Phase III trial of PLX-(PAD)-peripheral arterial disease cells in the treatment of critical limb ischemia has been cleared to start enrolling patients by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.]The Phase III trial has also been cleared by regulators in Germany and the United Kingdom. Pluristem has completed enrollment of 172 patients in January of 2017 for a multinational Phase II clinical trial of its PLX-PAD treatment pertaining to intermittent claudication. Top line results are expected early in 2018. On October 27, 2014, it was reported that Case Western Reserve University will conduct a preclinical study of PLX-R18 cells in umbilical cord blood transplants for the treatment of blood cancers and genetic diseases.[15] Results from the study suggest that PLX-R18 is safe and may significantly improve outcomes after bone marrow failure or hematopoietic cell transplantation. The US FDA has also cleared Pluristem to commence patient enrollment in a Phase I trial of its PLX-R18 cells to treat insufficient hematopoietic recovery following bone marrow transplant.
The U.S. National Institutes of Health is currently evaluating Pluristem’s PLX-R18 cells as a treatment for acute radiation syndrome.[14] The dose finding portion of the study was successfully concluded and data showed that PLX-R18 treated subjects had an 85% survival rate compared to the placebo group which had a 50% survival rate. PLX-R18 can serve as a tool for governments to protect their citizens against potential exposure to nuclear radiation.[15]
The USFDA has conferred orphan drug status on Pluristem's PLX cells for the treatment of Buerger's disease (2011) and aplastic anemia (2013).[16]
Human applications[edit]
In May 2012, Pluristem reported that its experimental PLacental eXpanded cells were injected into the muscles of a 7-year-old Romanian girl undergoing treatment for bone marrow aplasia disease at the Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem. The girl had undergone two allogenic stem cell transplants since being admitted in August 2011, both of which failed to improve her condition. Two months thereafter, with the patient's condition deteriorating rapidly, the Director of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Cell Therapy and Transplantation Research Center at Hadassah felt that all available options had been exhausted and turned to Pluristem's PLX cells. The Helsinki committee at Israel's Ministry of Health approved the procedure under compassionate use. According to Pluristem CEO Zami Aberman, it was the first time ever that stem cells were injected into the muscle rather than into the body's blood system. Pluristem announced that the treatment led to a significant increase in the girl's red cells, white cells and platelets, effecting a reverse in her condition.[16][17][18][19][20] She was released from the hospital soon after Pluristem's announcement.[21]
In September 2012 Pluristem reported saving the life of a third bone marrow disease patient using its PLacental eXpanded cell treatment, again at Jerusalem's Hadassah Medical Center and again under the terms of compassionate use. The 45-year-old patient suffered from acute myeloid leukemia and pancytopenia, and his condition was determined to be life-threatening. After two intramuscular injections of Pluristem's PLX cells, the patient's condition improved significantly and he was released from the hospital.[22] This event has been used as a supporting reference to the medical potential of the PLX cells.
In January 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave Pluristem Therapeutics, the go-ahead to move forward with its innovative treatment approach for hematopoietic disorders. Pluristem was given permission to begin its Phase I trial of PLX-R18 cells to treat incomplete hematopoietic recovery following Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation. The clinical trial is expected to begin in the coming months.[2]
Later in 2016, Pluristem announced it had partnered with Japan's Fukushima Medical University to test its placental-derived cellular therapy for radiation treatment and has been asked to join the United States National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases program.[23]

					Full Description



Pluristem Therapeutics Inc., incorporated on May 10, 2001, is a developer of placenta-based cell therapy product candidates for the treatment of multiple ischemic, inflammatory and hematologic conditions. The Company's lead indications are critical limb ischemia (CLI), recovery after surgery for femoral neck fracture and acute radiation syndrome. The Company's operations are focused on the research, development, clinical trials and manufacturing of cell therapeutics and related technologies. The Company's products include PLX-PAD and PLX R18. The Company's PLX cells are adherent stromal cells (ASCs) that are expanded using a three dimensional (3D) process. The system utilizes a synthetic scaffold to create an artificial 3D environment where placental-derived stromal cells can grow. The Company's PLX products are administered using a standard needle and syringe. The Company's PLX products are in clinical-stage development for multiple indications, such as cardiovascular, orthopedic, pulmonary and women's health diseases.The Company is investigating using PLX-PAD cells for treatments for various stages of peripheral arterial disease, from early-stage intermittent claudication (IC) to advanced CLI. As of June 30, 2016, the Company completed two Phase I safety/dose-finding clinical trials for CLI, one in the United States and one in Germany. The Company is conducting a Phase I/II, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study to assess the safety and efficacy of intramuscular injections of allogeneic PLX PAD cells for the regeneration of injured gluteal musculature after total hip replacement, in Germany. The Company focuses on pursuing the development of PLX-R18 in the treatment of recovery following Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). As of June 30, 2016, the Company had conducted several in-vivo studies for the evaluation of PLX-R18 for the treatment of Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS).The Company competes with Athersys, Inc., Capricor Therapeutics, Inc., Celgene Corporation, ReNeuron Group plc, Tigenix NV, SanBio Inc., Healios K.K., Cytori Therapeutics, Green Cross Cell Corp. and Mesoblast LTD.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Corporate history[edit]
Pluristem was founded in 2001 by Shai Meretzki of the Technion, who made use of a stem cell patent which was developed during his Ph.D studies at The Rappaport Faculty Of Medicine, Technion, under the supervision of Dr. Shosh Merchav, together with Professors Dov Zipori and Avinoam Kadouri from the Weizmann Institute of Science.[5][6] In 2003, the NASDAQ-listed shell company A1 Software acquired all shares and patents belonging to Pluristem and changed its name to Pluristem Life Systems.[7][8] In 2007 the name was changed again, this time to Pluristem Therapeutics Inc.[5] Pluristem's shares are traded on the NASDAQ exchange and the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, as well as on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.
In 2007 Pluristem entered into a collaborative research agreement with the Charité medical school in Berlin for a period of five years. In 2012 Pluristem announced that the agreement had been renewed until 2017.[9] Pluristem was awarded an NIS9 million (US$2.4 million) grant from the Office of the Chief Scientist of Israel in January 2012.[10] In April of the same year the company announced the receipt of an additional grant from the Chief Scientist, this time of NIS11.8 million (US$3.2 million).[11][12]
In August of 2016, Europe’s Horizon 2020 Program awarded Pluristem an $8 million grant to cover a portion of its expenses in Europe for Pluristem’s Phase III study of PLX-PAD cells in the treatment of critical limb ischemia.[13]
Products[edit]
Pluristem is in the process of clinically testing the use of its PLX (PLacental eXpanded) cells in Phase I, Phase II and Phase III trials. A Phase III trial of PLX-(PAD)-peripheral arterial disease cells in the treatment of critical limb ischemia has been cleared to start enrolling patients by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.]The Phase III trial has also been cleared by regulators in Germany and the United Kingdom. Pluristem has completed enrollment of 172 patients in January of 2017 for a multinational Phase II clinical trial of its PLX-PAD treatment pertaining to intermittent claudication. Top line results are expected early in 2018. On October 27, 2014, it was reported that Case Western Reserve University will conduct a preclinical study of PLX-R18 cells in umbilical cord blood transplants for the treatment of blood cancers and genetic diseases.[15] Results from the study suggest that PLX-R18 is safe and may significantly improve outcomes after bone marrow failure or hematopoietic cell transplantation. The US FDA has also cleared Pluristem to commence patient enrollment in a Phase I trial of its PLX-R18 cells to treat insufficient hematopoietic recovery following bone marrow transplant.
The U.S. National Institutes of Health is currently evaluating Pluristem’s PLX-R18 cells as a treatment for acute radiation syndrome.[14] The dose finding portion of the study was successfully concluded and data showed that PLX-R18 treated subjects had an 85% survival rate compared to the placebo group which had a 50% survival rate. PLX-R18 can serve as a tool for governments to protect their citizens against potential exposure to nuclear radiation.[15]
The USFDA has conferred orphan drug status on Pluristem's PLX cells for the treatment of Buerger's disease (2011) and aplastic anemia (2013).[16]
Human applications[edit]
In May 2012, Pluristem reported that its experimental PLacental eXpanded cells were injected into the muscles of a 7-year-old Romanian girl undergoing treatment for bone marrow aplasia disease at the Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem. The girl had undergone two allogenic stem cell transplants since being admitted in August 2011, both of which failed to improve her condition. Two months thereafter, with the patient's condition deteriorating rapidly, the Director of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Cell Therapy and Transplantation Research Center at Hadassah felt that all available options had been exhausted and turned to Pluristem's PLX cells. The Helsinki committee at Israel's Ministry of Health approved the procedure under compassionate use. According to Pluristem CEO Zami Aberman, it was the first time ever that stem cells were injected into the muscle rather than into the body's blood system. Pluristem announced that the treatment led to a significant increase in the girl's red cells, white cells and platelets, effecting a reverse in her condition.[16][17][18][19][20] She was released from the hospital soon after Pluristem's announcement.[21]
In September 2012 Pluristem reported saving the life of a third bone marrow disease patient using its PLacental eXpanded cell treatment, again at Jerusalem's Hadassah Medical Center and again under the terms of compassionate use. The 45-year-old patient suffered from acute myeloid leukemia and pancytopenia, and his condition was determined to be life-threatening. After two intramuscular injections of Pluristem's PLX cells, the patient's condition improved significantly and he was released from the hospital.[22] This event has been used as a supporting reference to the medical potential of the PLX cells.
In January 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave Pluristem Therapeutics, the go-ahead to move forward with its innovative treatment approach for hematopoietic disorders. Pluristem was given permission to begin its Phase I trial of PLX-R18 cells to treat incomplete hematopoietic recovery following Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation. The clinical trial is expected to begin in the coming months.[2]
Later in 2016, Pluristem announced it had partnered with Japan's Fukushima Medical University to test its placental-derived cellular therapy for radiation treatment and has been asked to join the United States National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases program.[23]

Corporate history[edit]
Pluristem was founded in 2001 by Shai Meretzki of the Technion, who made use of a stem cell patent which was developed during his Ph.D studies at The Rappaport Faculty Of Medicine, Technion, under the supervision of Dr. Shosh Merchav, together with Professors Dov Zipori and Avinoam Kadouri from the Weizmann Institute of Science.[5][6] In 2003, the NASDAQ-listed shell company A1 Software acquired all shares and patents belonging to Pluristem and changed its name to Pluristem Life Systems.[7][8] In 2007 the name was changed again, this time to Pluristem Therapeutics Inc.[5] Pluristem's shares are traded on the NASDAQ exchange and the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, as well as on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.
In 2007 Pluristem entered into a collaborative research agreement with the Charité medical school in Berlin for a period of five years. In 2012 Pluristem announced that the agreement had been renewed until 2017.[9] Pluristem was awarded an NIS9 million (US$2.4 million) grant from the Office of the Chief Scientist of Israel in January 2012.[10] In April of the same year the company announced the receipt of an additional grant from the Chief Scientist, this time of NIS11.8 million (US$3.2 million).[11][12]
In August of 2016, Europe’s Horizon 2020 Program awarded Pluristem an $8 million grant to cover a portion of its expenses in Europe for Pluristem’s Phase III study of PLX-PAD cells in the treatment of critical limb ischemia.[13]
Products[edit]
Pluristem is in the process of clinically testing the use of its PLX (PLacental eXpanded) cells in Phase I, Phase II and Phase III trials. A Phase III trial of PLX-(PAD)-peripheral arterial disease cells in the treatment of critical limb ischemia has been cleared to start enrolling patients by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.]The Phase III trial has also been cleared by regulators in Germany and the United Kingdom. Pluristem has completed enrollment of 172 patients in January of 2017 for a multinational Phase II clinical trial of its PLX-PAD treatment pertaining to intermittent claudication. Top line results are expected early in 2018. On October 27, 2014, it was reported that Case Western Reserve University will conduct a preclinical study of PLX-R18 cells in umbilical cord blood transplants for the treatment of blood cancers and genetic diseases.[15] Results from the study suggest that PLX-R18 is safe and may significantly improve outcomes after bone marrow failure or hematopoietic cell transplantation. The US FDA has also cleared Pluristem to commence patient enrollment in a Phase I trial of its PLX-R18 cells to treat insufficient hematopoietic recovery following bone marrow transplant.
The U.S. National Institutes of Health is currently evaluating Pluristem’s PLX-R18 cells as a treatment for acute radiation syndrome.[14] The dose finding portion of the study was successfully concluded and data showed that PLX-R18 treated subjects had an 85% survival rate compared to the placebo group which had a 50% survival rate. PLX-R18 can serve as a tool for governments to protect their citizens against potential exposure to nuclear radiation.[15]
The USFDA has conferred orphan drug status on Pluristem's PLX cells for the treatment of Buerger's disease (2011) and aplastic anemia (2013).[16]
Human applications[edit]
In May 2012, Pluristem reported that its experimental PLacental eXpanded cells were injected into the muscles of a 7-year-old Romanian girl undergoing treatment for bone marrow aplasia disease at the Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem. The girl had undergone two allogenic stem cell transplants since being admitted in August 2011, both of which failed to improve her condition. Two months thereafter, with the patient's condition deteriorating rapidly, the Director of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Cell Therapy and Transplantation Research Center at Hadassah felt that all available options had been exhausted and turned to Pluristem's PLX cells. The Helsinki committee at Israel's Ministry of Health approved the procedure under compassionate use. According to Pluristem CEO Zami Aberman, it was the first time ever that stem cells were injected into the muscle rather than into the body's blood system. Pluristem announced that the treatment led to a significant increase in the girl's red cells, white cells and platelets, effecting a reverse in her condition.[16][17][18][19][20] She was released from the hospital soon after Pluristem's announcement.[21]
In September 2012 Pluristem reported saving the life of a third bone marrow disease patient using its PLacental eXpanded cell treatment, again at Jerusalem's Hadassah Medical Center and again under the terms of compassionate use. The 45-year-old patient suffered from acute myeloid leukemia and pancytopenia, and his condition was determined to be life-threatening. After two intramuscular injections of Pluristem's PLX cells, the patient's condition improved significantly and he was released from the hospital.[22] This event has been used as a supporting reference to the medical potential of the PLX cells.
In January 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave Pluristem Therapeutics, the go-ahead to move forward with its innovative treatment approach for hematopoietic disorders. Pluristem was given permission to begin its Phase I trial of PLX-R18 cells to treat incomplete hematopoietic recovery following Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation. The clinical trial is expected to begin in the coming months.[2]
Later in 2016, Pluristem announced it had partnered with Japan's Fukushima Medical University to test its placental-derived cellular therapy for radiation treatment and has been asked to join the United States National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases program.[23]

Corporate history[edit]
Pluristem was founded in 2001 by Shai Meretzki of the Technion, who made use of a stem cell patent which was developed during his Ph.D studies at The Rappaport Faculty Of Medicine, Technion, under the supervision of Dr. Shosh Merchav, together with Professors Dov Zipori and Avinoam Kadouri from the Weizmann Institute of Science.[5][6] In 2003, the NASDAQ-listed shell company A1 Software acquired all shares and patents belonging to Pluristem and changed its name to Pluristem Life Systems.[7][8] In 2007 the name was changed again, this time to Pluristem Therapeutics Inc.[5] Pluristem's shares are traded on the NASDAQ exchange and the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, as well as on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.
In 2007 Pluristem entered into a collaborative research agreement with the Charité medical school in Berlin for a period of five years. In 2012 Pluristem announced that the agreement had been renewed until 2017.[9] Pluristem was awarded an NIS9 million (US$2.4 million) grant from the Office of the Chief Scientist of Israel in January 2012.[10] In April of the same year the company announced the receipt of an additional grant from the Chief Scientist, this time of NIS11.8 million (US$3.2 million).[11][12]
In August of 2016, Europe’s Horizon 2020 Program awarded Pluristem an $8 million grant to cover a portion of its expenses in Europe for Pluristem’s Phase III study of PLX-PAD cells in the treatment of critical limb ischemia.[13]
Products[edit]
Pluristem is in the process of clinically testing the use of its PLX (PLacental eXpanded) cells in Phase I, Phase II and Phase III trials. A Phase III trial of PLX-(PAD)-peripheral arterial disease cells in the treatment of critical limb ischemia has been cleared to start enrolling patients by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.]The Phase III trial has also been cleared by regulators in Germany and the United Kingdom. Pluristem has completed enrollment of 172 patients in January of 2017 for a multinational Phase II clinical trial of its PLX-PAD treatment pertaining to intermittent claudication. Top line results are expected early in 2018. On October 27, 2014, it was reported that Case Western Reserve University will conduct a preclinical study of PLX-R18 cells in umbilical cord blood transplants for the treatment of blood cancers and genetic diseases.[15] Results from the study suggest that PLX-R18 is safe and may significantly improve outcomes after bone marrow failure or hematopoietic cell transplantation. The US FDA has also cleared Pluristem to commence patient enrollment in a Phase I trial of its PLX-R18 cells to treat insufficient hematopoietic recovery following bone marrow transplant.
The U.S. National Institutes of Health is currently evaluating Pluristem’s PLX-R18 cells as a treatment for acute radiation syndrome.[14] The dose finding portion of the study was successfully concluded and data showed that PLX-R18 treated subjects had an 85% survival rate compared to the placebo group which had a 50% survival rate. PLX-R18 can serve as a tool for governments to protect their citizens against potential exposure to nuclear radiation.[15]
The USFDA has conferred orphan drug status on Pluristem's PLX cells for the treatment of Buerger's disease (2011) and aplastic anemia (2013).[16]
Human applications[edit]
In May 2012, Pluristem reported that its experimental PLacental eXpanded cells were injected into the muscles of a 7-year-old Romanian girl undergoing treatment for bone marrow aplasia disease at the Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem. The girl had undergone two allogenic stem cell transplants since being admitted in August 2011, both of which failed to improve her condition. Two months thereafter, with the patient's condition deteriorating rapidly, the Director of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Cell Therapy and Transplantation Research Center at Hadassah felt that all available options had been exhausted and turned to Pluristem's PLX cells. The Helsinki committee at Israel's Ministry of Health approved the procedure under compassionate use. According to Pluristem CEO Zami Aberman, it was the first time ever that stem cells were injected into the muscle rather than into the body's blood system. Pluristem announced that the treatment led to a significant increase in the girl's red cells, white cells and platelets, effecting a reverse in her condition.[16][17][18][19][20] She was released from the hospital soon after Pluristem's announcement.[21]
In September 2012 Pluristem reported saving the life of a third bone marrow disease patient using its PLacental eXpanded cell treatment, again at Jerusalem's Hadassah Medical Center and again under the terms of compassionate use. The 45-year-old patient suffered from acute myeloid leukemia and pancytopenia, and his condition was determined to be life-threatening. After two intramuscular injections of Pluristem's PLX cells, the patient's condition improved significantly and he was released from the hospital.[22] This event has been used as a supporting reference to the medical potential of the PLX cells.
In January 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave Pluristem Therapeutics, the go-ahead to move forward with its innovative treatment approach for hematopoietic disorders. Pluristem was given permission to begin its Phase I trial of PLX-R18 cells to treat incomplete hematopoietic recovery following Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation. The clinical trial is expected to begin in the coming months.[2]
Later in 2016, Pluristem announced it had partnered with Japan's Fukushima Medical University to test its placental-derived cellular therapy for radiation treatment and has been asked to join the United States National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases program.[23]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
