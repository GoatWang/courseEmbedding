1Forbes rates funds separately in both up and down market cycles. Funds are rated against their peers and are awarded letter grades (A+ to F) based on peformance in bull and bear markets. Market cycles are defined by an index or blend of indices. Stock funds, for example, are rated and benchmarked over four bullish and bearish cycles using the S&P 500 as a benchmark. The peformance benchmark for Balanced funds is a 50/50 blended index of the S&P 500 and the Merrill Lynch corporate/government bond index. Most bond funds are rated for five years, with each month treated as either a bullish or bearish month. Exception: taxable junk bond funds, which are presently rated over a 12-year period corresponding to the three most recent market cycles of the Merrill Lynch high yield bond index. 2Annual expense ratio plus brokerage commissions paid by the fund for buying and selling securities. p: Prior year.

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE


DEAR SHAREHOLDER:

Although the markets were fairly positive in 1995, no one can predict what
lies ahead for investors. The previous year, stocks posted below-average
returns and bonds had one of the worst years in history. This downturn
followed a period in which the investing environment was almost ideal.
These market ups and downs are a normal part of investing, and there are
some basic principles that can help investors in every type of market.
First, take a long-term approach when investing. If you can afford to leave
your money invested through the inevitable ups and downs of financial
markets, you will greatly reduce your vulnerability to any single decline.
Over time, for example, stock prices have gone up - and have significantly
outperformed other types of investments and stayed ahead of inflation.
Second, you can further manage risk by diversifying your investments. A
stock mutual fund is already diversified, because it invests in many
different companies. You can increase your diversification by investing in
a number of different stock funds, or in different investment categories,
such as bonds. You should also keep money you'll need in the near future in
a more stable investment.

Finally, it makes good sense to follow a regular investment plan, investing
a set amount of money at the same time each month or quarter. That way, you
can avoid getting caught up in the excitement of a rapidly-rising market -
and won't end up buying all your shares at market highs. This strategy
won't assure a profit or protect you from a loss in a declining market, but
it should help you lower the average cost of your purchases. For this to be
effective, you must continue to buy shares in both up and down markets.
If you have questions, please call us at 1-800-544-8888. We would be happy
to send you a Fidelity FundMatch kit, which can help you determine the mix
of investments that is right for you. You might also find it convenient to
set up a regular investment plan using the Fidelity Automatic Account
Builder.SM

We look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

Edward C. Johnson 3d


PERFORMANCE: THE BOTTOM LINE



To measure a money market fund's performance, you can look at either total
return or yield. Total return reflects the change in a fund's share price
over a given period, reinvestment of its dividends (or income), and the
effect of the fund's $5 account closeout fee on an average sized account.
Yield measures the income paid by a fund. Since a money market fund tries
to maintain a $1 share price, yield is an important measure of performance.
If Fidelity had not reimbursed the fund for certain expenses during the
periods shown, the total returns would have been lower.








CUMULATIVE TOTAL RETURNS
PERIODS ENDED APRIL 30, 1996   PAST 6   PAST 1   PAST 5   LIFE OF

New Jersey Tax-Free
Money Market Funds Average     1.45%    3.09%    14.74%   n/a








CUMULATIVE TOTAL RETURNS show the fund's performance in percentage terms
over a specific period - in this case, six months, one year, five years, or
since the fund started on May 1, 1990. For example, if you invested $1,000
in a fund that had a 5% return over the past year, the value of your
investment would be $1,050. To measure how the fund's performance stacked
up against its peers, you can compare it to the New Jersey tax-free money
market funds average, which reflects the performance of 10 New Jersey
tax-free money market funds with similar objectives tracked by IBC
Financial Data, Inc. over the past six months. (The periods covered by IBC
Financial Data, Inc. numbers are the closest available match to those
covered by the fund).

YIELD refers to the income paid by the fund over a given period. Yields for
money market funds are usually for seven-day periods, expressed as annual
percentage rates. A yield that assumes income earned is reinvested or
compounded is called an effective yield. The chart above shows the fund's
current seven-day yield at quarterly intervals over the past year. If the
adviser had not reimbursed certain fund expenses during the periods shown,
the yields would have been lower. You can compare these yields to the New
Jersey tax-free money market funds  average as tracked by IBC Financial
Data, Inc. Or you can look at the fund's tax-equivalent yield, which is
based on a combined effective 1996 federal and state income tax rate of
40.08%. A portion of the fund's income may be subject to the alternative
minimum tax.

A MONEY MARKET FUND'S TOTAL RETURNS AND YIELDS WILL VARY, AND REFLECT PAST
RESULTS RATHER THAN PREDICT FUTURE PERFORMANCE.



COMPARING

PERFORMANCE


Yields on tax-free investments

are usually lower than yields

on taxable investments.

However, a straight

comparison between the two

may be misleading because it

ignores the way taxes reduce

taxable returns. Tax-equivalent

yield - the yield you'd have to

earn on a similar taxable

investment to match the

tax-free yield - makes the

comparison more meaningful.

Keep in mind that the U.S.

Government neither insures

nor guarantees a money

market fund. In fact, there is

no assurance that a money

market fund will maintain a $1

share price.

FUND TALK: THE MANAGER'S OVERVIEW



An interview with Jeff Parker,

Portfolio Manager of Spartan

New Jersey Municipal Money

Market Fund

Q. JEFF, HOW HAS THE INVESTMENT CLIMATE CHANGED DURING THE PAST SIX MONTHS?

A. There's been quite a turnaround in market sentiment in recent months.
When the period began, the Federal Reserve was in an easing mode, having
lowered the federal funds rate - the rate banks charge each other for
overnight loans - the previous July. With inflation under control, Congress
and the White House apparently making progress toward a balanced budget
agreement, and the economy losing steam, many market participants believed
it was only a matter of time before the Fed cut interest rates again. It
therefore came as no surprise when the Fed lowered the federal funds rate
one-quarter percentage point in early December, and lowered it again by an
equal amount on the last day of January 1996. Heading into spring, it
appeared likely the rate cuts would continue.

Q. HAS THAT SCENARIO CHANGED?

A. Yes. When Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, testifying before Congress in
mid-February, seemed to suggest that the economy was basically sound, the
consensus shifted and rates backed up. Then came the infamous February
employment report, which was significantly stronger than most analysts had
predicted. Since then, a string of positive indicators has left little
doubt in most analysts' minds that, for the time being, the economy is in
no need of further stimulus.

Q. HOW DID YOU RESPOND TO CHANGING CONDITIONS?

A. The fund began the period with an average maturity of 70 days. In a
declining-rate environment, it usually makes sense to lock in attractive
rates for as long as possible by extending the fund's average maturity. As
evidence mounted that the economy was not as weak as we had thought, I
sought greater flexibility by reducing the fund's average maturity. By the
time the February employment report was released in early March, the fund's
average maturity was already in the mid 60s. Since then, I've gradually
rolled down, ending the period at 55 days.

Q. HOW DID THE FUND PERFORM?

A. The fund's seven-day yield on April 30, 1996 was 3.44%, compared to
3.55% on October 31, 1995. The latest yield was the equivalent of a taxable
yield of 5.74% for investors in the 40.08% combined federal and state tax
bracket. The fund's total return during the six-month period was 1.63%.
That beat the total return of 1.45% for the New Jersey tax-free money
market funds average, according to IBC Financial Data, Inc. The fund also
outperformed its peers over the past 12 months: 3.48%, compared to 3.09%.

Q. WHAT'S THE OUTLOOK?

A. Recently released economic indicators have produced some contradictory
signals, making it unclear just how strong the economy really is. In the
absence of compelling evidence one way or the other, I think it's likely
the Fed will stand pat for a while. Certainly no one expects the Fed to
lower rates again anytime soon. On the other hand, there have been ominous
signs of growing inflationary pressures in recent months. And if we
continue to see evidence of strong economic performance in key indicators
such as employment, housing and consumer spending, it is more likely that
the Fed will choose to raise rates, perhaps sometime during the third
quarter. But again, no one has a very clear sense of what to expect over
the next couple of months. Given the lack of a solid direction, I'll
probably aim to keep the fund's average maturity about where it is right
now - between 50 and 60 days. That gives me maximum flexibility to adapt to
changing conditions and take advantage of buying opportunities as they
arise.

WORDS TO KNOW


COMMERCIAL PAPER: A security

issued by a municipality to

finance capital or operating

needs.

FEDERAL FUNDS RATE: The interest

rate banks charge each other

for overnight loans.

MATURITY: The time remaining

before an issuer is scheduled

to repay the principal amount

on a debt security. When the

fund's average maturity -

weighted by dollar amount -

is short, the fund manager is

anticipating a rise in interest

rates. When the average

maturity is long, the manager

is expecting rates to fall.

When the average maturity is

neutral, the manager wants

the flexibility to respond to

rising rates, while still

capturing a portion of the

higher yields available from

issues with longer maturities.

MUNICIPAL NOTE: A security

issued in advance of future

tax or other revenues and

payable from those specific

sources.

TENDER BOND: A variable-rate,

long-term security that gives

the bond holder the option to

redeem the bond at face

value before maturity.


VARIABLE RATE DEMAND NOTE


(VRDN): A tender bond that

can be redeemed on short

notice, typically one or seven

days. VRDNs are useful in

managing the fund's average

maturity and liquidity.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

For the period ended April 30, 1996 (Unaudited)


1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES.
On December 14, 1995, the Board of Trustees approved a change in the fund's
name from Spartan New Jersey Municipal Money Market Portfolio to Spartan
New Jersey Municipal Money Market Fund. Spartan New Jersey Municipal Money
Market Fund (the fund) is a fund of Fidelity Beacon Street Trust (the
trust) and is authorized to issue an unlimited number of shares. The trust
is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the
1940 Act), as an open-end management investment company organized as a
Delaware business trust. The financial statements have been prepared in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles which permit
management to make certain estimates and assumptions at the date of the
financial statements. The following summarizes the significant accounting
policies of the fund:

SECURITY VALUATION. As permitted under Rule 2a-7 of the 1940 Act, and
certain conditions therein, securities are valued initially at cost and
thereafter assume a constant amortization to maturity of any discount or
premium.

INCOME TAXES. As a qualified regulated investment company under Subchapter
M of the Internal Revenue Code, the fund is not subject to income taxes to
the extent that it distributes substantially all of its taxable income for
its fiscal year. The schedule of investments includes information regarding
income taxes under the caption "Income Tax Information."
INTEREST INCOME. Interest income, which includes amortization of premium
and accretion of original issue discount, is accrued as earned. Accretion
of market discount represents unrealized gain until realized at the time of
a security disposition or maturity.

EXPENSES. Most expenses of the trust can be directly attributed to a fund.
Expenses which cannot be directly attributed are apportioned between the
funds in the trust.

DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS. Dividends are declared daily and paid
monthly from net interest income.

SECURITY TRANSACTIONS. Security transactions are accounted for as of trade
date. Gains and losses on securities sold are determined on the basis of
identified cost.

2. FEES AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES.
MANAGEMENT FEE. As the fund's investment adviser, Fidelity Management &
Research Company (FMR) pays all expenses, except the compensation of the
non-interested Trustees and certain exceptions such as interest, taxes,
brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. FMR receives a fee that
is computed daily at an annual rate of .50% of the fund's average net
assets.
FMR also bears the cost of providing shareholder services to the fund. To
offset the cost of providing these services, FMR or its affiliates collect
certain transaction fees from the fund's shareholders which amounted to
$3,570 for the period.

2. FEES AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES - CONTINUED
SUB-ADVISER FEE. As the fund's investment sub-adviser, FMR Texas Inc., a
wholly owned subsidiary of FMR, receives a fee from FMR of 50% of the
management fee payable to FMR. The fee is paid prior to any voluntary
expense reimbursements which may be in effect.

3. EXPENSE REDUCTIONS.
FMR voluntarily agreed to reimburse the fund's operating expenses
(excluding interest, taxes, brokerage commissions and extraordinary
expenses) above a specified percentage of average net assets. During the
period, this expense limitation ranged from .32% to .35% of average net
assets and the reimbursement reduced expenses by $377,045.
In addition, FMR has entered into arrangements  on behalf of the fund with
the fund's custodian and transfer agent whereby interest earned on
uninvested cash balances was used to offset a portion of the fund's
expenses. During the period, the fund's expenses were reduced by $29,691
under these arrangements.

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE


DEAR SHAREHOLDER:

Although the markets were fairly positive in 1995, no one can predict what
lies ahead for investors. The previous year, stocks posted below-average
returns and bonds had one of the worst years in history. This downturn
followed a period in which the investing environment was almost ideal.
These market ups and downs are a normal part of investing, and there are
some basic principles that can help investors in every type of market.
First, take a long-term approach when investing. If you can afford to leave
your money invested through the inevitable ups and downs of financial
markets, you will greatly reduce your vulnerability to any single decline.
Over time, for example, stock prices have gone up - and have significantly
outperformed other types of investments and stayed ahead of inflation.
Second, you can further manage risk by diversifying your investments. A
stock mutual fund is already diversified, because it invests in many
different companies. You can increase your diversification by investing in
a number of different stock funds, or in different investment categories,
such as bonds. You should also keep money you'll need in the near future in
a more stable investment.

Finally, it makes good sense to follow a regular investment plan, investing
a set amount of money at the same time each month or quarter. That way, you
can avoid getting caught up in the excitement of a rapidly-rising market -
and won't end up buying all your shares at market highs. This strategy
won't assure a profit or protect you from a loss in a declining market, but
it should help you lower the average cost of your purchases. For this to be
effective, you must continue to buy shares in both up and down markets.
If you have questions, please call us at 1-800-544-8888. We would be happy
to send you a Fidelity FundMatch kit, which can help you determine the mix
of investments that is right for you. You might also find it convenient to
set up a regular investment plan using the Fidelity Automatic Account
Builder.SM

We look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

Edward C. Johnson 3d


PERFORMANCE: THE BOTTOM LINE



To measure a money market fund's performance, you can look at either total
return or yield. Total return reflects the change in a fund's share price
over a given period and reinvestment of its dividends (or income). Yield
measures the income paid by a fund. Since a money market fund tries to
maintain a $1 share price, yield is an important measure of performance.








CUMULATIVE TOTAL RETURNS

All Tax-Free Money Market Funds Average   1.54%     3.25%    14.72%   45.69%








CUMULATIVE TOTAL RETURNS show the fund's performance in percentage terms
over a set period - in this case, six months, one year, five years, or 10
years. For example, if you invested $1,000 in a fund that had a 5% return
over the past year, the value of your investment would be $1,050. To
measure how the fund's performance stacked up against its peers, you can
compare it to the all tax-free money market funds average which reflects
the performance of 400 tax-free money market funds with similar objectives
tracked by IBC Financial Data, Inc. (IBC) over the past six months. (The
periods covered by IBC numbers are the closest match to those covered by








the fund.)

YIELD refers to the income paid by the fund over a given period. Yields for
money market funds are usually for seven-day periods, expressed as annual
percentage rates. A yield that assumes income earned is reinvested or
compounded is called an effective yield. The chart above shows the fund's
current seven-day yield at quarterly intervals over the past year. You can
compare these yields to the all tax-free money market funds average. Or you
can look at the fund's tax-equivalent yield, which assumes you're in the
36% tax bracket. Figures for the all tax-free money market funds average
are from IBC.

A MONEY MARKET FUND'S TOTAL RETURNS AND YIELDS WILL VARY, AND REFLECT PAST
RESULTS RATHER THAN PREDICT FUTURE PERFORMANCE.



COMPARING

PERFORMANCE


Yields on tax-free

investments are usually lower

than yields on taxable

investments. However, a

straight comparison between

the two may be misleading

because it ignores the way

taxes reduce taxable returns.

Tax-equivalent yield - the

yield you'd have to earn on a

similar taxable investment to

match the tax-free yield -

makes the comparison more

meaningful. Keep in mind that

the U.S. Government neither

insures nor guarantees a

money market fund. And there

is no assurance that a money

fund will maintain a $1 share

price.

FUND TALK: THE MANAGER'S OVERVIEW



An interview with Deborah Watson, Portfolio Manager of Fidelity Municipal
Money Market Fund


Q. DEBORAH, WHAT KIND OF INVESTMENT CLIMATE HAVE YOU BEEN OPERATING IN FOR
THE PAST SIX MONTHS?


A. Conditions have changed dramatically since the beginning of the period.
Last October, the economy was still growing slowly, inflationary pressures
were modest and there appeared to be bipartisan support in Congress for a
balanced-budget agreement. All that helped persuade the Federal Reserve to
continue pursuing a monetary policy designed to stimulate economic growth.
The Fed lowered the interest rate banks charge each other for overnight
loans - known as the federal funds rate - one-quarter percentage point in
December and another one-quarter percentage point in January 1996, to
5.25%. Since then, however, we've seen signs of increased economic activity
in a number of key areas, including employment and home sales. At the same
time, hopes for a balanced budget agreement have faded; and recently, both
the Producer Price Index and the Consumer Price Index have begun rising at
a rate that suggests inflationary pressures may be building. So far, the
Fed has stayed on the sidelines. However, toward the end of the period,
market pressures had nudged short-term rates higher anticipating a possible
Fed rate increase as early as the end of May.

Q. HOW DID YOUR STRATEGY CHANGE IN LIGHT OF CHANGING CONDITIONS?

A. Last fall, when rates seemed likely to continue declining, I positioned
the fund fairly aggressively. The fund's average maturity was 64 days at
the end of October; by the end of December, it was 68 days. In early March,
as market sentiment shifted and the potential for higher rates in the near
future increased, I began selling some of the fund's longer-term
securities. By the end of April, the fund's average maturity was toward the
defensive side of neutral at 41 days.

Q. HOW DID THE FUND PERFORM?

A. The fund's seven-day yield on April 30, 1996 was 3.29%, compared to
3.42% six months ago. The latest yield was the equivalent of a 5.14%
taxable yield for investors in the 36% federal tax bracket. The fund had a
total return for six months of 1.58%, compared to 1.54% for the all
tax-free money market funds average, according to IBC Financial Data, Inc.

Q. WHY IS THE FUND CHANGING ITS NAME?

A. As of May 1, 1996, the fund will be known as Fidelity Municipal Money
Market Fund. Even though the fund's name is being changed, the fund's
objective remains the same - to provide tax-free income.  The name change
is a result of a change in the fund's investment policy that will allow me
to begin buying securities subject to the alternative minimum tax - often
referred to as AMT securities. This change is a benefit to shareholders
because it gives me greater flexibility in pursuing all marketplace
opportunities - including areas dominated by AMT securities. AMT securities
are issued by municipalities to finance private activity, such as airports,
multi-family housing and industrial development. These securities typically
offer higher yields than other municipal securities of comparable maturity
without necessarily involving higher credit risk. Although the fund is now
permitted to invest in any amount of municipal securities that may be
considered taxable under the AMT, I don't expect to begin buying AMT
securities until early summer, and when I do I'll add them gradually. Six
months from now, it's possible the fund may have about a 20% stake in AMT
securities.

Q. WHAT'S THE OUTLOOK FOR INTEREST RATES AND THE ECONOMY?

A. I think rates are likely to remain fairly stable over the next several
months as market participants and the Fed try to sort through conflicting
signals on the strength of the economy. I'm not convinced that the growth
we've seen since the beginning of the year is sustainable, yet there's
enough uncertainty that another rate cut by the Fed seems unlikely. I'll
probably let the fund's average maturity roll down into the mid 30s ahead
of the annual summer borrowing season. As abundant supplies enter the
market, I typically have opportunities to lengthen the fund's average
maturity at attractive rates.

THE ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX

AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR

FIXED-INCOME INVESTORS


The federal alternative

minimum tax (AMT) is an

`additional' tax that may apply

to those individuals in higher

income tax brackets with

large deductions and/or

exclusions from income.

Investors may be subject to

the AMT if they benefit

substantially from what are

considered "items of tax

preference" and

"adjustments," such as

mutual fund dividends

attributable to certain

municipal private activity

bonds.

Most of Fidelity's municipal

money market funds do have

the ability to invest in

securities that are subject to

the AMT. The ability to invest

in such securities allows our

portfolio managers more

latitude in selecting securities

for their portfolios and helps

foster greater portfolio

diversification.

Of course, if you are not

subject to the AMT, the

tax-exempt status of the

income you receive from a

Fidelity municipal bond or

money market fund will not be

affected.

If you are an investor who is

subject to the AMT, or if you

are unsure, you should consult

your tax advisor for further

information.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


For the period ended April 30, 1996 (Unaudited)


1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES.
On April 10, 1996, the Board of Trustees approved a change in the fund's
name from Fidelity Tax-Exempt Money Market Trust to Fidelity Municipal
Money Market Fund. The fund's name change will be effective May 1, 1996.
Fidelity Municipal Money Market Fund (the fund) is a fund of Fidelity
Beacon Street Trust (the trust) and is authorized to issue an unlimited
number of shares. The trust is registered under the Investment Company Act
of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act), as an open-end management investment
company organized as a Delaware business trust. The financial statements
have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles which permit management to make certain estimates and
assumptions at the date of the financial statements. The following
summarizes the significant accounting policies of the fund:

SECURITY VALUATION. As permitted under Rule 2a-7 of the 1940 Act, and
certain conditions therein, securities are valued initially at cost and
thereafter assume a constant amortization to maturity of any discount or
premium.

INCOME TAXES. As a qualified regulated investment company under Subchapter
M of the Internal Revenue Code, the fund is not subject to income taxes to
the extent that it distributes substantially all of its taxable income for
its fiscal year. The schedule of investments includes information regarding
income taxes under the caption "Income Tax Information."
INTEREST INCOME. Interest income, which includes amortization of premium
and accretion of original issue discount, is accrued as earned. Accretion
of market discount represents unrealized gain until realized at the time of
a security disposition or maturity.

EXPENSES. Most expenses of the trust can be directly attributed to a fund.
Expenses which cannot be directly attributed are apportioned between the
funds in the trust.

DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS. Dividends are declared daily and paid
monthly from net interest income.

SECURITY TRANSACTIONS. Security transactions are accounted for as of trade
date. Gains and losses on securities sold are determined on the basis of
identified cost.

2. FEES AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES.
MANAGEMENT FEE. As the fund's investment adviser, Fidelity Management &
Research Company (FMR) receives a monthly fee that is calculated on the
basis of a group fee rate plus a fixed individual fund fee rate applied to
the average net assets of the fund. The group fee rate is the weighted
average of a series of rates and is based on the monthly average net assets
of all the mutual funds advised by FMR. The rates ranged from .1100% to
.3700% for the period. In the event that these rates were lower than the
contractual rates in effect during the period, FMR voluntarily implemented
the above rates, as they resulted in the same or a lower

2. FEES AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES - CONTINUED
MANAGEMENT FEE - CONTINUED
management fee. The annual individual fund fee rate is .15%. For the
period, the management fee was equivalent to an  annualized rate of .30% of
the fund's average net assets.
SUB-ADVISER FEE. As the fund's investment sub-adviser, FMR Texas Inc., a
wholly owned subsidiary of FMR, receives a fee from FMR of 50% of the
management fee payable to FMR. The fee is paid prior to any voluntary
expense reimbursements which may be in effect.
TRANSFER AGENT AND ACCOUNTING FEES. UMB Bank, n.a. (UMB) is the custodian
and transfer and shareholder servicing agent for the fund. UMB has entered
into a sub-contract with Fidelity Service Co. (FSC), an affiliate of FMR,
under which FSC performs the activities associated with the fund's transfer
and shareholder servicing agent and accounting functions. The fund pays
account fees and asset-based fees that vary according to account size and
type of account. FSC pays for typesetting, printing and mailing of all
shareholder reports, except proxy statements. The accounting fee is based
on the level of average net assets for the month plus out-of-pocket
expenses. For the period, FSC received transfer agent and accounting fees
amounting to $3,142,000 and $206,000, respectively.
For the period, the transfer agent fees were equivalent to an annualized
rate of .17% of the fund's average net assets.
Shareholders participating in the Fidelity Ultra Service Account(registered
trademark) Program (the Program) pay a $5.00 monthly fee to Fidelity
Brokerage Services, Inc. (FBSI), an affiliate of FMR, for performing
services associated with the Program. For the period, fees paid to FBSI by
shareholders participating in the Program amounted to $284,000.

	FIDELITY BEACON STREET TRUST:

	FIDELITY TAX MANAGED STOCK FUND

	FIDELITY ADVISOR TAX MANAGED STOCK FUND

	TO BE HELD ON NOVEMBER 14, 2001





	This Proxy Statement is furnished in connection with a solicitation of proxies made by, and on behalf of, the Board of Trustees of
	Fidelity Beacon Street Trust (the trust) to be used at the Special Meeting of Shareholders of Fidelity Tax Managed Stock Fund and Fidelity
	Advisor Tax Managed Stock Fund


	(the funds) and at any adjournments thereof (the Meeting), to be held on November 14, 2001 at 9:00
	a.m. at 27 State Street, 10th Floor, Boston, Massachusetts 02109, an office of the trust and Fidelity Management & Research Company
	(FMR), the funds' investment adviser.


	The purpose of the Meeting is set forth in the accompanying Notice. The solicitation is being made primarily by the mailing of this
	Proxy Statement and the accompanying proxy card on or about September 17, 2001. Supplementary solicitations may be made by mail,
	telephone, telegraph, facsimile, electronic means or by personal interview by representatives of the


	trust.




	In addition, D.F. King & Co., Inc

	.

	may be paid on a per-call basis to solicit shareholders on behalf of the funds at an anticipated cost of approximately $______(Fidelity Tax
	Managed Stock Fund) and $______ (Fidelity Tax Advisor Managed Stock Fund). The funds may also arrange to have votes recorded by
	telephone. D.F. King & Co., Inc. may be paid on a per-call basis for vote-by-phone solicitations on behalf of the funds at an anticipated cost
	of approximately $___ (Fidelity Tax Managed Stock Fund) and $___ (Fidelity Advisor Tax Managed Stock Fund). If the funds record votes by
	telephone, they will use procedures designed to authenticate shareholders' identities, to allow shareholders to authorize the voting of their
	shares in accordance with their instructions, and to confirm that their instructions have been properly recorded. Proxies voted by telephone
	may be revoked at any time before they are voted in the same manner that proxies voted by mail may be revoked. [The expenses in
	connection with preparing this Proxy Statement and its enclosures and of all solicitations, including telephone voting, will be paid by the
	funds, provided the expenses do not exceed Fidelity Advisor Tax Managed Stock Fund's existing voluntary expense cap of 1.50% for
	Institutional Class, 1.75% for Class A, 2.00% for Class T, and 2.50% for both Class B and C. Expenses exceeding each class's voluntary
	expense cap will be paid by FMR.] The funds will reimburse brokerage firms and others for their reasonable expenses in forwarding
	solicitation material to the beneficial owners of shares.


	The principal business address of FMR, each fund's investment adviser and administrator, Fidelity Distributors Corporation (FDC), each
	fund's principal underwriter and distribution agent, and FMR Co., Inc. (FMRC), subadviser to the funds, is 82 Devonshire Street, Boston,
	Massachusetts 02109. The principal business address of Fidelity Management & Research (U.K.) Inc. (FMR U.K.), located at 25 Lovat Lane,
	London, EC3R 8LL, England; Fidelity Management & Research (Far East) Inc. (FMR Far East), located at Shiroyama JT Mori Bldg., 4-3-1
	Toranomon Minato-ku, Tokyo 105, Japan; and Fidelity Investments Japan Limited (FIJ), located at 1-8-8 Shinkawa, Chuo-ku, Tokyo
	104-0033, Japan are also subadvisers to the funds.


	If the enclosed proxy card is executed and returned, it may nevertheless be revoked at any time prior to its use by written notification
	received by the trust, by the execution of a later-dated proxy card, by the trust's receipt of a subsequent valid telephonic vote or by
	attending the Meeting and voting in person.


	All proxy cards solicited by the Board of Trustees that are properly executed and received by the Secretary prior to the Meeting, and are
	not revoked, will be voted at the Meeting. Shares represented by such proxies will be voted in accordance with the instructions thereon. If
	no specification is made on a proxy card, it will be voted FOR the matters specified on the proxy card. Only proxies that are voted will be
	counted towards establishing a quorum. Broker non-votes are not considered voted for this purpose. Shareholders should note that while
	votes to ABSTAIN will count toward establishing a quorum, passage of any proposal being considered at the Meeting will occur only if a
	sufficient number of votes are cast FOR the proposal. Accordingly, votes to ABSTAIN and votes AGAINST will have the same effect in
	determining whether the proposal is approved. Broker non-votes will not be counted towards establishing a quorum nor will they affect the
	outcome of the proposals. With respect to fund shares held in Fidelity individual retirement accounts (including Traditional, Rollover, SEP,
	SARSEP, Roth and SIMPLE IRAs), the IRA Custodian will vote those shares for which it has received instructions from shareholders only in
	accordance with such instructions. If Fidelity IRA shareholders do not vote their shares, the IRA Custodian will vote their shares for them,
	in the same proportion as other Fidelity IRA shareholders have voted, but only to the extent necessary to reach quorum at the meeting.


	If a quorum is not present at the Meeting, or if a quorum is present at the Meeting but sufficient votes to approve one or more of the
	proposed items are not received, or if other matters arise requiring shareholder attention, the persons named as proxy agents may propose
	one or more adjournments of the Meeting to permit further solicitation of proxies. Any such adjournment will require the affirmative vote of a
	majority of those shares present at the Meeting or represented by proxy. When voting on a proposed adjournment, the persons named as
	proxy agents will vote FOR the proposed adjournment all shares that they are entitled to vote with respect to each item, unless directed to
	vote AGAINST the item, in which case such shares will be voted AGAINST the proposed adjournment with respect to that item. A shareholder
	vote may be taken on one or more of the items in this Proxy Statement prior to such adjournment if sufficient votes have been received and it
	is otherwise appropriate.


	Shares of each fund of the trust issued and outstanding as of July 31, 2001 are indicated in the following table:

	completed its first annual or semiannual period.




	VOTE REQUIRED:


	Approval of Proposals 1 and 2


	require the affirmative vote of a "majority of the outstanding voting securities" of the
	entire trust. A plurality of all votes cast at the Meeting is sufficient to approve Proposal 3. Approval of Proposals


	4 and


	5 requires the
	affirmative vote of a "majority of the outstanding voting securities" of


	the appropriate funds. Under the Investment Company Act of
	1940 (the 1940 Act), the vote of a "majority of the outstanding voting securities" means the affirmative vote of the lesser of (a) 67%
	or more of the voting securities present at the Meeting or represented by proxy if the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding
	voting securities are present or represented by proxy or (b) more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities. Broker non-votes are
	not considered "present" for this purpose.

	1. TO CONTINUE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ARTICLE VII, SECTION 7.04 OF THE TRUST INSTRUMENT



	The Board of Trustees recommends that shareholders vote to continue the effectiveness of Article VII, Section 7.04 of the Trust
	Instrument.


	On September 14, 2000, pursuant to authority granted to the Trustees under Article XI, Section 11.08 of the Trust Instrument and
	applicable laws, the Trustees modified a provision in the Trust Instrument to resolve any legal uncertainty regarding derivative actions
	brought on behalf of a fund. Under state law in order for a shareholder to file most derivative actions on behalf of a fund, the shareholder
	must first make demand on the Trustees of the fund to bring the claim. However, claims for violation of fiduciary duty involving the receipt
	of compensation by an adviser can be brought directly by the shareholder without first making demand on the Trustees. Notwithstanding
	their authority to amend the Trust Instrument, the Trustees authorized the submission of this amendment to shareholders to vote on the
	continued effectiveness of the provision. The amended provision currently in effect is set forth below.



	Section 7.04.

	In addition to the requirements set forth in Section 3816 of the Delaware Act, a Shareholder may bring
	derivative action on behalf of the Trust only if the Shareholder or Shareholders first make a pre-suit demand upon the
	Trustees to bring the subject action unless an effort to cause the Trustees to bring such action is excused. A demand on
	the Trustees shall only be excused if a majority of the Board of Trustees, or a majority of any committee established to
	consider the merits of such action, has a personal financial interest in the action at issue. A Trustee shall not be deemed
	to have a personal financial interest in an action or otherwise be disqualified from ruling on a Shareholder demand by
	virtue of the fact that such Trustee receives remuneration from his service on the Board of Trustees of the Trust or on the
	boards of one or more investment companies with the same or an affiliated investment advisor or underwriter.




	The amendment provides that a Trustee shall not be deemed to have a personal interest or otherwise be disqualified from considering a
	pre-suit demand by a shareholder to bring a derivative action on behalf of a fund due to his or her service on boards of trustees of other
	funds with the same or affiliated investment advisor or underwriter. There is some legal uncertainty regarding whether a Trustee serving on
	multiple boards of trustees is independent of the investment advisor and, therefore, permitted to consider a pre-suit demand by a
	shareholder seeking to assert a claim against a fund's investment advisor. The Trustees seek to ensure that they retain the ability to manage
	the affairs of the funds, including control of derivative actions that are brought on behalf of a fund. This provision in the amendment will
	resolve any legal uncertainty by expressly stating that a Trustee shall not be deemed to have a personal interest or otherwise be disqualified
	from considering a pre-suit demand due to his or her service on multiple fund boards of trustees.


	Continuing the effectiveness of the amendment will

	not

	alter in any way the Trustees' existing fiduciary obligations to act with due care
	and in shareholders' interests.


	If shareholders do not vote to continue the provision's effectiveness, the Trustees will execute an amended and restated Trust Instrument
	which replaces the version of Article VII, Section 7.04 discussed above with the following version which appeared prior to the September
	14, 2000 amendment by the Trustees.



	Section 7.04.

	Except as otherwise provided in Section 3816 of the Delaware Act, all matters relating to the bringing of
	derivative actions in the right of the Trust shall be governed by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware
	relating to derivative actions, and judicial interpretations thereunder, as if the Trust were a Delaware corporation and the
	Shareholders were shareholders of a Delaware corporation.



	Conclusion.

	The Board of Trustees has concluded that continuing the effectiveness of the amendment to Article VII, Section 7.04 of the
	Trust Instrument is in the best interests of the trust's shareholders. Accordingly, the Trustees unanimously recommend that shareholders
	vote FOR the proposal. If the proposal is approved, Article VII, Section 7.04 will remain unchanged as it appears in the current Trust
	Instrument. If the proposal is not approved, the Trustees will execute an amended and restated Trust Instrument incorporating the version
	of Article VII, Section 7.04 that was in effect prior to the September 14, 2000 amendment by the Trustees.



	2. TO AUTHORIZE THE TRUSTEES TO ADOPT AN AMENDED AND RESTATED TRUST INSTRUMENT.



	The Board of Trustees has approved, and recommends that the shareholders of the trust authorize them to adopt and execute, an
	amended and restated Trust Instrument in the form attached to this Proxy Statement as Exhibit 1 (New Trust Instrument). The New Trust
	Instrument has been marked to show changes from the trust's existing Trust Instrument (Current Trust Instrument). The New Trust
	Instrument is based on a standard form that will be used for all new Fidelity funds organized as Delaware business trusts going forward.


	The New Trust Instrument gives the Trustees more flexibility and, subject to applicable requirements of the 1940 Act and Delaware law,
	broader authority to act. This increased flexibility may allow the Trustees to react more quickly to changes in competitive and regulatory
	conditions and, as a consequence, may allow the funds to operate in a more efficient and economical manner. Adoption of the New Trust
	Instrument will not alter in any way the Trustees' existing fiduciary obligations to act with due care and in the shareholders' interests.
	Before utilizing any new flexibility that the New Trust Instrument may afford, the Trustees must first consider the shareholders' interests and
	then act in accordance with such interests.


	Under the Current Trust Instrument, shareholders generally have the right to vote on any amendment affecting their right to vote, any
	amendment affecting the amendment provisions of the Trust Instrument, any amendment required by law or the trust's registration
	statement, and any matter submitted to the shareholders by the Trustees. On November 18, 1999, the Trustees approved the form of the
	New Trust Instrument. On June 14, 2001, the Board authorized the submission of the New Trust Instrument to the trust's shareholders for
	their authorization at this Meeting.



	Number of Trustees.

	The New Trust Instrument modifies the Current Trust Instrument to allow the Trustees to increase the maximum
	number of Trustees from twelve (12) to fourteen (14). This increase is intended to enhance the flexibility of the Board to organize itself and
	its committees in overseeing management of the Fidelity Funds and to expand the level of the Board's expertise.



	Termination of the Trust or Its Series or Classes.

	Unlike the Current Trust Instrument, the New Trust Instrument generally permits the
	Trustees, subject to applicable Federal and state law, to terminate all or a portion of the trust or any of its series or classes. The Current
	Trust Instrument requires shareholder approval in order to terminate the trust or any of its series.


	Under certain circumstances, it may not be in the shareholders' interest to require a shareholder meeting to permit the Trustees to
	terminate a fund or class. For example, a fund may have insufficient assets to invest effectively or excessively high expense levels due to
	operational needs. Under such circumstances, absent viable alternatives, the Trustees may determine that terminating the fund is in the
	shareholders' interest and the only appropriate course of action. The process of obtaining shareholder approval of the fund's termination
	may, however, make it more difficult to complete the fund's liquidation and termination and, in general, will increase the costs associated
	with the termination. In such a case, it may be in the shareholders' interest to permit fund termination without incurring the costs and
	delays of a shareholder meeting.


	As discussed above, before allowing a trust, fund or class termination to proceed without shareholder approval, the Trustees have a
	fiduciary responsibility to first determine that the proposed transaction is in the shareholders' interest. Any exercise of the Trustees'
	increased authority under the New Trust Instrument is also subject to any applicable requirements of the 1940 Act and Delaware law.


	Of
	course, the New Trust Instrument would require that shareholders receive written notification of any proposed termination.



	Conclusion.

	The Board of Trustees has concluded that the proposed adoption of the New Trust Instrument is in the best interests of the
	trust's shareholders. Accordingly, the Trustees unanimously recommend that the shareholders vote FOR the proposal to authorize them to
	adopt and execute the New Trust Instrument. If the proposal is not approved, the Current Trust Instrument will remain unchanged and in
	effect. As explained in Proposal 1, please note that, notwithstanding approval of Proposal 2, if Proposal 1 is not approved, the Trustees will
	execute an amended and restated Trust Instrument incorporating the version of Article VII, Section 7.04 that was in effect prior to the
	September 14, 2000 amendment of Article VII, Section 7.04 by the Trustees.



	3. TO ELECT A BOARD OF TRUSTEES.



	The purpose of this proposal is to elect a Board of Trustees of the trust. The Trustees have determined that the Board of Trustees should be
	expanded from a maximum of twelve to a maximum of fourteen members and have fixed the number of Trustees at thirteen. Pursuant to the
	provisions of the Trust Instrument of Fidelity Beacon Street Trust, the increase in the size of the Board of Trustees is subject to shareholder
	approval (see Proposal 2). If shareholders approve expansion of the Board of Trustees, it is intended that the enclosed proxy card will be voted
	for the election as Trustees of the thirteen nominees listed below unless such authority has been withheld in the proxy card. Otherwise, the
	number of Trustees will continue to be fixed at twelve and the enclosed proxy card will be voted for all nominees listed below except for William
	S. Stavropoulos, unless such authority has been withheld in the proxy card.


	Except for Mr. Stavropoulos, all nominees named below are currently Trustees of




	Fidelity Beacon Street Trust and have served in that
	capacity continuously since originally elected or appointed.




	J. Michael Cook, Abigail P. Johnson, Marie L. Knowles, and Ned C. Lautenbach


	were selected by the trust's Nominating and Administration Committee (see page 19) and were appointed to the Board on




	January 1, 2001,
	June 15, 2001, January 1, 2001, and January 1, 2000, respectively


	.


	Mr. Stavropoulos is currently a Member of the Advisory Board of the
	trust. Mr. Stavropoulos was selected by the trust's Nominating and Administration Committee and was appointed as a Member of the
	Advisory Board on


	November 1, 2000. Except for Edward C. Johnson 3d and Ms. Johnson, none of the nominees are related to one
	another. Ms. Johnson is Mr. Johnson's daughter.


	Those nominees indicated by an asterisk (*) are "interested persons" of the trust by virtue of, among other things, their affiliation with

	** Except as otherwise indicated, each individual has held the office shown or other offices in the same company for the last five years.


	[As of July 31, 2001 the nominees, Trustees and officers of the trust and each fund owned, in the aggregate, less than 1% of each fund's
	outstanding shares.]


	If elected, the Trustees will hold office without limit in time except that (a) any Trustee may resign; (b) any Trustee may be removed by
	written instrument, signed by at least two-thirds of the number of Trustees prior to such removal; (c) any Trustee who requests to be
	retired or who has become incapacitated by illness or injury may be retired by written instrument signed by a majority of the other
	Trustees; and (d) a Trustee may be removed at any Special Meeting of shareholders by a two-thirds vote of the outstanding voting
	securities of the trust. In case a vacancy shall for any reason exist, the remaining Trustees will fill such vacancy by appointing another
	Trustee, so long as, immediately after such appointment, at least two-thirds of the Trustees have been elected by shareholders. If, at any
	time, less than a majority of the Trustees holding office has been elected by the shareholders, the Trustees then in office will promptly call a
	shareholders' meeting for the purpose of electing a Board of Trustees. Otherwise, there will normally be no meeting of shareholders for the
	purpose of electing Trustees.


	The trust's Board, which is currently composed of three interested and nine non-interested Trustees, met eleven


	times during the twelve
	months ended October 31, 2000. It is expected that the Trustees will meet at least ten times a year at regularly scheduled meetings.


	The trust's Audit Committee is composed entirely of Trustees who are not interested persons of the trust, FMR or its affiliates and
	normally meets four times a year, or as required, in conjunction with meetings of the Board of Trustees. Currently, Messrs. Kirk (Chairman),
	Gates


	and Lautenbach

	,

	and Ms. Knowles are members of the committee. The committee oversees and monitors the trust's internal control
	structure, its auditing function and its financial reporting process, including the resolution of material reporting issues. The committee
	recommends to the Board of Trustees the appointment of auditors for the trust. It reviews audit plans, fees and other material arrangements
	in respect of the engagement of auditors, including non-audit services to be performed. It reviews the qualifications of key personnel
	involved in the foregoing activities. The committee plays an oversight role in respect of the trust's investment compliance procedures and
	the code of ethics. During the twelve months ended October 31, 2000


	,


	the committee held seven meetings. For additional information on
	each fund's auditor, refer to the section entitled "Independent Accountants" on page 26.


	The trust's Nominating and Administration Committee is currently composed of Messrs. Mann (Chairman), Cox, and Gates. The
	committee members confer periodically and hold meetings as required. The committee makes nominations for independent trustees, and for
	membership on committees. The committee periodically reviews procedures and policies of the Board of Trustees and committees. It acts
	as the administrative committee under the Retirement Plan for non-interested trustees who retired prior to December 30, 1996. It monitors
	the performance of legal counsel employed by the trust and the independent trustees. The committee in the first instance monitors
	compliance with, and acts as the administrator of the provisions of the code of ethics applicable to the independent trustees. During the
	twelve months ended October 31, 2000, the committee held




	six


	meetings. The Nominating and Administration Committee will consider
	nominees recommended by shareholders. Recommendations should be submitted to the committee in care of the Secretary of the Trust.
	The trust does not have a compensation committee; such matters are considered by the Nominating and Administration Committee.


	The following table sets forth information describing the compensation of each Trustee and Member of the Advisory Board of the fund for
	his or her services for the fiscal year ending October 31, 2000, or calendar year ended December 31, 2000, as applicable.

	A

	Information is for the calendar year ended December 31, 2000 for 247 funds in the complex. Compensation figures include cash,
	amounts required to be deferred, and may include amounts deferred at the election of Trustees. For the calendar year ended
	December 31, 2000, the Trustees accrued required deferred compensation from the funds as follows: Ralph F. Cox, $110,000;
	Phyllis Burke Davis, $110,000; Robert M. Gates, $110,000; $75,000; Donald J. Kirk, $7110,000; Ned C. Lautenbach, $110,000;
	Marvin L. Mann, $110,000; William O. McCoy, $110,000; Gerald C. McDonough, $141,000; and Thomas R. Williams, $110,000.
	Certain of the non-interested Trustees elected voluntarily to defer a portion of their compensation as follows: Ralph F. Cox,
	$39,768; Ned C. Lautenbach, $46,296; William O. McCoy, $39,768; and Thomas R. Williams, $46,296.


	Under a deferred compensation plan adopted in September 1995 and amended in November 1996 and January 2000 (the Plan),
	non-interested Trustees must defer receipt of a portion of, and may elect to defer receipt of an additional portion of, their annual fees.
	Amounts deferred under the Plan are treated as though equivalent dollar amounts had been invested in shares of a cross-section of Fidelity
	funds including funds in each major investment discipline and representing a majority of Fidelity's assets under management (the Reference
	Funds). The amounts ultimately received by the non-interested Trustees under the Plan will be directly linked to the investment performance
	of the Reference Funds. Deferral of fees in accordance with the Plan will have a negligible effect on a fund's assets, liabilities, and net
	income per share, and will not obligate a fund to retain the services of any non-interested Trustee or to pay any particular level of
	compensation to the non-interested Trustee. A fund may invest in the Reference Funds under the Plan without shareholder approval.

	Fidelity Tax Managed Stock Fund's current fundamental investment limitation concerning underwriting states:


	"The fund may not underwrite securities issued by others, except to the extent that the fund may be considered an underwriter within the
	meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 in the disposition of restricted securities."


	The Trustees recommend that shareholders of Fidelity Tax Managed Stock Fund's vote to replace this limitation with the following
	amended fundamental investment limitation governing underwriting (additional language is

	underlined

	):


	"The fund may not underwrite securities issued by others, except to the extent that the fund may be considered an underwriter within the
	meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 in the disposition of restricted securities

	or in connection with investments in other investment
	companies

	."


	The primary purpose of the proposal is to clarify that Fidelity Tax Managed Stock Fund


	is not prohibited from investing in other
	investment companies, even if as a result of such investment, the fund


	is technically considered an underwriter under federal securities
	laws.


	The proposal also serves to conform Fidelity Tax Managed Stock Fund's fundamental investment limitation concerning underwriting to a
	limitation which is expected to become standard for all funds managed by FMR or its affiliates. If the proposal is approved, the new
	limitation may not be changed without the approval of shareholders.


	Adoption of the proposed limitation concerning underwriting is not expected to affect the way in which Fidelity Tax Managed Stock Fund
	is managed, the investment performance of the fund, or the securities or instruments in which the fund invests.



	Conclusion.

	The Board of Trustees has concluded that the proposal will benefit Fidelity Tax Managed Stock Fund and its shareholders. The
	Trustees recommend voting FOR the proposal. Upon shareholder approval, the amended fundamental limitation will become effective when
	disclosure is revised to reflect the changes. If the proposal is not approved by the shareholders of the fund, the fund's current limitation will
	remain unchanged.



	5. TO AMEND




	FIDELITY TAX MANAGED STOCK FUND'S FUNDAMENTAL INVESTMENT LIMITATION CONCERNING LENDING.



	Fidelity Tax Managed Stock Fund's current fundamental investment limitation concerning lending is as follows:


	"The fund may not lend any security or make any other loan if, as a result, more than 33 1/3% of its total assets would be lent to other
	parties, but this limitation does not apply to purchases of debt securities or to repurchase agreements."


	The Trustees recommend that the shareholders of Fidelity Tax Managed Stock Fund vote to replace the fund's limitation with the
	following amended fundamental investment limitation governing lending (additional language is

	underlined

	):


	"The fund may not lend any security or make any other loan if, as a result, more than 33 1/3% of its total assets would be lent to other
	parties, but this limitation does not apply to purchases of debt securities or to repurchase agreements

	, or to acquisitions of loans, loan
	participations or other forms of debt instruments

	."


	The primary purpose of this proposal is to revise


	Fidelity Tax Managed Stock Fund's fundamental lending limitation to conform to a
	limitation expected to become standard for all funds managed by FMR or its affiliates. If the proposal is approved, the new fundamental
	lending limitation cannot be changed without the approval of shareholders.


	Adoption of the proposed limitation on lending is not expected to affect the way in which


	Fidelity Tax Managed Stock Fund is managed,
	the investment performance of the fund, or the instruments in which


	the fund invests. However, the proposed limitation would clarify that
	acquisitions of loans, loan participations or other debt instruments are not considered lending.


	If shareholders approve the proposed fundamental investment limitation on lending set forth above, the Board intends to adopt the
	following non-fundamental limitation:


	"The fund does not currently intend to lend assets other than securities to other parties, except by (a) lending money (up to 15% of the
	fund's net assets) to a registered investment company or portfolio for which FMR or an affiliate serves as investment adviser or (b)
	assuming any unfunded commitments in connection with the acquisition of loans, loan participations, or other forms of debt
	instruments. (This limitation does not apply to purchases of debt securities, to repurchase agreements, or to acquisitions of loans, loan
	participations or other forms of debt instruments.)"


	Loans and other forms of debt instruments are used by issuers to borrow money. Loans may be subject to restrictions on resale.
	Purchasers of loans and other forms of debt instruments depend primarily upon the creditworthiness of the borrower for payment of
	interest and principal. If scheduled interest or principal payments are not made, the value of the instrument may be adversely affected.


	Loans, loan participations, and other forms of direct debt instruments involve a risk of loss in case of default or insolvency of the borrower,
	lending bank, or other intermediary.


	When a fund lends a security, it receives in return collateral in an amount at least equal in value to the security loaned. A fund could
	incur expenses if the borrower defaults on its obligation to return the securities loaned for any reason.


	The Trustees may change non-fundamental limitations in response to regulatory, market, legal or other developments without the
	approval of shareholders.



	Conclusion.

	The Board of Trustees has concluded that the proposal will benefit Fidelity Tax Managed Stock Fund and its shareholders.
	The Trustees recommend voting FOR the proposal. Upon shareholder approval, the amended fundamental limitation will become effective
	when the prospectus and/or statement of additional information are revised to reflect it. If the proposal is not approved by the shareholders
	of the fund, the fund's current limitation will remain unchanged.



	OTHER BUSINESS



	The Board knows of no other business to be brought before the Meeting. However, if any other matters properly come before the
	Meeting, it is the intention that proxies that do not contain specific instructions to the contrary will be voted on such matters in accordance
	with the judgment of the persons therein designated.

	The independent accountants examine annual financial statements for the funds and provide other non-audit and tax-related services to

	BENEFICIAL INTEREST


	SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST



	Section 2.01

	. The beneficial interest in the Trust shall be divided into such transferable Shares of one or more separate and distinct
	Series or classes of a Series as the Trustees shall from time to time create and establish. The number of Shares of each Series, and class
	thereof, authorized hereunder is unlimited. Each Share shall have no par value. All Shares issued hereunder, including without limitation,
	Shares issued in connection with a dividend in Shares or a split or reverse split of Shares, shall be fully paid and nonassessable.


	ISSUANCE OF SHARES



	Section 2.02

	. The Trustees in their discretion may, from time to time, without vote of the Shareholders, issue Shares, in addition to the
	then issued and outstanding Shares and Shares held in the treasury, to such party or parties and for such amount and type of
	consideration, subject to applicable law, including cash or securities, at such time or times and on such terms as the Trustees may deem
	appropriate, and may in such manner acquire other assets (including the acquisition of assets subject to, and in connection with, the
	assumption of liabilities) and businesses. In connection with any issuance of Shares, the Trustees may issue fractional Shares and Shares
	held in the treasury. The Trustees may from time to time divide or combine the Shares into a greater or lesser number without thereby
	changing the proportionate beneficial interests in the Trust. Contributions to the Trust may be accepted for, and Shares shall be redeemed
	as, whole Shares and/or 1/1,000th of a Share or integral multiples thereof.


	REGISTER OF SHARES AND SHARE CERTIFICATES



	Section 2.03

	. A register shall be kept at the principal office of the Trust or an office of the Trust's transfer agent which shall contain the
	names and addresses of the Shareholders of each Series, the number of Shares of that Series (or any class or classes thereof) held by
	them respectively and a record of all transfers thereof. As to Shares for which no certificate has been issued, such register shall be
	conclusive as to who are the holders of the Shares and who shall be entitled to receive dividends or other distributions or otherwise to
	exercise or enjoy the rights of Shareholders. No Shareholder shall be entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution, nor
	to have notice given to him as herein or in the Bylaws provided, until he has given his address to the transfer agent or such other officer or
	agent of the Trustees as shall keep the said register for entry thereon. The Trustees, in their discretion, may authorize the issuance of share
	certificates and promulgate appropriate rules and regulations as to their use. Such certificates may be issuable for any purpose limited in
	the Trustees discretion. In the event that one or more certificates are issued, whether in the name of a shareholder or a nominee, such
	certificate or certificates shall constitute evidence of ownership of Shares for all purposes, including transfer, assignment or sale of such
	Shares, subject to such limitations as the Trustees may, in their discretion, prescribe.


	TRANSFER OF SHARES



	Section 2.04

	. Except as otherwise provided by the Trustees, Shares shall be transferable on the records of the Trust only by the record
	holder thereof or by his agent thereunto duly authorized in writing, upon delivery to the Trustees or the Trust's transfer agent of a duly
	executed instrument of transfer, together with a Share certificate, if one is outstanding, and such evidence of the genuineness of each such
	execution and authorization and of such other matters as may be required by the Trustees. Upon such delivery the transfer shall be
	recorded on the register of the Trust. Until such record is made, the Shareholder of record shall be deemed to be the holder of such Shares
	for all purposes hereunder and neither the Trustees nor the Trust, nor any transfer agent or registrar nor any officer, employee or agent of
	the Trust shall be affected by any notice of the proposed transfer.


	TREASURY SHARES



	Section 2.05

	. Shares held in the treasury shall, until reissued pursuant to Section 2.02 hereof, not confer any voting rights on the
	Trustees, nor shall such Shares be entitled to any dividends or other distributions declared with respect to the Shares.


	ESTABLISHMENT OF SERIES



	Section 2.06

	. The Trust created hereby shall consist of one or more Series and separate and distinct records shall be maintained by the
	Trust for each Series and the assets associated with any such Series shall be held and accounted for separately from the assets of the Trust
	or any other Series. The Trustees shall have full power and authority, in their sole discretion, and without obtaining any prior authorization
	or vote of the Shareholders of any Series of the Trust, to establish and designate and to change in any manner any such Series of Shares
	or any classes of initial or additional Series and to fix such preferences, voting powers, rights and privileges of such Series or classes
	thereof as the Trustees may from time to time determine, to divide or combine the Shares or any Series or classes thereof into a greater or
	lesser number, to classify or reclassify any issued Shares or any Series or classes thereof into one or more Series or classes of Shares,
	and to take such other action with respect to the Shares as the Trustees may deem desirable. The establishment and designation of any
	Series shall be effective upon the adoption of a resolution by a majority of the Trustees setting forth such establishment and designation
	and the relative rights and preferences of the Shares of such Series, whether directly in such resolution or by reference to, or approval of,
	another document that sets forth such relative rights and preferences of the Shares of such Series including, without limitation, any
	registration statement of the Trust, or as otherwise provided in such resolution. A Series may issue any number of Shares and need not
	issue shares. At any time that there are no Shares outstanding of any particular Series previously established and designated, the Trustees
	may by a majority vote abolish that Series and the establishment and designation thereof.


	All references to Shares in this Trust Instrument shall be deemed to be Shares of any or all Series, or classes thereof, as the context may
	require. All provisions herein relating to the Trust shall apply equally to each Series of the Trust, and each class thereof, except as the
	context otherwise requires.


	Each Share of a Series of the Trust shall represent an equal beneficial interest in the net assets of such Series. Each holder of Shares of a
	Series shall be entitled to receive his pro rata share of distributions of income and capital gains, if any, made with respect to such Series.
	Upon redemption of his Shares, such Shareholder shall be paid solely out of the funds and property of such Series of the Trust.


	INVESTMENT IN THE TRUST



	Section 2.07

	. The Trustees shall accept investments in any Series of the Trust from such persons and on such terms as they may from
	time to time authorize. At the Trustees' discretion, such investments, subject to applicable law, may be in the form of cash or securities in
	which the affected Series is authorized to invest, valued as provided in Article IX, Section 9.03 hereof. Investments in a Series shall be
	credited to each Shareholder's account in the form of full Shares at the Net Asset Value per Share next determined after the investment is
	received; provided, however, that the Trustees may, in their sole discretion, (a) fix the Net Asset Value per Share of the initial capital
	contribution, (b) impose a sales charge or other fee upon investments in the Trust in such manner and at such time determined by the
	Trustees or (c) issue fractional Shares.


	ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF SERIES



	Section 2.08

	. All consideration received by the Trust for the issue or sale of Shares of a particular Series, together with all assets in
	which such consideration is invested or reinvested, all income, earnings, profits, and proceeds thereof, including any proceeds derived from
	the sale, exchange or liquidation of such assets, and any funds or payments derived from any reinvestment of such proceeds in whatever
	form the same may be, shall be held and accounted for separately from the other assets of the Trust and of every other Series and may be
	referred to herein as "assets belonging to" that Series. The assets belonging to a particular Series shall belong to that Series for all
	purposes, and to no other Series, subject only to the rights of creditors of that Series. In addition, any assets, income, earnings, profits or
	funds, or payments and proceeds with respect thereto, which are not readily identifiable as belonging to any particular Series shall be
	allocated by the Trustees between and among one or more of the Series in such manner as the Trustees, in their sole discretion, deem fair
	and equitable. Each such allocation shall be conclusive and binding upon the Shareholders of all Series for all purposes, and such assets,
	income, earnings, profits or funds, or payments and proceeds with respect thereto shall be assets belonging to that Series. The assets
	belonging to a particular Series shall be so recorded upon the books of the Trust, and shall be held by the Trustees in trust for the benefit
	of the holders of Shares of that Series. The assets belonging to each particular Series shall be charged with the liabilities of that Series and
	all expenses, costs, charges and reserves attributable to that Series. Any general liabilities, expenses, costs, charges or reserves of the Trust
	which are not readily identifiable as belonging to any particular Series shall be allocated and charged by the Trustees between or among any
	one or more of the Series in such manner as the Trustees in their sole discretion deem fair and equitable. Each such allocation shall be
	conclusive and binding upon the Shareholders of all Series for all purposes. Without limitation of the foregoing provisions of this Section
	2.08, but subject to the right of the Trustees in their discretion to allocate general liabilities, expenses, costs, charges or reserves as herein
	provided, the debts, liabilities, obligations and expenses incurred, contracted for or otherwise existing with respect to a particular Series
	shall be enforceable against the assets of such Series only, and not against the assets of the Trust generally. Notice of this limitation on
	inter-Series liabilities may, in the Trustee's sole discretion, be set forth in the certificate of trust of the Trust (whether originally or by
	amendment) as filed or to be filed in the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware pursuant to the Delaware Act, and upon
	the giving of such notice in the certificate of trust, the statutory provisions of Section 3804 of the Delaware Act relating to limitations on
	inter-Series liabilities (and the statutory effect under Section 3804 of setting forth such notice in the certificate of trust) shall become
	applicable to the Trust and each Series. Any person extending credit to, contracting with or having any claim against any Series may look
	only to the assets of that Series to satisfy or enforce any debt, liability, obligation or expense incurred, contracted for or otherwise existing
	with respect to that Series. No Shareholder or former Shareholder of any Series shall have a claim on or any right to any assets allocated
	or belonging to any other Series.


	NO PREEMPTIVE RIGHTS



	Section 2.09

	. Shareholders shall have no preemptive or other right to subscribe to any additional Shares or other securities issued by
	the Trust or the Trustees, whether of the same or other Series.


	PERSONAL LIABILITY OF SHAREHOLDERS



	Section 2.10

	. Each Shareholder of the Trust and of each Series shall not be personally liable for the debts, liabilities, obligations and
	expenses incurred by, contracted for, or otherwise existing with respect to, the Trust or by or on behalf of any Series. The Trustees shall
	have no power to bind any Shareholder personally or to call upon any Shareholder for the payment of any sum of money or assessment
	whatsoever other than such as the Shareholder may at any time personally agree to pay by way of subscription for any Shares or
	otherwise. Every note, bond, contract or other undertaking issued by or on behalf of the Trust or the Trustees relating to the Trust or to a
	Series shall include a recitation limiting the obligation represented thereby to the Trust or to one or more Series and its or their assets (but
	the omission of such a recitation shall not operate to bind any Shareholder or Trustee of the Trust).


	ASSENT TO TRUST INSTRUMENT



	Section 2.11

	. Every Shareholder, by virtue of having purchased a Share shall become a Shareholder and shall be held to have expressly
	assented and agreed to be bound by the terms hereof.


	ARTICLE III


	THE TRUSTEES


	MANAGEMENT OF THE TRUST



	Section 3.01

	. The Trustees shall have exclusive and absolute control over the Trust Property and over the business of the Trust to the
	same extent as if the Trustees were the sole owners of the Trust Property and business in their own right, but with such powers of
	delegation as may be permitted by this Trust Instrument. The Trustees shall have power to conduct the business of the Trust and carry on
	its operations in any and all of its branches and maintain offices both within and without the State of Delaware, in any and all states of the
	United States of America, in the District of Columbia, in any and all commonwealths, territories, dependencies, colonies, or possessions of
	the United States of America, and in any foreign jurisdiction and to do all such other things and execute all such instruments as they deem
	necessary, proper or desirable in order to promote the interests of the Trust although such things are not herein specifically mentioned. Any
	determination as to what is in the interests of the Trust made by the Trustees in good faith shall be conclusive. In construing the provisions
	of this Trust Instrument, the presumption shall be in favor of a grant of power to the Trustees.


	The enumeration of any specific power in this Trust Instrument shall not be construed as limiting the aforesaid power. The powers of
	the Trustees may be exercised without order of or resort to any court.


	Except for the Trustees named herein or appointed to fill vacancies pursuant to Section 3.04 of this Article III, the Trustees shall be
	elected by the Shareholders owning of record a plurality of the Shares voting at a meeting of Shareholders. Such a meeting shall be held
	on a date fixed by the Trustees. In the event that less than a majority of the Trustees holding office have been elected by Shareholders, the
	Trustees then in office will call a Shareholders' meeting for the election of Trustees.


	INITIAL TRUSTEES



	Section 3.02

	. The initial Trustees shall be the persons named herein. On a date fixed by the Trustees, the Shareholders shall elect at
	least three but not more than [twelve]

	fourteen

	Trustees, as specified by the Trustees pursuant to Section 3.06 of this Article III.


	TERM OF OFFICE OF TRUSTEES



	Section 3.03

	. The Trustees shall hold office during the lifetime of this Trust, and until its termination as herein provided; except (a) that
	any Trustee may resign his trust by written instrument signed by him and delivered to the other Trustees, which shall take effect upon such
	delivery or upon such later date as is specified therein; (b) that any Trustee may be removed at any time by written instrument, signed by
	at least two-thirds of the number of Trustees prior to such removal, specifying the date when such removal shall become effective; (c) that
	any Trustee who requests in writing to be retired or who has died, become physically or mentally incapacitated by reason of disease or
	otherwise, or is otherwise unable to serve, may be retired by written instrument signed by a majority of the other Trustees, specifying the
	date of his retirement; and (d) that a Trustee may be removed at any meeting of the Shareholders of the Trust by a vote of Shareholders
	owning at least two-thirds of the outstanding Shares.


	VACANCIES AND APPOINTMENT OF TRUSTEES



	Section 3.04

	. In case of the declination to serve, death, resignation, retirement, removal, physical or mental incapacity by reason of
	disease or otherwise, or a Trustee is otherwise unable to serve, or an increase in the number of Trustees, a vacancy shall occur. Whenever
	a vacancy in the Board of Trustees shall occur, until such vacancy is filled, the other Trustees shall have all the powers hereunder and the
	certificate of the other Trustees of such vacancy shall be conclusive. In the case of an existing vacancy, the remaining Trustees shall fill
	such vacancy by appointing such other person as they in their discretion shall see fit consistent with the limitations under the 1940 Act.
	Such appointment shall be evidenced by a written instrument signed by a majority of the Trustees in office or by resolution of the Trustees,
	duly adopted, which shall be recorded in the minutes of a meeting of the Trustees, whereupon the appointment shall take effect.


	An appointment of a Trustee may be made by the Trustees then in office in anticipation of a vacancy to occur by reason of retirement,
	resignation or increase in number of Trustees effective at a later date, provided that said appointment shall become effective only at or after
	the effective date of said retirement, resignation or increase in number of Trustees. As soon as any Trustee appointed pursuant to this
	Section 3.04 shall have accepted this trust, or at such date as may be specified in the acceptance whenever made, the trust estate shall
	vest in the new Trustee or Trustees, together with the continuing Trustees, without any further act or conveyance, and he shall be deemed a
	Trustee hereunder. The power to appoint a Trustee pursuant to this Section 3.04 is subject to the provisions of Section 16(a) of the 1940
	Act.


	TEMPORARY ABSENCE OF TRUSTEE



	Section 3.05

	. Any Trustee may, by power of attorney, delegate his power for a period not exceeding six months at any one time to any
	other Trustee or Trustees, provided that in no case shall less than two Trustees personally exercise the other powers hereunder except as
	herein otherwise expressly provided.


	NUMBER OF TRUSTEES



	Section 3.06

	. The number of Trustees shall be at least three, and thereafter shall be such number as shall be fixed from time to time by
	a majority of the Trustees, provided, however, that the number of Trustees shall in no event be more than [twelve (12)]

	fourteen (14)

	.


	EFFECT OF DEATH, RESIGNATION, ETC. OF A TRUSTEE



	Section 3.07

	. The declination to serve, death, resignation, retirement, removal, incapacity, or inability of the Trustees, or any one of
	them, shall not operate to terminate the Trust or to revoke any existing agency created pursuant to the terms of this Trust Instrument.


	OWNERSHIP OF ASSETS OF THE TRUST



	Section 3.08

	. The assets of the Trust and of each Series shall be held separate and apart from any assets now or hereafter held in any
	capacity other than as Trustee hereunder by the Trustees or any successor Trustees. Legal title in all of the assets of the Trust and the right
	to conduct any business shall at all times be considered as vested in the Trustees on behalf of the Trust, except that the Trustees may
	cause legal title to any Trust Property to be held by, or in the name of the Trust, or in the name of any person as nominee. No Shareholder
	shall be deemed to have a severable ownership in any individual asset of the Trust or of any Series or any right of partition or possession
	thereof, but each Shareholder shall have, except as otherwise provided for herein, a proportionate undivided beneficial interest in the Trust
	or Series. The Shares shall be personal property giving only the rights specifically set forth in this Trust Instrument.


	ARTICLE IV


	POWERS OF THE TRUSTEES

	matter affects the interests of more than one Series, then the Shareholders of all such Series shall be entitled to vote thereon. The Trustees
	may also determine that a matter affects only the interests of one or more classes of a Series, in which case any such matter shall be
	voted on by such class or classes. A shareholder of each Series shall be entitled to one vote for each dollar of net asset value (number of
	shares owned times net asset value per share) of such Series on any matter on which such shareholder is entitled to vote and each
	fractional dollar amount shall be entitled to a proportionate fractional vote. There shall be no cumulative voting in the election of Trustees.
	Shares may be voted in person or by proxy or in any manner provided for in the Bylaws. A proxy may be given in writing. The Bylaws may
	provide that proxies may also, or may instead, be given by any electronic or telecommunications device or in any other manner.
	Notwithstanding anything else herein or in the Bylaws, in the event a proposal by anyone other than the officers or Trustees of the Trust is
	submitted to a vote of the Shareholders of one or more Series or of the Trust, or in the event of any proxy contest or proxy solicitation or
	proposal in opposition to any proposal by the officers or Trustees of the Trust, Shares may be voted only in person or by written proxy.
	Until Shares are issued, the Trustees may exercise all rights of Shareholders and may take any action required or permitted by law, this
	Trust Instrument or any of the Bylaws of the Trust to be taken by Shareholders.


	MEETINGS



	Section 7.02

	. The first Shareholders' meeting shall be held in order to elect Trustees as specified in Section 3.02 of Article III hereof at
	the principal office of the Trust or such other place as the Trustees may designate. Meetings may be held within or without the State of
	Delaware. Special meetings of the Shareholders of any Series may be called by the Trustees and shall be called by the Trustees upon the
	written request of Shareholders owning at least one-tenth of the Outstanding Shares entitled to vote. Whenever ten or more Shareholders
	meeting the qualifications set forth in Section 16(c) of the 1940 Act, as the same may be amended from time to time, seek the opportunity
	of furnishing materials to the other Shareholders with a view to obtaining signatures on such a request for a meeting, the Trustees shall
	comply with the provisions of said Section 16(c) with respect to providing such Shareholders access to the list of the Shareholders of
	record of the Trust or the mailing of such materials to such Shareholders of record, subject to any rights provided to the Trust or any
	Trustees provided by said Section 16(c). Shareholders shall be entitled to at least fifteen (15) days' notice of any meeting.


	QUORUM AND REQUIRED VOTE



	Section 7.03

	. One-third of Shares entitled to vote in person or by proxy shall be a quorum for the transaction of business at a
	Shareholders' meeting, except that where any provision of law or of this Trust Instrument permits or requires that holders of any Series
	shall vote as a Series (or that holders of a class shall vote as a class), then one-third of the aggregate number of Shares of that Series (or
	that class) entitled to vote shall be necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business by that Series (or that class). Any
	lesser number shall be sufficient for adjournments. Any adjourned session or sessions may be held, within a reasonable time after the date
	set for the original meeting, without the necessity of further notice. Except when a larger vote is required by law or by any provision of this
	Trust Instrument or the Bylaws, a majority of the Shares voted in person or by proxy shall decide any questions and a plurality shall elect a
	Trustee, provided that where any provision of law or of this Trust Instrument permits or requires that the holders of any Series shall vote as
	a Series (or that the holders of any class shall vote as a class), then a majority of the Shares present in person or by proxy of that Series
	or, if required by law, a Majority Shareholder Vote of that Series (or class), voted on the matter in person or by proxy shall decide that
	matter insofar as that Series (or class) is concerned. Shareholders may act by unanimous written consent. Actions taken by Series (or
	class) may be consented to unanimously in writing by Shareholders of that Series.



	DERIVATIVE ACTIONS




	Section 7.04

	. In addition to the requirements set forth in Section 3816 of the Delaware Act, a Shareholder may bring derivative action on
	behalf of the Trust only if the Shareholder or Shareholders first make a pre-suit demand upon the Trustees to bring the subject action
	unless an effort to cause the Trustees to bring such action is excused. A demand on the Trustees shall only be excused if a majority of the
	Board of Trustees, or a majority of any committee established to consider the merits of such action, has a personal financial interest in the
	action at issue. A Trustee shall not be deemed to have a personal financial interest in an action or otherwise be disqualified from ruling on
	a Shareholder demand by virtue of the fact that such Trustee receives remuneration from his service on the Board of Trustees of the Trust
	or on the boards of one or more investment companies with the same or an affiliated investment advisor or underwriter.


	ARTICLE VIII


	CUSTODIAN


	APPOINTMENT AND DUTIES



	Section 8.01

	. The Trustees shall at all times employ a bank, a company that is a member of a national securities exchange, or a trust
	company, each having capital, surplus and undivided profits of at least two million dollars ($2,000,000) as custodian with authority as its
	agent, but subject to such restrictions, limitations and other requirements, if any, as may be contained in the Bylaws of the Trust:


	(1) to hold the securities owned by the Trust and deliver the same upon written order or oral order confirmed in writing, or by such
	electro-mechanical or electronic devices as are agreed to by the Trust and the custodian, if such procedures have been authorized in writing
	by the Trust;


	(2) to receive and receipt for any moneys due to the Trust and deposit the same in its own banking department or else where as the
	Trustees may direct;


	(3) to disburse such funds upon orders or vouchers;


	and the Trust may also employ such custodian as its agent:


	(4) to keep the books and accounts of the Trust or of any Series or class and furnish clerical and accounting services; and


	(5) to compute, if authorized to do so by the Trustees, the Net Asset Value of any Series, or class thereof, in accordance with the
	provisions hereof;


	all upon such basis of compensation as may be agreed upon between the Trustees and the custodian.


	The Trustees may also authorize the custodian to employ one or more sub-custodians from time to time to perform such of the acts
	and services of the custodian, and upon such terms and conditions, as may be agreed upon between the custodian and such sub-custodian
	and approved by the Trustees, provided that in every case such sub-custodian shall be a bank, a company that is a member of a national
	securities exchange, or a trust company organized under the laws of the United States or one of the states thereof and having capital,
	surplus and undivided profits of at least two million dollars ($2,000,000) or such other person as may be permitted by the Commission, or
	otherwise in accordance with the 1940 Act.


	CENTRAL CERTIFICATE SYSTEM



	Section 8.02.

	Subject to such rules, regulations and orders as the Commission may adopt, the Trustees may direct the custodian to
	deposit all or any part of the securities owned by the Trust in a system for the central handling of securities established by a national
	securities exchange or a national securities association registered with the Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
	amended, or such other person as may be permitted by the Commission, or otherwise in accordance with the 1940 Act, pursuant to which
	system all securities of any particular class or series of any issuer deposited within the system are treated as fungible and may be
	transferred or pledged by bookkeeping entry without physical delivery of such securities, provided that all such deposits shall be subject to
	withdrawal only upon the order of the Trust or its custodians, subcustodians or other agents.


	ARTICLE IX


	DISTRIBUTIONS AND REDEMPTIONS


	DISTRIBUTIONS



	Section 9.01.



	(a) The Trustees may from time to time declare and pay dividends or other distributions with respect to any Series. The amount of such
	dividends or distributions and the payment of them and whether they are in cash or any other Trust Property shall be wholly in the
	discretion of the Trustees.


	(b) Dividends and other distributions may be paid or made to the Shareholders of record at the time of declaring a dividend or other
	distribution or among the Shareholders of record at such other date or time or dates or times as the Trustees shall determine, which
	dividends or distributions, at the election of the Trustees, may be paid pursuant to a standing resolution or resolutions adopted only once
	or with such frequency as the Trustees may determine. The Trustees may adopt and offer to Shareholders such dividend reinvestment
	plans, cash dividend payout plans or related plans as the Trustees shall deem appropriate.


	(c) Anything in this Trust Instrument to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustees may at any time declare and distribute a dividend of
	stock or other property pro rata among the Shareholders of a particular Series, or class thereof, as of the record date of that Series fixed
	as provided in Section (b) hereof.


	REDEMPTIONS



	Section 9.02.

	In case any holder of record of Shares of a particular Series desires to dispose of his Shares or any portion thereof, he
	may deposit at the office of the transfer agent or other authorized agent of that Series a written request or such other form of request as
	the Trustees may from time to time authorize, requesting that the Series purchase the Shares in accordance with this Section 9.02; and the
	Shareholder so requesting shall be entitled to require the Series to purchase, and the Series or the principal underwriter of the Series shall
	purchase his said Shares, but only at the Net Asset Value thereof (as described in Section 9.03 of this Article IX). The Series shall make
	payment for any such Shares to be redeemed, as aforesaid, in cash or property from the assets of that Series and payment for such Shares
	less any applicable deferred sales charge and/or fees shall be made by the Series or the principal underwriter of the Series to the
	Shareholder of record within seven (7) days after the date upon which the request is effective. Upon redemption, shares shall become
	Treasury shares and may be re-issued from time to time.


	DETERMINATION OF NET ASSET VALUE AND VALUATION OF PORTFOLIO ASSETS



	Section 9.03.

	The term "Net Asset Value" of any Series shall mean that amount by which the assets of that Series exceed its liabilities,
	all as determined by or under the direction of the Trustees. Such value shall be determined separately for each Series and shall be
	determined on such days and at such times as the Trustees may determine. Such determination shall be made with respect to securities for
	which market quotations are readily available, at the market value of such securities; and with respect to other securities and assets, at the
	fair value as determined in good faith by the Trustees; provided, however, that the Trustees, without Shareholder approval, may alter the
	method of valuing portfolio securities insofar as permitted under the 1940 Act and the rules, regulations and interpretations thereof
	promulgated or issued by the Commission or insofar as permitted by any Order of the Commission applicable to the Series. The Trustees
	may delegate any of their powers and duties under this Section 9.03 with respect to valuation of assets and liabilities. The resulting
	amount, which shall represent the total Net Asset Value of the particular Series, shall be divided by the total number of shares of that
	Series outstanding at the time and the quotient so obtained shall be the Net Asset Value per Share of that Series. At any time, the Trustees
	may cause the Net Asset Value per Share last determined to be determined again in similar manner and may fix the time when such
	redetermined value shall become effective. If, for any reason, the net income of any Series, determined at any time, is a negative amount,
	the Trustees shall have the power with respect to that Series (i) to offset each Shareholder's pro rata share of such negative amount from
	the accrued dividend account of such Shareholder, or (ii) to reduce the number of Outstanding Shares of such Series by reducing the
	number of Shares in the account of each Shareholder by a pro rata portion of that number of full and fractional Shares which represents
	the amount of such excess negative net income, or (iii) to cause to be recorded on the books of such Series an asset account in the
	amount of such negative net income (provided that the same shall thereupon become the property of such Series with respect to such
	Series and shall not be paid to any Shareholder), which account may be reduced by the amount, of dividends declared thereafter upon the
	Outstanding Shares of such Series on the day such negative net income is experienced, until such asset account is reduced to zero; (iv) to
	combine the methods described in clauses (i) and (ii) and (iii) of this sentence; or (v) to take any other action they deem appropriate, in
	order to cause (or in order to assist in causing) the Net Asset Value per Share of such Series to remain at a constant amount per
	Outstanding Share immediately after each such determination and declaration. The Trustees shall also have the power not to declare a
	dividend out of net income for the purpose of causing the Net Asset Value per Share to be increased. The Trustees shall not be required to
	adopt, but may at any time adopt, discontinue or amend the practice of maintaining the Net Asset Value per Share of the Series at a
	constant amount.


	SUSPENSION OF THE RIGHT OF REDEMPTION



	Section 9.04.

	The Trustees may declare a suspension of the right of redemption or postpone the date of payment as permitted under the
	1940 Act. Such suspension shall take effect at such time as the Trustees shall specify but not later than the close of business on the
	business day next following the declaration of suspension, and thereafter there shall be no right of redemption or payment until the
	Trustees shall declare the suspension at an end. In the case of a suspension of the right of redemption, a Shareholder may either withdraw
	his request for redemption or receive payment based on the Net Asset Value per Share next determined after the termination of the
	suspension. In the event that any Series is divided into classes, the provisions of this Section 9.04, to the extent applicable as determined
	in the discretion of the Trustees and consistent with applicable law, may be equally applied to each such class.


	REDEMPTION OF SHARES



	Section 9.05

	. The Trustees may require Shareholders to redeem Shares for any reason under terms set by the Trustees, including, but
	not limited to, (i) the determination of the Trustees that direct or indirect ownership of Shares of any Series has or may become
	concentrated in such Shareholder to an extent that would disqualify any Series as a regulated investment company under the Internal
	Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (or any successor statute thereto), (ii) the failure of a Shareholder to supply a tax identification number
	if required to do so, or (iii) the failure of a Shareholder to pay when due for the purchase of Shares issued to him. The redemption shall be
	effected at the redemption price and in the manner provided in this Article IX.


	The holders of Shares shall upon demand disclose to the Trustees in writing such information with respect to direct and indirect ownership
	of Shares as the Trustees deem necessary to comply with the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, or to comply with the requirements
	of any other taxing authority.


	ARTICLE X


	LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION


	LIMITATION OF LIABILITY



	Section 10.01.

	Neither a Trustee nor an officer of the Trust when acting in such capacity, shall be personally liable to any person other
	than the Trust or a beneficial owner for any act, omission or obligation of the Trust, any Trustee or any officer of the Trust. Neither a
	Trustee nor an officer of the Trust shall be liable for any act or omission or any conduct whatsoever in his capacity as Trustee or officer of
	the Trust, provided that nothing contained herein or in the Delaware Act shall protect any Trustee or any officer of the Trust against any
	liability to the Trust or to Shareholders to which he would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence
	or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of the office of Trustee or Officer hereunder.


	INDEMNIFICATION



	Section 10.02.



	(a) Subject to the exceptions and limitations contained in Section (b) below:


	(i) every Person who is, or has been, a Trustee or officer of the Trust (hereinafter referred to as a "Covered Person") shall be
	indemnified by the Trust to the fullest extent permitted by law against liability and against all expenses reasonably incurred or paid by him
	in connection with any claim, action, suit or proceeding in which he becomes involved as a party or otherwise by virtue of his being or
	having been a Trustee or officer and against amounts paid or incurred by him in the settlement thereof;


	(ii) the words "claim," "action," "suit," or "proceeding" shall apply to all claims, actions, suits or proceedings (civil, criminal or
	other, including appeals), actual or threatened while in office or thereafter, and the words "liability" and "expenses" shall include, without
	limitation, attorneys' fees, costs, judgments, amounts paid in settlement, fines, penalties and other liabilities.


	(b) No indemnification shall be provided hereunder to a Covered Person:


	(i) who shall have been adjudicated by a court or body before which the proceeding was brought (A) to be liable to the Trust or
	its Shareholders by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of
	his office or (B) not to have acted in good faith in the reasonable belief that his action was in the best interest of the Trust; or


	(ii) in the event of a settlement, unless there has been a determination that such Trustee or officer did not engage in willful
	misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of his office,


	(A) by the court or other body approving the settlement;


	(B) by at least a majority of those Trustees who are neither Interested Persons of the Trust nor are parties to the matter based
	upon a review of readily available facts (as opposed to a full trial-type inquiry); or


	(C) by written opinion of independent legal counsel based upon a review of readily available facts (as opposed to a full trial-type
	inquiry);


	provided, however, that any Shareholder may, by appropriate legal proceedings, challenge any such determination by the Trustees or by
	independent counsel.


	(c) The rights of indemnification herein provided may be insured against by policies maintained by the Trust, shall be severable, shall
	not be exclusive of or affect any other rights to which any Covered Person may now or hereafter be entitled, shall continue as to a person
	who has ceased to be a Covered Person and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person. Nothing
	contained herein shall affect any rights to indemnification to which Trust personnel, other than Covered Persons, and other persons may be
	entitled by contract or otherwise under law.


	(d) Expenses in connection with the preparation and presentation of a defense to any claim, action, suit or proceeding of the character
	described in paragraph (a) of this Section 10.02 may be paid by the Trust or Series from time to time prior to final disposition thereof upon
	receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Covered Person that such amount will be paid over by him to the Trust or Series if it is
	ultimately determined that he is not entitled to indemnification under this Section 10.02; provided, however, that either (a) such Covered
	Person shall have provided appropriate security for such undertaking, (b) the Trust is insured against losses arising out of any such
	advance payments or (c) either a majority of the Trustees who are neither Interested Persons of the Trust nor parties to the matter, or
	independent legal counsel in a written opinion, shall have determined, based upon a review of readily available facts (as opposed to a
	trial-type inquiry or full investigation), that there is reason to believe that such Covered Person will be found entitled to indemnification
	under this Section 10.02.


	SHAREHOLDERS



	Section 10.03.

	In case any Shareholder or former Shareholder of any Series shall be held to be personally liable solely by reason of his
	being or having been a Shareholder of such Series and not because of his acts or omissions or for some other reason, the Shareholder or
	former Shareholder (or his heirs, executors, administrators or other legal representatives, or, in the case of a corporation or other entity, its
	corporate or other general successor) shall be entitled out of the assets belonging to the applicable Series to be held harmless from and
	indemnified against all loss and expense arising from such liability. The Trust, on behalf of the affected Series, shall, upon request by the
	Shareholder, assume the defense of any claim made against the Shareholder for any act or obligation of the Series and satisfy any
	judgment thereon from the assets of the Series.


	ARTICLE XI


	MISCELLANEOUS


	TRUST NOT A PARTNERSHIP



	Section 11.01.

	It is the intention of the Trustees to create a business trust pursuant to the Delaware Act. It is not the intention of the
	Trustees to create a general partnership, limited partnership, joint stock association, corporation, bailment, or any form of legal relationship
	other than a business trust pursuant to the Delaware Act. No Trustee hereunder shall have any power to bind personally either the Trust's
	officers or any Shareholder. All persons extending credit to, contracting with or having any claim against the Trust or the Trustees shall look
	only to the assets of the appropriate Series or (if the Trustees shall have yet to have established Series) of the Trust for payment under
	such credit, contract or claim; and neither the Shareholders nor the Trustees, nor any of their agents, whether past, present or future, shall
	be personally liable therefor. Nothing in this Trust Instrument shall protect a Trustee against any liability to which the Trustee would
	otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the
	conduct of the office of Trustee hereunder.


	TRUSTEE'S GOOD FAITH ACTION, EXPERT ADVICE, NO BOND OR SURETY



	Section 11.02.

	The exercise by the Trustees or the officers of the Trust of their powers and discretions hereunder in good faith and with
	reasonable care under the circumstances then prevailing shall be binding upon everyone interested. Subject to the provisions of Article X
	hereof and to Section 11.01 of this Article XI, the Trustees or the officers of the Trust shall not be liable for errors of judgment or mistakes
	of fact or law. The Trustees and the officers of the Trust may take advice of counsel or other experts with respect to the meaning and
	operation of this Trust Instrument, and subject to the provisions of Article X hereof and Section 11.01 of this Article XI, shall be under no
	liability for any act or omission in accordance with such advice or for failing to follow such advice. The Trustees and the officers of the
	Trust shall not be required to give any bond as such, nor any surety if a bond is obtained.


	ESTABLISHMENT OF RECORD DATES



	Section 11.03.

	The Trustees may close the Share transfer books of the Trust for a period not exceeding sixty (60) days preceding the
	date of any meeting of Shareholders, or the date for the payment of any dividends or other distributions, or the date for the allotment of
	rights, or the date when any change or conversion or exchange of Shares shall go into effect; or in lieu of closing the stock transfer books
	as aforesaid, the Trustees may fix in advance a date, not exceeding sixty (60) days preceding the date of any meeting of Shareholders, or
	the date for payment of any dividend or other distribution, or the date for the allotment of rights, or the date when any change or
	conversion or exchange of Shares shall go into effect, as a record date for the determination of the Shareholders entitled to notice of, and
	to vote at, any such meeting, or entitled to receive payment of any such dividend or other distribution, or to any such allotment of rights,
	or to exercise the rights in respect of any such change, conversion or exchange of Shares, and in such case such Shareholders and only
	such Shareholders as shall be Shareholders of record on the date so fixed shall be entitled to such notice of, and to vote at, such meeting,
	or to receive payment of such dividend or other distribution, or to receive such allotment or rights, or to exercise such rights, as the case
	may be, notwithstanding any transfer of any Shares on the books of the Trust after any such record date fixed as aforesaid.

	[Section 11.04]

	Article XI

	.

	adequate consideration which may include the assumption of all outstanding obligations, taxes and other liabilities, accrued or

	interests of such trust, partnership, association or corporation or of a series thereof; or]

	ratably among the holders of Shares of that Series then outstanding.]


	[(c) Upon completion of the distribution of the remaining proceeds or the remaining assets as provided in sub-section (b), the
	Trust or any affected Series shall terminate and the Trustees and the Trust shall be discharged of any and all further liabilities and duties
	hereunder and the right, title and interest of all parties with respect to the Trust or Series shall be cancelled and discharged.]


	[Upon termination of the Trust, following completion of winding up of its business, the Trustees shall cause a certificate of cancellation of
	the Trust's certificate of trust to be filed in accordance with the Delaware Act, which certificate of cancellation may be signed by any one
	Trustee.]

	TERMINATION OF THE TRUST, A SERIES OR A CLASS




	Section 11.05.




	(a) Subject to applicable Federal and state law, the Trust or any Series or class thereof may be terminated (i) by Majority
	Shareholder Vote of the Trust, each Series affected, or each class affected, as the case may be; or (ii) without the vote or consent of
	Shareholders by a majority of the Trustees either at a meeting or by written consent. The Trustees shall provide written notice to the
	affected Shareholders of a termination effected under clause (ii) above. Upon the termination of the Trust or the Series or class, (i) the
	Trust or the Series or class shall carry on no business except for the purpose of winding up its affairs; (ii) the Trustees shall proceed to
	wind up the affairs of the Trust or the Series or class, and all of the powers of the Trustees under this Trust Instrument shall continue until
	the affairs of the Trust shall have been wound up, including the power to fulfill or discharge the contracts of the Trust or the Series or class
	thereof; collect its assets; sell, convey, assign, exchange, transfer, or otherwise dispose of all or any part of the remaining Trust property or
	Trust property allocated or belonging to such Series or class to one or more persons at public or private sale for consideration that may
	consist in whole or in part of cash, securities, or other property of any kind; discharge or pay its liabilities; and do all other acts appropriate
	to liquidate its business; and (iii) after paying or adequately providing for the payment of all liabilities, and upon receipt of such releases,
	indemnities, and refunding agreements as they deem necessary for their protection, the Trustees may distribute the remaining Trust
	property or the remaining property of the terminated Series or class, in cash or in kind or partly each, among the Shareholders of the Trust
	or the Series or class according to their respective rights; and




	(b) Upon completion of the distribution of the remaining proceeds or the remaining assets as provided in sub-section (a),
	the Trust or any affected Series or class thereof shall terminate and the Trustees and the Trust shall be discharged of any and all further
	liabilities and duties hereunder and the right, title and interest of all parties with respect to the Trust, Series or class shall be cancelled and
	discharged. Upon termination of the Trust, following completion of winding up of its business, the Trustees shall cause a certificate of
	cancellation of the Trust's certificate of trust to be filed in accordance with the Delaware Act, which certificate of cancellation may be signed
	by any one Trustee.




	MERGER; CONSOLIDATION; AND SALE OF ASSETS




	Section 11.06. Subject to applicable Federal and state law, the Trust or any Series or class thereof may merge or consolidate with
	any other corporation, association, trust, or other organization or may sell, lease, or exchange all or a portion of the Trust property or Trust
	property allocated or belonging to such Series or class, including its good will, upon such terms and conditions and for such consideration
	when and as authorized by the Trustees without the vote or consent of Shareholders. Such transactions may be effected through
	share-for-share exchanges, transfers or sale of assets, shareholder in-kind redemptions and purchases, exchange offers, or any other
	method approved by the Trustees. Any agreement of merger or consolidation or certificate of merger may be signed by a majority of

	FILING OF COPIES, REFERENCES, HEADINGS



	Section [11.06] 11.08

	. The original or a copy of this Trust Instrument and of each amendment hereof or Trust Instrument supplemental
	hereto shall be kept at the office of the Trust where it may be inspected by any Shareholder. A supplemental trust instrument executed by
	any one Trustee may be relied upon as a Supplement hereof. Anyone dealing with the Trust may rely on a certificate by an officer or Trustee
	of the Trust as to whether or not any such amendments or supplements have been made and as to any matters in connection with the
	Trust hereunder, and with the same effect as if it were the original, may rely on a copy certified by an officer or Trustee of the Trust to be a
	copy of this Trust Instrument or of any such amendment or supplemental Trust Instrument. In this Trust Instrument or in any such
	amendment or supplemental Trust Instrument, references to this Trust Instrument, and all expressions like "herein," "hereof" and
	"hereunder," shall be deemed to refer to this Trust Instrument as amended or affected by any such supplemental Trust Instrument. All
	expressions like "his", "he" and "him", shall be deemed to include the feminine and neuter, as well as masculine, genders. Headings are
	placed herein for convenience of reference only and in case of any conflict, the text of this Trust Instrument, rather than the headings, shall
	control. This Trust Instrument may be executed in any number of counterparts each of which shall be deemed an original.


	APPLICABLE LAW



	Section [11.07] 11.09

	. The trust set forth in this instrument is made in the State of Delaware, and the Trust and this Trust Instrument,
	and the rights and obligations of the Trustees and Shareholders hereunder, are to be governed by and construed and administered
	according to the Delaware Act and the laws of said State; provided, however, that there shall not be applicable to the Trust, the Trustees or
	this Trust Instrument (a) the provisions of Section 3540 of Title 12 of the Delaware Code or (b) any provisions of the laws (statutory or
	common) of the State of Delaware (other than the Delaware Act) pertaining to trusts which relate to or regulate (i) the filing with any court
	or governmental body or agency of trustee accounts or schedules of trustee fees and charges, (ii) affirmative requirements to post bonds
	for trustees, officers, agents or employees of a trust, (iii) the necessity for obtaining court or other governmental approval concerning the
	acquisition, holding or disposition of real or personal property, (iv) fees or other sums payable to trustees, officers, agents or employees of
	a trust, (v) the allocation of receipts and expenditures to income or principal, (vi) restrictions or limitations on the permissible nature,
	amount or concentration of trust investments or requirements relating to the titling, storage or other manner of holding of trust assets, or
	(vii) the establishment of fiduciary or other standards or responsibilities or limitations on the acts or powers of trustees, which are
	inconsistent with the limitations or liabilities or authorities and powers of the Trustees set forth or referenced in this Trust Instrument. The
	Trust shall be of the type commonly called a "business trust", and without limiting the provisions hereof, the Trust may exercise all powers
	which are ordinarily exercised by such a trust under Delaware law. The Trust specifically reserves the right to exercise any of the powers or
	privileges afforded to trusts or actions that may be engaged in by trusts under the Delaware Act, and the absence of a specific reference
	herein to any such power, privilege or action shall not imply that the Trust may not exercise such power or privilege or take such actions.


	AMENDMENTS



	Section [11.08] 11.10

	. Except as specifically provided herein, the Trustees may, without shareholder vote, amend or otherwise
	supplement this Trust Instrument by making an amendment, a Trust Instrument supplemental hereto or an amended and restated Trust
	Instrument. Shareholders shall have the right to vote (i) on any amendment which would affect their right to vote granted in Section 7.01 of
	Article VII hereof, (ii) on any amendment to this Section 11.08, (iii) on any amendment as may be required by law or by the Trust's
	registration statement filed with the Commission and (iv) on any amendment submitted to them by the Trustees. Any amendment required
	or permitted to be submitted to Shareholders which, as the Trustees determine, shall affect the Shareholders of one or more Series shall be
	authorized by vote of the Shareholders of each Series affected and no vote of shareholders of a Series not affected shall be required.
	Notwithstanding anything else herein, any amendment to Article 10 hereof shall not limit the rights to indemnification or insurance provided
	therein with respect to action or omission of Covered Persons prior to such amendment.


	FISCAL YEAR



	Section [11.09] 11.11

	. The fiscal year of the Trust shall end on a specified date as set forth in the Bylaws, provided, however, that the
	Trustees may, without Shareholder approval, change the fiscal year of the Trust.


	USE OF THE WORD "FIDELITY"



	Section [11.10] 11.12

	. Fidelity Management & Research Company ("FMR") has consented to, and granted a non-exclusive license for,
	the use by any Series or by the Trust of the identifying word "Fidelity" or "Spartan" in the name of any Series or of the Trust. Such consent
	is subject to revocation by FMR in its discretion, if FMR or subsidiary or affiliate thereof is not employed as the investment adviser of each
	Series of the Trust. As between the Trust and FMR, FMR controls the use of the name of the Trust insofar as such name contains the
	identifying word "Fidelity" or "Spartan." FMR may, from time to time, use the identifying word "Fidelity" or "Spartan" in other connections
	and for other purposes, including, without limitation, in the names of other investment companies, corporations or businesses which it may
	manage, advise, sponsor or own or in which it may have a financial interest. FMR may require the Trust or any Series thereof to cease
	using the identifying word "Fidelity" or "Spartan" in the name of the Trust or any Series thereof if the Trust or any Series thereof ceases to
	employ FMR or a subsidiary or affiliate thereof as investment adviser.


	PROVISIONS IN CONFLICT WITH LAW



	Section [11.11] 11.13

	. The provisions of this Trust Instrument are severable, and if the Trustees shall determine, with the advice of
	counsel, that any of such provisions is in conflict with the 1940 Act, the regulated investment company provisions of the Internal Revenue
	Code or with other applicable laws and regulations, the conflicting provision shall be deemed never to have constituted a part of this Trust
	Instrument; provided, however, that such determination shall not affect any of the remaining provisions of this Trust Instrument or render
	invalid or improper any action taken or omitted prior to such determination. If any provision of this Trust Instrument shall be held invalid or
	unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity or unenforceability shall attach only to such provision in such jurisdiction and shall not in
	any manner affect such provisions in any other jurisdiction or any other provision of this Trust Instrument in any jurisdiction.


	IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned, being all of the Trustees of the Trust, have executed this instrument as of the date set forth
	above.
