Dermira, Inc. Key Developments

UCB and Dermira Announce U.S. and EU Regulatory Submissions for CIMZIA® (certolizumab pegol) for the Treatment of Moderate-to-Severe Chronic Plaque Psoriasis
Jul 25 17
UCB and Dermira, Inc. announced the UCB submission of a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for CIMZIA® (certolizumab pegol). Separately, UCB also submitted a regulatory filing with the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Both regulatory filings seek to expand the approved indications for CIMZIA to include treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis. An additional submission to expand the use of CIMZIA in this patient population is also planned with Health Canada. The Phase 3 CIMZIA clinical development program in psoriasis was led by Dermira, Inc., in collaboration with UCB as the regulatory sponsor. Under the terms of the agreement announced in July 2014, Dermira obtained exclusive rights to develop CIMZIA in psoriasis in the United States, Canada and the EU. Subject to regulatory approval of CIMZIA in psoriasis, Dermira is granted an exclusive commercial license to market CIMZIA to dermatologists in the United States and Canada. UCB will retain marketing rights for CIMZIA in the U.S. and Canada for rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohn’s disease and ankylosing spondylitis. In the rest of world, UCB retains marketing rights for CIMZIA for all approved indications, including psoriasis, subject to approval.


Dermira, Inc. Announces the publication of Findings from Nonclinical Studies Evaluating the Mechanism of Action for Olumacostat Glasaretil
Jun 26 17
Dermira, Inc. announced that findings from nonclinical studies evaluating the mechanism of action for olumacostat glasaretil (formerly DRM01) in sebum inhibition were published in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology (JID). In cultures of sebaceous cells, Dermira analyzed the effects of olumacostat glasaretil on the composition of sebum lipids. These studies revealed a reduction in saturated and monounsaturated fatty acyl chains that can give rise to the inflammatory response in acne. In addition, in animal models, it was shown that topical application of olumacostat glasaretil accumulated in sebaceous glands relative to the surrounding dermis and significantly reduced sebaceous gland size. Olumacostat glasaretil is a novel, small molecule designed to target sebum production following topical application in Phase 3 development as a treatment for patients with acne vulgaris. Olumacostat glasaretil is designed to exert its effect by inhibiting acetyl coenzyme-A carboxylase (ACC), the enzyme that plays an important role in the synthesis of more than 80% of the lipids that make up sebum. Sebum, an oily substance made up of lipids, is produced by glands in the skin called sebaceous glands. An approved topical product that targets sebum production does not currently exist. Results from a Phase 2b clinical trial evaluating topically applied olumacostat glasaretil in patients with facial acne vulgaris were reported in May 2016. Olumacostat glasaretil is currently being evaluated in two Phase 3 trials, CLAREOS-1 and CLAREOS-2, assessing its safety and efficacy in adults and adolescents with facial acne vulgaris. An additional open-label trial, CLARITUDE, is evaluating the long-term safety of olumacostat glasaretil. Topline results from the CLAREOS-1 and CLAREOS-2 trials are expected in the first half of 2018.
