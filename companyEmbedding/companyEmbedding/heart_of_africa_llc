Heart of Africa vol.2


  CD-Audio $99 
    CD-ROM $199  - Akai






Heart of Africa vol.2

    Heart of Africa Volume Two features rare performances recorded live at a two week tribal competition in Kenya. Authentic choir and vocal shouts, chants and polyrhythmic percussion ensemble grooves from the Maasai, Kikuyu, Meru, Pokot, and Nandi peoples. A collection of powerfully primal and untamed tribal ensemble phrases and SFX that perfectly compliment the instruments and loops from Volume one. Presented in song construction format. 
The Heart of Africa series has been produced with the same standard of excellence as the renown Heart of Asia library.

Review Quotes
"Spectrasonics has unleashed another world music monster in Heart of Africa...The emotion, energy and spontaneity of the performances is wonderful...The vocal performance samples in Vol. 2 are strongly evocative...a vocal solo might include yodels, gargles, or blurbles a an integral part of the line: We're talking flavor here...the tapes were recorded on location, but the sound is surprisingly clean and consistent throughout...The fact that you're hearing segments from one song rather than isolated excerpts gives you a lot more ways to build a piece. you don't have to just grab a two-bar bit and loop it...An amazing assortment of musical experiences that any sampler owner can use...if you'd like to spice up your tracks with a dose of real African flavor, it's hard to see how you could go wrong with Heart of Africa vol.2"

Review Quotes


    "...draws a parallel with their earlier and very excellent Heart of Asia collection, though to my mind, Heart of Africa is far more exciting...I was immediately impressed by both the clarity and power of the recordings...the African choir and vocal sounds are simply stunning...beautifully multisampled with lots of depth...Mere description does little justice to this collection of samples. It's quite simply the most fantastic collection of ethnic sounds I've heard from a single source."
-Sound on Sound Magazine 
"Spectrasonics has unleashed another world music monster in Heart of Africa...a feast of auditory delights...The emotion, energy and spontaneity of the performances is wonderful...It's great that Spectrasonics has captured the buzzes and rattles that adorn the sounds of many African wind and percussion instruments, since they are an essential expressive element in African music...The CD-ROM versions have plenty of musical resources, and far more stuff than we can describe...the best material may be the traditional tribal choir phrases, but you'll also find plenty of playable kalimbas, snappy clay pot percussion and gorgeous balaphone multisamples...the log drums are very deep and meaty, and the marimbas wonderfully dynamic...I was delighted to find lots of crisp udu samples, with no less than 64 separate samples laid out across the keyboard in a single program......An amazing assortment of musical experiences that any sampler owner can use...if you'd like to spice up your tracks with a dose of real African flavor, it's hard to see how you could go wrong with Heart of Africa vol.1"

Description
“In The Heart Of Africa” is a set of fast-play wargames rules for the period of exploration and imperial conquest in tropical Africa. Chronologically this corresponds roughly to the second half of the 19th century, while geographically it covers the region between the Zambezi River in the south, and the edge of the Sahara Desert in the north – the classic “Darkest Africa” of the explorers. This has been a popular period for skirmishing, role playing, and conventional wargames. This is not surprising, as it has a number of unique advantages. It rivals the ancient and medieval periods in the enormous variety of possible armies, each with its own distinctive – and often spectacular – appearance. It shares the “Boy’s Own Adventure” atmosphere of ordinary colonial gaming, but is far more interesting as a game: the Africans have more tactical options to choose from than the Zulu or Dervish charge, while the Europeans have a less decisive advantage in weaponry. And unlike many exotic and colorful periods it is relatively well known and accessible, with plenty of primary sources available in English – Livingstone, Stanley and several others are still household names to this day.
The army lists covered in the main rule book are:
The Native Kingdom
The Native Warlord
The Peaceful Villagers
The Warrior Herdsmen
The Jungle Cannibals
The Pygmies
The Zanzibaris
The Sudanese Slavers
The Portuguese Settlers
The White Explorers
The Egyptians
The Colonial Expedition
