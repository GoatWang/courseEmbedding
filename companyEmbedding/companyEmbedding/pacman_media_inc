Our offering is being made on a self-underwritten basis: no minimum number of
shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed. The offering price per
share is $0.01. The following table sets forth the uses of proceeds assuming the
sale of 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%, respectively, of the securities offered for sale
by the Company. There is no assurance that we will raise the full $90,000 as
anticipated. Assuming the sale of only a smaller portion of the offering such as
ten or fifteen percent of the proposed offering the Company will be in a
position where it will need to make loans in order to supplement cash amount to
reach the least amount raised  proposed in the use table bellow.

Gross proceeds                              $22,500   $45,000   $67,500   $90,000

In the event that only $22,500 is raised from this offering, Dragon license cost
will be covered by director loan.

The amounts actually spent by us for any specific purpose may vary and will
depend on a number of factors. Non-fixed cost, sales and marketing and general
and administrative costs may vary depending on the business progress  and
development efforts, general business conditions and market reception to our
services. Accordingly, our management has broad discretion to allocate the net
proceeds to non-fixed costs.

An example of changes to this spending  allocation  for non-fixed  costs include
management deciding to spend less of the allotment on product development and
more on sales and marketing.  

If necessary, Mr. Evans, our officer and director, has verbally agreed to loan
the company funds to complete the registration process but we will require
funding of a minimum funding scenario, displayed in our Use of Proceeds table,
therefore to implement our complete business plan. If insufficient funds are
raised we plan to borrow funds from our management. However the agreement with
Mr. Evans to provide funding is non-binding and there is no guarantee that he
will provide such funding.


From our research we find that as of May 2015 there were 1.4 million apps
available for download from the Apple Store compared to 900,000 in June 2013. So
to us the market seems to be increasingly crowded and in order for our apps to
stick out from the crowd they need to have superior and innovative design
qualities. The risks in this area are that our apps are not innovative enough to
stick out in a crowd of 1.4 million. Also established competitors could launch a
similar app in the same period and outperform us promotionally by aggressively
marketing their product using their own established advertising strategies. Most
ominously, rivals with larger economies of scale could steal our idea and design
an app with similar functions but superior design features. All of this will
have direct impact on our possible revenues and investors should strongly
consider this risk before investing any money with Pacman Media.


Company Description
Pacman Media is a new venture, which intends to specialize in the creation of
mobile apps (applications) to be used on mobile devices, specifically
smartphones and tablet computers. The apps are planned to be designed using
voice recognition software and their purpose is to make it possible to


 continue
work, on say a word document, even if the user is away from their desktop
computer. Therefore our apps meant to be specifically designed for users who are
‘on the move’ be it stuck in traffic, waiting for a train or pounding the
sidewalk.

We intend to cater industry professionals and those desiring to join their ranks
such students. Once produced we plan to sell the apps in the region of $10.
