Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI) is one of three United States performing rights organizations, along with ASCAP and SESAC. It collects license fees on behalf of songwriters, composers, and music publishers and distributes them as royalties to those members whose works have been performed. In FY 2015, BMI collected more than $1.013 billion in licensing fees and distributed $877 million in royalties.[2]
BMI songwriters create music in many genres, ranging from mainstream pop and country, to death metal and hip hop. BMI represents artists such as Selena, Demi Lovato, Fifth Harmony, Lil Wayne, Birdman, Lady Gaga, Taylor Swift, Eminem, Rihanna and Shakira and Ed Sheeran; bands as diverse as Maroon 5, Evanescence, Nickelback and Linkin Park; Sam Cooke, Willie Nelson, Fats Domino and Dolly Parton; as well as composers such as Harry Gregson-Williams, John Williams and Danny Elfman and musical songwriters Richard & Robert Sherman. BMI also represents Michael Jackson's music catalog, Sony/ATV Music Publishing, which features the late artist's music as well as the largest repertoire of any catalog in history.[3]

History[edit]
In the 1930s, radio was coming to prominence as a source of musical entertainment that threatened to weaken record sales and opportunities for "live" acts. The Great Depression was already draining artist revenues from recordings and live performances. ASCAP, the pre-eminent royalty/licensing agency for more than two decades, required radio stations to subscribe to "blanket" licenses granting ASCAP a fixed percentage of each station's revenue, regardless of how much music the station played from ASCAP's repertoire. In 1939, ASCAP announced a substantial increase in the revenue share licensees would be required to pay. BMI was founded by the National Association of Broadcasters to provide a lower-cost alternative to ASCAP.[4] As such, BMI created competition in the field of performing rights, providing an alternative source of licensing for all music users.
The vast majority of U.S. radio stations and all three radio networks refused to renew their ASCAP licenses for 1941, choosing to forgo playing ASCAP music entirely and relying on the BMI repertoire. In February 1941, BMI and the Department of Justice entered into a consent decree, requiring certain changes to BMI's business model, including giving licensees the option of paying only for the music they actually use instead of buying a blanket license.[5] The U.S. District Court in Milwaukee was chosen by the Justice Department to supervise the decree for both BMI and ASCAP.[6]
Competing against the strongly established ASCAP, BMI sought out artists that ASCAP tended to overlook or ignore. BMI also purchased the rights to numerous catalogs held by independent publishers or whose ASCAP contracts were about to expire. To attract newer writers, BMI proposed to compensate songwriters and publishers on the basis of a fixed fee per performance, as opposed to ASCAP's two-tier system which discriminated against less-established songwriters. Thus, despite its original motivation regarding radio station royalties and its focus on radio station revenues vs artist revenues, BMI became the first performing rights organization in the United States to represent songwriters of blues, jazz, rhythm and blues, gospel (black genres, performers, and writers that ASCAP did not want to represent), country, folk, Latin, and—ultimately—rock and roll. During the 1940s and 1950s, BMI was the primary licensing organization for Country artists and R&B artists, while ASCAP centered on more established Pop artists. Also during this time, BMI expanded its repertoire of classical music, and now represents the majority[7] of the members of the prestigious American Academy of Arts and Letters and the winners of 31[8] Pulitzer Prizes for Music.

Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI) is one of three United States performing rights organizations, along with ASCAP and SESAC. It collects license fees on behalf of songwriters, composers, and music publishers and distributes them as royalties to those members whose works have been performed. In FY 2015, BMI collected more than $1.013 billion in licensing fees and distributed $877 million in royalties.[2]
BMI songwriters create music in many genres, ranging from mainstream pop and country, to death metal and hip hop. BMI represents artists such as Selena, Demi Lovato, Fifth Harmony, Lil Wayne, Birdman, Lady Gaga, Taylor Swift, Eminem, Rihanna and Shakira and Ed Sheeran; bands as diverse as Maroon 5, Evanescence, Nickelback and Linkin Park; Sam Cooke, Willie Nelson, Fats Domino and Dolly Parton; as well as composers such as Harry Gregson-Williams, John Williams and Danny Elfman and musical songwriters Richard & Robert Sherman. BMI also represents Michael Jackson's music catalog, Sony/ATV Music Publishing, which features the late artist's music as well as the largest repertoire of any catalog in history.[3]

History[edit]
In the 1930s, radio was coming to prominence as a source of musical entertainment that threatened to weaken record sales and opportunities for "live" acts. The Great Depression was already draining artist revenues from recordings and live performances. ASCAP, the pre-eminent royalty/licensing agency for more than two decades, required radio stations to subscribe to "blanket" licenses granting ASCAP a fixed percentage of each station's revenue, regardless of how much music the station played from ASCAP's repertoire. In 1939, ASCAP announced a substantial increase in the revenue share licensees would be required to pay. BMI was founded by the National Association of Broadcasters to provide a lower-cost alternative to ASCAP.[4] As such, BMI created competition in the field of performing rights, providing an alternative source of licensing for all music users.
The vast majority of U.S. radio stations and all three radio networks refused to renew their ASCAP licenses for 1941, choosing to forgo playing ASCAP music entirely and relying on the BMI repertoire. In February 1941, BMI and the Department of Justice entered into a consent decree, requiring certain changes to BMI's business model, including giving licensees the option of paying only for the music they actually use instead of buying a blanket license.[5] The U.S. District Court in Milwaukee was chosen by the Justice Department to supervise the decree for both BMI and ASCAP.[6]
Competing against the strongly established ASCAP, BMI sought out artists that ASCAP tended to overlook or ignore. BMI also purchased the rights to numerous catalogs held by independent publishers or whose ASCAP contracts were about to expire. To attract newer writers, BMI proposed to compensate songwriters and publishers on the basis of a fixed fee per performance, as opposed to ASCAP's two-tier system which discriminated against less-established songwriters. Thus, despite its original motivation regarding radio station royalties and its focus on radio station revenues vs artist revenues, BMI became the first performing rights organization in the United States to represent songwriters of blues, jazz, rhythm and blues, gospel (black genres, performers, and writers that ASCAP did not want to represent), country, folk, Latin, and—ultimately—rock and roll. During the 1940s and 1950s, BMI was the primary licensing organization for Country artists and R&B artists, while ASCAP centered on more established Pop artists. Also during this time, BMI expanded its repertoire of classical music, and now represents the majority[7] of the members of the prestigious American Academy of Arts and Letters and the winners of 31[8] Pulitzer Prizes for Music.
Business[edit]
BMI issues licenses to users of music, including:

Television and radio stations and networks
New media, including the Internet and mobile technologies such as podcasts, ringtones, and ringbacks
Satellite audio services, such as XM and Sirius
Nightclubs, discos, hotels, bars, and restaurants
Symphony orchestras, concert bands, and classical chamber music ensembles
Digital jukeboxes
Live concerts

BMI tracks public performances for 10.5 million works, and collects and distributes licensing revenues for those performances as royalties to over 700,000 songwriters, composers, and music publishers it represents.[9] BMI has offices in Atlanta, London, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, New York, and Puerto Rico.
Awards[edit]
Main article: BMI Award
BMI annually hosts award shows that honor the songwriters, composers and music publishers of the year's most-performed songs in the BMI catalogue. BMI Award shows include the BMI Latin Awards, BMI Pop Awards, BMI Film/TV Awards, BMI Urban Awards, BMI London Awards, BMI Country Awards, BMI Christian Awards, and the BMI Trailblazers of Gospel Music Luncheon.[10]

History
Early history
In August 1966, Richard M. Schulze and a business partner opened Sound of Music, an electronics store specializing in high fidelity stereos in Saint Paul, Minnesota.[11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20] Schulze financed the opening of his first store with his personal savings and a second mortgage he took out on his family’s home.[19][21] In 1967, Sound of Music acquired Kencraft Hi-Fi Company and Bergo Company.[21] Sound of Music earned $1 million in revenue and made about $58,000 in profits in its first year.[19] In 1969, Schulze bought out his business partner. Sound of Music had three stores and became a publicly held company listed on the NASDAQ exchange.[19][22]
Sound of Music operated nine stores throughout Minnesota by 1978.[23] In 1981, the Roseville, Minnesota, Sound of Music location, at the time the largest and most profitable Sound of Music store, was hit by a tornado.[19] The store’s roof was sheared off and showroom destroyed, but the storeroom was left intact.[19][24] In response, Schulze decided to have a “Tornado Sale” of damaged and excess stock in the damaged store’s parking lot.[19] He poured the remainder of his marketing budget into advertising the sale, promising “best buys” on everything.[24] Sound of Music made more money during the four-day sale than it did in a typical month.[20]
In 1983, with seven stores and $10 million in annual sales, Sound of Music was renamed Best Buy Company, Inc.[23][24] The company also expanded its product offerings to include home appliances and VCRs, in an attempt to expand beyond its then-core customer base of 15-to-18-year-old males.[24] Later that year Best Buy opened its first superstore in Burnsville, Minnesota.[24] The Burnsville location featured a high-volume, low price business model, which was borrowed partially from Schulze’s successful Tornado Sale in 1981.[19][24] In its first year, the Burnsville store out-performed all other Best Buy stores combined.[20][21]
Best Buy debuted on the New York Stock Exchange in 1987.[25][26] In 1989, the company introduced a new store concept dubbed “Concept II.”[21][25] Concept II replaced dimly lit industrial-style stores with brighter and more fashionably fixtured stores.[21] Stores also began placing all stock on the sales floor rather than in a stock room, had fewer salespersons and provided more self-help product information for its customers.[25][26] Best Buy also did away with commissioned salespeople.[19][25] The commission-free sales environment “created a more relaxed shopping environment free of the high-pressure sales tactics used in other stores,” but was unpopular with salespersons and suppliers.[25] Some suppliers, such as Maytag, Whirlpool and Sony, were upset that salespeople would no longer be pushing their products and stopped selling their wares in Best Buy stores.[19][20] The suppliers returned after Best Buy’s sales and revenue grew following the roll-out of Concept II.[24]
In 1992, the company achieved $1 billion in annual revenues.[26] In 1995, Best Buy debuted “Concept III” stores, which were larger than its previous stores.[26][27] The Concept III stores included expanded product offerings, interactive touchscreen kiosks that displayed product information for both customers and employees, and demonstration areas for products such as surround sound stereo systems and videogames.[27][28]
Best Buy launched its “Concept IV” stores with its expansion into New England in 1998.[26][29] Concept IV stores included an open layout with products organized by category, cash registers located throughout the store, and slightly smaller stores than Concept III stores.[30] The stores also had large areas for demonstrating home theater systems and computer software.[26][31]
In 1999, Best Buy was added to Standard & Poor’s S&P 500.[26]

In 2000, Best Buy formed Redline Entertainment, an independent music label and action-sports video distributor.[32] The company acquired Magnolia Hi-Fi, Inc., an audio-video retailer located in California, Washington and Oregon, in December 2000.[26]
In January 2001, Best Buy acquired Musicland Stores Corporation, a Minnetonka, Minnesota-based retailer that sold home entertainment products under the Sam Goody, Suncoast Motion Picture Company, Media Play and OnCue brands.[26][33] Best Buy purchased the company for $425 million in cash and the assumption of $271 million of Musicland debt.[26][33] Later that year, Best Buy acquired the British Columbia, Canada-based electronics-chain Future Shop Ltd., marking its entrance to the international marketplace.[26][34] Under the deal, Future Shop was purchased for approximately $377 million and continued to operate as subsidiary independent from Best Buy Canada.[35][36]
Brad Anderson succeeded Richard Schulze as Best Buy CEO in July 2002.[37] Anderson had begun working at Best Buy in 1973 while attending seminary school.[37] He was promoted to vice president in 1981 and executive vice president in 1986. Anderson had most recently served as president and COO of Best Buy, a position he had held since 1991.[37] In September of that year, Best Buy opened the first Canadian Best Buy-branded store in Mississauga, Ontario.[38] In October, Best Buy acquired Minneapolis, Minnesota-based Geek Squad, then a 24-hour residential computer repair business with offices in Minneapolis, Chicago, Illinois, Los Angeles, California and San Francisco, California.[37]
Best Buy stores in the U.S. surpassed the 600-store mark and the company opened its first global-sourcing office in Shanghai, China in 2003.[39][40] In June, Best Buy divested itself of Musicland in a deal with Sun Capital Partners under which Sun Capital received all of Musicland’s stock and debt.[41] Best Buy launched its “Reward Zone” loyalty program in July following an 8-month test of the program in San Diego, California.[42] Also in 2003, Best Buy’s corporate offices were consolidated into a single campus in Richfield, Minnesota.
In January 2004, Best Buy hired Virtucom Group to revamp Best Buy’s website and handle all of the company’s online content.[43] In May, the company launched its “customer centricty” program, which segmented its stores according to customer profiles.[44] The program also called for employees to focus on specific customer groups rather than product categories.[44] In October, Best Buy completed rolling out Geek Squad “precincts” in every American Best Buy store.[45]
In April 2005, Best Buy began eliminating mail-in rebates in response to negative customer reaction against them, and instead started giving out instant rebates via notebook computers.[46]
In May 2006, Best Buy acquired a majority interest in Chinese appliance retailer Jiangsu Five Star Appliance for $180 million.[47] At the time of the deal, Jiangsu was the fourth-largest appliance chain in China with 193 stores across eight Chinese provinces.[47] In June, the company opened Geek Squad precincts at Office Depot in Orlando, Florida.[42] The market test was later expanded to Denver Colorado.[48]
In January 2007, the first Best Buy-branded store in China officially opened in Shanghai, China.[49] In March 2007, Best Buy acquired Speakeasy, a Seattle, Washington-based broadband VOIP, data and IT services provider.[50] The acquisition was worth $80 million and, under terms of the deal, Speakeasy began operating as a wholly owned subsidiary of Best Buy.[50] The company’s products also became part of Best Buy’s For Business program.[50] Best Buy also expanded its Geek Squad market tests in March, opening Geek Squad precincts in FedEx Kinkos stores located in Indianapolis, Indiana and Charlotte, North Carolina.[51] In October 2007, Best Buy became the first consumer-electronics retailer to exit the analog television market, carrying only digital products that became mandatory in June 2009 by the FCC.[52]
In February 2008, Best Buy opened its first store in San Juan, Puerto Rico.[53] Best Buy’s Geek Squad market tests in Office Depot and FedEx Kinkos stores ended by March.[54] Also in March, the company began promoting the Blu-ray optical-disc format over the HD DVD format, a move which ultimately contributed to Toshiba's decision to drop HD DVD.[55] In May, the company agreed to buy 50% of the retail division of The Carphone Warehouse, a London, England-based mobile phone retailer.[56][57] The deal was worth $2.1 billion.[57]
In July 2008, Best Buy announced that it would start selling musical instruments and related gear in over 80 of its retail stores, making the company the second-largest musical-instrument distributor in the US.[58] Best Buy became the first third-party retail seller of Apple’s iPhone in September.[59] Later that month, the company agreed to acquire Napster for $121 million.[60] In December, Best Buy opened its first store in Mexico.[61]
In February 2009, Best Buy leveraged its partnership with The Carphone Warehouse to launch Best Buy Mobile, a Best Buy-branded mobile retailer.[62] Best Buy Mobile standalone stores were opened in shopping malls and urban downtowns.[62] Best Buy Mobile were also added in all Best Buy-branded stores.[62]
In June 2009, Brian Dunn became Best Buy CEO.[63] Dunn replaced Brad Anderson, who was retiring.[63] Dunn had joined Best Buy in 1985 as a sales associate.[64] In 2000, Dunn became senior vice president of East Coast operations and president of North American retail operations in 2004.[64] He had most recently served as president of Best Buy, a position he had held since 2006.[64]
Best Buy partnered with Roxio's CinemaNow to launch an on-demand movie download service that would allow customers to stream content to any device sold by Best Buy that connected to the Internet in November 2009.[65] In December, the first Turkish Best Buy opened in İzmir.

In April 2010, Best Buy opened its first United Kingdom-based Best Buy-branded store in Thurrock.[66] The company eventually opened 11 Best Buy stores in the United Kingdom.[67] The company closed all UK-based Best Buy stores in November 2011.[67] That same month Best Buy purchased The Carphone Warehouse’s share of Best Buy Mobile for $1.3 billion.[67] Best Buy and The Carphone Warehouse maintained their Best Buy Europe joint venture, which at the time operated 2,500 mobile phone stores throughout Europe.[67]
The company closed all of its Best Buy-branded stores in China by February 2011, when it merged Best Buy China’s operations with Jiangsu Five Star, which had become a wholly owned subsidiary of Best Buy in 2009.[3][68] In December 2011, Best Buy purchased mindSHIFT Technologies, a company that provided IT support for small and medium-sized businesses, for $167 million.[69]
In 2012, in response to overall revenue decline, Best Buy announced plans to undergo a "transformation strategy". Stores began to adopt a redesigned "Connected Store" format, providing the Geek Squad with a centralized service desk and implementing a "store-within-a-store" concept for Pacific Kitchen & Bath and Magnolia Design Center.[70]
In April 2012, Brian Dunn resigned as Best Buy’s CEO during an internal company investigation into allegations of personal misconduct stemming from an inappropriate relationship with a female Best Buy employee.[71] Best Buy named Director George L. Mikan III interim CEO following Dunn’s resignation.[71] The internal investigation was released in May 2012 and alleged that Best Buy founder and chairman Richard Schulze knew of Dunn’s inappropriate relationship and failed to notify the Best Buy board.[71] Schulze subsequently resigned his chairmanship of the company.[71] Best Buy Director Hatim Tyabji replaced Schulze as Best Buy chairman.[71]
Hubert Joly replaced Mikan as Best Buy CEO in September 2012.[72] Joly had previously served as CEO of Carlson, a hospitality conglomerate, since 2008.[72]
In April 2013, Best Buy exited the European consumer electronics market when it sold its 50% stake in Carphone Warehouse back to the UK-based mobile phone retailer.[73][74] The sale was worth approximately $775 million.[73][74]
An increasing trend towards online shopping began to erode revenues and profits in the 2010s. A 4% dip in sales for the June 30, 2014 quarter, marked the tenth quarter in a row where Best Buy's sales had declined. The company, in announcing the result, said it was focusing more on digital-media in its marketing, moving away from newspaper, magazine, and television advertising.[75]
On March 28, 2015, Best Buy announced the shutdown of the Future Shop chain in Canada; 65 of its 131 former locations were converted into Best Buy locations, while the rest (primarily those in close proximity to an existing Best Buy) were shuttered permanently.[76]
On May 24, 2016, Best Buy announced Sharon McCollam would step down as Chief Financial Officer on June 14.[77]

Best Buy sells consumer electronics and a variety of related merchandise, including software, video games, music, VHS cassettes and VCRs, mobile phones, digital cameras, car stereos and video cameras, in addition to home appliances (washing machines, dryers, and refrigerators), in a non-commissioned sales environment.[3] Under the Geek Squad brand, Best Buy offers computer repair, warranty service, and accidental service plans.[3]
The building exteriors of Best Buy-branded stores are typically light brown, with the entrance designed to look like a blue box emerging from the structure.[78] Corporate employees operated under a results only work environment from 2005 until March 2013, when the management style was abandoned by Best Buy CEO Hubert Joly.[79][80]
As of October 29, 2016, Best Buy operated 1,026 Best Buy, 331 Best Buy Mobile stand-alone stores and 28 stand-alone Pacific Sales stores in the US.[1][3] Best Buy also operated: 135 Best Buy and 53 Best Buy Mobile stand-alone stores in Canada; and 18 Best Buy stores and 5 Best Buy Express stores in Mexico.[3] Best Buy exited the European market in April 2013.[73][74]

Criticism
Warranty
In 2000, two Florida consumers brought a lawsuit against the company, alleging that it engaged in fraudulent business practices related to the sale of extended warranties (or, more accurately, service plans). The suit claimed that store employees had misrepresented the manufacturer's warranty in order to sell its own Product Service/Replacement Plan and that Best Buy had "entered into a corporate-wide scheme to institute high-pressure sales techniques involving the extended warranties" and that the company used "artificial barriers to discourage consumers who purchased the 'complete extended warranties' from making legitimate claims."[81] The company ultimately settled for $200,000 but admitted no wrongdoing.[82]
In 2014, Best Buy settled for $4.55 million in a class action lawsuit filed against them in April 2010 by consumers who claimed Best Buy was making unsolicited phone calls in contravention of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.[83]
Pricing
In the second quarter of 2007, Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal ordered an investigation into the company's use of an in-store website alleged to have misled customers on item sales prices.[84] In December 2007, the Los Angeles Times reported on the same issue, in which some customers claimed they thought they were surfing the Internet version of bestbuy.com at an in-store kiosk only to learn that the site reflected in-store prices only. In response, company spokesperson Sue Busch indicated the in-store kiosks were not intended for price-match purposes and rather were a means to navigate in-store availability. Since the initial investigation, a banner was placed on the in-store site to make its customers more aware of the difference.[85]
Similar pricing errors occurred in July 2009, when the Palm Pre multimedia smartphone was mistakenly sold for $99.99 (versus the retail price of $199.99), and Best Buy honored some of the sales.[citation needed] Best Buy regularly exercises the right to cancel orders associated with errors on its website.[citation needed]
Analog televisions
In April 2008, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) fined the company $280,000 for not alerting customers that the analog televisions it sold would not receive over-the-air stations after the digital transition on June 12, 2009.[86] The company challenged this ruling in May 2008 by the FCC saying it was and is in compliance with current FCC regulations pertaining to the digital transition.[87]
Environmental issues
It was one of several large companies named by Greenpeace in 2007 for purchasing raw materials or manufactured products derived thereof from logging companies that, in the opinion of Greenpeace, contribute to unethical deforestation of taiga in Canada.[88]
Since that time, however, the company launched what it calls Greener Together to increase the energy efficiency of its products as well as reduce consumer waste through more recyclable packaging and proper disposal of certain electronic components such as rechargeable batteries, and empty ink cartridges.[89]
As a way to improve its image and past environmental issues, the company introduced a recycling program in 2009 that has since collected nearly half-a-billion pounds of consumer electronics and e-waste and is available at all their stores for free. These items are then handed over to certified recyclers in the U.S. for proper recycling. The company's goal is to collect one billion pounds of recycling.[90]
It also has been named to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency top-50 list of the largest green-power purchasers. In 2011, the company purchased nearly 119 million kilowatt-hours (kWh) of green power –  electricity generated from renewable resources, such as wind, solar, geothermal, biogas, biomass and low-impact hydropower.[91]

History
Early history
In August 1966, Richard M. Schulze and a business partner opened Sound of Music, an electronics store specializing in high fidelity stereos in Saint Paul, Minnesota.[11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20] Schulze financed the opening of his first store with his personal savings and a second mortgage he took out on his family’s home.[19][21] In 1967, Sound of Music acquired Kencraft Hi-Fi Company and Bergo Company.[21] Sound of Music earned $1 million in revenue and made about $58,000 in profits in its first year.[19] In 1969, Schulze bought out his business partner. Sound of Music had three stores and became a publicly held company listed on the NASDAQ exchange.[19][22]
Sound of Music operated nine stores throughout Minnesota by 1978.[23] In 1981, the Roseville, Minnesota, Sound of Music location, at the time the largest and most profitable Sound of Music store, was hit by a tornado.[19] The store’s roof was sheared off and showroom destroyed, but the storeroom was left intact.[19][24] In response, Schulze decided to have a “Tornado Sale” of damaged and excess stock in the damaged store’s parking lot.[19] He poured the remainder of his marketing budget into advertising the sale, promising “best buys” on everything.[24] Sound of Music made more money during the four-day sale than it did in a typical month.[20]
In 1983, with seven stores and $10 million in annual sales, Sound of Music was renamed Best Buy Company, Inc.[23][24] The company also expanded its product offerings to include home appliances and VCRs, in an attempt to expand beyond its then-core customer base of 15-to-18-year-old males.[24] Later that year Best Buy opened its first superstore in Burnsville, Minnesota.[24] The Burnsville location featured a high-volume, low price business model, which was borrowed partially from Schulze’s successful Tornado Sale in 1981.[19][24] In its first year, the Burnsville store out-performed all other Best Buy stores combined.[20][21]
Best Buy debuted on the New York Stock Exchange in 1987.[25][26] In 1989, the company introduced a new store concept dubbed “Concept II.”[21][25] Concept II replaced dimly lit industrial-style stores with brighter and more fashionably fixtured stores.[21] Stores also began placing all stock on the sales floor rather than in a stock room, had fewer salespersons and provided more self-help product information for its customers.[25][26] Best Buy also did away with commissioned salespeople.[19][25] The commission-free sales environment “created a more relaxed shopping environment free of the high-pressure sales tactics used in other stores,” but was unpopular with salespersons and suppliers.[25] Some suppliers, such as Maytag, Whirlpool and Sony, were upset that salespeople would no longer be pushing their products and stopped selling their wares in Best Buy stores.[19][20] The suppliers returned after Best Buy’s sales and revenue grew following the roll-out of Concept II.[24]
In 1992, the company achieved $1 billion in annual revenues.[26] In 1995, Best Buy debuted “Concept III” stores, which were larger than its previous stores.[26][27] The Concept III stores included expanded product offerings, interactive touchscreen kiosks that displayed product information for both customers and employees, and demonstration areas for products such as surround sound stereo systems and videogames.[27][28]
Best Buy launched its “Concept IV” stores with its expansion into New England in 1998.[26][29] Concept IV stores included an open layout with products organized by category, cash registers located throughout the store, and slightly smaller stores than Concept III stores.[30] The stores also had large areas for demonstrating home theater systems and computer software.[26][31]
In 1999, Best Buy was added to Standard & Poor’s S&P 500.[26]

In 2000, Best Buy formed Redline Entertainment, an independent music label and action-sports video distributor.[32] The company acquired Magnolia Hi-Fi, Inc., an audio-video retailer located in California, Washington and Oregon, in December 2000.[26]
In January 2001, Best Buy acquired Musicland Stores Corporation, a Minnetonka, Minnesota-based retailer that sold home entertainment products under the Sam Goody, Suncoast Motion Picture Company, Media Play and OnCue brands.[26][33] Best Buy purchased the company for $425 million in cash and the assumption of $271 million of Musicland debt.[26][33] Later that year, Best Buy acquired the British Columbia, Canada-based electronics-chain Future Shop Ltd., marking its entrance to the international marketplace.[26][34] Under the deal, Future Shop was purchased for approximately $377 million and continued to operate as subsidiary independent from Best Buy Canada.[35][36]
Brad Anderson succeeded Richard Schulze as Best Buy CEO in July 2002.[37] Anderson had begun working at Best Buy in 1973 while attending seminary school.[37] He was promoted to vice president in 1981 and executive vice president in 1986. Anderson had most recently served as president and COO of Best Buy, a position he had held since 1991.[37] In September of that year, Best Buy opened the first Canadian Best Buy-branded store in Mississauga, Ontario.[38] In October, Best Buy acquired Minneapolis, Minnesota-based Geek Squad, then a 24-hour residential computer repair business with offices in Minneapolis, Chicago, Illinois, Los Angeles, California and San Francisco, California.[37]
Best Buy stores in the U.S. surpassed the 600-store mark and the company opened its first global-sourcing office in Shanghai, China in 2003.[39][40] In June, Best Buy divested itself of Musicland in a deal with Sun Capital Partners under which Sun Capital received all of Musicland’s stock and debt.[41] Best Buy launched its “Reward Zone” loyalty program in July following an 8-month test of the program in San Diego, California.[42] Also in 2003, Best Buy’s corporate offices were consolidated into a single campus in Richfield, Minnesota.
In January 2004, Best Buy hired Virtucom Group to revamp Best Buy’s website and handle all of the company’s online content.[43] In May, the company launched its “customer centricty” program, which segmented its stores according to customer profiles.[44] The program also called for employees to focus on specific customer groups rather than product categories.[44] In October, Best Buy completed rolling out Geek Squad “precincts” in every American Best Buy store.[45]
In April 2005, Best Buy began eliminating mail-in rebates in response to negative customer reaction against them, and instead started giving out instant rebates via notebook computers.[46]
In May 2006, Best Buy acquired a majority interest in Chinese appliance retailer Jiangsu Five Star Appliance for $180 million.[47] At the time of the deal, Jiangsu was the fourth-largest appliance chain in China with 193 stores across eight Chinese provinces.[47] In June, the company opened Geek Squad precincts at Office Depot in Orlando, Florida.[42] The market test was later expanded to Denver Colorado.[48]
In January 2007, the first Best Buy-branded store in China officially opened in Shanghai, China.[49] In March 2007, Best Buy acquired Speakeasy, a Seattle, Washington-based broadband VOIP, data and IT services provider.[50] The acquisition was worth $80 million and, under terms of the deal, Speakeasy began operating as a wholly owned subsidiary of Best Buy.[50] The company’s products also became part of Best Buy’s For Business program.[50] Best Buy also expanded its Geek Squad market tests in March, opening Geek Squad precincts in FedEx Kinkos stores located in Indianapolis, Indiana and Charlotte, North Carolina.[51] In October 2007, Best Buy became the first consumer-electronics retailer to exit the analog television market, carrying only digital products that became mandatory in June 2009 by the FCC.[52]
In February 2008, Best Buy opened its first store in San Juan, Puerto Rico.[53] Best Buy’s Geek Squad market tests in Office Depot and FedEx Kinkos stores ended by March.[54] Also in March, the company began promoting the Blu-ray optical-disc format over the HD DVD format, a move which ultimately contributed to Toshiba's decision to drop HD DVD.[55] In May, the company agreed to buy 50% of the retail division of The Carphone Warehouse, a London, England-based mobile phone retailer.[56][57] The deal was worth $2.1 billion.[57]
In July 2008, Best Buy announced that it would start selling musical instruments and related gear in over 80 of its retail stores, making the company the second-largest musical-instrument distributor in the US.[58] Best Buy became the first third-party retail seller of Apple’s iPhone in September.[59] Later that month, the company agreed to acquire Napster for $121 million.[60] In December, Best Buy opened its first store in Mexico.[61]
In February 2009, Best Buy leveraged its partnership with The Carphone Warehouse to launch Best Buy Mobile, a Best Buy-branded mobile retailer.[62] Best Buy Mobile standalone stores were opened in shopping malls and urban downtowns.[62] Best Buy Mobile were also added in all Best Buy-branded stores.[62]
In June 2009, Brian Dunn became Best Buy CEO.[63] Dunn replaced Brad Anderson, who was retiring.[63] Dunn had joined Best Buy in 1985 as a sales associate.[64] In 2000, Dunn became senior vice president of East Coast operations and president of North American retail operations in 2004.[64] He had most recently served as president of Best Buy, a position he had held since 2006.[64]
Best Buy partnered with Roxio's CinemaNow to launch an on-demand movie download service that would allow customers to stream content to any device sold by Best Buy that connected to the Internet in November 2009.[65] In December, the first Turkish Best Buy opened in İzmir.
2010s

In April 2010, Best Buy opened its first United Kingdom-based Best Buy-branded store in Thurrock.[66] The company eventually opened 11 Best Buy stores in the United Kingdom.[67] The company closed all UK-based Best Buy stores in November 2011.[67] That same month Best Buy purchased The Carphone Warehouse’s share of Best Buy Mobile for $1.3 billion.[67] Best Buy and The Carphone Warehouse maintained their Best Buy Europe joint venture, which at the time operated 2,500 mobile phone stores throughout Europe.[67]
The company closed all of its Best Buy-branded stores in China by February 2011, when it merged Best Buy China’s operations with Jiangsu Five Star, which had become a wholly owned subsidiary of Best Buy in 2009.[3][68] In December 2011, Best Buy purchased mindSHIFT Technologies, a company that provided IT support for small and medium-sized businesses, for $167 million.[69]
In 2012, in response to overall revenue decline, Best Buy announced plans to undergo a "transformation strategy". Stores began to adopt a redesigned "Connected Store" format, providing the Geek Squad with a centralized service desk and implementing a "store-within-a-store" concept for Pacific Kitchen & Bath and Magnolia Design Center.[70]
In April 2012, Brian Dunn resigned as Best Buy’s CEO during an internal company investigation into allegations of personal misconduct stemming from an inappropriate relationship with a female Best Buy employee.[71] Best Buy named Director George L. Mikan III interim CEO following Dunn’s resignation.[71] The internal investigation was released in May 2012 and alleged that Best Buy founder and chairman Richard Schulze knew of Dunn’s inappropriate relationship and failed to notify the Best Buy board.[71] Schulze subsequently resigned his chairmanship of the company.[71] Best Buy Director Hatim Tyabji replaced Schulze as Best Buy chairman.[71]
Hubert Joly replaced Mikan as Best Buy CEO in September 2012.[72] Joly had previously served as CEO of Carlson, a hospitality conglomerate, since 2008.[72]
In April 2013, Best Buy exited the European consumer electronics market when it sold its 50% stake in Carphone Warehouse back to the UK-based mobile phone retailer.[73][74] The sale was worth approximately $775 million.[73][74]
An increasing trend towards online shopping began to erode revenues and profits in the 2010s. A 4% dip in sales for the June 30, 2014 quarter, marked the tenth quarter in a row where Best Buy's sales had declined. The company, in announcing the result, said it was focusing more on digital-media in its marketing, moving away from newspaper, magazine, and television advertising.[75]
On March 28, 2015, Best Buy announced the shutdown of the Future Shop chain in Canada; 65 of its 131 former locations were converted into Best Buy locations, while the rest (primarily those in close proximity to an existing Best Buy) were shuttered permanently.[76]
On May 24, 2016, Best Buy announced Sharon McCollam would step down as Chief Financial Officer on June 14.[77]

Best Buy sells consumer electronics and a variety of related merchandise, including software, video games, music, VHS cassettes and VCRs, mobile phones, digital cameras, car stereos and video cameras, in addition to home appliances (washing machines, dryers, and refrigerators), in a non-commissioned sales environment.[3] Under the Geek Squad brand, Best Buy offers computer repair, warranty service, and accidental service plans.[3]
The building exteriors of Best Buy-branded stores are typically light brown, with the entrance designed to look like a blue box emerging from the structure.[78] Corporate employees operated under a results only work environment from 2005 until March 2013, when the management style was abandoned by Best Buy CEO Hubert Joly.[79][80]
As of October 29, 2016, Best Buy operated 1,026 Best Buy, 331 Best Buy Mobile stand-alone stores and 28 stand-alone Pacific Sales stores in the US.[1][3] Best Buy also operated: 135 Best Buy and 53 Best Buy Mobile stand-alone stores in Canada; and 18 Best Buy stores and 5 Best Buy Express stores in Mexico.[3] Best Buy exited the European market in April 2013.[73][74]

Criticism
Warranty
In 2000, two Florida consumers brought a lawsuit against the company, alleging that it engaged in fraudulent business practices related to the sale of extended warranties (or, more accurately, service plans). The suit claimed that store employees had misrepresented the manufacturer's warranty in order to sell its own Product Service/Replacement Plan and that Best Buy had "entered into a corporate-wide scheme to institute high-pressure sales techniques involving the extended warranties" and that the company used "artificial barriers to discourage consumers who purchased the 'complete extended warranties' from making legitimate claims."[81] The company ultimately settled for $200,000 but admitted no wrongdoing.[82]
In 2014, Best Buy settled for $4.55 million in a class action lawsuit filed against them in April 2010 by consumers who claimed Best Buy was making unsolicited phone calls in contravention of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.[83]
Pricing
In the second quarter of 2007, Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal ordered an investigation into the company's use of an in-store website alleged to have misled customers on item sales prices.[84] In December 2007, the Los Angeles Times reported on the same issue, in which some customers claimed they thought they were surfing the Internet version of bestbuy.com at an in-store kiosk only to learn that the site reflected in-store prices only. In response, company spokesperson Sue Busch indicated the in-store kiosks were not intended for price-match purposes and rather were a means to navigate in-store availability. Since the initial investigation, a banner was placed on the in-store site to make its customers more aware of the difference.[85]
Similar pricing errors occurred in July 2009, when the Palm Pre multimedia smartphone was mistakenly sold for $99.99 (versus the retail price of $199.99), and Best Buy honored some of the sales.[citation needed] Best Buy regularly exercises the right to cancel orders associated with errors on its website.[citation needed]
Analog televisions
In April 2008, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) fined the company $280,000 for not alerting customers that the analog televisions it sold would not receive over-the-air stations after the digital transition on June 12, 2009.[86] The company challenged this ruling in May 2008 by the FCC saying it was and is in compliance with current FCC regulations pertaining to the digital transition.[87]
Environmental issues
It was one of several large companies named by Greenpeace in 2007 for purchasing raw materials or manufactured products derived thereof from logging companies that, in the opinion of Greenpeace, contribute to unethical deforestation of taiga in Canada.[88]
Since that time, however, the company launched what it calls Greener Together to increase the energy efficiency of its products as well as reduce consumer waste through more recyclable packaging and proper disposal of certain electronic components such as rechargeable batteries, and empty ink cartridges.[89]
As a way to improve its image and past environmental issues, the company introduced a recycling program in 2009 that has since collected nearly half-a-billion pounds of consumer electronics and e-waste and is available at all their stores for free. These items are then handed over to certified recyclers in the U.S. for proper recycling. The company's goal is to collect one billion pounds of recycling.[90]
It also has been named to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency top-50 list of the largest green-power purchasers. In 2011, the company purchased nearly 119 million kilowatt-hours (kWh) of green power –  electricity generated from renewable resources, such as wind, solar, geothermal, biogas, biomass and low-impact hydropower.[91]

History
Early history
In August 1966, Richard M. Schulze and a business partner opened Sound of Music, an electronics store specializing in high fidelity stereos in Saint Paul, Minnesota.[11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20] Schulze financed the opening of his first store with his personal savings and a second mortgage he took out on his family’s home.[19][21] In 1967, Sound of Music acquired Kencraft Hi-Fi Company and Bergo Company.[21] Sound of Music earned $1 million in revenue and made about $58,000 in profits in its first year.[19] In 1969, Schulze bought out his business partner. Sound of Music had three stores and became a publicly held company listed on the NASDAQ exchange.[19][22]
Sound of Music operated nine stores throughout Minnesota by 1978.[23] In 1981, the Roseville, Minnesota, Sound of Music location, at the time the largest and most profitable Sound of Music store, was hit by a tornado.[19] The store’s roof was sheared off and showroom destroyed, but the storeroom was left intact.[19][24] In response, Schulze decided to have a “Tornado Sale” of damaged and excess stock in the damaged store’s parking lot.[19] He poured the remainder of his marketing budget into advertising the sale, promising “best buys” on everything.[24] Sound of Music made more money during the four-day sale than it did in a typical month.[20]
In 1983, with seven stores and $10 million in annual sales, Sound of Music was renamed Best Buy Company, Inc.[23][24] The company also expanded its product offerings to include home appliances and VCRs, in an attempt to expand beyond its then-core customer base of 15-to-18-year-old males.[24] Later that year Best Buy opened its first superstore in Burnsville, Minnesota.[24] The Burnsville location featured a high-volume, low price business model, which was borrowed partially from Schulze’s successful Tornado Sale in 1981.[19][24] In its first year, the Burnsville store out-performed all other Best Buy stores combined.[20][21]
Best Buy debuted on the New York Stock Exchange in 1987.[25][26] In 1989, the company introduced a new store concept dubbed “Concept II.”[21][25] Concept II replaced dimly lit industrial-style stores with brighter and more fashionably fixtured stores.[21] Stores also began placing all stock on the sales floor rather than in a stock room, had fewer salespersons and provided more self-help product information for its customers.[25][26] Best Buy also did away with commissioned salespeople.[19][25] The commission-free sales environment “created a more relaxed shopping environment free of the high-pressure sales tactics used in other stores,” but was unpopular with salespersons and suppliers.[25] Some suppliers, such as Maytag, Whirlpool and Sony, were upset that salespeople would no longer be pushing their products and stopped selling their wares in Best Buy stores.[19][20] The suppliers returned after Best Buy’s sales and revenue grew following the roll-out of Concept II.[24]
In 1992, the company achieved $1 billion in annual revenues.[26] In 1995, Best Buy debuted “Concept III” stores, which were larger than its previous stores.[26][27] The Concept III stores included expanded product offerings, interactive touchscreen kiosks that displayed product information for both customers and employees, and demonstration areas for products such as surround sound stereo systems and videogames.[27][28]
Best Buy launched its “Concept IV” stores with its expansion into New England in 1998.[26][29] Concept IV stores included an open layout with products organized by category, cash registers located throughout the store, and slightly smaller stores than Concept III stores.[30] The stores also had large areas for demonstrating home theater systems and computer software.[26][31]
In 1999, Best Buy was added to Standard & Poor’s S&P 500.[26]

In 2000, Best Buy formed Redline Entertainment, an independent music label and action-sports video distributor.[32] The company acquired Magnolia Hi-Fi, Inc., an audio-video retailer located in California, Washington and Oregon, in December 2000.[26]
In January 2001, Best Buy acquired Musicland Stores Corporation, a Minnetonka, Minnesota-based retailer that sold home entertainment products under the Sam Goody, Suncoast Motion Picture Company, Media Play and OnCue brands.[26][33] Best Buy purchased the company for $425 million in cash and the assumption of $271 million of Musicland debt.[26][33] Later that year, Best Buy acquired the British Columbia, Canada-based electronics-chain Future Shop Ltd., marking its entrance to the international marketplace.[26][34] Under the deal, Future Shop was purchased for approximately $377 million and continued to operate as subsidiary independent from Best Buy Canada.[35][36]
Brad Anderson succeeded Richard Schulze as Best Buy CEO in July 2002.[37] Anderson had begun working at Best Buy in 1973 while attending seminary school.[37] He was promoted to vice president in 1981 and executive vice president in 1986. Anderson had most recently served as president and COO of Best Buy, a position he had held since 1991.[37] In September of that year, Best Buy opened the first Canadian Best Buy-branded store in Mississauga, Ontario.[38] In October, Best Buy acquired Minneapolis, Minnesota-based Geek Squad, then a 24-hour residential computer repair business with offices in Minneapolis, Chicago, Illinois, Los Angeles, California and San Francisco, California.[37]
Best Buy stores in the U.S. surpassed the 600-store mark and the company opened its first global-sourcing office in Shanghai, China in 2003.[39][40] In June, Best Buy divested itself of Musicland in a deal with Sun Capital Partners under which Sun Capital received all of Musicland’s stock and debt.[41] Best Buy launched its “Reward Zone” loyalty program in July following an 8-month test of the program in San Diego, California.[42] Also in 2003, Best Buy’s corporate offices were consolidated into a single campus in Richfield, Minnesota.
In January 2004, Best Buy hired Virtucom Group to revamp Best Buy’s website and handle all of the company’s online content.[43] In May, the company launched its “customer centricty” program, which segmented its stores according to customer profiles.[44] The program also called for employees to focus on specific customer groups rather than product categories.[44] In October, Best Buy completed rolling out Geek Squad “precincts” in every American Best Buy store.[45]
In April 2005, Best Buy began eliminating mail-in rebates in response to negative customer reaction against them, and instead started giving out instant rebates via notebook computers.[46]
In May 2006, Best Buy acquired a majority interest in Chinese appliance retailer Jiangsu Five Star Appliance for $180 million.[47] At the time of the deal, Jiangsu was the fourth-largest appliance chain in China with 193 stores across eight Chinese provinces.[47] In June, the company opened Geek Squad precincts at Office Depot in Orlando, Florida.[42] The market test was later expanded to Denver Colorado.[48]
In January 2007, the first Best Buy-branded store in China officially opened in Shanghai, China.[49] In March 2007, Best Buy acquired Speakeasy, a Seattle, Washington-based broadband VOIP, data and IT services provider.[50] The acquisition was worth $80 million and, under terms of the deal, Speakeasy began operating as a wholly owned subsidiary of Best Buy.[50] The company’s products also became part of Best Buy’s For Business program.[50] Best Buy also expanded its Geek Squad market tests in March, opening Geek Squad precincts in FedEx Kinkos stores located in Indianapolis, Indiana and Charlotte, North Carolina.[51] In October 2007, Best Buy became the first consumer-electronics retailer to exit the analog television market, carrying only digital products that became mandatory in June 2009 by the FCC.[52]
In February 2008, Best Buy opened its first store in San Juan, Puerto Rico.[53] Best Buy’s Geek Squad market tests in Office Depot and FedEx Kinkos stores ended by March.[54] Also in March, the company began promoting the Blu-ray optical-disc format over the HD DVD format, a move which ultimately contributed to Toshiba's decision to drop HD DVD.[55] In May, the company agreed to buy 50% of the retail division of The Carphone Warehouse, a London, England-based mobile phone retailer.[56][57] The deal was worth $2.1 billion.[57]
In July 2008, Best Buy announced that it would start selling musical instruments and related gear in over 80 of its retail stores, making the company the second-largest musical-instrument distributor in the US.[58] Best Buy became the first third-party retail seller of Apple’s iPhone in September.[59] Later that month, the company agreed to acquire Napster for $121 million.[60] In December, Best Buy opened its first store in Mexico.[61]
In February 2009, Best Buy leveraged its partnership with The Carphone Warehouse to launch Best Buy Mobile, a Best Buy-branded mobile retailer.[62] Best Buy Mobile standalone stores were opened in shopping malls and urban downtowns.[62] Best Buy Mobile were also added in all Best Buy-branded stores.[62]
In June 2009, Brian Dunn became Best Buy CEO.[63] Dunn replaced Brad Anderson, who was retiring.[63] Dunn had joined Best Buy in 1985 as a sales associate.[64] In 2000, Dunn became senior vice president of East Coast operations and president of North American retail operations in 2004.[64] He had most recently served as president of Best Buy, a position he had held since 2006.[64]
Best Buy partnered with Roxio's CinemaNow to launch an on-demand movie download service that would allow customers to stream content to any device sold by Best Buy that connected to the Internet in November 2009.[65] In December, the first Turkish Best Buy opened in İzmir.
2010s

In April 2010, Best Buy opened its first United Kingdom-based Best Buy-branded store in Thurrock.[66] The company eventually opened 11 Best Buy stores in the United Kingdom.[67] The company closed all UK-based Best Buy stores in November 2011.[67] That same month Best Buy purchased The Carphone Warehouse’s share of Best Buy Mobile for $1.3 billion.[67] Best Buy and The Carphone Warehouse maintained their Best Buy Europe joint venture, which at the time operated 2,500 mobile phone stores throughout Europe.[67]
The company closed all of its Best Buy-branded stores in China by February 2011, when it merged Best Buy China’s operations with Jiangsu Five Star, which had become a wholly owned subsidiary of Best Buy in 2009.[3][68] In December 2011, Best Buy purchased mindSHIFT Technologies, a company that provided IT support for small and medium-sized businesses, for $167 million.[69]
In 2012, in response to overall revenue decline, Best Buy announced plans to undergo a "transformation strategy". Stores began to adopt a redesigned "Connected Store" format, providing the Geek Squad with a centralized service desk and implementing a "store-within-a-store" concept for Pacific Kitchen & Bath and Magnolia Design Center.[70]
In April 2012, Brian Dunn resigned as Best Buy’s CEO during an internal company investigation into allegations of personal misconduct stemming from an inappropriate relationship with a female Best Buy employee.[71] Best Buy named Director George L. Mikan III interim CEO following Dunn’s resignation.[71] The internal investigation was released in May 2012 and alleged that Best Buy founder and chairman Richard Schulze knew of Dunn’s inappropriate relationship and failed to notify the Best Buy board.[71] Schulze subsequently resigned his chairmanship of the company.[71] Best Buy Director Hatim Tyabji replaced Schulze as Best Buy chairman.[71]
Hubert Joly replaced Mikan as Best Buy CEO in September 2012.[72] Joly had previously served as CEO of Carlson, a hospitality conglomerate, since 2008.[72]
In April 2013, Best Buy exited the European consumer electronics market when it sold its 50% stake in Carphone Warehouse back to the UK-based mobile phone retailer.[73][74] The sale was worth approximately $775 million.[73][74]
An increasing trend towards online shopping began to erode revenues and profits in the 2010s. A 4% dip in sales for the June 30, 2014 quarter, marked the tenth quarter in a row where Best Buy's sales had declined. The company, in announcing the result, said it was focusing more on digital-media in its marketing, moving away from newspaper, magazine, and television advertising.[75]
On March 28, 2015, Best Buy announced the shutdown of the Future Shop chain in Canada; 65 of its 131 former locations were converted into Best Buy locations, while the rest (primarily those in close proximity to an existing Best Buy) were shuttered permanently.[76]
On May 24, 2016, Best Buy announced Sharon McCollam would step down as Chief Financial Officer on June 14.[77]

Best Buy sells consumer electronics and a variety of related merchandise, including software, video games, music, VHS cassettes and VCRs, mobile phones, digital cameras, car stereos and video cameras, in addition to home appliances (washing machines, dryers, and refrigerators), in a non-commissioned sales environment.[3] Under the Geek Squad brand, Best Buy offers computer repair, warranty service, and accidental service plans.[3]
The building exteriors of Best Buy-branded stores are typically light brown, with the entrance designed to look like a blue box emerging from the structure.[78] Corporate employees operated under a results only work environment from 2005 until March 2013, when the management style was abandoned by Best Buy CEO Hubert Joly.[79][80]
As of October 29, 2016, Best Buy operated 1,026 Best Buy, 331 Best Buy Mobile stand-alone stores and 28 stand-alone Pacific Sales stores in the US.[1][3] Best Buy also operated: 135 Best Buy and 53 Best Buy Mobile stand-alone stores in Canada; and 18 Best Buy stores and 5 Best Buy Express stores in Mexico.[3] Best Buy exited the European market in April 2013.[73][74]

Criticism
Warranty
In 2000, two Florida consumers brought a lawsuit against the company, alleging that it engaged in fraudulent business practices related to the sale of extended warranties (or, more accurately, service plans). The suit claimed that store employees had misrepresented the manufacturer's warranty in order to sell its own Product Service/Replacement Plan and that Best Buy had "entered into a corporate-wide scheme to institute high-pressure sales techniques involving the extended warranties" and that the company used "artificial barriers to discourage consumers who purchased the 'complete extended warranties' from making legitimate claims."[81] The company ultimately settled for $200,000 but admitted no wrongdoing.[82]
In 2014, Best Buy settled for $4.55 million in a class action lawsuit filed against them in April 2010 by consumers who claimed Best Buy was making unsolicited phone calls in contravention of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.[83]
Pricing
In the second quarter of 2007, Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal ordered an investigation into the company's use of an in-store website alleged to have misled customers on item sales prices.[84] In December 2007, the Los Angeles Times reported on the same issue, in which some customers claimed they thought they were surfing the Internet version of bestbuy.com at an in-store kiosk only to learn that the site reflected in-store prices only. In response, company spokesperson Sue Busch indicated the in-store kiosks were not intended for price-match purposes and rather were a means to navigate in-store availability. Since the initial investigation, a banner was placed on the in-store site to make its customers more aware of the difference.[85]
Similar pricing errors occurred in July 2009, when the Palm Pre multimedia smartphone was mistakenly sold for $99.99 (versus the retail price of $199.99), and Best Buy honored some of the sales.[citation needed] Best Buy regularly exercises the right to cancel orders associated with errors on its website.[citation needed]
Analog televisions
In April 2008, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) fined the company $280,000 for not alerting customers that the analog televisions it sold would not receive over-the-air stations after the digital transition on June 12, 2009.[86] The company challenged this ruling in May 2008 by the FCC saying it was and is in compliance with current FCC regulations pertaining to the digital transition.[87]
Environmental issues
It was one of several large companies named by Greenpeace in 2007 for purchasing raw materials or manufactured products derived thereof from logging companies that, in the opinion of Greenpeace, contribute to unethical deforestation of taiga in Canada.[88]
Since that time, however, the company launched what it calls Greener Together to increase the energy efficiency of its products as well as reduce consumer waste through more recyclable packaging and proper disposal of certain electronic components such as rechargeable batteries, and empty ink cartridges.[89]
As a way to improve its image and past environmental issues, the company introduced a recycling program in 2009 that has since collected nearly half-a-billion pounds of consumer electronics and e-waste and is available at all their stores for free. These items are then handed over to certified recyclers in the U.S. for proper recycling. The company's goal is to collect one billion pounds of recycling.[90]
It also has been named to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency top-50 list of the largest green-power purchasers. In 2011, the company purchased nearly 119 million kilowatt-hours (kWh) of green power –  electricity generated from renewable resources, such as wind, solar, geothermal, biogas, biomass and low-impact hydropower.[91]

History
Early history
In August 1966, Richard M. Schulze and a business partner opened Sound of Music, an electronics store specializing in high fidelity stereos in Saint Paul, Minnesota.[11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20] Schulze financed the opening of his first store with his personal savings and a second mortgage he took out on his family’s home.[19][21] In 1967, Sound of Music acquired Kencraft Hi-Fi Company and Bergo Company.[21] Sound of Music earned $1 million in revenue and made about $58,000 in profits in its first year.[19] In 1969, Schulze bought out his business partner. Sound of Music had three stores and became a publicly held company listed on the NASDAQ exchange.[19][22]
Sound of Music operated nine stores throughout Minnesota by 1978.[23] In 1981, the Roseville, Minnesota, Sound of Music location, at the time the largest and most profitable Sound of Music store, was hit by a tornado.[19] The store’s roof was sheared off and showroom destroyed, but the storeroom was left intact.[19][24] In response, Schulze decided to have a “Tornado Sale” of damaged and excess stock in the damaged store’s parking lot.[19] He poured the remainder of his marketing budget into advertising the sale, promising “best buys” on everything.[24] Sound of Music made more money during the four-day sale than it did in a typical month.[20]
In 1983, with seven stores and $10 million in annual sales, Sound of Music was renamed Best Buy Company, Inc.[23][24] The company also expanded its product offerings to include home appliances and VCRs, in an attempt to expand beyond its then-core customer base of 15-to-18-year-old males.[24] Later that year Best Buy opened its first superstore in Burnsville, Minnesota.[24] The Burnsville location featured a high-volume, low price business model, which was borrowed partially from Schulze’s successful Tornado Sale in 1981.[19][24] In its first year, the Burnsville store out-performed all other Best Buy stores combined.[20][21]
Best Buy debuted on the New York Stock Exchange in 1987.[25][26] In 1989, the company introduced a new store concept dubbed “Concept II.”[21][25] Concept II replaced dimly lit industrial-style stores with brighter and more fashionably fixtured stores.[21] Stores also began placing all stock on the sales floor rather than in a stock room, had fewer salespersons and provided more self-help product information for its customers.[25][26] Best Buy also did away with commissioned salespeople.[19][25] The commission-free sales environment “created a more relaxed shopping environment free of the high-pressure sales tactics used in other stores,” but was unpopular with salespersons and suppliers.[25] Some suppliers, such as Maytag, Whirlpool and Sony, were upset that salespeople would no longer be pushing their products and stopped selling their wares in Best Buy stores.[19][20] The suppliers returned after Best Buy’s sales and revenue grew following the roll-out of Concept II.[24]
In 1992, the company achieved $1 billion in annual revenues.[26] In 1995, Best Buy debuted “Concept III” stores, which were larger than its previous stores.[26][27] The Concept III stores included expanded product offerings, interactive touchscreen kiosks that displayed product information for both customers and employees, and demonstration areas for products such as surround sound stereo systems and videogames.[27][28]
Best Buy launched its “Concept IV” stores with its expansion into New England in 1998.[26][29] Concept IV stores included an open layout with products organized by category, cash registers located throughout the store, and slightly smaller stores than Concept III stores.[30] The stores also had large areas for demonstrating home theater systems and computer software.[26][31]
In 1999, Best Buy was added to Standard & Poor’s S&P 500.[26]

In 2000, Best Buy formed Redline Entertainment, an independent music label and action-sports video distributor.[32] The company acquired Magnolia Hi-Fi, Inc., an audio-video retailer located in California, Washington and Oregon, in December 2000.[26]
In January 2001, Best Buy acquired Musicland Stores Corporation, a Minnetonka, Minnesota-based retailer that sold home entertainment products under the Sam Goody, Suncoast Motion Picture Company, Media Play and OnCue brands.[26][33] Best Buy purchased the company for $425 million in cash and the assumption of $271 million of Musicland debt.[26][33] Later that year, Best Buy acquired the British Columbia, Canada-based electronics-chain Future Shop Ltd., marking its entrance to the international marketplace.[26][34] Under the deal, Future Shop was purchased for approximately $377 million and continued to operate as subsidiary independent from Best Buy Canada.[35][36]
Brad Anderson succeeded Richard Schulze as Best Buy CEO in July 2002.[37] Anderson had begun working at Best Buy in 1973 while attending seminary school.[37] He was promoted to vice president in 1981 and executive vice president in 1986. Anderson had most recently served as president and COO of Best Buy, a position he had held since 1991.[37] In September of that year, Best Buy opened the first Canadian Best Buy-branded store in Mississauga, Ontario.[38] In October, Best Buy acquired Minneapolis, Minnesota-based Geek Squad, then a 24-hour residential computer repair business with offices in Minneapolis, Chicago, Illinois, Los Angeles, California and San Francisco, California.[37]
Best Buy stores in the U.S. surpassed the 600-store mark and the company opened its first global-sourcing office in Shanghai, China in 2003.[39][40] In June, Best Buy divested itself of Musicland in a deal with Sun Capital Partners under which Sun Capital received all of Musicland’s stock and debt.[41] Best Buy launched its “Reward Zone” loyalty program in July following an 8-month test of the program in San Diego, California.[42] Also in 2003, Best Buy’s corporate offices were consolidated into a single campus in Richfield, Minnesota.
In January 2004, Best Buy hired Virtucom Group to revamp Best Buy’s website and handle all of the company’s online content.[43] In May, the company launched its “customer centricty” program, which segmented its stores according to customer profiles.[44] The program also called for employees to focus on specific customer groups rather than product categories.[44] In October, Best Buy completed rolling out Geek Squad “precincts” in every American Best Buy store.[45]
In April 2005, Best Buy began eliminating mail-in rebates in response to negative customer reaction against them, and instead started giving out instant rebates via notebook computers.[46]
In May 2006, Best Buy acquired a majority interest in Chinese appliance retailer Jiangsu Five Star Appliance for $180 million.[47] At the time of the deal, Jiangsu was the fourth-largest appliance chain in China with 193 stores across eight Chinese provinces.[47] In June, the company opened Geek Squad precincts at Office Depot in Orlando, Florida.[42] The market test was later expanded to Denver Colorado.[48]
In January 2007, the first Best Buy-branded store in China officially opened in Shanghai, China.[49] In March 2007, Best Buy acquired Speakeasy, a Seattle, Washington-based broadband VOIP, data and IT services provider.[50] The acquisition was worth $80 million and, under terms of the deal, Speakeasy began operating as a wholly owned subsidiary of Best Buy.[50] The company’s products also became part of Best Buy’s For Business program.[50] Best Buy also expanded its Geek Squad market tests in March, opening Geek Squad precincts in FedEx Kinkos stores located in Indianapolis, Indiana and Charlotte, North Carolina.[51] In October 2007, Best Buy became the first consumer-electronics retailer to exit the analog television market, carrying only digital products that became mandatory in June 2009 by the FCC.[52]
In February 2008, Best Buy opened its first store in San Juan, Puerto Rico.[53] Best Buy’s Geek Squad market tests in Office Depot and FedEx Kinkos stores ended by March.[54] Also in March, the company began promoting the Blu-ray optical-disc format over the HD DVD format, a move which ultimately contributed to Toshiba's decision to drop HD DVD.[55] In May, the company agreed to buy 50% of the retail division of The Carphone Warehouse, a London, England-based mobile phone retailer.[56][57] The deal was worth $2.1 billion.[57]
In July 2008, Best Buy announced that it would start selling musical instruments and related gear in over 80 of its retail stores, making the company the second-largest musical-instrument distributor in the US.[58] Best Buy became the first third-party retail seller of Apple’s iPhone in September.[59] Later that month, the company agreed to acquire Napster for $121 million.[60] In December, Best Buy opened its first store in Mexico.[61]
In February 2009, Best Buy leveraged its partnership with The Carphone Warehouse to launch Best Buy Mobile, a Best Buy-branded mobile retailer.[62] Best Buy Mobile standalone stores were opened in shopping malls and urban downtowns.[62] Best Buy Mobile were also added in all Best Buy-branded stores.[62]
In June 2009, Brian Dunn became Best Buy CEO.[63] Dunn replaced Brad Anderson, who was retiring.[63] Dunn had joined Best Buy in 1985 as a sales associate.[64] In 2000, Dunn became senior vice president of East Coast operations and president of North American retail operations in 2004.[64] He had most recently served as president of Best Buy, a position he had held since 2006.[64]
Best Buy partnered with Roxio's CinemaNow to launch an on-demand movie download service that would allow customers to stream content to any device sold by Best Buy that connected to the Internet in November 2009.[65] In December, the first Turkish Best Buy opened in İzmir.
2010s

In April 2010, Best Buy opened its first United Kingdom-based Best Buy-branded store in Thurrock.[66] The company eventually opened 11 Best Buy stores in the United Kingdom.[67] The company closed all UK-based Best Buy stores in November 2011.[67] That same month Best Buy purchased The Carphone Warehouse’s share of Best Buy Mobile for $1.3 billion.[67] Best Buy and The Carphone Warehouse maintained their Best Buy Europe joint venture, which at the time operated 2,500 mobile phone stores throughout Europe.[67]
The company closed all of its Best Buy-branded stores in China by February 2011, when it merged Best Buy China’s operations with Jiangsu Five Star, which had become a wholly owned subsidiary of Best Buy in 2009.[3][68] In December 2011, Best Buy purchased mindSHIFT Technologies, a company that provided IT support for small and medium-sized businesses, for $167 million.[69]
In 2012, in response to overall revenue decline, Best Buy announced plans to undergo a "transformation strategy". Stores began to adopt a redesigned "Connected Store" format, providing the Geek Squad with a centralized service desk and implementing a "store-within-a-store" concept for Pacific Kitchen & Bath and Magnolia Design Center.[70]
In April 2012, Brian Dunn resigned as Best Buy’s CEO during an internal company investigation into allegations of personal misconduct stemming from an inappropriate relationship with a female Best Buy employee.[71] Best Buy named Director George L. Mikan III interim CEO following Dunn’s resignation.[71] The internal investigation was released in May 2012 and alleged that Best Buy founder and chairman Richard Schulze knew of Dunn’s inappropriate relationship and failed to notify the Best Buy board.[71] Schulze subsequently resigned his chairmanship of the company.[71] Best Buy Director Hatim Tyabji replaced Schulze as Best Buy chairman.[71]
Hubert Joly replaced Mikan as Best Buy CEO in September 2012.[72] Joly had previously served as CEO of Carlson, a hospitality conglomerate, since 2008.[72]
In April 2013, Best Buy exited the European consumer electronics market when it sold its 50% stake in Carphone Warehouse back to the UK-based mobile phone retailer.[73][74] The sale was worth approximately $775 million.[73][74]
An increasing trend towards online shopping began to erode revenues and profits in the 2010s. A 4% dip in sales for the June 30, 2014 quarter, marked the tenth quarter in a row where Best Buy's sales had declined. The company, in announcing the result, said it was focusing more on digital-media in its marketing, moving away from newspaper, magazine, and television advertising.[75]
On March 28, 2015, Best Buy announced the shutdown of the Future Shop chain in Canada; 65 of its 131 former locations were converted into Best Buy locations, while the rest (primarily those in close proximity to an existing Best Buy) were shuttered permanently.[76]
On May 24, 2016, Best Buy announced Sharon McCollam would step down as Chief Financial Officer on June 14.[77]

Best Buy sells consumer electronics and a variety of related merchandise, including software, video games, music, VHS cassettes and VCRs, mobile phones, digital cameras, car stereos and video cameras, in addition to home appliances (washing machines, dryers, and refrigerators), in a non-commissioned sales environment.[3] Under the Geek Squad brand, Best Buy offers computer repair, warranty service, and accidental service plans.[3]
The building exteriors of Best Buy-branded stores are typically light brown, with the entrance designed to look like a blue box emerging from the structure.[78] Corporate employees operated under a results only work environment from 2005 until March 2013, when the management style was abandoned by Best Buy CEO Hubert Joly.[79][80]
As of October 29, 2016, Best Buy operated 1,026 Best Buy, 331 Best Buy Mobile stand-alone stores and 28 stand-alone Pacific Sales stores in the US.[1][3] Best Buy also operated: 135 Best Buy and 53 Best Buy Mobile stand-alone stores in Canada; and 18 Best Buy stores and 5 Best Buy Express stores in Mexico.[3] Best Buy exited the European market in April 2013.[73][74]

Criticism
Warranty
In 2000, two Florida consumers brought a lawsuit against the company, alleging that it engaged in fraudulent business practices related to the sale of extended warranties (or, more accurately, service plans). The suit claimed that store employees had misrepresented the manufacturer's warranty in order to sell its own Product Service/Replacement Plan and that Best Buy had "entered into a corporate-wide scheme to institute high-pressure sales techniques involving the extended warranties" and that the company used "artificial barriers to discourage consumers who purchased the 'complete extended warranties' from making legitimate claims."[81] The company ultimately settled for $200,000 but admitted no wrongdoing.[82]
In 2014, Best Buy settled for $4.55 million in a class action lawsuit filed against them in April 2010 by consumers who claimed Best Buy was making unsolicited phone calls in contravention of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.[83]
Pricing
In the second quarter of 2007, Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal ordered an investigation into the company's use of an in-store website alleged to have misled customers on item sales prices.[84] In December 2007, the Los Angeles Times reported on the same issue, in which some customers claimed they thought they were surfing the Internet version of bestbuy.com at an in-store kiosk only to learn that the site reflected in-store prices only. In response, company spokesperson Sue Busch indicated the in-store kiosks were not intended for price-match purposes and rather were a means to navigate in-store availability. Since the initial investigation, a banner was placed on the in-store site to make its customers more aware of the difference.[85]
Similar pricing errors occurred in July 2009, when the Palm Pre multimedia smartphone was mistakenly sold for $99.99 (versus the retail price of $199.99), and Best Buy honored some of the sales.[citation needed] Best Buy regularly exercises the right to cancel orders associated with errors on its website.[citation needed]
Analog televisions
In April 2008, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) fined the company $280,000 for not alerting customers that the analog televisions it sold would not receive over-the-air stations after the digital transition on June 12, 2009.[86] The company challenged this ruling in May 2008 by the FCC saying it was and is in compliance with current FCC regulations pertaining to the digital transition.[87]
Environmental issues
It was one of several large companies named by Greenpeace in 2007 for purchasing raw materials or manufactured products derived thereof from logging companies that, in the opinion of Greenpeace, contribute to unethical deforestation of taiga in Canada.[88]
Since that time, however, the company launched what it calls Greener Together to increase the energy efficiency of its products as well as reduce consumer waste through more recyclable packaging and proper disposal of certain electronic components such as rechargeable batteries, and empty ink cartridges.[89]
As a way to improve its image and past environmental issues, the company introduced a recycling program in 2009 that has since collected nearly half-a-billion pounds of consumer electronics and e-waste and is available at all their stores for free. These items are then handed over to certified recyclers in the U.S. for proper recycling. The company's goal is to collect one billion pounds of recycling.[90]
It also has been named to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency top-50 list of the largest green-power purchasers. In 2011, the company purchased nearly 119 million kilowatt-hours (kWh) of green power –  electricity generated from renewable resources, such as wind, solar, geothermal, biogas, biomass and low-impact hydropower.[91]

The parties are positive a deal could be signed by September as major issues such as granting loss-making Spotify a more favorable revenue split in return for making some new albums accessible only to its paying subscribers for a defined period have already been agreed, the sources said.      However, the precise revenue split and the size of a potential guaranteed upfront payment to the label, home to artists including Ed Sheeran and Muse, have yet to be agreed, said two of the sources.  "The negotiations are at a crossroads," said one of the sources, asking not to be named because the talks are private, adding discussions were taking place daily.     "There are still a number of key points that remain to be agreed. If we manage to come to terms on these points, then it could lead to a very quick transaction. If not, any deal would remain at bay." Others saw a deal being done by late summer. "Given the way talks are progressing, I would be surprised if we don't have a deal in September," said another source on the other side of the table.  Spotify Takes Wing Sweden's Spotify has grown in less than a decade into the world's most popular streaming music service, but its financial sustainability hinges on its ability to strike music licensing contracts at less onerous royalty rates..  Basic features of Spotify are free and supported by advertising while paying subscribers enjoy unlimited listening and other premium features. It faces mounting competition from far bigger internet players such as Apple (AAPL.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O), which can afford to subsidize their push into music by drawing on money they make in other businesses. The streaming firm, which was recently valued at $13 billion, is pushing for a 50-50 revenue split but Warner Music is demanding it retains at least 52 percent of the royalties, in line with the other labels, according to the sources. Under the terms of their current agreement, Spotify pays 55 percent of royalties to Warner. Warner is also pushing to receive a guaranteed upfront payment regardless of subscription growth, said one of the sources.     The label, owned by billionaire investor Len Blavatnik's Access Industries, is also asking for protection against the  potential rise of unsigned artists who could over time reduce its revenue share. A smartphone with a headset with Spotify logo are seen in front of a displayed Warner Music logo in this illustration picture taken July 24, 2017.Dado RuvicThis follows recent press reports that Spotify was filling its playlists with anonymous or little known artists to reduce the influence of the majors, said one of the sources.     Warner would be ready to reduce its royalties rate from 55 percent to 52 percent provided these issues were resolved, said the same person. Spotify declined to comment. Other Deals     Earlier this year, the Swedish company struck a licensing deal with Vivendi's (VIV.PA) Universal Music Group (UMG) to pay the world's largest label a lower royalty rate. This was recently followed by a similar agreement with Sony Music. Spotify didn't disclose the terms of the deals but it was widely reported that the streaming firm had managed to lower the royalty rate from about 57 percent to 52 percent, based on growing volumes of paying listeners. Slideshow (2 Images)In return, the streaming service agreed to restrict new albums to paying subscribers for a couple of weeks before offering access to free users.     As of June, Spotify had 53 million paying users or 40 percent of streaming music subscribers worldwide, according to MIDiA Research. It has more than 140 million active users, including free listeners. By comparison, Apple had 19 percent, or 28.2 million music subscribers, in June, up from 20 million in December, while Amazon held 12 percent, or 16 million subscribers, MIDiA estimated. Heading for the Market One of the sources said Spotify, which hired Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to advise it on a stock market listing, is still aiming to go public via a direct listing toward the end of this year or the beginning of the next.    Spotify recorded revenues of 2.9 billion euros for 2016, up 51 percent from 2015, according to company filings in Luxembourg in June.  Operating losses grew 48 percent to 349.4 million euros, but including financing costs, its losses before tax leapt 133 percent to 539 million euros.     Last year, Universal held a 28.9 percent share of global music label revenue, Sony Music generated 22.4 percent and Warner 17.4 percent. Independent labels made up the remaining 31.3 percent, according to MIDiA Research.     The company has faced boycotts from some top music artists who have complained its free services undercut the value of their work but the major label licensing deals have gone some way toward easing these tensions, according to analysts.

The Art of Describing a Product in One Sentence


A look back at early interviews with Facebook and Uber CEOs illustrates an ingenious way to communicate hard-to-describe products.

WRITE A COMMENT

As a founder, I spent countless hours refining my elevator pitch and practicing it every chance I got. I learned that "leading with the need" is an extremely effective way to position your product as solving an important problem for your customers.
It's a shame that most potential customers don't hear about my product from me. Like 50 percent of startup founders, I rely on word of mouth to promote my product. The catch is that my customers haven't learned my well-practiced elevator pitch. Worse still, they don't have a full 30 seconds to explain how the product works in detail--I'm lucky if they take more than three seconds to describe it.
How customers talk about your product
Your product will only come up in conversations when it's perceived as being relevant to that conversation. Here's a typical word-of-mouth scenario:
 Something triggers your customer to remember your product. For example, perhaps somebody has described the need that your product addresses. Your customer will introduce your product tentatively with a question, "Have you heard about product X?" Without much setup, your customer jumps head-first into a simplified description of how it works--typically in a single sentence. If the description resonates, great. If not, your customer will justify why they think it's relevant to the conversation and move on.
I wanted to know why some one-sentence descriptions sound like a genius idea and others flop. As I researched how the founders of successful startups presented their products before they were well-known, I discovered something interesting.
Viral products tend to have a "lead feature"
In this early interview before Facebook's IPO, Mark Zuckerberg describes Facebook as:
"Something where you can type someone's name and find out a bunch of information about them."


Mark is describing one of Facebook's features--the ability to view profiles of real people. There is no talk of "social networks" or helping the world to connect to each other. Just a simple and practical description of a key feature of the product.
In 2011, Travis Kalanick described Uber (at the 21:15 mark) as a mobile app where
"You push a button and in five minutes a Mercedes picks you up and takes you where you want to go."
Travis doesn't lead with buzzwords like platform and marketplace. Instead, he focuses on just one button and uses vividly specific language to make the outcome extremely appealing. Today, Uber has further simplified it to "Tap a button, get a ride."
The format of both descriptions is the same: "You do X and Y happens." X is the input and Y is the output. This input-output pair matches our intuition about how software works. Simplifying the product as a straightforward input and desirable output creates the sense that it's an ingenious idea.
Facebook and Uber have thousands of features, yet Mark and Travis elevate a single feature above the others, making the product easy to understand, easy to remember, and, most importantly, easy to talk about.
How to promote a feature to lead feature
A product's features are usually highly interconnected, making it hard to know which one to choose. I've found it helpful to think through the user experience chronologically. Find the first, unique feature that's highly desirable to the user and describe it in terms of inputs and outcomes.
If you choose a feature without a clear input, you risk confusing the user. Presenting a feature that other products have invites the terror-inducing question of "why is it different from X?" For example, Facebook allows users to share photos with friends, but if Mark led with this feature, it would beg the question: "Why can't I just use email?"
I'd argue that even the most complex SaaS platforms can be simplified with an illustrative lead feature. But what if your product is the exception? In that case, it's not a good idea to rely on word of mouth to grow your business. If you find it hard to describe, imagine how hard it will be for your customers. In this case, a salesforce might be a more reliable channel.
Tactical or strategic?
It's easy to mistake a one-line description as just another communications tactic. However, crafting this sentence is one of the most strategic decisions a founder can make. If we want our product to be shared by word of mouth, then we must accept that it will likely pass from person to person as a single sentence.
Figuring out this sentence early in the process can focus our product development on the inputs and outputs that really matter and our marketing efforts on helping us enter the right conversations. Seize the opportunity to craft and test single sentences early--before you build something that's too hard to describe.

Taylor Swift is returning her music catalog to streaming services, ending the digital music world’s highest-profile feud and affirming that streaming is now the dominant music format.On Thursday evening, Ms. Swift’s management announced on Twitter that since her latest album, “1989,” has now sold 10 million copies around the world, she “wants to thank her fans by making her entire back catalog available to all streaming services tonight at midnight.”For Spotify in particular, Ms. Swift’s return has great symbolic significance. Shortly after she released “1989,” in October 2014, Ms. Swift removed her entire catalog from Spotify, saying later, “I’m not willing to contribute my life’s work to an experiment that I don’t feel fairly compensates the writers, producers, artists and creators of this music.”It was the highest-profile protest at a moment when many artists were highly suspicious of streaming, and concerned that the new format would erode their sales of CDs and downloads.
