Range Design 
Cubic delivers shooting ranges and training systems that meet international design standards, as well as local and global health and safety laws, to provide safe, cost-effective and low-maintenance solutions.
Cubic maintains a standard of design excellence underpinned by a corporate culture that differentiates us from our competitors. We see design as being a holistic process in which sustainability and safety are key, as well as form, function, people and environment.
Our range designers regularly meet with the TAS group in the United Kingdom to discuss the latest developments in range design best practices. The TAS group manages the JSP 403 Handbook for Defence Land Range Safety on behalf of the UK's Ministry of Defence.
A safety-by-design methodology is fully embraced and encouraged, so that occupational and environmental risks are accounted for in early stages to reduce hazards in the construction and end-use phases of the project.
Our implementation of Building Information Modeling (BIM) allows our designers to work with remote consultants on the same data file that represents decisions being made by the global team. The same files are available to the climate, energy and environmental impact analysis consultants and cost analysis consultants to facilitate a seamless process.
Accreditation
Design and whole-system quality management audits are carried out annually by internationally accredited assessors. Cubic has:

ISO 9001 certification
Safe contractor accreditation

EOD and Explosives Skills Training
The NEK Services EOD and Explosives Skills program provides a single resource for advanced Explosive Ordnance Disposal and Tactical Operations training. Courses provided can be custom tailored to fulfill numerous special operations requirements.
Courses combine advanced EOD skills with tactical applications to support EOD integration into all special operations communities. The result of each course is to develop the skill sets needed to plan, support and conduct EOD operations in highly complex environments.
Courses are designed to fulfill requirements for all special operations communities, to include confirm and ID, intelligence collection, and safe practices during assault operations.
All courses have been developed from the ground up by experienced Explosive Ordnance Disposal and Special Forces personnel with the needs of the operator in mind.  The courses are taught by operators for operators, with an emphasis on knowledge and skill sets that can be used downrange and in mission planning.
Course format
When possible, all courses are built on a crawl/walk/run model, beginning with classroom lectures followed by hands-on practical exercises in each topic, and finishing with a culminating exercise in which the students are required to use the knowledge and skills acquired throughout the course.
The course structures a low student-to-instructor ratio which ensures maximum student comprehension and safety.
Training locations
Courses offered by NEK Services are available at our training locations in Colorado, as well as at Mobile Training Team (MTT) courses at client-selected locations.  Our Colorado facilities offer the client a choice of a more remote location with inclusive on-site messing and berthing, or a more central location near Colorado Springs.  Both training campuses have fully equipped laboratories with demolition and small arms ranges adjacent to the lab.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    0.77      Net Money Flow ($)  -269,847    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.
