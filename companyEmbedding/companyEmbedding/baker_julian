Paleo Bread™ was inspired by the Paleolithic diet due to it’s health and dietary benefits.  Those who follow the Paleo lifestyle cut out all grains and eat what our native hunters and gatherers ate many years ago.  It’s a food plan based on lean meats, seafood, nuts, fruits, and fresh vegetables.  We created two versions of Paleo Bread which meet any and all requirements in order to be kind to practically any diet.  Both breads are healthy, low calorie, gluten free and grain free.  The Almond variety and the Coconut variety are equally tasty and both offer their own unique benefits.
Julian Bakery made Paleo Bread™ to fulfill the craving for bread while you are living a Paleo lifestyle free from processed foods. Paleo Bread utilizes the highest quality ingredients.  This bread provides the protein and fiber your body needs to satisfy hunger while helping your body to perform at its peak.  We love The Paleo Bread and hope you do too!

Ben, NY – March 20, 2017:
	
Excellent fried in coconut oil or a healthy high heat oil on both sides and used for sandwiches. So hard to find an almond bread out there. Thanks! Haven’t eaten many sandwiches since I went “paleo” 10 years ago. This was a nice surprise. It thaws well in the microwave first. Would be good with a bit of healthy fruit spread and coconut oil.

Sandra McLaughlin, J.D. – March 26, 2017:
	
The almond bread toasts well! I enjoy it with avocado in the mornings or all sorts of toppings. I feel great after eating it and restaurants let me hand them the bag and they toast it for me or use it to make sandwiches! I am very happy I can eat a bread with no nightshades-potato starch, e.g., nor yeast. My arthritis is absent when I refrain from nightshades and fermented items. I eat gluten and dairy free due to autoimmune issues and have normal labs with these dietary changes. I eat from the garden and meat, but really like breads! I like ALL of Julian’s breads and there is zero competition out there! Thank you, Julian, for loving us enough to feed us!

I’ve been doing the ketogenic lifestyle for 3+ years, this is a perfect bread solution for those sandwhich cravings! I like to pan fry them with grassfed butter and then grill them with brie cheese and bacon. Soooo yummy!

I don’t have dietary issues and do not adhere to a strict paleo diet. I do, however, have a raging sweet tooth that I try to keep in check by eating a low glycemic diet day to day, and limit high glycemic foods to those times when I am deliberately treating myself to “sweets”. This bread  is more the texture of “quick bread” (like banana, or zucchini), which was a surprise. Its very tasty and satisfying, almost rich. This bread will be a good delivery system for peanut butter and bananas or soft boiled eggs.

I read about this bread in my book Paleo For Vegetarians. I quickly ordered and received bread today. Wow! This is SO delicious! This bread will save me!! I don’t eat white bread, rice or other unhealthy starches. But a slice of heaveanly Julian’s Paleo Bread,  is a great treat! I think this diet/ life change will work for me!! Thank you!

J Kim – April 27, 2017:
	
On Wednesday, April 26, 2017 my daughter and I drove to Julian Bakery in Oceanside. It is in a business park and easy to locate. They have a small storefront bakery where they have a few items out to purchase, the bread is actually in the back, and I assume so is most of their other items. They bake on Monday and Tuesday, which is why I chose to go on Wednesday. I wanted freshly made bread and all the bread at the other stores must be kept in the freezer because they are moist and would spoil too quickly otherwise. March 24 I was diagnosed with stage three breast cancer and found out from David Getoff’s website that Paleo bread was the only bread that he would recommend if you HAD to have bread. There are no grains used in Paleo bread and they use Stevia if a sweetener is needed. The bread is more like a banana nut or zucchini bread, moist. It does well in the toaster, but I like the moistness of the bread and sometimes it in plain. (Grains, including all rice, potatoes, etc. turn rapidly into sugar which is BAD for people with cancer. Cancer cells have 9500 receptor sites, while normal cells only have four. Sugar keeps the body in an acid state, which is how cancer can expand so rapidly. ALL microwaved foods turn acidic. Anything fried has a pH level of 4 and below (BAD). Cancer LOVES sugar and fat. So my diet has changed.  You can store the bread in the frig for up to 4 weeks. It freezes for about twelve months. The bread is organic and non-gmo. I have been eating mostly organic for quite awhile now and now that I REALLY need to change my diet . . . I will be coming to the Julian Bakery MUCH more in the future!! Elizabeth is a wonderful help, very informative! (She is NOT the person that you speak to on the phone – that person is in another building, in customer service.) This is a little out of the way for me (35 minute drive) but well worth it!! Thank you Julian Bakery!! They also have things for Pegan and something else, but I did not really pay attention because I have to go Paleo . . . 🙂

I have tried many lower cost loafs but this is the best. If your loaf costs less than 29 bucks your eating a lesser quality bread that isnt real bread.

Steve M – May 14, 2017:
	
I love this bread but my local Whole Foods (Los Gatos CA) appears to no longer stock it.
Where can I now buy it from (other than online)?








Julian Bakery, Inc. – May 14, 2017:
	
Right now online only with FREE Shipping. We would suggest to let your local Whole Foods team leader of that dept. know you would like them to bring it back in. We do offer it online for less+ offer free shipping. Our bread last 3 weeks in the fridge and 12  months frozen.

Love this bread only bread other then what I make at home I can eat. I have celiac disease, and Ulcerative Colitis, I have a allergy to corn, intolerance to carbs, yeast, soy, dairy, among a few other things.  Julian Bakery Almond Bread is a life saver, reminds me of whole grain bread from my child hood. I love to put nutivia butter flavored coconut oil on it and toast it with cinnamon. IT does have to be toasted to hold up well but raw I like to use it to scramble in with eggs sometimes. Toasted it is great with almond butter and sugar free jam, avacado and eggs, bit of avacado mayo, and what ever else you wish. I find they work better as open sandwiches, then a true sandwich.   Other thoughts try topping them with a paleo cheese after toasting and slowly warm it up to melt it on (Julian paleo cheese can take a bit to melt so low and slow as to not burn it) and it makes a lovely cheesy bread.    One of my oddest and favorite things is a bit of nutiva butter flavored coconut oil and some caraway seeds as this makes it taste like a rye bread I use to eat as a child before my diagnosis.

TimberLine Magazine Article - Restless Nature Gets Retired Farmer into Pallet Business: Baker Products Cant Cut-Up Line Gets Monster Pallets Going

Restless Nature Gets Retired Farmer into Pallet Business: Baker Products Cant Cut-Up Line Gets Monster Pallets GoingMonster Pallets: Julian Drake started a pallet company in his 60�s when most people are more interested in retiring; the company uses Baker Products equipment to manufacture pallet stock from hardwood cants.By Tim CoxDate Posted: 6/1/2009DRAKE, South Carolina � Julian Drake was not made for the rocking chair. He has worked hard all his life and has no plans to stop now. When most people his age are taking it easy in retirement, Julian decided to start a new business � a pallet manufacturing business.����������� Julian, 68, was born and raised on a family farm in Drake, S.C., about 35 miles north of Florence. He worked alongside his father and uncle, learning the business of farming and running a cotton gin. When he began farming on his own, he grew cotton and soybeans, bought and sold grain, sold and spread fertilizer, and owned and operated the cotton gin.����������� Over the years Julian developed an uncanny ability to design and make anything he needed on the farm or in the cotton gin. With his mechanical ability and since his 100-year-old home is located miles from the nearest fire station, Julian developed and patented several pieces of firefighting equipment. That success led him to start a fire truck and equipment company.����������� After selling the fire equipment company and retiring from the fire truck business, Julian began to look at other manufacturing businesses and ideas. He talked to his son, Rogers, about various business ideas. Julian wanted to start a business that would deal with industrial customers, not require a lot of travel and create manufacturing jobs in his home, Marlboro County.����������� Based on Julian�s manufacturing experience and the availability of a rent-free building Julian owned, Rogers suggested his father look into starting a pallet manufacturing business. The Drake area is centrally located to lots of hardwood stock, and various manufacturing businesses are located within 50 miles. Also, the labor market is good.����������� �We decided to open Monster Pallets,� said Julian. His farm had housed an old plywood mill, and he was able to use the building for the pallet plant. �It�s a great feeling to know this building came to be as a sawmill over 80 years ago, and here we are today making wood pallets,� said Julian.����������� They decided on operating a plant that would process hardwood cants into new pallet stock. Rogers helped his father research machinery and equipment for making pallet stock and assembling pallets. He looked on the Internet, including the Pallet Enterprise Web site (www.palletenterprise.com), and made a lot of phone calls. They narrowed it down to Baker Products.����������� They made a trip to visit the Baker Products plant in Ellington, Missouri. �Baker was the way to go,� said Julian. �Once we got down there and saw the machinery and how it was manufactured, the decision was confirmed,� he said. �We bought the whole cut-up line from them and put it in.� He also purchased all the material handling equipment from Baker Products.����������� With his experience in farming, the cotton gin and firefighting equipment, Julian is knowledgeable about machinery and equipment, and he was very impressed with the Baker Products factory operations and the industrial quality of the company�s equipment.����������� Julian started Monster Pallets in mid-2007 and hired eight employees. The company is capable of producing 20-25,000 pallets per month. The focus of the business has been specialty and custom pallets. �We did pretty well at that,� Julian said, when he started the company. Monster Pallet also has some high-volume customers that buy several footprints or sizes in large, consistent quantities. Julian established a warehouse and distribution center in Charleston to service warehouse and manufacturing operations located near the ports.����������� He buys hardwood cants, usually 3-1/2x6 in 10- and 12-foot lengths, from sawmills in the Carolinas. The incoming cants are placed on an unscrambler to be singulated and fed to a three-head cut-off saw. After the cants are cut to length, the pieces go through a sizer that uses a bandsaw blade to size them to the correct height. Once the material has been sized, it goes through a Baker four-head band resaw. Finished cut stock is cleaned by a Baker de-duster. If the line is cutting stringers that require notching, the material is fed to a Baker two-head notching machine.����������� In addition to the cut-up equipment, Baker Products supplied all the material handling equipment, which included the cant unscrambler with package deck, v-deck and dealer deck, a trough conveyor, an incline conveyor to carry cant end trims into a steel hopper, a three-strand transfer with staging, live head and rolls, an off-stacking transfer conveyor, stacking racks and an unscrambler feed for the notching machine.����������� Pallets are assembled by hand with two Bronco Pallet Systems nailing stations. The Bronco nailing stations consist of a jig set at an incline to make it easier to insert pallet components. A pneumatic nailing tool is suspended overhead. After the worker nails the bottom face of the pallet, he turns it over, inserts the top deck boards, and finishes nailing the pallet. The nailing stations have a stacker on the back to automatically stack the finished pallets. Julian and his employees also built a couple of tables used for assembling pallets.����������� The company uses Stanley-Bostitch pneumatic nailing tools and collated nails. Julian buys saw blades and notching tools from Baker.����������� Julian supplies some of his waste wood material to paper mills and gives some of it away. He is looking at the possibility of using it for feedstock for a wood fuel pellet mill.����������� Julian is considering investing in an automated nailing machine and also may add a pallet heat-treating system.����������� Julian helps run the shop equipment and is responsible for sales. He calls on local businesses and has a Web site to market the company. The Web site, www.monsterpallets.com, was designed and is maintained by his granddaughter, Bailey, 16.����������� The company�s customers are primarily manufacturers with specific custom pallet requirements and warehouse businesses that receive floor-loaded goods in shipping containers; the goods must be removed from the containers and loaded onto pallets.����������� One thing about the Baker line of equipment that particularly impressed Julian was the heavy-built construction. Some machinery in the cotton gin was anchored to the floor, he noted. When he received the Baker equipment, Julian noticed that some machines did not have fittings or holes to anchor it. He called his Baker representative, Clay Hedrick, and asked him about it. Clay told him the machines would not �walk� or move on the plant floor and therefore would not need to be anchored. �It has not moved,� said Julian. �That amazes me every day.������������ When the equipment arrived, Baker provided Julian with preliminary drawings, and he had an electrician run power to the main boxes. The Baker equipment is fitted with openings for fork tines so the machines can be lifted and set in place with a forklift, which was what they did. All the electrical plugs are color coded. It took Julian and two helpers only a half-day to put the machinery in place and make the electrical connections.����������� �It was done,� said Julian. �Plug it up. Let�s go.������������ �We haven�t had a minute�s problem,� he added. One hydraulic valve went bad. He called Baker and got the part the next day. �I slipped it on in less than 10 minutes. That was the only problem we had with it.������������ In addition to the quality and performance of the Baker Products equipment, Julian has been especially impressed with the knowledge and quick response of the Baker Products staff.����������� In the future Julian plans to add automatic nailing machines and a pallet heat-treating system so he can keep lowering his costs while delivering the quality his customers have come to expect.����������� �I have some grandchildren,� he said. �Maybe when they grow up, they�ll be interested in running a pallet business.������������ �I have to work,� said Julian. �I�ve got to go.�Baker Builds Machines to Process Logs, Cants, Lumber into Cut Stock����������� Baker Products, based in Ellington, Mo., is a leading supplier of machinery and equipment to the pallet and other wood processing industries.����������� The company was founded by Ed Baker, who first operated a pallet manufacturing business.����������� Ed was a pioneer in developing the thin-kerf horizontal bandsaw for resawing cants into pallet deck boards and stringers. He developed the horizontal bandsaw resaw for his own pallet plant, and other pallet manufacturers began asking him to build machines for them. He founded Baker Products as a machinery business in 1988.����������� The company and its product line have grown significantly in the intervening years, and Baker Products now is headed by Mike McNail, president.����������� Baker Products can supply individual machines or complete equipment lines to remanufacture cants and rough lumber into pallet stock as well as scragg mills to process low-grade or scragg logs. The company manufactures a line of portable band sawmills and other lumber remanufacturing equipment, including edgers, planer-moulders, chamfers, board de-dusters and much more. Baker Products manufactures material handling equipment to move and convey logs, cants, lumber and residual wood material, such as slabs, edgings, trim blocks and more.����������� Baker Products has been especially associated with its successful thin-kerf bandsaws for resawing cants and rough lumber into pallet stock. The resaws are available as a single, stand-alone machine or in multiple configurations or heads that will completely resaw a cant into deck boards or stringers in one pass down the entire resaw line.����������� For more information, visit the Baker Products Web site at www.logtolumber.com or call the company at (800) 548-6914.

"Well, we’re always thinking that someday we’ll be happy.You know, we’ll get that car or that job or that person in our lives that’ll fix everything. But happiness is a mood,and it’s a condition,not a destination. It’s like being tired or hungry. It’s not permanent. It comes and goes,and that’s okay. And I feel like if people thought of it that way, they’d find happiness a lot more often."
―Julian Baker[src]
Julian Andrew Baker (born Julian Andrew Norris) was a film Producer who arrived in Tree Hill to create a film adaption of Lucas Scott's first novel, who was unaware of Julian's history with Peyton Sawyer. He eventually revealed an interest in Peyton's best friend, Brooke Davis. When the film's production fell through, he left town for Los Angeles, but Brooke, who had realized and accepted her feelings for him, followed him. Deciding to let him into her life, the two reunited. The two then embarked on a long-distance relationship while he made a new movie, but they eventually reunited in Tree Hill, and got engaged. The couple was later married, and had twin sons, Davis and Jude Baker. After the birth of his children, he acquired a soundstage and began a TV series based on Brooke's life in high school called Ravens


Background
    Julian Norris with his mother, Sylvia.  
Julian was the only son and child born to Paul and Sylvia Norris (née Baker). His father was an esteemed film producer who introduced Julian to the film industry and made his love of cinema grow. However, Paul often neglected his son, choosing his work over his relationship with Julian. This prompted Julian's closer relationship with his mother. 
Julian admired the magic he believed his mother had inside of her but he slowly saw the magic fade away as his mother started to feel unloved due to Paul's involvement in his work. When his mother sunk into a depression and Julian was unable to save her, he developed a complex about saving people. This would affect his later relationships with Peyton Sawyer, Brooke Davis, and Alex Dupre. With his close relationship to his mother and distant relationship with his father, Julian took on his mother's surname at the age of fifteen and also began calling his father by his first name. ("Some Roads Lead Nowhere")

    Julian Norris in high school.  
Attending high school, Julian was a typical geek, although it is now assumed otherwise. In his year book photo, Julian appears geekish and was also a member of the debate and pep club with national honors and was also a mathlete.
After watching his mother fade away, Julian tried to remain close to his father but struggled. One day, however, Julian and Paul spent the day together and went to see the film The Thin Red Line and Julian would later claim that that day was the one day he spent believing he was close to his father and was therefore the best of his childhood. Careerwise, Julian originally tried to work in music as a guitarist. After a failed career as a guitarist, Julian then decided, despite Paul's neglect afterwards, that he wanted to make movies to be like his father. Wanting to be seen as an independent producer, Julian moved away from his father to North Hollywood. Although working out of the shadow of his father, Julian would often return to his dad for support financially, which he disliked as he knew Paul would see him as more of a failure. With most of the films Julian has created, Paul has noticed a recurring theme, that he plans for a brilliant movie, but the plans never become completed. ("What Are You Willing To Lose?") ("Sympathy for the Devil")

    Julian meets Peyton after her break up with Lucas ("Sympathy for the Devil")   During his time in North Hollywood, he met Peyton Sawyer at an office. As they met, Julian invited Peyton, who had just broke up with her high school boyfriend, Lucas Scott to a due he had for a movie so she could be used as a quick getaway claiming she was 'the saddest girl alive.' The two fell in love and Peyton watched as Julian created a movie that eventually got him to Sundance. However, during their romance, Julian noticed Peyton had what he called an "obsession" with her ex's book, An Unkindness of Ravens. When confronted about this, the couple broke up and Julian claimed to go to Sundance alone. However, Julian was so heartbroken that he stayed at home. He missed both the Sundance Festival and his movie's premiere. Although he did not attend, his father planted a story in the media that he had been sleeping with an A-list celebrity, boosting his profile. Julian also read the book by Lucas and decided to go and find Peyton in Tree Hill. However, when he read the book, he found that he connected more with Brooke Davis.
Character arc
Season 6
    Julian and Lucas talk about the film. ("Our Life is Not a Movie or Maybe")  
Julian Baker is first introduced as a producer eager to make Lucas's first novel into a movie. He introduces himself as the person interested in making a film out of his book and tells him he wants to get a feel for the place where the book takes place. After a while Lucas agrees. Julian then says it would pay 300,000 grand and Lucas suddenly rethinks. Julian then asks about Peyton. After persuading Lucas to option of his movie, he run into Peyton (leaving the toilets at Tric after he and Lucas sign the contract) and she realizes Julian is the one making the movie and it is soon revealed that he is her ex-boyfriend. Lucas finds out about Julian and Peyton, he punches Julian although they still carry on with the movie although with heated tension between the two men.
Julian soon forms a close friendship with Sam (Brooke's foster daughter) after she asks him to read some of her work. Julian then goes to see Brooke, he asks her to design the costumes for the movie as it would be very beneficial to both him and her and she later agrees. When Lucas meets Julian's father Paul, he is quick to criticize Julian's work and suggests Lucas should find someone else of the movie. When Sam goes missing he helps to look for her and eventually finds her along with Brooke.

    Lucas, Reese and Julian discuss the film. ("We Change, We Wait")  
After the ordeal with Sam, Julian and Brooke often meet up at her house to review her designs for the movie although Brooke denies that it is a date but a business meeting to Sam. At the Cafe Sam and Julian are bickering over whether he likes Brooke are not, Peyton walks in and Julian accuses her of being jealous as Sam tells him that she is pregnant he congratulates her, leaving with Peyton telling him that if he breaks Brooke’s heart, she’ll break his face. When he and Brooke meet up for their business meeting Julian brings them wine (which means it's a date). Brooke and Julian are talking about Brooke’s business as Julian admires her for her bravery and reveals he has the same situation but with his father rather than his mother and that he took his mother’s name to make it on his own but has to keep going back to his dad and feels like a failure. He says that one of these days he will not as Brooke toasts to that day. As he goes to leave, they both discuss how inappropriate it would be for them to kiss and be on a date due to work and Peyton, but they kiss ignoring all the other obstacles.

Julian and Lucas have turned down five directors. The following day, director #6 is seen as Julian’s dad comes to town as he is unhappy with their progress. Lucas and Julian meet Paul at a restaurant, who says it is time for him step in and tells them to pick a director or he will pick one for them. He tells them they have until tomorrow. Julian goes to see Brooke at her store and finds all the clothes lined up for the film. She shows him a letterman jacket and Julian is amazed. Julian tells her that he did not play sports in high school so never had a letterman jacket, so Brooke gives him one. But she later breaks up with him as she explains that she is trying to set a good example for Sam and does not want to have to explain having fun to Sam. As Julian asks what it is about, whether it is her, Sam or Peyton, Brooke says that it does not matter as he will be leaving after the movie anyway, but they later recoil. When Julian casts the Brooke role in his movie they argue about Brooke's clothing, Julian wanting it to be more slutty.    Brooke and Julian argue over her casting call. ("Screenwriter's Blues")  Later, he shows her a picture from his year book he seems very unpopular and was a mathlete and part of the debate team. He tells her that he wants the Brooke Davis now. He hands over a breakdown of the Brooke Davis he is looking for and Brooke reads a list of compliments that Brooke is. After Julian admits to Brooke he loves her, she is mad though, and after Julian talks to Brooke he realises the last person she was in love with was Lucas. Brooke tells him that she is not and that she is not Peyton. Julian apologizes but explains that he still worries after his relationship with Peyton. Julian tells Brooke that they would pretend that it never happen along Julian still like wary about Brooke's feelings towards Lucas.
Later Julian's father is fired at his film company and their film is cancelled. After ignoring each other Brooke and Julian finally meet up, he tells her that he does not want to say goodbye and shows her some plane tickets telling her that they could write their own love story in Malibu, but Brooke asks what she would do with Sam and as Julian shows her that he has got another plane ticket for her as Julian says he understands that she will come up with a million other excuse why not to go, but to go because he loves her. Brooke meets Julian in the airport but tells him as she has a life in Tree Hill.

    Brooke and Julian talk during Lucas and Peyton’s wedding. ("Forever and Almost Always")  
At Lucas and Peyton's wedding, Lucas invites Julian as Brooke's date, but he decides to take Missy instead. This infuriates Brooke and the two spend the evening making each other jealous with their dates. However, they later dance
and admit they miss each other. He later meets Brooke's mother, Victoria Davis, and tells her that his father often made him feel like a failure. He informs her that he sees the same in Brooke. When Victoria asks if he is finished, Julian says that he is in love with her daughter and that she will love him back someday. And when that day comes, she can either be nice to Brooke or not be in her life.

After Peyton collapses Julian joins Brooke at the hospital.     Brooke finally tells Julian she loves him. ("Remember Me as a Time of Day")   After talking about Sam they sleep together but Julian still leaves. Brooke goes to New York to see him, Julian is filming as he seems lonely and miserable. Suddenly, Brooke appears next time. She tells him that he said someday she would be able to love someone and thinks she has found that someone. Julian smiles saying that if it was a movie they would kiss as Brooke disagrees saying that if it was a movie she would say she loves him and then kiss him. She walks closer to him and tells him that she loves him and they kiss happily.
Inbetween
Brooke and Julian continue their relationship, but it becomes long-distance with Julian travelling around the world to film screenplays and Brooke working on her fashion line in Tree Hill. During this time, Julian made a movie in New Zealand that was expected to raise him to worldwide stardom as a film producer.

Season 7
Julian is with Brooke on a romantic beach date when he tells her that he got an offer to produce a movie in New Zealand and he would be gone for eight months. Brooke advises him to take it and it seems he does because he does not answer his phone when Brooke calls several times. He returns for Jamie's 7th birthday party, and Brooke is happy to see him. They almost have sex in Haley's spare bedroom until Haley and Quinn walk in on them. Julian later takes her to the beach again and reveals to Brooke that he turned the movie down.
Julian's father comes to town to tell Julian that he made a big mistake turning down the movie for Brooke, but Brooke stands up for Julian and his father leaves. Julian later meets Brooke's new model, Alex, who flirts with him and insults Brooke openly in front of him.
Brooke learns that she can't have children and tells Julian, who says he doesn't want any and promises to keep this news between them. While Brooke buries herself in work, Julian confides in Alex that he actually does want children. Alex decides to "help" Brooke by bringing her adoption pamphlets. Brooke blows up with anger and yells at Alex. She then yells at Julian for revealing that she cannot get pregnant to Alex and telling her he wanted children, something he never said to Brooke. Brooke's mother Victoria then tells Julian to take another movie, because Brooke wants some time alone for herself before she can trust him again. After an argument with Julian, Alex attempts to commit suicide by slitting her wrists. Julian finds Alex in her bathtub and informs Brooke, who goes to the hospital to support her now estranged boyfriend. Brooke soon comes to realize that Julian has a thing for girls in need, after finding out he began his relationship with Peyton while she was crying after breaking up with Lucas. Brooke's relationship with Julian started when she needed help looking for Sam, and now he wants to be with Alex since she needs his support to get better. She goes to see Alex at the hospital, but finds Julian sitting at her bedside holding her hand and assumes they are together. Brooke and Julian then spend 6 weeks apart when Brooke goes on a business trip with Alexander to start her men's line. She returns from her trip and runs into Julian at the airport, only to see that he's waiting for Alex. Julian comes to see her and they yet again fight about Alex, and when they fight again at Haley's concert, Julian tells Brooke he can't do it anymore and breaks up with her, leaving her heartbroken.
Brooke packs up all of Julian's things but is too nervous to bring them to him, so Victoria says she will take care of it and sends Alexander to do it, which angers Julian. He confronts Brooke, then later comes back to apologize and ask her to be the costume designer for the movie he is making with Alex. Brooke agrees to take the job only if Julian directs the film, which he does. Brooke later tells Julian that if he wants to, he can come to Haley and Quinn's '80s-themed fundraiser at the high school and it wouldn't be weird, but he tells her he has too much work to do before they begin filming. Julian is staying late at the set when Alex comes to comfort him and tells him that Brooke does actually want him to come to the dance. At the dance, Julian is uncomfortable, as being back at a high school reminded him of what a geek he used to be. He voices his insecurities to Alex, who confides that she used to be a geek also. Brooke later finds Julian in wood shop class and they talk. When she's about to leave, she kisses him to give him confidence for his first day of filming.

The two later go back to their working relationship, but this is severely tested after Brooke messes up costumes     Julian proposes to Brooke. ("Almost Everything I Wish I'd Said The Last Time I Saw You...")  and punches Alex in the face, causing days of filming to be lost, because Brooke thought that Julian and Alex had slept together, when, in fact, the two had traded rooms and Alex slept with Alexander, not Julian. Eventually, the two make up after Brooke visits him on set to explain, and she once again confesses her love for Julian.
Julian and Brooke finish the movie and then go on a trip to Utah with their friends for the premiere of Julian's movie which is a success. While in Utah Julian asks Brooke to "marry him" in the snow and she happily accepts.

Rutland Pride Magazine - Food Hero of the Year 2016
We are delighted to announce that the Rutland Pride Magazine has chosen our own Julian Carter as their Food Hero of the Year 2016 - well done Julian!


The 30 Best Bakeries in the UK- November 2016
The Sunday Times has included Hambleton Bakery in their list of the 30 Best Bakeries in the UK.
The 20 Best Bakeries in Britain - January 2016
Hambleton Bakery are delighted to have been listed as one of Britain's best bakeries in The Daily Telegraph at the weekend.
Hambleton Bakery is commended for the “Baker Of The Year” category in the Farm Shop & Deli Awards 2015 from over 500 entries.
Julian Carter, Hambleton Bakery's Head Baker is delighted to have been commended in the "Bakery Of The Year' category. 

Now in its second year, the Farm Shop & Deli Awards, in partnership with Olives Et Al, recognises the very best standards in the speciality retail market and celebrates the highest levels of service, product knowledge, initiative, innovation and community involvement.   The Awards praise the unsung heroes of the high street and speciality retail scene with categories ranging from butchers, bakers, farm shops and delis through to garden centres, food halls and online businesses.The awards were judged by a team of expert judges from the world of speciality retail, fine food and food media. Once the award entries had been received the judges drew up a shortlist of entrants and then carried out a series of ‘secret’ visits in December 2014 to see the entrants in action.Judge Nigel Barden, Chairman of Judges and Food and Drink Journalist/Broadcaster, says: “Another brilliantly rewarding set of visits. There are some very focused, driven and talented food retailers in Britain, who deserve to be nourished and encouraged.  It’s marvellous that these awards can bring them to much wider attention.”Elaine Lemm, the Co-Chair of Judges and Food Writer, says: "I thought the high standard of last year’s entries for the awards were unsurpassable. I was wrong. The quality, dedication and sheer hard work of all the businesses entering this year showed this is, once again, a sector of which to be proud. It is no wonder that shopping habits in the UK are changing with this retail of this quality on offer for the British shopper."Nikki Storrar, Overall Winner of the Awards in 2014 from Ardross Farm Shop, says: “Winning last year was beyond our dreams. It was actually a member of staff who gave us the idea as it was something we had never really considered. The year after winning the awards was fantastic. The staff got so much pride in what they were doing. So to be asked to be a judge this year was great but also pretty daunting because of the effect that you may have on the person who has entered. It’s also been a fantastic experience because I learnt a lot about what’s happening in the industry and I also could sympathize quite a lot with people who have entered.” The Farm Shop & Deli Awards 2015 received a record number of entrants from over 500 businesses across the UK, along with thousands of public votes from consumers supporting their favourite speciality retailers.
Hambleton Bakery was one of twelve category winners and twenty three commended chosen following a day of intensive judging by leading speciality retailers and key industry figures along with mystery visits conducted throughout December by Nigel Barden and Elaine Lemm.
The scores will now be counted and judged within the nine UK regions, announcing the Regional Champions in March – these winners will go through to the final with the chance to win Retailer of the Year.  The overall winner will be announced at the Farm Shop & Deli Show on Monday 20 April 2015 at 2:45pm at Birmingham’s NEC.
 


Hambleton Bakery's Julian Carter is "Baker of the Year" 2013
At last night's Bakery Industry Awards at London's Hilton  hotel, Rutland Baker Julian Carter took the top "Baker of the Year" award.
The last 12 months have been exciting for Julian.  His "Hambleton Bakery" based in Exton Rutland was voted "Britain's best Bakery" in the ITV show of that name screened last December.
In August Rutland planners accepted plans for his Exton bakery to double in size to cope with increased demand for its Artisan breads, cakes and savouries which are sold through its four local shops and 50 local restaurants delis and shops.
Bakery owner Tim Hart commented "Julian is a genius. We are all very proud!"
