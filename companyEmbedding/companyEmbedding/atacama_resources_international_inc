Atacama Resources International Releases Good2Drive, a Mobile Application
Apr 27 17
Atacama Resources International announced that the company has released Good2Drive, a mobile application that allows drivers, corporate fleets and law enforcement to test a driver's cognitive alertness before getting behind the wheel of a motor vehicle. Good2Drive uses a 60-90 second image matching test using a patented algorithm that was created based on the scientific study of cognitive abilities at various West Coast hospitals and universities. Good2Drive's features have been specifically designed with following needs in mind: Families - Young drivers are the higher risk group on the roads for traffic crashes. Test results from Good2Drive from any family member using the application are pushed to the Parent's phone, providing them peace of mind whenever their young driver gets behind the wheel. Individuals users have all had doubts about whether "good to drive." Now individuals will be able to double check their ability to drive before taking the risk. Whether it's a couple of drinks, prescription medication, or a long day at the office, it's no longer a guess -- Good2Drive will let users know when users are good to drive. Corporate Fleets - Moving cargo is stressful enough without having to worry about driver impairment. Good2Drive gives fleet owners proof that their cargo is in good hands. Good2Drive not only promotes safety but also means less risk of cargo lost to traffic crashes. Law Enforcement - A breathalyzer can't tell the whole story. Drugs and drowsy driving are contributing to a significant number of traffic crashes, many causing injuries and death. Good2Drive's 60-90 second test can be administered roadside, is not invasive, and gives law enforcement immediate results regarding the driver's current ability to operate a motor vehicle. A free trial version of Good2Drive will be available shortly on both iOS and Android devices. Continued use will cost $0.99 a month for individuals, $1.99 a month for families (up to five people), with pricing for Corporate Fleets and Law Enforcement Organizations available on request. Subscriptions for Good2Drive will soon be available for download on Android smartphones at Google Play and Apple smartphones at iTunes Store.

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the common stock offered 
through this Prospectus by the selling shareholders.


The company is aware of many other consulting companies providing a variety of
technical and business services to companies in the mining industry. We have not
located information for any other company or firm that is currently providing
the specific services that we offer or with the focused approach of AMRI, which
is to introduce and connect small and medium sized Chilean mining opportunities
to potential North American partners.


Company Description
Arrakis Mining Research Inc. (hereinafter “AMRI”) is a company incorporated in
the State of Florida in June 2013. We were formed as a consultant to the Mining
industry. The Mining industry is subject to constant change due to market
trends, thereby making it extremely competitive. The Mining


 industry is complex,
because several segments are regulated by both federal and state/provincial
governments. AMRI’s approach is intended to assist our potential clients with
general business operations with the growth and development, international
expansion, including mergers & acquisitions, and financing aspects of their
business, exposing our potential clients to a much wider international field of
opportunities and perspectives.

By using the services provided by AMRI, our clients are free to focus on
compliance with regulations within their industry, and to complete their primary
business goals.

AMRI focuses on two main aspects of the consulting business: international
expansion strategy, and financing.  Our programs will be tailored to meet the
needs and requests of our clients. We will assist our clients with growth by
exposing them to international merger and acquisition opportunities as well as
financing opportunities.

We will provide customized business strategies, based upon client preference,
which may include any or all of the following:

. International and domestic corporate development strategies;

. Strategic and financial partnering;                         
  
. Mergers and acquisitions;
---

In our CEO's business history he has consulted on a number of projects and as a
result, created a strong corporate history and respect in the mining industry.
The rate charged for our services will be dependent upon the level of consulting
services the client company is interested in utilizing and the complexity of the
client company business. AMRI consulting fees will be negotiated and established
based upon factors such as the level of services requested by the client.  

Thus far we have marketed our services primarily to mining and mining
development companies located in the United States of America (the “U.S.”) and
Canada. AMRI has been doing business since inception, June 2013. To date we have
not secured any paying clients, however we are confident that with the
relationships of our CEO, we will soon have paying clients. Originally formed to
do any and all legal business, the intent of the corporation was to specialize
in corporate development and growth management consultation.  Ken Olsen, our
president has been involved in the Company since inception and is the founder.
 We focus on geographic areas, projects and budget levels where we believe there
are significant demand for our services and the potential for attractive returns
to our Company and investors. We do not consider our Company to be a “blank
check company” as such term is defined in Securities and Exchange Commission
Rule 419; however, we are a company with minimal revenues and limited operations
and our auditor has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as
a going concern. The Company is not a blank-check company and is not being
formed for the purposes of a reverse merger or any other like transaction. The
Company does now and will continue to operate as an advisory company, on a
fee-based compensation basis, for independent clients requiring our expertise,
experience and international contact networks. The Company’s business plan is
first and foremost designed to grow organically by obtaining clients by personal
contact. However, as the opportunity present itself (to further our business
plan with potential growth through the acquisition of specialty service
providers and other independent consulting services companies) the Company will
consider acquisitions to enhance all of the personal efforts.  Any acquisitions
that the Company may make in the future would be of companies similar in nature
to our own, operating in similar or complementary industry segments or
geographic location to enhance the Company with new growth opportunities and a
competitive advantage.  AMRI anticipates growth through the consolidation of
consulting service providers, proprietary processes and small to mid-sized
independent management consulting companies that operate in related industries.
Our management has designed an aggressive but straightforward strategy to
transition AMRI to a full service independent mining industry solutions provider
in addition to our consulting with minimal risk to the existing operation.

We believe that our conduct to date evidences significant, bona fide business
operations and a scenario that is wholly inapposite to any attempt to create the
mere appearance of a specific business plan and effort to avoid the application
of Rule 419.

Our general business strategy is to market our services to markets primarily in
mining friendly regions of the United States of America. Our strategically
located business development efforts are well positioned to benefit from the
continuing need for our services.  We recognize that current market conditions
are extremely challenging.  Accordingly, we have adapted our business plan and
strategy with the goal of protecting liquidity, enhancing our balance sheet and
positioning our Company for future growth when market conditions improve.  In
connection with this strategy, we have adopted a conservative approach and our
principal business strategy is to utilize our sales expertise to:

. sell consulting services throughout selected regions of the United States,
  Canada, and Chile;

. provide consistently reliable high-quality service;

. aggressively manage operating costs to maintain and improve operating margins;

. expand business by improving, enhancing and expanding sales, gaining new
  customers;

. pursue complementary “bolt on” growth opportunities having acceptable risks 
  and returns; and

. generate consistent revenue, operating margins, earnings and cash flows.
