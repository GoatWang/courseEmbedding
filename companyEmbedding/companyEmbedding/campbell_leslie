The Primerica Business Opportunity



		*Not available in all states/provinces
	









			About Leslie Yoshiko Campbell
		
I joined Primerica in 2008 after hearing about a business opportunity from a Primerica Representative. At that time in my life, I was working as an Admin Assistant and was searching for a way to increase my income.  Primerica allowed me to be my own boss, work as many or as little hours as I chose and enjoy an unlimited income potential*  all while helping families become debt free and financially independent.  For me, the Primerica Opportunity was a dream come true. Today, my organization continues to grow and Im on my way to fulfilling my goals and dreams. Primerica has changed my life! Please contact me for more information on the Primerica Opportunity and how you can receive a free, personalized Primerica Financial Needs Analysis.

Benefits of working with Primerica

Helping people change their lives
Educating families about how money works
Building a business of my own
Creating a lasting legacy for my family


Skills developed through Primerica

How to manage my own finances
How to build a business
How to motivate people to succeed



			* Your earnings are dependent on your own efforts and abilities. Actual earnings also depend upon the organization size that you build, the number of sales and override commissions you earn and the efforts of your downlines.
