New ecological knowledge and practices for society and sustainabilityProduct Type: Journal ArticleYear: 2007Author(s): Nichols, E., J. Baron, R. Dirzo, J. Sarukhan, A. Persic, S. AricoSuggested Citation: Nichols, E., J. Baron, R. Dirzo, J. Sarukhan, A. Persic, S. Arico. 2007. New ecological knowledge and practices for society and sustainability. Frontiers in Ecology and Environment. 5(4): W5-W7. As attributes of the Earth's ecosystems shift in the face of human impact and sustainability of ecosystem services becomes less certain, one important tool at the disposal of the scientific community and other groups is a blueprint for understanding, evaluating, and communicating the value of ecological services. The blueprint presented here is based on: 

 (1) an examination of the ecological and societal trade-offs accompanying any given action,

 (2) revised methods of communication, and

 (3) coordination of actions at many different scales.
The Mexican National Commission for the Knowledge and Use of Biodiversity (CONABIO) is a good example of a demand-driven “bridging institution” between academia, government, and civil society, and it works to collect and convert scientific information into information for policy, management, and conservation. Intergovernmental organizations like the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) are well placed to facilitate such coordination at the international level, through their work with member states. Through collaboration with the constituencies of such organizations as the Ecological Society of America, the blueprint described below has the potential to become an important tool for assessing and managing threats to ecosystem services that are essential to life.
