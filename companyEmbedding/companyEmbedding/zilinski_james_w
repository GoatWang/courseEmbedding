James W Zielinski's Experience
Title: Staff Physician
               Company: Creekwood Chiropractic
Job Details
               At Creekwood Chiropractic the mission is simple: To provide safe, effective, lasting relief and preventive correction of back pain and neck pain for our patients. The end result is for them to regain a great quality of life as soon as possible, without drugs or surgery. With our dedication and expertise we are able to help a wide range of patients, from those with severely acute back or neck pain problems, to those who have lost hope due to chronic pain over decades, especially those who have faced a failed back surgery. Time and again, we meet with patients who have been told that surgery or living on prescription painkillers is their only option. Time and again we find out that this is not the case. Most experts will tell you that you should explore every option before resorting to invasive spinal surgery. While our treatment is not for everyone, our clinic doctors are experts at determining a patients potential for success, as well as other treatment options. When a patient does qualify for treatment, we have an immaculate track record of success and great patient satisfaction. We strongly believe that our therapy is the logical first step towards relieving back pain, and the vast majority of our patients experience substantial back pain, neck pain and sciatica relief.
