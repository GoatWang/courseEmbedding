	United Cannabis Corporation Receives Approval To Begin Manufacturing And Distribution Of Products In Jamaica

United Cannabis Corporation Receives Approval To Begin Manufacturing And Distribution Of Products In Jamaica


Prana Hemp Aromatherapy Roll-On, Capsules and Sublingual Drops Are First Products Registered With Jamaica's Ministry Of Health
DENVER, CO / ACCESSWIRE / July 11, 2017 / United Cannabis Corporation (OTCQB: CNAB) (the "Company" or "United Cannabis") today announced that Jamaica's Ministry of Health has registered its Prana P5 Hemp Bio Nutrient Capsules, Aromatherapy Roll-On and Sublingual Drops, and approved a Jamaican bilateral partner of the Company, Caribbean Research & Development Limited ("CRD"), to begin production in Jamaica.
Through CRD, the Company now has approval in a legal market to research, cultivate, manufacture, and distribute its CBD-based products in Jamaica and reciprocal countries, giving United Cannabis and CRD immediate means to revenue. The Company has begun to secure facilities, hire and train staff and establish necessary contacts. The Company expects to commence production within 90 days.
Additionally, management believes the ability to produce in Jamaica provides United Cannabis with a real competitive advantage beyond the United States; it enables the Company to access other markets. Countries that allow the purchase of hemp-based products from Jamaica currently include Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and the Company has begun pursuing strategic partners and customers in those markets.
The approval includes the hemp-derived CBD-based formulations from the Company's full cannabis-centric product lines. United Cannabis' aromatherapy roll-on collection is a holistic, solvent-less botanical transdermal oil made from ratio-specific whole plant cannabis oil, cannabis-derived terpenes, almond oil, wild arnica, lavender flowers, juniper berry, and roman chamomile. Patients have found these products effective in treating arthritis, neuropathy, acute pain, joint aches, muscle tension, muscle spasms, muscle recovery, migraines, and various skin conditions.
The Prana Sublingual Collection is another effective delivery mechanism for United Cannabis' proprietary cannabis-centric therapies. Prana Sublingual Drops are available in 5 categories, "raw" and "active" formulations, and accurately deliver 1mg doses for patients. Prana Sublingual drops are an alternative to the oral route and are particularly useful when a rapid onset of micro-dosing is desired, with better patient compliance than oral tablets.
Earnest Blackmon, Chief Executive Officer of United Cannabis, commented on the announcement, "This is the culmination of a four-year effort by the management of United Cannabis to create a relationship with a supportive government in the Caribbean in order to give patients in the area access to improved, alternative health choices, greater access to research, and to create jobs and tax revenues for the local community. To that end, we have initially budgeted over $2 million for investment in facilities and operations at CRD to help ensure a world class operation in Jamaica."
Tony Verzura, the Company's Chief Technology Officer, added, "This is a very big milestone for United Cannabis, CRD, and Jamaica! In the United States, we face many challenges in researching the cannabis plant, however, Jamaica is positioning itself to be a leader in cannabis research and seeks to be a major supplier of cannabis-based products across the world. This approval not only provides us the opportunity to begin generating revenue, but the ability to initiate research brings us a step closer to laying the foundation for clinical studies, and that is our primary, long-term objective."
About Cannabinoid Research & Development Limited
Cannabinoid Research & Development (CRD), a bilateral partner of United Cannabis, is a Jamaican-based corporation pursuing local licensing to advance the use of medical cannabis therapies through biomedical research and development for the nutraceutical industry. CRD focuses on genetic restoration, cannabinoid isolation techniques, scientific research, educational programs, and promotes domestic job opportunities. John Sayers, along with Kenyama Brown, local Jamaican directors and executives of CRD, coupled with Jamaican partners specializing in agricultural science and plant-based medicine, will help United Cannabis implement Sayer's 40 years of agricultural methodologies into localized educational curriculums, job training programs, and help with the integration of localized products.

 United Cannabis Corporation Signs Memo Of Understanding with Herbal Biotech Pathways Labs to Establish Puerto Rican Joint Venture 


Companies Will Establish Grow, Production, Research, and Distribution Facilities to Operate in and Serve the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico
DENVER, CO / ACCESSWIRE / June 13, 2017 / United Cannabis Corporation (OTCQB: CNAB) (the "Company" or "United Cannabis") today announced that it has signed a Memo Of Understanding ("MOU") with Herbal Biotech Pathways Labs ("Herbal Biotech") to form a joint venture ("NEWCO") in order to advance and support access to medical cannabis in Puerto Rico. NEWCO will be equally owned by the two companies and established according to the laws of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. 
According to the terms of the MOU, the Company will make available to NEWCO its proprietary cannabis brands, products and expertise, Prana formulations, delivery methods, software and professional network, sufficient to launch complete cannabis based business (grow, processing/manufacturing, retail and marketing for cannabis and/or hemp) for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; and Herbal Biotech will invest and/or make available capital, services and equipment to support and develop the operation pursuant to a business plan as agreed upon by both parties.
United Cannabis' Chief Executive Officer, Earnest Blackmon, commented on the announcement, "Puerto Rico represents a substantial opportunity within the cannabis market, and we have been working to establish United Cannabis as a leader in that market. Patients in Puerto Rico will not be allowed to smoke medical marijuana, but can use other delivery methods, such as oral drops, pills, topical creams and salves, and our proprietary Prana line fully complies with these requirements. Cesar's general expertise in the sector, as well as his contacts and financial resources within the Puerto Rican community, will enable us to expedite our plans to establish a comprehensive operation that will support our efforts in research, product development, production and distribution."
Cesar Cordero-Kruger, Principal at Herbal Biotech, went on to say, "We are very enthusiastic about this new partnership, which positions us in a very unique space, for the development of phyto-therapeutics products that target Puerto Rico patient's ailments in a safe and effective manner. The addition of United Cannabis' remarkable science team strengthens our ability to become a trusted provider of infused products with high therapeutic value."

UCANN History 
The Company’s Chief Executive and Chief Technical Officers have been involved with medical cannabis since it was permissible in California in 1999, turning their focus to Colorado during the infancy stage of legalizing medical cannabis in 2009. With the benefit of more than 30 years’ combined experience, United Cannabis has accumulated an extensive knowledgebase across the spectrum of the cannabis industry, including engineered facilities, security, regulatory compliance, genetics, cultivation, good manufacturing practices (GMP), proprietary extraction methods, branding, retail operations (SOP), marketing and wholesale distribution.
Once cannabis was approved for medical use in Colorado, the team began working closely with patients who were finding relief from a variety of chronic conditions and disease, in order to optimize their results. The results were extremely encouraging, as indicated by patient testimonials. With success, the patient base grew, providing more data, and in turn, evidence for the effectiveness of particular therapies. These cannabinoid sequencing protocols serve as the basis for United Cannabis’ Prana Bio Nutrient Medicinals and A.C.T. Now Programs.
Accredited with observational data from more than 15,000 patients to date, the Company’s success with Prana Bio Nutrients and A.C.T. Now Program garnered significant attention within the medical community, including Brent Reynolds Ph.D, William Yarosh Ph.D, and Dr. Barry Bialek  (listed below) who went on to join the United Cannabis Medical Advisory Board
United Cannabis remains dedicated to advancing the use of cannabinoids in medicine with a focus on the refinement of genetics for medical grade strains of CBD-rich cannabis plants. The Company is also steadfast in its mission to bring best practices to the industry across all aspects of operation, planning, products, governance and patient care.

Brent A. Reynolds, Ph.D. (Chief Medical Advisor)
Brent A. Reynolds, Ph.D., attended the University of Calgary, where he received his M.Sc. and Ph.D. in 1989 and 1994, respectively. While working on his Ph.D. thesis Reynolds co-discovered the existence of stem cells in the adult mammalian brain, a finding that overcame a century old dogma that the mature brain did not have the capacity to repair itself. After graduating, Reynolds co‑founded the first neural stem cell company, NeuroSpheres, Ltd., where he was a director and vice president of research. Here he developed a strong patent portfolio in the neural stem cell field, developing and protecting protocols related to the application of stem cell technology in brain repair. Today, these patents and technology have been licensed to numerous biotechnology companies that are testing the efficacy in over half a dozen clinical trials for diseases such as spinal cord injury, stroke, ALS and pediatric disorders.  After a brief hiatus, where Reynolds studied and practiced Traditional Chinese Medicine, he returned to industry working with StemCell Technologies in Vancouver, Canada. In 2004, Reynolds returned to academic science as a professor at the Queensland Brain Institute at the University of Queensland in Australia where he continued refining the application of neural stem cells for repairing the damaged brain.  In 2008, Reynolds was recruited to the department of Neurosurgery at the University of Florida and has focused his efforts on studying aggressive pediatric and adult brain cancer and developing novel translational approaches to combat this lethal disease. Working with a multidisciplinary group of scientists, the team is taking the unique approach that cancer can be managed as a chronic disease by applying the principles that have been used in ecology to manage wildlife and pest populations. Based on the lessons learned over the past 80 years by ecologists, the team is focused on using multimodal low toxicity therapeutics to enforce a stable tumor population that exists below a threshold that has any harmful effects.  Dr. Reynolds has more than 60 publications, including papers in Science, Cell and Nature, with several manuscripts receiving over 1,000 citations. In addition, he is an inventor on 18 granted US patents.  Dr. Reynolds is currently a professor in the department of neurosurgery at UF; adjunct professor at the University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia; an honorary professor at the Queensland Brain Institute, Australia; and program director for StepAhead, Australia. NIH, NHMRC and numerous foundations have funded his lab.
Barry Bialek MD. (Medical Advisor)

He received his MD, Doctor of Medicine from George Washington University in 1985, and did his residency in family and community medicine at Wellesley Hospital, University of Toronto. Dr. Bialek did his fellowship in Obstetrics Mt. Sinai Hospital, University of Toronto. He was a lecturer from 93’ – 96’, Division of Emergency Medicine Department of Family & Community Medicine, University of Toronto School of Medicine. He later went on from 1999 – 2007 as the Clinical Assistant Professor, Department of Family Medicine, at the University of Arizona.

His appreciation for the toll of continuous combat operations on service members and concern over the limitations and dangers of current pain management medications led to his interest in medical marijuana. General Scott now resides in Tampa, Florida, where he serves on the board of eight non-profit organizations dedicated to supporting veteran issues, preserving WWII vessels, and community development initiatives.

INDUSTRIAL HEMP/June 22, 2017/148 views /CNABIn a recent interview Earnest Blackmon the CEO of United Cannabis Corp (OTCMKTS:CNAB)OTCMKTSOTCMKTS:CNABUnited Cannabis CorpUnited Cannabis Corp (OTCMKTS:CNAB) United Cannabis Corp (OTCMKTS:CNAB) Products Aiding Patientsshare on:FacebookTwitterIn a recent interview, Earnest Blackmon, the CEO of United Cannabis Corp (OTCMKTS:CNAB) highlighted on the company’s Prana Bio Medicinals programs. It is the company’s only known type of cannabis treatments.  The CEO used the opportunity to elaborate on the benefits that the medical cannabis had on its patients. He also talked about the company’s program to advance the development of verified medicinal products
United Cannabis has come with a distinct line of Cannabinoids which are accessed through licensed dispensaries. The company has designed the A.C.T. Now plan to encourage its patients to use CBD products for therapeutic purposes.  These have been designed to assist in eliminating the gap between patients’ need for effective treatment of a variety of medical conditions and offering official legalization of cannabis. This comes at a moment when the industry is filled a lot of uncertainty among doctors concerning the use of cannabis.
The company’s Prana Bio products follow a patent-pending infusion course that use selected lipids, some combination of terpenes plus fatty acids. All these products are packed and sold in day regimens of 10-30-60. These capsules are produced with a wide range of cannabis based terpenes plus some quantities of THC and CBD.
When a patient is admitted for the A.C.T and which is offered at as an extra service with Prana Bio Medicinal offers, they are allocated a nurse who evaluates the patient’s current drugs then comes up with a personalized treatment program. From there, the patients will depend on a HIPPA-based cloud-based software to track their treatment progress, make follow-ups and do fine-tuning with particular doctors.
Bothe the company’s CEO and Chief Technology Officer Tony Verzura have been very active and instrumental in the development of the field of medicinal cannabis since 1999. In 2009, they directed their focus and resources to Colorado after the state legalized the use of medical cannabis. The team boasts of nearly 30 years of experience in the marijuana industry including cultivation, security, engineered facilities, genetics, manufacturing, regulatory compliance, branding, retail operations and extraction.  Since 2009, the company has collected a lot of observational data from over 15,000 people who use medical cannabis under Prana Bio and A.C.T. programs.

TESTIMONIALS
Patients that have already acted and improved their lives with us








“It improved my appetite and my ability to sleep.[…] Once I started taking Prana it’s started to coming around, I started feeling better and sleeping better.[…] My opinion is that was the Prana that cured me or put me in remission […] That’s why I think more and more what Prana is doing for me is put me in remission and keeping me there, and at the very least, it’s helping with the chemo.”

“When we gave him the drops, William had this calm exterior all of the sudden.  The drops were helping him more than anything else he had.”
