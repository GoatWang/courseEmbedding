Investment  Approach











REITs at a Glance
A real estate investment trust, or REIT, is a company with the ability to pool the money of many investors and create a diversified, professionally-managed portfolio of commercial real estate assets. REITs are legally required to pay 90 percent of taxable income as dividends and, therefore, have the potential to provide attractive streams of income.  The United States Congress created REITs in 1960 to make investments in large scale, income producing real estate accessible to smaller investors. Investors in a professionally managed REIT may benefit from greater diversification through a portfolio of properties, rather than a single building and the benefits from an experienced real estate investment team.
How Non-Traded REITs Work

Potential Benefits of Investing in Commercial Real Estate through Non-Traded REITs
Given the historic uncertainty of the financial markets, we believe adding an investment in commercial real estate to a traditional investment portfolio may provide investors with a number of potential benefits including:

Capital preservation
Reduced portfolio volatility
Increase portfolio diversification
Provide an alternative source of cash flow1
Lower portfolio risk through reducing the correlation across major asset classes
Help hedge against potential inflation

An investment in commercial real estate through non-traded REITs does not guarantee that the benefits described above will be realized. We set the offering price of our shares arbitrarily. This price is unrelated to the net book value of our assets or to our expected operating income. If we raise substantially less than the maximum offering, we may not be able to acquire a diverse portfolio of investments and the value of your shares may vary more widely with the performance of specific assets. Investing in non-traded REITs includes various risks including but not limited to unfavorable market conditions, loss of principal and limited liquidity. 1) There is no guarantee of distributions. Distributions have been paid and may continue to be paid from sources other than cash flow from operations, including offering proceeds, borrowings or sales of assets and distributions may exceed earnings.

Distributions have been paid and may continue to be paid from sources other than cash flow from operations, including offering proceeds, borrowings or sales of assets and distributions may exceed earnings. Fees paid to the advisor and sub-advisor were not determined on an arm’s length basis and reduce the amount the program can invest in income-producing assets and your overall return may be reduced. If we make investments with attractive yields, there is no guarantee that it will result in distributions. As with any real estate investment, there are various risks including but not limited to: unfavorable market conditions, loss of principal and limited liquidity.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 1. "Financial Statements" of this report. References to "we," "us" or "our" refer to NorthStar/RXR New York Metro Real Estate, Inc. and its subsidiaries unless the context specifically requires otherwise. Introduction We were formed to acquire a high-quality commercial real estate, or CRE portfolio, concentrated in the New York metropolitan area and, in particular New York City, with a focus on office, mixed-use properties and a lesser emphasis on multifamily properties. We intend to complement this strategy by originating and acquiring: (i) CRE debt including, subordinate loans and participations in such loans and preferred equity interests; and (ii) joint ventures and partnership interests in CRE related investments. We were formed on March 21, 2014 as a Maryland corporation and intend to make an election to qualify as a real estate investment trust or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Internal Revenue Code, commencing with our taxable year ending December 31, 2016. We are externally managed by NSAM J-NS/RXR Ltd, or our Advisor, a subsidiary of our co-sponsor NorthStar Asset Management Group Inc.

                                         NSAM's sponsored companies that raise capital through the retail market, as well as any future sponsored companies, including funds, joint ventures and partnerships both in the United States and internationally, collectively the NSAM Managed Companies. As of September 30, 2016, NSAM has an aggregate of $39.3 billion of assets under management, adjusted for commitments to acquire or sell certain investments by NSAM and NSAM Managed Companies. We are sub-advised by RXR NTR Sub-Advisor LLC, or our Sub-Advisor, a Delaware limited liability company and a subsidiary of our co-sponsor, RXR Realty LLC, or RXR. RXR is a leading real estate owner, manager and developer in the New York metropolitan area. As of September 30, 2016, RXR's operating platform managed 90 commercial real estate properties and investments comprising approximately 25.1 million square feet with an aggregate gross asset value of approximately $15.0 billion. In addition, RXR has a residential development pipeline of approximately 3,200 units. We, our Advisor and our Sub-Advisor, entered into a sub-advisory agreement delegating certain investment responsibilities of our Advisor to our Sub-Advisor. NSAM and RXR are collectively referred to as our Co-Sponsors. Our dealer manager for the Offering is an affiliate of our Advisor and a subsidiary of NSAM. In June 2016, NSAM announced that it entered into a definitive merger agreement with NorthStar Realty and Colony Capital, Inc., or Colony, providing for the combination of NSAM, NorthStar Realty and Colony into a wholly-owned subsidiary of NSAM, as the surviving publicly-traded company for the combined organization that, upon and following the effective time of the mergers, will be named Colony NorthStar, Inc., or Colony NorthStar. As a result of the mergers, Colony NorthStar will be an internally-managed equity REIT, with a diversified real estate and investment management platform. In addition, following the mergers, our Advisor and NorthStar Securities, LLC, or our Dealer Manager, will be subsidiaries of Colony NorthStar. This transaction is expected to close in January 2017, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals, and approval by the NSAM's, NorthStar Realty's and Colony's respective shareholders. There is no guarantee this transaction will close on the contemplated terms or within the anticipated timeframe, or at all. We do not expect that this transaction will have a material impact on our operations. Our primary investment types will be as follows: Commercial Real Estate Equity - Our CRE equity investments will primarily be high-quality commercial real estate concentrated in the New York metropolitan area with a focus on office and mixed use properties and a lesser emphasis on multifamily properties. These investments may include direct and indirect ownership in real estate and real estate assets that may or may not be structurally senior to a third-party partner's equity.   Commercial Real Estate Debt - Our CRE debt investments may include subordinate loans and participations in such loans and preferred equity interests.   Commercial Real Estate Securities - Our CRE securities investments may include commercial mortgage backed securities, or CMBS backed by real estate in the New York metropolitan area and may include collateralized debt obligation, or CDO notes and other securities.  We believe that our targeted investment types are complementary to each other due to their overlapping sources of investment opportunities, common reliance on real estate fundamentals and ability to apply similar portfolio management and servicing skills to maximize value and to protect shareholder capital. On March 28, 2014, as part of our formation, we issued 16,667 shares of common stock to NorthStar Realty and 5,556 shares of common stock to a subsidiary of RXR for $0.2 million, all of which were subsequently renamed Class A shares. On February 9,  Table of Contents  2015, our registration statement on Form S-11 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC was declared effective to offer a minimum of $2,000,000 and a maximum of $2,000,000,000 in shares of common stock in a continuous, public offering, of which up to $1,800,000,000 was offered pursuant to our Primary Offering at a purchase price of $10.1111 per Class A Share and $9.5538 per Class T Share and up to $200,000,000 pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, or our DRP, at a purchase price of $9.81 per Class A Share and $9.27 per Class T Share.   Number of Principal Amount / Investment Type: Properties Cost(1) % of Total Real estate equity Operating real estate Class-A Office Building(2) 1 $ 4,893,243 100.0 % __________________________________________________________  (2) Represents our proportionate share of the gross cost of the underlying real estate for our investment in unconsolidated venture.  Commercial Real Estate Equity   Number of Number of Property Type Portfolios Properties Amount(1) % of Total Capacity Primary Locations Class-A Office  (2) Represents our proportionate share of the gross cost of the underlying real estate for our investment in unconsolidated venture.  Commercial Real Estate Debt  Table of Contents  Sources of Operating Revenues and Cash Flows We will generate revenue from rental income and interest income. Rental and escalation income will be generated from our operating real estate for the leasing of space to various tenants. The leases will be for fixed terms of varying length and generally provide for annual rentals and expense reimbursements to be paid in monthly installments. Rental income from leases will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective leases. Interest income will be generated from our CRE debt and securities investments. Additionally, we will report our proportionate interest of revenues and expenses from CRE investments which we may own through unconsolidated ventures.  Table of Contents  In terms of square footage, the size of Manhattan's office market is larger than the next five U.S. office markets combined. Furthermore, we believe the three main submarkets within Manhattan (Midtown, Midtown South and Downtown) are dynamic and may operate independently. In Midtown, there are at least 12 previously built Class A office buildings that already are, or in the next five years will become more than 75% vacant due to relocations west and south. Companies such as Time Warner, Conde Nast, L'Oreal and KKR are relinquishing contiguous blocks of space in prestigious buildings throughout Midtown's more traditional submarkets and decamping to new product. Large blocks of previously constructed space in Midtown South and Downtown have been backfilled by Midtown tenants. Tenants that have relocated Downtown now typically pay rent in the $40 to $60 PSF range as opposed to $70 to $90 PSF in Midtown. Class A asking rents in Downtown Manhattan have increased 34.8% in the past three years, but remain 24.7% below the Midtown average per Newmark Grubb Knight Frank.  Table of Contents  Brooklyn, Long Island and Westchester. Brooklyn, New York's most populous borough with 2.7 million residents, has seen a migration of renters along transportation corridors, raising average rents by 2.2% year-over-year. Long Island is faced with an aging supply of multifamily homes with 78% of all inventory constructed prior to 1990. Further, rental residential demand continues to increase as the aging population and millennials, comprising 40% of the Long Island's population, search for new housing options. Westchester also suffers from a limited supply of rental apartments, as the percentage of renter-occupied housing units is 38%, among the lowest in the metropolitan area. Non-traded REIT capital raising was down year over year by 20% in 2014 (with approximately $16 billion in equity raised) and 2015 sales were down 36% year over year compared to 2014. Despite this declining industry trend, our co-sponsor was able to gain market share with its non-traded REITs during this time, having a 7% market share in 2014 increasing to 13% in 2015. In April of 2016, the retail industry experienced the implementation of FINRA 15-02 related to disclosure on broker-dealer account statements and the final ruling of the U.S. Department of Labor's "fiduciary" standard for retirement accounts. Although the final fiduciary rule was more favorable to both sponsors and broker-dealers in the retail industry than initial proposals, the impact of both of these events has been a sharp decline in capital raising in the retail market as evidenced by the overall non-traded REIT capital raising being down 55% year over year as of the end of the third quarter, according to Robert A. Stranger & Co. Inc. Our co-sponsor has seen sales and its market share decline in 2016 as a result. However, we anticipate the market improving as it adapts to these changes and we expect our capital raising to gain momentum in the near term. Our co-sponsor believes this opportunity will be enhanced once the merger of our co-sponsor with NorthStar Realty and Colony has closed.

NEW YORK, June 1, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- NorthStar/RXR New York Metro Real Estate, Inc. (NorthStar/RXR) announced today that it made its initial investment by acquiring an indirect minority interest in 1285 Avenue of the Americas, a commercial office building in midtown Manhattan, for a purchase price of approximately $1.9 million. The acquisition was part of an approximately $1.65 billion transaction sourced by RXR Realty, LLC (RXR Realty), NorthStar/RXR's co-sponsor and affiliate of its sub-advisor. NorthStar/RXR completed the acquisition through a limited partnership structure. 








Property highlights include:

1.8 million square foot, 39-story, Class-A office building with approximately 25,000 square feet of retail space and 84,000 below-grade square footage 
Currently 99% leased to high quality tenants, including operating as the North American headquarters for UBS AG (UBS), and the global headquarters for both BBDO Worldwide, Inc. (a division of Omnicom Group) and law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP 
Centrally located in Manhattan's Sixth Avenue and Rockefeller Center corridor, a leading office submarket comprised of approximately 45 million square feet of office space 
Offers underground access to Rockefeller Center concourse and close proximity to multiple public transit lines
Highlights of RXR Realty Value-Add Strategy:

UBS, one of the world's largest wealth managers, agreed to a long-term lease extension, securing their occupancy in approximately 890,000 square feet of space through June 2032. RXR Realty had been working with UBS on the extension since December 2015, when RXR Realty agreed to purchase the property. 
RXR Realty plans to upgrade the building's lobby, modernize the elevator mechanical systems and make improvements to the plaza.
"This was a very large, complex agreement and with the close of the $1.65 billion acquisition, RXR Realty has completed one of the largest office building transactions in New York City so far this year," remarked Scott Rechler, Chairman and CEO of RXR Realty and Co-Chairman of NorthStar/RXR. "We were able to ensure that one of the city's most prestigious buildings will remain the home to some of the city's most noteworthy companies for decades to come." 
Daniel R. Gilbert, Co-Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of NorthStar/RXR commented, "We are pleased to announce our initial investment in a prominent property like 1285 Avenue of the Americas. This acquisition is representative of our sub-advisor's ability to identify and execute high-quality, value-add investments in the New York metropolitan area and the lease extension of UBS reflects their ability to realize value in challenging circumstances. As NorthStar/RXR's portfolio develops, we are confident that we may capitalize on similar compelling opportunities that are consistent with our investment strategy."
NorthStar/RXR is structured as a public, non-traded company that intends to qualify as a real estate investment trust (REIT) and is co-sponsored by NorthStar Asset Management Group Inc. and RXR Realty. NorthStar/RXR was formed to create a balanced portfolio of high-quality commercial real estate and value-add investment opportunities in the New York metropolitan area.
This Press Release contains certain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements are generally identifiable by use of forward-looking terminology such as "will" "expects," "intends," or other similar words or expressions.

Variations of assumptions and results may be material. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from NorthStar/RXR's expectations include, but are not limited to, NorthStar/RXR's ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, the ability of NorthStar/RXR to transfer and/or sell its interest in the property, if desired, the ability of NorthStar/RXR to achieve its targeted returns, the ability of RXR and its affiliates to successfully manage the property, changes in economic conditions generally and the real estate and debt markets specifically, the impact of local economics, the ability to successfully implement an exit strategy, availability of investment opportunities, availability of capital, generally accepted accounting principles, policies and rules applicable to REITs and the factors described in Part I, Item 1A of NorthStar/RXR's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 and in its other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive.

Staying out of the money pit: Avoiding a bad homeBuying a home is always a bit of gamble, even with new homes. The largest gamble is a pre-owned home. You need to be careful to not get stuck with a money pit. Here are 5 simple ways to avoid getting stuck with a giant money pit:The layout and size - Look closely at how the house is designed and how your family will use it. If you might need to put on an addition, it’s going to cost you. Also, think about how your family might change in the next 20 years.Neighbors - Look closely at how the neighborhood fits with your needs. If the neighborhood is an uncomfortable place, you might find yourself moving much sooner than you had planned.Condition - When you look at the home, you need to think about more than just what shows up on the home inspection. Calculate the costs of repainting, new molding, and nearly everything else. It can cost you thousands just to fix the house up the way you want.Resale potential - Think ahead to how much this home might be worth when you go to sell. You might not want to think about getting rid of the house that you just bought, but it’s likely that you will at some point, so plan ahead.Shopping and arts - The proximity to shopping and arts can be a great indication of the neighborhood and the home’s long-term value. Closer is always better and will increase the value of the house.

 My first visit to Delaware County was over 25 years ago...and it was love at first sight!  Working as a top marketing executive in New York, I found the Beauty and Seclusion of this area a welcome relief to my hectic and demanding schedule of Manhattan, 
          
          and almost immediately set up "roots" in the lovely and quaint hamlet of Bovina. 

          After 25 years of traveling back and forth, I decided to switch my full time residency to my Home here in the Catskills. In 2000, I acquired my NY State Real 
            
            Estate License and have since achieved measurable success by combining my "corporate" talents of: 
          
          outstanding service, detailed follow thru and a high level of commitment. 

But...let's move on from my qualifications to why you are looking at an Upstate New York Real 
            
            Estate website!  Believe me, I get it...in fact, I live it! You want to wake up in the 
          
          morning and hear the birds chirping (not a taxi honking)...sip your morning coffee on your porch or 
          
          deck (not wait on line at Starbucks)...look out to our magnificent Catskill 
            
            Mountains (not up to skyscrapers)...and discover the startling Pristine 
              
              Water that our area has (thanks to the Watershed). 

          This is a much-needed place to flex your stress-weary bones. Play Tennis, a round of Golf, hit the Ski Slopes at Plattekill and Belleayre Mountains, go Horseback Riding,  try Fishing, 
          
          buy a Snowmobile or ATV...hey, just breathe some fresh air! Enjoy all the amazing activities that we have here in the Country...including our Farmer Markets, Great Restaurants, Galleries, Theater, and Summer Concerts at 
            
            Belleayre.

See what some of my sellers and buyers have to say about me…  

        " We listed our house with Carol Spinelli, just as the market was softening.  Fortunately, for us, Carol did a few things that led to it being sold quickly.  Today, both we and the buyers are pleased with the deal and have, in fact, become friends.  This doesn't always happen with a real estate transaction!" 
www.yelp.com 

        "When we were looking for our home in the Catskills, we found Carol Spinelli.  She is passionate about the community and her enthusiasm is infectious.  When we found the house, we closed in a record 3 weeks.  Carol moved at our pace and made it happen!" 
www.yellowpages.com 

        "We want to highly recommend Carol Spinelli for the selling of our Roxbury home.  From her first communication to the closing, we were elated how every detail was handled.  Carol constantly stayed in touch via emails and the transaction was as seamless.  Owning our house for 26 years was filled with happiness. Because of Carol, the selling of our home did not tarnish our memories!" 
www.superpages.com 

        "We had been searching for a second home, when we connected with Carol.  She spent a lot of time, before we met, to have a clear picture of our needs.  Her thoroughness was quite refreshing!  After our purchase, Carol continued to be a tremendous community resource.  We were lucky to have Carol as our agent and would recommend her – in fact we already have several times!"

 After my first visit to the Catskills over 13 year ago, I knew this was a special place. I fell in love with the clear streams, the stunning vistas, the fresh air, the verdant mountain foliage and the peaceful, unhurried pace. I came up here one summer and purchased my first home. After 10 years of being a week-end home owner I made the switch from “part timer” to “full timer”. Having traveled to over 40 countries, I am always happy to come home to Andes and the beauty that is the Catskills. 
With more than 20 years’ experience in Sales & Customer Relations with a prestigious international airline, I bring a wealth of knowledge in understanding peoples needs, desires and motivations. Having bought, sold and renovated numerous properties over the years, I bring a personal, practical knowledge of real estate dealings. My attention to detail, patient easy going but energetic nature, and a sincere desire to help people make me the agent of choice. Whether you are selling or buying a home I would love to talk to you.

I first visited the Schoharie / Delaware County areas of the Catskills almost twenty years ago when my brother relocated to the area. I grew to love the landscape and the setting of the upstate region. After several visits I made the decision to relocate my family from Long Island to pursue a dream for a better quality of life. That was over 14 years ago and the Catskills became home to my children and me. We continue to enjoy the serenity and beauty as well as the lifestyle the community offers. 
To live in the Catskills is to know a tranquil way of life, away from the hustle-and-bustle of living in an urban or even suburban community. The Real Estate business eventually became my career choice. I have been told my strengths as a Real Estate Agent are my integrity and honesty as well as putting people at ease. I enjoy meeting new people and the excitement of helping them find the property that suits their needs. 
It is satisfying to be able to match people to the property they desire, and I will go the extra mile or two to accommodate anyone whether they are buying or selling. I have over eight years of experience in residential, commercial and land sales. 
If you have property you wish to sell or you are looking for the property you've thought countless times about owning, I look forward to hearing from you.

riends introduced me to the Catskills in the early 90's. As my visits became more frequent I was won over by the effortless charm of the villages, the amazing landscapes and the genuine inhabitants. 
Having worked for over 20 years as a design director for fashion apparel companies, I decided to expand those talents to designing and building my own home. In 2004 I purchased land in Bovina; worked with local excavators, contractors, engineers and landscapers and as a result became even more entranced with the area and the people. The process and results were so rewarding that I decided to change my life, live full time in the Catskills and become a Real Estate professional.
 
Bringing the joy of life in the Catskills to others is a truly rewarding experience. Using my accumulated professional skills I can bring you a high level of service, integrity, area and market savvy as well as a constant enthusiasm. If your dreams include the Catskills as mine did let my experience help you find your ideal property, home or the perfect buyer for your home or land. I look forward to helping in any way that I can, please call me at: (607) 746-7400 ext. 15 
 
Client & Customer Comments:
"We feel very fortunate to have worked with Alex on buying our home away from home. He only showed us properties that met our criteria and price range. He was knowledgeable and organized when he showed us each one. He was very patient and never rushed us or gave us time limits. During the purchase process he was VERY responsive and if he didn't know the answer to something he looked it up and got back to us right away. Alex's enthusiasm and knowledge of the Catskills was inspiring and a helpful resource to us as we begin

My husband Bob and I moved up to the Stamford area more than 32 years ago. We both grew up in Nassau County on the North Shore of Long Island and found it too hectic even by the mid-70’s. We visited friends in the area and were instantly “sold” by the serenity and beauty of the area, and even more so by the value and quality of the home we were able to purchase. 
We feel privileged to have raised our two sons in such a pristine, farming community. I still believe this quality of life and value holds true today, in an area just a few hours from Manhattan. 
Even though my degree is in Early Childhood Education, for the past 23 years I have been in real estate and love listing and selling. I have a passion for the decorative arts, local history and vintage homes - I truly love my job! 
I am very proud of my achievements over the recent years, as you will see when you stop in to see me! I’d be happy to show you around our area and assist you with your real estate needs. ploesel@timberlandproperties.net

          "I would like to compliment you on your professional attitude and demeanor today. You are obviously a very knowledgeable agent, and I appreciate your time and effort helping me to find just the right piece of land. I look forward to hearing from you, and working with you on this project. I will most definitely recommend your office, and you in particular, to any and all my friends and contacts looking forProperty in your Area. It is so nice and away from the norm anymore to work with someone so pleasant and helpful. Knowledgeable and pleasant, not pushy and rude.

          "You have been a delight to work with! Viewing so many different Homes and having patience with us during one of the most exciting times of our lives. Thank you for helping us focus on the important aspects of buying a Home and leading us down all the right paths. I will definitely tell anyone I know to give you a call before looking for a home and will use your services the next time we need to sell or buy." -Alicia H., Jefferson, NY
        
          "As a first-time homebuyer in a volatile market, I was terribly nervous about the process. Jill Ogden was there to help every step of the way. Jill took the time to find out what was truly important to us in a Property and guided us towards gems every time. Throughout all of our negotiations and all the way through closing, Jill went far above and beyond to make sure that I understood the process and was able to navigate it smoothly. 
        
          "Even after the deal was sealed, Jill stayed in touch and made sure we knew about all of the great things our new neighborhood has to offer. I cannot say enough about the patience, helpfulness, quality of the service, and attention to detail that she offered us. We now own a Beautiful piece of the Catskills that is all that we wanted and more. When I look out over my Property, I can't help but think that things couldn't possibly have gone so well for me without the help of Jill Ogden. Finding our way to her office was the best thing that could have happened to us." Dan K., Brooklyn, NY 
        
          "I am VERY excited, and so glad we picked you to sell our home...to be honest with you, we had other Realtors up here, but they just seemed like they wanted to make a quick buck, and that's it. You are very sincere, and we think you truly care about our best interests, not just how much you will make, and we appreciate that." Eileen S., Delhi, NY
        
          "We would like to give special mention to our outstanding experience with Jill Ogden, RSPS, Realtor. Jill worked countless hours to help find a Second Home. Throughout the process, she was knowledgeable, personable, and determined to find our Dream Home. Jill worked diligently to find a match for our idea of a second home, bringing a personal experience that one would describe as exceptional one-to-one customer service. Jill solidified our desires to own a second home in Upstate New York. She dedicated a generous amount of time in helping us familiarize ourselves with the area. This, in turn, reinforced our desire to own aSecond Home that generations of our family will enjoy. She is beyond doubt an asset to your company and the community." - Javier & Brenda R., Crystal Beach, FL
        
          "Thank you. These past 7-8 months of working with other realtors has been like pulling teeth to get any information or follow-up. Seriously, your conscientiousness is unique in your field." Jamie R., Rochester, NY 
        
          "I just want to thank you, you are a true pro. I intend to buy in the near future, and must say no one I dealt with today goes as far as you to put all your listings out there. I know it's your living, but I see you go the extra mile to get the info out there, so when I'm ready to buy I will call you." Anthony P., Brooklyn, NY 
        
          "…thanks to you and a little kick from Fate, we've got the keys to our New Homewhich we are absolutely happy with! I must say we wouldn't have had such a fulfilling experience finding a house if it weren't for you. You certainly kept your promise to work diligently to "get us into property we dream of." I would like to thank you for all your guidance, patience and countless hours you spent with us during the showings. You've always been truthful, knowledgeable and to the point when answering our zillion questions in person and on the phone. I wish you all the best and hope to work with you in the future again!" Nissim A., Brooklyn, NY         
          "Charlie and I want to thank you for that and for looking out for us; getting us the best deal we could get. We are very appreciative of all your help, your staging expertise, etc., we could not have done this without you.

    The “how and why” we came to build in Cooperstown began when my parents uprooted our family of 7 children from Long Island, NY and moved us here when I was 5 years old. The subsequent 13 summers spent on, in and around Otsego Lake formed in me an idealistic view of “the perfect place to live”. 
    
    Successfully founding and growing a NJ based manufacturing business in 1980 taught me the importance of production methodology, which would be instrumental later in my real estate career. After selling the business in 1998, it was time for us to share our love of the Cooperstown area and the lake with our children. 
    
    A fruitless search for the ideal home led to the purchase of a spectacular home site on Otsego Lake; where we designed and built our own custom handcrafted log home. 
    
    Shortly thereafter, the acquisition of perhaps the last commercially developable lakefront property on Otsego allowed me to undertake building the region’s first, luxury lakefront enclave, ArrowHead Pointe. 
    
    The process of designing, engineering and over-seeing the construction, and ultimately the on-going management, of a complex development such as AHP provides me a valuable perspective and set of qualifications that I am delighted to share with sellers and buyers of real estate in the Cooperstown region. 
    
    As the manager and marketer of a number of luxury vacation properties Liz and I own, I have numerous resources and information which I make available to buyers who are considering the purchase or construction of an income producing property. 
    
With in-depth, insider knowledge of the local real estate market acquired during 30 years, I am uniquely qualified and eager to help you in your own real estate pursuits.

Growing up in Trout Town USA (Roscoe NY) I developed an appreciation for the area's fish and wildlife, the flowing waters and natural lakes, the clean air and skies as clear as can ever be imagined. In fact early in life I thought this was all normal…only one word explains it. Jaded. 
Pursuing a higher education, working and traveling throughout the country, ultimately marrying and starting a family, I have come full circle. I now live and operate the small farm that has been in my family since 1847 focused on sustainable rotational grazing to produce healthy grass-fed animals while sequestering carbon in deep fertile soil. Here I raise my family, surrounded by the purest air and water in New York State, all within easy driving distance to the greatest city in the world. Through strong family roots, all that is the Catskills runs through my veins. I fully embrace the fact, fiction, and folklore of the region and am proud to call this home. 
As a dedicated professional with knowledge in local history, agriculture, recreation, flora and fauna, united with knowledge in custom home building and remodeling, I can help guide you to your most ideal real estate situation. 
Whether buying or selling for the first or fifth time, I will bring a fun, enjoyable, educational and most importantly professional experience to your next real estate transaction. 
If you have made it this far, I would be pleased to guide you the rest of the way to making this truly magnificent region your home too.
