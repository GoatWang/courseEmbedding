      SAFE & SOUND® STAR RATINGS™
    TIAA-CREF TRUST COMPANY FSBSt. Louis, Missouri 63102STAR RATING: 4
          G
        
    Predictive Indicator
    neutral
    As of
    
        March 31,
      2016
    Federal Reserve System Identifier 2716547HOLDING COMPANY INFORMATION(Based on data from the previous quarter.)This bank is not owned by a holding company.INTRODUCTIONU.S. commercial banks are chartered under either federal or state jurisdiction for the purposes of accepting funds for deposit and extending loans to either individual or business borrowers. Banks are subject to credit, interest rate, and operational risk, and, because of both their public purpose and their importance to the nation’s economy, banks become the object of intense regulatory scrutiny.U.S. thrift institutions are chartered under either federal or state jurisdiction for the primary purpose of  utilizing deposited funds to issue loans secured by real estate.  Currently, real estate-backed loans account for approximately 42% of total thrift industry assets, and one-to-four family residential mortgages comprise nearly 59% of the industry’s real estate loan portfolio. Thrift institutions are subject to credit, interest rate, and operational risk, and, during the last twenty years, thrifts have made great strides toward reducing historic mismatches between asset and liability maturities.
        The Bankrate proprietary commercial bank rating model analyzes capitalization,
        asset quality, earnings, and liquidity and produces composite and component
        "Star" ratings that can be used as a measure of the rated entity's financial
        safety and soundness. Additionally, early warning components of the model
        highlight operating characteristics of immediate concern and recommended
        follow-up actions. "The analyses are not adjusted for TARP funding and those
        institutions receiving funds may receive ratings that would differ were the
        TARP funds adjusted out of the analyses. You can check whether or not this
        institution has received TARP funding and whether or not they have paid it
        back at http://projects.propublica.org/bailout/list/index."

            For this bank we have noted:
          Net Interest MarginOverheadAsset GrowthBrokered DepositsPurchased LiabilitiesInstitution CommentaryOVERVIEW of InstitutionTIAA-CREF TRUST COMPANY FSB, which, as of
        
            March 31,
          2016,
        reported $3.664 billion in total assets.
        At that date, loans and deposits held by the bank amounted to
        $2.8744 billion and $2.6742 billion,
        respectively. The bank's
        
            March 31,
          2016
        equity base of $476.479 million produced an Equity/Assets ratio of
        13.00%, as of that date.
      COMPOSITE SUMMARY
        Bankrate believes that, as of
        
            March 31,
          2016,
        this bank exhibited a sound condition, characterized by
        substantially lower than normal overall, sustainable profitability,
        a very high measure of asset quality,
        very strong capitalization and
        lower than normal liquidity.
      EARNINGS ANALYSIS
        For the twelve months ended
        
            March 31,
          2016,
        the bank recorded a net loss
        of $-25,987 thousand. The bank experienced a return on average assets (ROA) of
        -0.81% over the latest four quarters. Year earlier
        twelve month results amounted to a a net loss
        of $-39,791 thousand, or a
        -1.69%
        ROA over the most recent four quarters at that time. An ROA of at least 1.0% is deemed satisfactory in accordance with banking
        industry standards, and the industry's annualized ROA for the twelve months
        of 2016 was approximately 0.95% for commercial banks
        and 1.25% for thrift institutions.
      
        We have concluded that for the four quarters ending
        
            March 31,
          2016,
        the bank achieved substantially below average
        return on equity
          , and, as noted,
          sustained an actual loss for that period
        .
        We deem net interest margin to have been substantially below average, and the reported percentage should cause inquiry into balance sheet composition, asset yields, and liability costs.
        Noninterest income was solid.
        We also observed overhead ratios that were significantly higher than average, and the composition of overhead should be thoroughly analyzed.
        Importantly, net interest margins, noninterest income components, and overhead expense levels
        represent operating factors that combine to impact overall operating results.
        ASSET QUALITY ANALYSIS
        The bank revealed, as previously stated, a very high measure of
        asset quality. Our conclusion with respect to asset quality incorporates our analysis
        of data depicting regional economic conditions as well as our computations of
        a relatively low
            March 31,
          2016 nonperforming asset ratio,
        much better than normal
        reserve coverage for nonperforming loans; and
        apparently acceptable quality, or no greater than average,
        holdings of commercial real estate and construction loans, two categories
        that can intensify credit risk.
        
          Other asset categories, such as farm and consumer loans, which may carry
          more than usual default potential, should not have a substantial negative impact
          upon future results.
        Loan yield can measure financial reward versus credit risk. Excessive loan yield may be an
        indicator of existing or future problems. Our loan review indicates that the bank has assumed a
        seemingly prudent position between credit risk and financial reward.
        
          Likewise, for banking institutions, substantially higher than normal asset growth can be
          deemed speculative and can lead to financial deterioration. This bank exhibits such
          growth which, if unrelated to merger activity, should be subject to further inquiry.
        CAPITAL ANALYSIS
        For the one year period ended
        
            March 31,
          2016, the bank reported
        a strong rate of growth in equity capital.
        Balance sheet structural changes, through the one year period of time ended
        
            March 31,
          2016, have
        somewhat improved
        the bank's capital position. Our analytical methodology does take into account the quantity,
        quality, and durability of net worth, and, as set forth above, we have determined, based upon
        our series of tests, that the bank demonstrates
        very strong
        capitalization. We have calculated the bank's
        
            March 31,
          2016
        Total Risk-Based Capital position, a computation used by industry regulators, and have concluded
        that this bank substantially exceeded
        the requirement, set by regulation, for this test.
        LIQUIDITY ANALYSIS
        As of
        
            March 31,
          2016, the bank displayed
        Below Normal
        balance sheet liquidity and a
        Greater Than Average Dependence
        upon wholesale, or non-core liabilities, which include all borrowings, such as Federal Home
        Loan Bank Advances, and CD's greater than $250,000.
        
          We do note a substantial dependence upon brokered deposits, another component of
          wholesale liabilities.
        
          Accordingly, an inquiry into funds acquisition strategies should be undertaken.
        
        Accounting principles require some securities to be categorized as "Available-for-Sale."
        Changes in market value of these securities are reflected through the GAAP (Generally
        Accepted Accounting Principles) net worth of the institution. Based upon the bank's
        present balance sheet, changes in the value of the current level of securities reported
        as "Available-for-Sale"
        are almost certain to have a substantial impact
        upon future net worth of the bank.
      INSTITUTION SUMMARY
        This bank has been rated
        sound.
      
          Negative factors that impacted that rating follow:EarningsLiquidity
          Positive factors that impacted that rating follow:Asset QualityCapitalization
          As noted previously, early warning indicators, possibly requiring specific
          investigation include:
        Net Interest MarginOverheadAsset GrowthBrokered DepositsPurchased LiabilitiesPREDICTIVE INDICATOR
        As stated, we have determined a composite Star rating for this bank of
        
            4
            
            G
          
        , indicative of a
        sound
        financial condition. At times, financial conditions of banks change rapidly and significantly.
        Hence, our Safe & Sound Star ratings should not be deemed predictive of likely future ratings.
        However, in view of early warning indicators set forth within this report, in combination with
        the institution's financial data, we believe that the Star rating for this institution is
        
            unlikely to change
          
        within the ensuing twelve month period.
      



Rating is for the quarter ending 03-31-2016; amended filings not reflected
