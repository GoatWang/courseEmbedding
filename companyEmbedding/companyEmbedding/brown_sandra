From acclaimed best-selling author Sandra Brown, Tough Customer is a heart-pounding tale about obsession and murder. 
Colleagues, friends, and lovers know Dodge Hanley as a tough talking, chain smoking investigator. He is a a private investigator who doesn't let rules get in his way, not in his private life or his professional life. If he breaks a heart, or bends the law in order to catch a criminal, he does so without hesitation or apology. He receives a late night phone call from the love of his life, Caroline King. Dodge hasn’t seen Caroline in 30 years. But she continues to haunt his dreams. She asks Dodge for help when a deranged stalker attempts to murder their daughter, Berry. 
Dodge has never even met Berry, but he immediately returns to Texas. Berry has become the object of desire of a co-worker, a madman and genius with a penchant for puzzles and games. He has spent the past year making Berry's life hell, and he has vowed to kill her. Dodge joins forces with local deputy sheriff Ski Nyland. Ski is an Afghanistan war veteran and the local investigator on the case. Ski is immediately attracted to Berry and he will do anything to keep her safe, but is still suspicious of her story. The alarming situation goes from bad to worse when the stalker begins to claim other victims and leaves a trail of clues as he works his way toward Berry. 
Sensing Berry’s killer getting closer, Dodge realizes that this time, he is in for the fight of his life to save his daughter. But does Berry hold secrets that may have provoked her stalker who’s turned killer?

Brown, Sandra, Mean Streak





Default Title - $8.00










Dr. Emory Charbonneau, a pediatrician and marathon runner, disappears on a mountain road in North Carolina. By the time her husband Jeff, miffed over a recent argument, reports her missing, the trail has grown cold. Literally. Fog and ice encapsulate the mountainous wilderness and paralyze the search for her.
While police suspect Jeff of "instant divorce," Emory, suffering from an unexplained head injury, regains consciousness and finds herself the captive of a man whose violent past is so dark that he won't even tell her his name. She's determined to escape him, and willing to take any risks necessary to survive.

Rainwater Q&A

A Conversation with Sandra Brown, Author of Rainwater1. What was your inspiration for this novel? A vivid memory of my father’s childhood occurred when he was about eight years old.  His father, my grandfather, had a showdown with armed federal agents who arrived at his dairy farm demanding that he pour out milk he couldn’t sell because of an over-supplied market.  My grandfather refused to waste good milk when so many families in the area were going...

Family Traditions


Let The Countdown Begin!


Being Web 2.0 is Hard Work




May 10, 2010
              Mother's Day approaches, andthis year is significant to me for two momentousreasons. The first is personal, the second, professional.I learned a few weeks ago that my daughter, Rachel, is pregnant with her third child. This was totallyunexpected and, actually, just short of a miracle. After conceivingher first child with no trouble at all, she and her husband worked for four years to conceiveagain. Eventually, they resorted to in vitro fertilization to get sonnumber two. Now, three years later, without any assistance frommodern medical science, God and Mother Nature did their thing, and so this Mother's Day finds me celebrating the imminent...

              Why do I hear Hank Williams Jr in my head? The one Christmas tradition we have in my family is that the traditions keep being altered. When I was a kid, we always packed up and drove 250 miles to my grandparents house, where I got to see my number one favorite cousin. Santa Claus always -- miraculously -- found my sisters and me there. One smart cookie was Santa. He worked around our not being at our house. Flash forward a decade or two and my grandparents are no longer with us. MY parents were the grandparents, and we spent every Christmas Day at their house with my four sisters and their family. A horde of about 30 people. Loud, noisy, lots of food...

November 16, 2009
              I don't count down the days to Christmas. Instead, I count down the days to Thanksgiving, because it's one of maybe a dozen days a year when I cook. Kind of like with writing, if you don't cook habitually, you don't acquire good cooking skills. Hence, the countdown. Not with anticipation, but with anxiety. Give me a chapter that needs work any day over preparing a meal. I don't even attempt baking a turkey. A baster looks like something that belongs in a doctor's office, and an examination you dread. As for stuffing a cavity. . . No thank you. If I tried deep frying the bird Cajun-style, which is delicious, I'd catch the house on fire. So,...

              A year or so ago when my assistant, Amie, who’s the Internet guru of the office, came to me and said, “We need to talk about your blog,” I thought she was referring to a figure flaw. “I agree,” said I. “Something must be done. Soon.” Long story short, I’m now providing blog entries. But not very faithfully, I’ll admit. Amie persistently says, “You need to update several blogs. What’s happening in your life? Do you have anything for Facebook?” See that’s the thing. Rarely is anything happening that I think my readers would be interested in knowing about....
