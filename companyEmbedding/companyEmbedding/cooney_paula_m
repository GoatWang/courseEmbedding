Boeing's shares were upgraded by RBC, Credit Suisse, BofA Merrill Lynch, and Goldman Sachs. This was based on our analysis of Boeing historical results that showed it generates its best margins when revenue is weighted towards planes that have been in production for many years, and margins have typically come under pressure when it introduces new models, as we expected with the 737 MAX and, eventually, 777X. While nearly all of the ramp on the MAX is yet to come, Boeing’s smooth transition to the MAX so far shows that this is nothing like the prior derivative programs (737 Classic to 737NG and 747-400 to 747-8) that drove significant operating issues for Boeing in the past.5Reactions.

And he’s got a massive empire to go with that title. His empire encompasses not just e-commerce, but also news organizations, robotics companies and coupon sites. Oh, and ever heard of Google, Airbnb or Uber? Bezos is an investor in those companies, too. On Thursday, Bezos’s net worth hit $90.7 billion, propelling him past Bill Gates to become the richest person in the world, according to the billionaire rankings done by Forbes and Bloomberg. On his way to that title, Bezos has made a number of investments and acquisitions.
