Ruby Tuesday Chair Sells Stock, Resigns - Restaurant Industry Insight and Analysis - October 2013

Restaurant Finance Across America / October 2013 / Ruby Tuesday Chair Sells Stock, Resigns 



 
 Ruby Tuesday Chair Sells Stock, Resigns By Jonathan Maze

Published: 2013.10.28 10:14 AM





	File the following information under "Ominous Signs for Ruby Tuesday:"

	The chain's chairman, Matthew Drapkin, unloaded 1.45 million shares in Ruby Tuesday on Friday. On Sunday he resigned, and was replaced by the company's CEO, JJ Buettgen.

	Ruby Tuesday noted the change in a terse, three-sentence SEC filing this morning. It noted that the chairman change was effective "immediately."

	What's more, Drapkin barely profited from the sale. In 2011, Drapkin along with Steven Becker and their Dallas-based investment firm, Becker Drapkin Management, bought up 883,000 shares, paying $8.3 million. Drapkin amassed more shares as a director and then chairman, and sold most of those shares on Friday for $5.90 to $5.95 a share, or around $8.6 million.

	Drapkin had quickly taken a major role in the company after he and Becker paired with Carlson Capital in 2011 to form an activist investor group. Ruby Tuesday, under founder Sandy Beall, quickly gave the group two seats on its board rather than face a proxy fight. Carlson Capital and Becker Drapkin then split their group.

	Beall ultimately retired. Buettgen replaced him as CEO late last year, and Drapkin was elevated to the chairmanship.

	But results have been hard to come by this year amid a tough environment for casual dining concepts—an environment so tough that even a one-time bright spot like BJ's Restaurants has suffered sales declines. Ruby Tuesday's primary competitors, Chili's and Applebee's, have been marketing heavily and investing in their stores. Price competition has been intense. And Ruby Tuesday has shifted its product strategy from Beall's failed upscaling idea back to its lower-cost, burger-centric roots.

	The chain's struggles were punctuated by a same-store sales decline of 11.4 percent in its most recent quarter and predictions that comparable store sales will be down in the "high single digits" this year as the chain adjusts. 

	Remember: Ruby Tuesday had been flirting with bankruptcy before a surprisingly good quarter in 2009 led to a surge in its stock price that enabled the company to use a secondary offering to pay down some debt.

	Now, Ruby Tuesday is sinking again. And its chairman just sold stock and abandoned ship.

INVESTOR INSIGHT:INVESTOR INSIGHT: Matthew Drapkin At the same time they’re doing this, they’re significantly upgrading the user experience. XO bought a company called Two Bright Lights, for example, which aggregates real wedding photos and tags them with information not only on the photographers who took them, but also on all the vendors that are showcased in them. That’s an example of updating the site to modern standards, which hadn’t really been done. How do you see all this translating to dollars and cents. MD: The overhaul of the websites, product offerings and technology platforms has been expensive. From 2013 to 2015, operating expenses increased at nearly four times the rate at which revenue grew. Now the vast majority of the investment spending is behind them just as revenue growth is starting to accelerate. Assuming only modest success on the transaction side, our base-case model assumes 11% annual revenue growth over the next two to three years, which because of the incremental profitability on that revenue would result in EBITDA nearly doubling by 2018, to around $60 million. We can come up with credible scenarios that result in much higher growth than that. What upside do you see in the shares, trading recently at just over $18? EW: Given the quality of the business and its prospects for growing at extremely high incremental margins, we believe that an EV/EBITDA multiple of 10-12x is easily warranted. Using 10x on our estimates for 2017, that would result in a share price of nearly $26. We think that’s conservative – if EBITDA is growing 30% per year, the stock is unlikely to trade at only 10x EBITDA. MD: With respect to downside protection, we like that the company currently has $90 million in cash on the balance sheet, almost 20% of the market cap. In the normal course of business we expect that cash to nearly double in three years, to $175 million. That would give them plenty of flexibility to continue to pursue accretive acquisitions and/or to judiciously buy back stock. As the business scales, we also see XO as a very attractive acquisition target for Yelp, Priceline, GrubHub or a host of other bigger Internet companies. There are almost no small-cap independent Internet media companies left – they all get bought, especially those that have dominant positions in attractive markets. And the buyout multiples tend to be quite big. News Corp. paid 23x EV/EBITDA for Move, Inc., the same multiple Priceline paid for OpenTable. HomeAway was acquired by Expedia for 25x. Applying these types of multiples to XO, the stock is worth $40- 45 per share. Is there a threat one of those bigger players decides to build rather than buy its way into XO’s market? MD: XO’s CEO comes from Google and tells a funny story when people raise that type of question. He says in all his time at Google he heard the founders talk at Your Guide Through Perilous Seas Subscribe now and receive a full year of Value Investor Insight – including weekly e-mail bonus content and access to all back issues – for only $349.

If anybody wants to be in the space, the smart move would be to buy the market leader. From Internet media to refrigerants, explain your investment case for Hudson Technologies [HDSN]. EW: The company’s two main businesses are reselling virgin gases that are used in commercial and residential air-conditioning systems, and also reclaiming, recycling and then reselling those same reusable gases. Today the virgin-gas business makes up about 75% of total revenues, with the reclamation piece making up most of the rest. While it’s a small player in virgin gas, it has a roughly 28% share of the recycling market. The crux of the thesis revolves around the Montreal Protocol-required phase-out by the end of 2019 of R-22, the dominant refrigerant gas in use today. It can still be used, but the huge installed base will have to rely on the recycled version rather than virgin. Given that air-conditioning units have 15- to 20-year useful lives, there’s a good long tail on the demand for aftermarket R-22. As a result, we expect a dramatic increase in the demand for Hudson’s reclaimed gas. That’s just math: while R-22 usage will slowly decline as people upgrade their units, the remaining base will need supply to replace the virgin gas being phased out, which has already largely happened. That will produce a highly favorable mix shift for the company away from virgin-gas sales and into reclaimed gas, where they earn more than twice the gross margin. MD: A big added kicker is that in the new supply/demand environment the price of R-22 will likely continue to increase. Five years ago it was selling for $4 a pound, but as the Environmental Protection Agency has been communicating over the years about the phase-out, prices have risen and are now at all-time highs in the INVESTMENT SNAPSHOT Hudson Technologies (Nasdaq: HDSN) Business: Provider of refrigerants and related maintenance and reclamation services to the commercial air-conditioning, industrial-processing and refrigeration markets. Share Information (@7/28/16): Price 4.88 52-Week Range 2.45 – 5.63 Dividend Yield 0.0% Market Cap $166.3 million Financials (TTM): Revenue $85.8 million Operating Profit Margin 11.6% Net Profit Margin 6.8% HDSN PRICE HISTORY 6 5 4 3 2 1 3 2 1 $14-15 range. The benefit of higher prices should flow pretty much straight through to the company’s bottom line. There is some risk producers of virgin R-22 in the near term get more aggressive to clear out inventory, which could put downward pressure on prices, but they have shown no inclination to do so and before long will be ceding price-setting control to companies like Hudson. The bigger risk is that prices go up too far too fast and incent people to replace their units that use R-22 faster than they would have otherwise. We continue to watch prices closely, but think the odds are very Valuation Metrics (@7/28/16): HDSN S&P 500 P/E (TTM) 28.7 24.9 Forward P/E (Est.) 11.9 18.4 Largest Institutional Owners (@3/31/16): Company % Owned William Blair Inv Mgmt 9.8% Heartland Adv 7.6% Northern Right Capital 5.6% Perritt Capital 5.2% Royce & Assoc 4.2% Short Interest (as of 7/15/16): Shares Short/Float 2.0% 2014 2015 2016 THE BOTTOM LINE The mandated phase-out of the virgin form of the primary product the company sells should result in a dramatic increase in the sales price and sales volume of the recycled version of the same product it also sells, at much higher margins, says Eric Ward. On his 2017 estimates, the shares even after a big recent pop trade at less than 2x EV/EBITDA. Sources: Company reports, other publicly available information 20 6 5 15 4 103 5 1 much in favor of steady price increases as scarcity builds. You haven’t mentioned the news two weeks ago that Hudson had been awarded a big contract with the Department of Defense, which caused the stock to pop 33%. EW: Yes, it’s a five-year contract with a five-year renewal option to supply refrigerants, compressed gases, cylinders and related items to military installations. It’s not something we were counting on, but adds another leg to the thesis. The company also received some favorable news 2 Cl July 29, 2016 www.valueinvestorinsight.com Value Investor Insight 13Page 1 and 2: ValueInvestor July 29, 2016 The LeaPage 3 and 4: INVESTOR INVESTOR INSIGHT: INSIGHT:Page 5 and 6: INVESTOR INSIGHT: Metropolis CapitaPage 7 and 8: INVESTOR INSIGHT: Metropolis CapitaPage 9 and 10: INVESTOR INSIGHT: Matthew Drapkin IPage 11: INVESTOR INSIGHT: Matthew Drapkin WPage 15 and 16: INVESTOR INSIGHT: Matthew Drapkin OPage 17 and 18: INVESTOR INSIGHT: Michael Dzialo InPage 19 and 20: INVESTOR INSIGHT: Michael Dzialo woPage 21 and 22: INVESTOR INSIGHT: Michael Dzialo bePage 23 and 24: Tuned In UNCOVERING VALUE: Scripps
