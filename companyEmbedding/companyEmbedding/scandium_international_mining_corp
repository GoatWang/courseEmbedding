News

 Jun 29, 2016 Nyngan Scandium Project  Confirming Process Test Results Received Reno, Nevada, June 29, 2016 -- Scandium International Mining Corp.  (TSX:SCY) ("Scandium International" or the "Company") is pleased to announce the results of a confirmatory  metallurgical test work report from Altrius Engineering Services (AES) of Brisbane, QLD, Australia. The test work results directly relate a list of recommended programs included in the recently released NI 43-101 Definitive Feasibility Study ("DFS"), authored by Lycopodium (Brisbane, QLD, Australia) and filed on SEDAR.  AES devised and supervised these test work programs at the SGS laboratory in Perth, Australia and at the Nagrom laboratory in Brisbane, Australia.

In addition to recent test work results, the Company also reports that the Nyngan Project environmental impact statement ("EIS") has completed its public exhibition and comment period.

Metallurgical Test Work Results

The project DFS recommended a number of process flowsheet test work programs be investigated prior to commencing detailed engineering and construction.  Those study areas included pressure leach ("HPAL"), counter-current decant circuits ("CCD"), solvent extraction ("SX"), and oxalate precipitation, with specific work steps suggested in each area.  This latest test work program addresses all of these recommended areas, and the results confirm recoveries and efficiencies that either meet or exceed the parameters used in the DFS.

HIGHLIGHTS

Pressure leach test work achieved 88% recoveries, from larger volume tests,
Settling characteristics of leach discharge slurry show substantial improvement,
Residue neutralization work meets or exceeds all environmental requirements as presented in the DFS and the environmental impact statement ("EIS"),
Solvent extraction circuit optimization tests generated improved performance, exceeding 99% recovery in single pass systems, and
Product finish circuits produced 99.8% scandium oxide, completing the recovery process from Nyngan ore to finished scandia product.
Test Work Specifics.  A series of 15 (20 litre) HPAL tests were conducted at SGS in Perth between February and April 2016.   The results of these tests augmented earlier leach performance data, and also provided leach solution for downstream tests, where additional optimization data was also sought.  The feed-stream source of scandium in each case was Nyngan limonite resource, graded at approximately the head grade assumed in the DFS.

Flowsheet test results were positive in all cases.

HPAL recoveries exceeded 88% in the majority of options tested (vs 87% in the DFS),
Settling characteristics on HPAL discharge slurry were substantially improved, with the use of different chemical additions, and
At the solvent extraction stage, test work produced superior loading performance, with recovery in this step exceeding 99%.
Further work was conducted on residue chemistry as well.  The process for residue neutralization, as proposed in the DFS was fully tested, and environmental requirements for tailings disposal at the project site were met.

The process flowsheet for producing final scandium product has also been confirmed by additional test work using the solutions produced at SGS.  These solutions were delivered to Nagrom Laboratories in Brisbane, where we have set up a mini solvent extraction (SX) pilot plant to test process variants, to produce loaded strip liquor, and to produce product-grade scandium oxide. The results of this work produced 99.8% scandium oxide, again confirming the process applied in the DFS is capable of generating high purity scandia product in a very simple, single stage operation---this time directly from Nyngan laterite resource.  Scandium oxide grades of 99.8% exceed the requirements of the aluminum industry for use in aluminum alloys.

Other Project Updates

Second Town Hall Meeting Held.  The Company held a second town hall meeting in Nyngan on May 23, 2016, to brief the community on project plans and impacts.  The meeting was announced in the local Nyngan Observer newspaper, and attended by local members of the community, the town Council, and the Mayor.  Discussion was encouraged and issues raised were general in nature.

Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) Status. As previously reported (May 2, 2016), the EIS has been completed and submitted to the NSW Department of Planning and Environment.  The EIS was accepted by the Department after an adequacy review, and the Company met with Department staff on May 25th, for detailed discussions on details of the document and development plans.  After this formal departmental review meeting, the EIS was subsequently placed on public exhibition on May 26th, for access by the public and other NSW governmental agencies, for a period of 30 days.

The exhibition period was completed on Friday, June 24th.  The filing received relatively few comments, none that represent an issue with development, and will now be followed by further internal reviews and discussions between the Company and various governmental agencies.

The final outcome sought from this formal environmental and developmental review is the granting of a Ministerial Development Consent, and subsequently a Mining Lease for project development, anticipated as early as year-end 2016.

George Putnam, CEO of Scandium International Mining Corp. commented:

"These latest metallurgical test work results further confirm a number of key parameters used in the DFS, and they formally complete an important check-list item prior to the start of detailed engineering on the project.  The product specification achievement of 99.8% scandia from Nyngan resource is particularly important.  It validates our earlier product quality work, confirms a single pass SX system can deliver product to this standard, and fully supports our planned product offering to the aluminum alloy industry.  This formally and empirically completes the Nyngan resource-to-product cycle for us.

We view the efficient and positive EIS public exhibition experience our project received as a very positive indicator of both regulatory and community support.  This helps us progress without delay towards a mining lease, and keeps us on our tight timetable to begin construction early next year."

QUALIFIED PERSONS AND NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT

Willem Duyvesteyn, MSc, AIME, CIM, a Director and CTO of the Company, is a qualified person for the purposes of NI 43-101 and has reviewed and approved the technical content of this press release on behalf of the Company.

ABOUT SCANDIUM INTERNATIONAL MINING CORP.

The Company is focused on developing the Nyngan Scandium Project into the world's first scandium-only producing mine.  The Company owns an 80% interest in both the Nyngan Scandium Project, and the adjacent Honeybugle Scandium Property, in New South Wales, Australia, and is manager of both projects.  Our joint venture partner, Scandium Investments LLC, owns the remaining 20% in both projects, along with an option to convert those direct project interests into SCY common shares, based on market values, prior to construction.

The Company filed a NI 43-101 technical report in May 2016, titled "Feasibility Study -- Nyngan Scandium Project".  That feasibility study delivered an expanded scandium resource, a first reserve figure, and an estimated 33.1% IRR on the project, supported by extensive metallurgical test work and an independent, 10-year global marketing outlook for scandium demand.

In addition to the two lateritic scandium properties in Australia, SCY owns a 100% interest in the Tørdal Scandium/REE property in southern Norway, where we continue our exploration efforts, specifically for scandium and REE minerals.

Scandium International Mining Corp. - Nyngan Scandium Project - Fri Jul 28, 2017



































TSX:SCY
Last $0.310
+ more info













Nyngan Scandium Project




Location:
New South Wales (NSW), Australia


Ownership:
80% Scandium International Mining Corp.







Project Highlights:

World's first scandium-only mine development project
2,925 hectare property approximately 500 km NW of Sydney, Australia
Australia is a mining-friendly, politically and economically stable jurisdiction
NI 43-101 measured and indicated scandium resource
Excellent local infrastructure with nearby water, rail, power and workforce
Easy access: 3 km from all-weather sealed road, 25 km from local town
Production targeted for 2017 at approximately 38,000 kg per year of scandium oxide (scandia) (Sc2O3) 1 
Single product resource significantly reduces the cost of scandium extraction


Definitive feasibility study completed in May 2016
Flow-sheet design is complete, based on proven conventional technology and extensive independent test work
Initial offtake agreement in place
Environmental Impact Statement filed May 2016
All required governmental approvals are expected to be completed in late 2016



1. Subject to financing. See Cautionary Notes -- Loan Details.
The Nyngan scandium resource is located in NSW, Australia approximately 500 kilometers northwest of Sydney. Minerals exploration at the site has defined a measured and indicated resource significantly larger (7X) than the currently planned 20 year mine life outlined in the feasibility study.
Surface mining at the site is anticipated to be done by conventional truck and shovel method. The resource is a typical tertiary laterite, composed of limonites and saprolites. The top 15 metres is alluvial material, and the next 50 metres is the limonite-saprolite host for scandium. The resource indicates a very low strip ratio, and it is expected that the plant will be satisfied by a partial-year mining schedule during the dry summer season (contractor campaign mining).
The processing and refining plant design flow sheet was modeled and validated from METSIM modeling and considerable bench scalp/pilot scale metallurgical test work utilizing Nyngan resource material. The scandium recovery and beneficiation process uses a conventional flow sheet, employing high pressure acid leach (HPAL) and solvent extraction (SX) techniques.

Definitive Feasibility Study
During May 2016 the Company issued a National Instrument NI  43-101 Technical Report entitled "Feasibility Study - Nyngan Scandium Project".  The feasibility study was independently prepared; Lycopodium Limited led the feasibility study team from their Brisbane, Australia office.
FEASIBILITY STUDY HIGHLIGHTS:

Capital cost estimate for the Project is US$87.1 million,
Operating cost estimate for the Project is US$557/kg scandium oxide,
Oxide product volume averages 37,690 kg per year, over 20 years,
Project Constant Dollar NPV10% is US$177 million, (NPV8% is US$225 million),
Project Constant Dollar IRR is 33.1%,
Oxide product grades of 98-99.9%, as based on customer requirements,
Project resource increases by 40% to 16.9 million tonnes, grading 235ppm Sc, at a 100ppm cut-off in the measured and indicated categories, and
Project Reserve totalling 1.43 million tonnes, grading 409ppm Sc was established on part of the resource.

The feasibility study confirms the commercial viability of both the resource and the process for recovering scandium, as configured, for the Nyngan Project.  The Nyngan resource has now been expanded by 40% compared to the prior estimate, a 20 year project mineable grade has been defined through a detailed mine plan, and the processing facility has been configured and is supported by detailed flowsheet test work.  Based on the results of the feasibility study, the technical team led by Lycopodium has recommended that the Project owners seek project financing and proceed to construction.  
The feasibility study concludes that the Project has the potential to produce an average of 37,690 kilograms of scandium oxide (scandia) per year, at grades of 98.0%-99.9%, generating an after tax cumulative cash flow over a 20 year Project life of US$629 million, with an NPV10% of US$177 million. The average process plant feed grade over the 20 year Project life is 409ppm of scandium.
The financial results of the feasibility study are based on a conventional flow sheet, employing continuous high pressure acid leach (HPAL) and solvent extraction (SX) techniques.  The flow sheet was modeled and validated from METSIM modeling and considerable bench scale/pilot scale metallurgical test work utilising Nyngan resource material.  A number of the key elements of this flowsheet work have been protected by the Company under US Patent Applications. 
The feasibility study has been developed and compiled to an accuracy level of +15%/-5%, by a globally recognized engineering firm that has considerable expertise in laterite deposits and process facilities, as well as in smaller mining and processing projects, and has excellent familiarity with the Project location and environment.

What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Scandium International Mining Corp. - Scandium - Overview - Fri Jul 28, 2017



































TSX:SCY
Last $0.310
+ more info













Scandium


Scandium is a soft, silvery metallic element. Its atomic number is 21, making it the lightest of the transition metals. Scandium is not particularly rare - its occurrence in crustal rocks is 22 around ppm.  This makes scandium generally more abundant than lead, mercury, and precious metals. Despite this fairly common occurrence, scandium rarely concentrates in nature.  It does not selectively combine with the common ore-forming anions, so time and geologic forces only rarely form scandium concentrations over 100 ppm. There is currently no dedicated single mine source and it estimated that only 15 tonnes of scandium are produced globally each year.  

Scandium exists in nature in its oxide form.  It is very difficult to reduce to its pure elemental state. In fact, it was not isolated in pure form until 1937 and the first pound of pure elemental scandium metal was not produced until 1960.  Scandium in oxide form is referred to as scandia or scandium oxide, and the chemical formula is Sc2O3.  Processed scandium oxide, a white powder, is stable at ambient temperature and is the standard scandium form for commerce.
Despite scandium’s scarcity and high cost, interest in the metal is high and multiple high value commercial uses have been developed.  Of particular interest is the alloy of scandium into aluminum metal products.  When used in combination with other common aluminum alloys scandium can produce stronger, more corrosion resistant, heat tolerant, weldable aluminum products.  Aluminum products are being increasingly incorporated into transportation applications (aircraft and automobile) in order to meet fuel efficiency requirements.   

Aircraft manufacturers are particularly interested in scandium alloyed aluminum materials. Aircraft designers believe use of Al-Sc alloys can reduce aircraft weights by 15%-20%.  In addition, the ability to employ weldable structures promises similar cost reduction potential. 
Scandium also exhibits exceptional electrical conductivity and heat stabilization qualities and the largest volume current use is in solid oxide fuel cells (“SOFCs”).  Incorporation of scandium in SOFCs enables a lower operating temperature resulting in longer lived equipment and less costly materials of construction.  Bloom Energy is the leading SOFC manufacturer and currently single largest scandium user.


		Al-Sc alloys may reduce aircraft weights by 15%-20%
	

Numerous other applications have been identified and are under research, most notably high intensity lighting (“stadium lighting”) and high voltage power transmission and additive layer parts manufacturing (“3D Printing”).

Scandium International: The first scandium-only mine development project?

2017 marks twenty years since a junior mining company made a seemingly insignificant scandium discovery close to the city of Port Macquarie in New South Wales (“NSW”). Recent developments suggest it may also be the year that the resulting Nyngan scandium project begins production, potentially making it the world’s first primary scandium mine and Australia’s only producing scandium resource.
In November 2016 Scandium International Mining Corp. (TSX: SCY) (“SI”), 80% owner of both the Nyngan Scandium Project and the adjacent Honeybugle Scandium Property, received both Ministerial Development Consent for Nyngan from the NSW Minister of Planning, and a subsequent Government cash injection of A$629,000. The cash was earned from the Australian Government’s R&D Tax Incentive Program, designed to encourage R&D activities that benefit Australia.

    }Australia, specifically the NSW lateritic clay belt, represents a recent, game-changing discovery of scandium at grades approximately four times the grade of existing sources. These resources are surface-mineable and can deliver scandium in sufficient quantities to promote much wider use of the metal. SI believes that an assured source of scandium, offered at realistic pricing levels, will promote dramatic increases in commercial scandium demand.
Scandium has long been recognized as a valuable commodity, but economic concentrations of scandium are rare and current supply is sourced from low-grade stockpiles or as a by-product from other mineral operations. These limited supply sources have resulted in high market prices and inadequate volume for wide-scale adoption.
Despite scandium’s scarcity, over the past two decades multiple potential high-value commercial uses for the metal have been developed. Of particular interest is the addition of scandium into various aluminium alloys. It has been found that relatively small additions of scandium into aluminium alloys produces stronger, lighter, more heat and corrosion resistant and weld-friendly aluminium products. The aircraft industry depends on advanced aluminium alloys, and would incorporate Aluminium-Scandium alloys if consistent scandium supply was available. At present, it is estimated world supply is no greater than 15 tonnes. As such, Airbus, Boeing and similar large corporations simply cannot  take the risk given such short supply.  However, the mines of NSW could change this.
The Nyngan scandium resource is located approximately 500 kilometres northwest of Sydney. Minerals exploration at the site has defined a measured and indicated resource seven times larger than the currently planned twenty-year mine life outlined in their feasibility study which was completed in 2016.  The Development Consent follows an in-depth review of the Environmental Impact Study, (EIS), the project plan, community impact studies, public EIS exhibition and commentary, and economic viability. It involved more than 12 specialised governmental agencies and groups and so represents a great show of confidence in the project on behalf of the state of Australia.
According to its feasibility study, Nyngan holds a resource totalling 16.9 million tonnes, grading 235 ppm in the measured and indicated categories. The capital cost estimate for the project is US$87.1 million, with an operating cost estimate of US$557/kg scandium oxide and envisages an average of 37,690 kg of production per year over 20 years.
With only one significant Government flag-waving to go, the 2,925 hectare property in a mining-friendly, politically and economically stable jurisdiction, is really taking shape as the world’s first scandium-only mine development project. An initial offtake agreement is already in place and production for this year is expected to be the full 38,000kg.

Scandium International Mining Corp. Receives Mining Lease Grant for Nyngan Scandium Project 
InvestorIntel |
        May 05, 2017 |
        No Comments


May 5, 2017 (Source) — Scandium International Mining Corp. (TSX: SCY) (“Scandium International” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce that its subsidiary company, EMC Metals Australia, has been granted a Mining Lease for the Nyngan Scandium Project in New South Wales (“NSW”), Australia. The Mining Lease (“ML”) overlays select areas previously covered by two Exploration Licenses. The ML was granted by the Minister for Resources of the State of New South Wales on May3, 2017, and represents the final major approval required from the NSW Government to begin construction on the project.
HIGHLIGHTS:

Mining Lease grant received on Nyngan Project (ML 531), 
Represents final key project approval required from NSW Government, 
Permits development of the world’s first primary scandium mine, 
Triggers project partners’ decisions to reach Final Investment Decision (“FID”) and,
Allows SCY to actively begin mine development, subject to project funding.

Discussion:
The Mining Lease grant represents the final governmental primary approval needed to construct a mine in the State of NSW, Australia. The ML was awarded after all environmental work was completed and reviewed, all social implications of project development were considered, and the NSW Environmental Minister issued a Development Consent in November 2016. The ML grant reflects the further review that the State resource value was considered and approved for extraction based on mine development plans. The ML was offered for a period of 21 years, and is based on the development plans and intent submitted in the ML Application. The ML can be modified by NSW regulatory agencies, as requested by EMC Australia (“EMC-A”) over time, to reflect changing operating conditions.
This ML grant represents the culmination of a seven-year effort by SCY and our team of specialists, consultants and technicians, working on the Nyngan Scandium Project since 2010. That process has specifically included:

Defining a NI 43-101 scandium resource on the property,
Testing and proving a metallurgical process to economically produce significant commercial quantities of scandium oxide, and mine plans to extract scandium ore for refining to commercial grade scandium product,
Demonstrating viable economics with an independently prepared (NI 43-101) Definitive Feasibility Study,
Completing all environmental, social, developmental, and regulatory requirements specified by NSW regulators, and
Receiving final NSW Department Ministerial approvals and sign-off on this work.

SCY currently owns 80% of the Nyngan Scandium Project, through ownership of 80% of EMC Metals Australia. Our minority partner, Scandium Investments LLC (“SIL”) owns the remaining 20% of the Project, through its 20% ownership in EMC-A. The ML grant triggered an option for SIL to convert their 20% interest in EMC-A into SCY common shares, which SIL may exercise in their sole discretion until mid-June 2017. If SIL does not exercise the option and elects to retain its 20% ownership interest in EMC-A, their free-carry period for development costs will end, and the partners will be required to fund development costs on a pro-rata basis to their ownership of EMC-A.

    }George Putnam, CEO of Scandium International Mining Corp. commented:
“This Mining Lease grant is a major milestone in the Company’s development of the Nyngan Scandium Project. It signals the full support of state government, regulators, and the community for our endeavor, and is validation of the level and quality of work that has been committed to date. We couldn’t be more pleased with this show of support and encouragement from NSW regulators to move forward and build Nyngan into the world’s first primary scandium mine, and to do so in NSW, Australia”
QUALIFIED PERSONS AND NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT
Willem Duyvesteyn, MSc, AIME, CIM, a Director and CTO of the Company, is a qualified person for the purposes of NI 43-101 and has reviewed and approved the technical content of this press release on behalf of the Company.
ABOUT SCANDIUM INTERNATIONAL MINING CORP.
The Company is focused on developing the Nyngan Scandium Project into the world’s first scandium-only producing mine. The Company owns an 80% interest in both the Nyngan Scandium Project, and the adjacent Honeybugle Scandium Property, in New South Wales, Australia, and is manager of both projects. Our joint venture partner, Scandium Investments LLC, owns the remaining 20% in both projects, along with an option to convert those direct project interests into SCY common shares, based on market value, by mid-June 2017.
The Company filed a NI 43-101 technical report in May 2016, titled “Feasibility Study — Nyngan Scandium Project”. That feasibility study delivered an expanded scandium resource, a first reserve figure, and an estimated 33.1% IRR on the project, supported by extensive metallurgical test work and an independent, 10-year global marketing outlook for scandium demand.

(TSX: SCY) ("Scandium International" or the "Company") is pleased to announce it has signed a Memorandum of Understanding ("MOU") with Weston Aluminium Pty Ltd ("Weston") of Chatswood, NSW, Australia. The MOU defines a cooperative commercial alliance ("Alliance") to jointly develop the capability to manufacture aluminum-scandium master alloy ("Master Alloy"). The intended outcome of this Alliance will be to develop the capability to offer Nyngan Project aluminum alloy customers scandium in form of Al-Sc Master Alloy, should customers prefer that product form.HIGHLIGHTS:MOU outlines terms of a commercial alliance with Weston Aluminum,Represents key steps towards Master Alloy manufacturing agreement, Allows SCY to quickly apply know-how alongside operating aluminum processor,Supports a product offer more suitable to many downstream customers, thereby expanding the potential customer base, andAllows SCY to bring added value to significant potential scandium markets.The MOU outlines steps to jointly establish the manufacturing parameters, metallurgical processes, and capital requirements to convert Nyngan Project scandium product into Master Alloy, on Weston's existing production site in NSW. The MOU does not include a binding contract with commercial terms at this stage, although the intent is to pursue the necessary technical elements to arrive at a commercial contract for conversion of scandium oxide to Master Alloy, and to do so prior to first mine production from the Nyngan Project.Discussion:SCY has been developing an internal understanding and capability to convert scandium oxide to Master Alloy for some time. In 2014, the Company announced it applied for a US Patent on Master Alloy production, which is still in the application phase. That Patent Application addressed scandium Master Alloys with both aluminum-base and magnesium-base metals. The Company has investigated scandium Master Alloy manufacturing processes previously with the CSIRO, in Australia, and Kingston Process Metallurgy (KPM) in Ontario, Canada. Further, the technical team in SCY has previous relevant experience in this metallurgical area.Weston Aluminium is a privately-owned, established secondary aluminum and industrial services company with its production facilities located near Kurri Kurri in, NSW, approximately 50km from Newcastle and 400km from the Nyngan Project. Using an environmentally attractive 'non-salt' processing technology from Asahi Seiren in Japan as its core technology, Weston has further developed its application to process all forms of aluminum bearing dross and by-products from the aluminum industry, and manufacturing Aluminum Deoxidant for steel making for BlueScope Steel at Port Kembla NSW and Arrium at Whyalla SA. Weston recycles industrial aluminum scrap, and dross, principally from the Tomago Aluminum Smelter located north of Newcastle, which is an independent joint venture between Rio Tinto Alcan, CSR and Hydro Aluminum. Weston today recycles 20,000 tonnes of aluminum materials annually, and has established capability in recovering valuable metals from metallurgical process dross materials, resulting in zero land fill.The process for making scandium Master Alloy is generally known, although efficiencies vary widely in practice. While numerous entities make and sell a variety of aluminum master alloys globally, very few have established the capability or the access to scandium, to make Al-Sc Master Alloy product well.The Company believes that it can establish world-class techniques for manufacture of scandium Master Alloy, and can offer an upgraded product to aluminum alloy customers directly. This approach enables the Company to better control product quality, by consolidating the upgrade step through a trusted downstream processor. The Company will also continue to offer product in scandium oxide form, for customers who prefer or require that product form.SCY intends to contribute the majority of the intellectual property ("IP") required to define manufacturing technique and metallurgy, and will retain the IP rights to that process, recipe and know-how, as defined in the MOU.George Putnam, CEO of Scandium International Mining Corp. commented:"We are excited to team with an experienced aluminum products manufacturer to build a capability in scandium Master Alloy manufacturing. This Alliance allows SCY to apply and expand our know-how in this area immediately, while working with Weston, an innovative local operator. We believe this capability to offer scandium product as Master Alloy has the potential to broaden our customer base and deliver scandium's promise more effectively to aluminum alloy users."Read MoreQUALIFIED PERSONS AND NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORTWillem Duyvesteyn, MSc, AIME, CIM, a Director and CTO of the Company, is a qualified person for the purposes of NI 43-101 and has reviewed and approved the technical content of this press release on behalf of the Company.ABOUT SCANDIUM INTERNATIONAL MINING CORP.The Company is focused on developing the Nyngan Scandium Project into the world's first scandium-only producing mine.

Australians are such aficionados of gambling that there is an old adage that they will bet upon two flies crawling up a wall. There are two Scandium (Sc) stories of note in Australia and both are in New South Wales and both are separated by a mere 90 miles. The first is Scandium International Mining Corp. (TSX: SCY) (which we have covered before and has had a stellar run this year) and the other is Clean TeQ Holdings Limited (ASX: CLQ |OTCQX: CTEQF) which, despite its name, is a Scandium developer as a by-product from a Nickel-Cobalt project. With Cobalt as the word on everyone’s lips and Scandium the word on ours, it scores a very respectable two out of three.
Getting Informed
At the start of the Rare Earth boom, many misinformed observers referred to Scandium as a Rare Earth, this was despite it not being in the Lanthanide series at all and rarely even appearing with other REEs in mineralsiations. This was just blatant false news. Indeed Scandium is twice as prevalent in the Earth’s crust as Lead. Rarity should be made of sterner stuff.
The thing that is rare is Scandium production. What production there is (and it amounts to between 10-25 tonnes per annum and even that is a shaky statistic) comes as a by-product of refining of mainly base metals. Indeed Scandium metal is very difficult to reduce to its pure elemental state. In fact, it was not isolated in pure form until 1937 and the first pound of pure elemental scandium metal was not produced until 1960.
The potential of Scandium as an alloying element in aluminium (Al) alloys has been a long-simmering desire of many informed observers over the last two decades. Hundreds of scientific papers have been published describing various improvements in properties that can be achieved, and one text book and a string of reviews or other overview articles are written on this subject.
The use of Scandium as an alloying element in aluminium alloys was first investigated by scientists of the former Soviet Union, who developed several Sc-containing Al-alloys during the 1980’s and 1990’s.

    }Aeronautics
Much of the alloy development that took place in the USSR appears to have been intended for aerospace applications. One alloy, 1421, is used for fuselage stringers of large cargo aircrafts, and some parts of the MiG 29 military aircrafts are also made of Sc-containing Al-Li based alloys. It is also claimed that some parts of the international space station (ISS) are made from alloys with Sc.
Aircraft manufacturers have been particularly interested in scandium alloyed aluminum materials. Aircraft designers believe use of Al-Sc alloys can reduce aircraft weights by 15%-20%. In addition, the ability to employ weldable structures promises similar cost reduction potential.
The three principle effects that can be obtained by adding scandium to aluminium alloys are

grain refinement during casting or welding
precipitation hardening from Al3Sc particles
grain structure control from Al3Sc dispersoids

Addition of scandium in combination with zirconium is particularly effective (which gives us a chance to mention Alkane, which is in close proximity to both the projects in NSW).
The table below shows graphically the eight major series of Aluminium alloys. As can be noted all of them provide aluminium with a strength push when combined with Scandium in an alloy. The two that show the greatest benefits are with pire aluminium and in alloys with Aluminium and Magnesium.

A little goes a long way with Scandium in alloys. Small additions of the metal to an alloy can produce a quantum benefit in strength for a relatively low cost (in many cases the Sc added to the alloy master mixes is a fraction of a percent of the total metal). The effect though is massive in lowering the weight of the plane and thus the fuel costs of operating the plane. The stronger the aluminium the less than needs to be used.
The problem the aircraft manufacturers face in adoption of Scandium alloys en masse is not one of price or desirability it is of supply. With no primary mines and no sizeable supply there could at some point be an absolute absence of Scandium supply for either competition reasons or geopolitical considerations. Boeing going to the storage division and finding no Scandium for that day’s production would effectively shut down operations. Only with a largish, stable supply from a politically friendly jurisdiction can a wholesale adoption of Scandium in aeronautical applications be considered. For the first time since 1960, this possibility can be realistically contemplated.
Solid Oxide Fuel Cells
A solid oxide fuel cell (or SOFC) is an electrochemical conversion device that produces electricity directly from oxidizing a fuel. Fuel cells are characterized by their electrolyte material; the SOFC has a solid oxide or ceramic electrolyte. Advantages of this class of fuel cells include high efficiency, long-term stability, fuel flexibility, low emissions, and relatively low cost.
Scandium’s usefulness for SOFCs is that it exhibits exceptional electrical conductivity and heat stabilization qualities and therefore the largest volume current use for the metal is in SOFCs.
Scandium is used as the electrolyte component in the fuel cell, most commonly as scandia stabilized zirconia (ScSZ). Below can be seen a conceptualization of how these fuel cells work, with the electrolyte (containing the Scandium) being the dark grey layer.

Incorporation of scandium in SOFCs enables a lower operating temperature resulting in longer lived equipment and less costly materials of construction. Bloom Energy in the US is the leading SOFC manufacturer and currently the single largest scandium user. The fuel cells are massed into stacks to match the energy required so the potential is enormous and once again limited only by the reliable supply of Scandium rather than any lack of potential end demand.
Conclusion
Scandium is the example, par excellence, for our thesis of “Build it and they will come”. In the aeronautics industry in particular tooling up for a different mode of manufacturing or input can be a massive cost running into the hundreds of millions of dollars if not billions. It is clear that the industry wants to apply the benefits that Scandium brings but it is not going to go out on the limb and hope that the adage “Build it and they will supply us” proves to be true. As we all know that train is heading down the track fullspeed towards Tesla that has foolishly failed to secure its supply of Cobalt and Lithium for the future. The likes of Boeing and Airbus are not so naïve.
Thus when a significant supply of Scandium is guaranteed then the synergies between aeronautics and Scandium mining will come into play and the uptake of product will be potentially enormous. That in itself will trigger more realistic and workable pricing and in turn that will feed greater uptake (beyond the aeronautical industry into those with more sensitive price points, such as lighting and fuel cells). Scandium International is well positioned to do this as a primary mine and potentially Clean Teq will be able to follow with its sizeable by-product credit of Scandium from a Nickel/Cobalt production facility.
It also seems that Australia and most specifically New South Wales will be the epicentre of Scandium activity for the short term and maybe even farther into the future. This in some dusty pub in the Australian pub in the outback will find that betting on either, or both, of those flies will pay off.
Note from the assistant publisher: George Putnam, President and CEO of Scandium International will be presenting at InvestorIntel’s 6th annual Cleantech and Technology Metals Summit, and is scheduled to speak on Monday 15th from 1:50 – 2:05 PM (EST).
