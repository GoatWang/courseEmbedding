About KOHLER

The brand name KOHLER is synonymous with the world's finest plumbing products in the world. From cutting-edge designs and the industry's most notable materials to flawless functionality, KOHLER manufactures everything you need for the kitchen and bathroom, and it's all available at Faucet.com. KOHLER's history of providing customers with amazing faucets and fixtures goes back over a century. Since then, the company has combined advanced technology with an artist's eye to create perfection. Today, KOHLER offers products like kitchen faucets, kitchen sinks, kitchen accessories, bathroom sink faucets, bathroom sinks, bathroom accessories, toilets, bathtubs, everything for the tub and shower, vanities, medicine cabinets, and even bathroom lighting.KOHLER Kitchen FixturesKOHLER kitchen faucets are designed with style, simplification, and perfect functionality in mind. While the main kitchen faucet is certainly one of the fixtures it makes, it's certainly not the only one. KOHLER also provides bar faucets and pot fillers designed to help with food prep and clean up in the kitchen. KOHLER laundry faucets and utility faucets are available as well.Kitchen sinks absorb a lot of daily use, and KOHLER kitchen sinks are more than worthy to take on this task. KOHLER uses the plumbing industry's finest materials for its kitchen sinks, like cast iron, vitreous china, and stainless steel. From self-rimming to apron front sinks (also called Farmhouse sinks), KOHLER has a sink for every kitchen. And pair up a main kitchen sink with a KOHLER bar sink for an extra workspace.As you might expect, KOHLER also helps to round out the kitchen with a helpful host of kitchen accessories. Choose from deck-mounted soap dispensers to basin racks and colanders for the kitchen sink. Cutting boards and wire rinse baskets also make valuable kitchen accessories. KOHLER Bathroom FixturesThe bathroom is where KOHLER truly shines, and it starts with KOHLER bathroom sink faucets. Within its selection of single handle and double handle bathroom faucets, KOHLER has some of the best-selling fixtures in the entire plumbing industry. Choose from a number of different configurations, as well, including single-hole, widespread, the unique wall-mount faucet, and the beautiful and striking vessel bathroom faucet.Select the perfect KOHLER bathroom sink to go with your bathroom faucet. You'll not find a selection better suited for today's bathroom demands than the one KOHLER offers. Any bathroom will benefit from a KOHLER bathroom sink, whether it's a self-rimming sink (also called drop in) or undermount sink. The wall-mount sink provides a truly unique look, a pedestal sink adds a stylish look to a bathroom of any size, and a vessel sink doubles as a striking design element poised to be a focal point. KOHLER Toilets, Bathtubs, and ShowersKOHLER toilets are some of the most efficient and versatile in the entire plumbing industry. KOHLER offers toilets in every size and shape you can imagine, from round to elongated. Comfort height toilets are designed to make sitting down and standing up easier for our aging population. And when it comes to water-efficient toilets, KOHLER is at the top of the list.KOHLER bathtubs are designed for comfort—as well as getting you clean. From the relaxing soaking tub to the rejuvenating air tubs and whirlpool tubs, KOHLER bathtubs come in a number of shapes, sizes, and installation types. And they're made using the plumbing industry's most trusted materials, like, cast iron, acrylic, and vitreous china.The tub and shower is an area designed for relaxation and rejuvenation, and KOHLER has everything you might need. From Rainshower showerheads and tub and shower faucets to Roman tub faucets, KOHLER fixtures will fit seamlessly into any bathroom décor. KOHLER tub and shower faucets are also equipped with leading-edge technologies, like thermostatic valve trim with volume controls, and pressure balanced trim with diverters.Don't forget about KOHLER tub and shower accessories, either. Showerheads and hand showers offer versatility; body sprays help rejuvenate the mind, body, and spirit; grab bars aid accessibility; and KOHLER tub wastes are purely functional and round out the overall look of your tub.Shower fixtures must be in place even before you ever turn the water on. KOHLER shower receptors include the drain; KOHLER shower doors can provide an unlimited amount to the bathroom décor; and shower walls and shower modules can include a number of features like shelves, seating, and accessibility. KOHLER Bathroom AccessoriesWhat bathroom would be complete without its share of KOHLER bathroom accessories? Think of how your bathroom would function without a towel bar, towel ring, or robe hook. KOHLER also has bathroom accessories like toilet paper holders, storage shelves, and soap dishes.Medicine cabinets are one of the most important additions to a bathroom, and KOHLER gives them a look all their own. KOHLER medicine cabinets include plenty of storage for toiletries and other bathroom necessities, and choose from framed or frameless mirrors.KOHLER vanities are ideal for the smaller bathroom that needs storage, a bathroom sink, and yet is still concerned with creating a beautiful bathroom environment. KOHLER vanities are available with or without the bathroom sink, and you can even add a sink separately.Just when you thought KOHLER already had everything for the bathroom, it surprises with a gorgeous selection of bathroom lighting. These are mostly wall-mounted fixtures with one, two, and three lights. Much of KOHLER bathroom lighting is also reversible, adding further versatility.When shopping KOHLER kitchen and bathroom products, you can also do so by its popular collections. This ensures you have access to perfectly coordinated fixtures and can stretch out the theme to the kitchen and every bathroom in the home.KOHLER Popular Collections The KOHLER Devonshire collection features KOHLER's top-selling selection of bathroom faucets and fixtures. This traditional-themed family boasts fixtures for the entire bathroom, from the bathroom faucet and bathroom sink to the toilet and tub/shower elements. KOHLER's Bancroft collection is defined by classic design elements, like subtle scrolling at the base of the handles and spouts of the bathroom faucets. The bathroom sinks are produced from vitreous china, and the bathroom lighting helps to round out this very complete collection. The KOHLER Purist collection is one of the most striking contemporary-themed families. Design elements are kept to a minimum here, as bold lines and the cylindrical form help create a stunning contrast. KOHLER's Forte collection is a fun family with lots of character. The double handle bathroom faucet is one of KOHLER's most popular fixtures. This family provides everything for a smooth-running bathroom, while adding amazingly good looks.Shop KOHLER at Faucet.com for everything your home needs in the kitchen and bathroom.

Preschool toys that promote pretend play allow children to use their imaginations and creativity while developing fine motor skills. It also encourages the development of social skills and cognitive thinking. Children who engage in pretend play learn how to communicate more effectively and have the opportunity to solve problems and overcome challenges in a safe, secure environment, which boosts self-confidence.
How Can You Make Pretend Play Time More Productive?
Using realistic pretend play toys, integrating math problems, and encouraging preschoolers to invite children their own age into the pretend play scenario are all ways to make play time more beneficial. Parents and caregivers can also ask children questions and create challenges that prompt the child to use their creativity and critical thinking skills. It is also OK to simply let children interact with pretend play toys on their own to foster independence.
What Are Some Popular Pretend Play Activities?
Kid-size grocery stores, kitchens, and doctor setups, as well as Play-Doh kits and tea sets, are all great for pretend play. They allow children to develop a wide range of skills. Dolls, figurines, puppets, and fake food offer preschoolers the opportunity to have fun while using their imaginations and building communication skills. Dress-up sets, musical instruments, and science kits are other popular pretend play toys.Side Refine PanelShop by CategoryToys & HobbiesPreschool Toys & Pretend PlayBrio Preschool ToysBrio Compatible Preschool ToysPretend Play DinosaursPretend Play Dish & Tea SetsPretend Play Doctor & Nurse KitsPretend Play Dress-Up & CostumesFisher-Price Preschool ToysPretend Play KitchensLittle Tikes Preschool ToysLittlest Pet Shop ToysPlay-Doh & Modeling ClayPlaymobil Preschool ToysPlayskool Preschool ToysPretend Play PuppetsPreschool PuzzlesStep 2 Preschool Toys & Pretend PlayPretend Play Tool SetsWooden & Handcrafted Pretend Play ToysOther Preschool & Pretend Play ToysSales & EventsShop All Toys DealsShop All EventsSelling on eBaySell DirectConsign Items

    See all 16 reviews5.0 out of 5 starsBest sink I've ever had.ByKathryn Con March 12, 2016Color: White|Verified PurchaseThis is my dream sink - we've had it for a few months now, and we just love it.  Even with a huge 16" cast iron frying pan dropping into it (a couple times), it only suffered one minor chip...and the impact was with one of the sharper edges of the pan.  The idea of any chip may send off alarm bells for you, but please keep in mind that the frying pan in question put full-on dents into our prior "standard" gauge stainless sink.This is HEAVY - definitely have two people around to install it, and read instructions thoroughly to avoid any little positioning and mounting mishaps.  Once it's in - it's IN.  That sink isn't going anywhere!The size is absolutely perfect - from bottom to top, that extra couple inches of depth (compared to what most of us are used to as "standard" depth sinks) really makes a huge difference.  I can clean my larger sheet pans with no problem by laying the end in the larger side, and letting the length extend at an angle over the divider.  I do recommend using a tall sprayer-head faucet, because it's so big and deep that a "regular" fixed-head won't reach all over.  Luckily, the sheer size of the sink makes it so that the larger arched faucets don't look disproportionate (I think the smaller standard-sized stock faucets would look entirely too small with this monster!)It looks gorgeous, and the front apron is sleek and simple - perfect if what you're looking for is a classic "farmhouse" apron sink.0Comment|

The delivery was to our house though we had to carry it from our driveway since the delivery guys said they had to get to another delivery. It was very heavy but my husband and I were able to carry it together. It is very solid and is definitely one of the most complimented items in our kitchen.0Comment|

I had a slight problem with the initial delivery - the enamel was cracked, however Amazon handled the problem wonderfully.  They immediately sent a 2nd sink and arranged for pickup of the cracked sink (I had to do absolutely nothing).  The 2nd sink arrived in perfect condition and looks fantastic in my kitchen.  I highly recommend this sink.0Comment|

I love the look of it for my restored 1930s bungalow kitchen, and it love the Smart Divide feature.  It allows me to have two separate sink compartments, but still be able to wash oversized pans.22 comments|

PRODUCT DETAILS:

The Whitehaven apron-front kitchen sink features a streamlined and versatile farmhouse style to complement any decor. The Self-Trimming(R) design requires only a simple rough cut, overlapping the cabinet face for beautiful results. The sink is designed to fit in most standard 36-inch apron-front cabinetry. A low barrier divides the two compartments, making it easy to wash and rinse large items while still keeping the two basins separate. Crafted from enameled cast iron, this sink resists chipping, cracking, or burning for years of beauty and reliable performance.

Follow the instructions and it's simple to put together.  I'd recommend building it on a board, so it can be easily lifted to move or store ( otherwise it has a tendency to come apart in sections!).  Good quality and incredible detail in design.  Also works with the Playmobil extension kit.Verified purchase:  Yes | Condition: NewThis item doesn't belong on this page.CancelThanks, we'll look into this.
