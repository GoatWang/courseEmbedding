Deutsche High Income Trust (KHI) Announces Termination of Trust and Liquidating Distribution to Shareholders by November 30, 2016 and Special Meeting of Shareholders to be Held in June 2016 | Business Wire


























































Deutsche High Income Trust (KHI) Announces Termination of Trust and 
      Liquidating Distribution to Shareholders by November 30, 2016 and 
      Special Meeting of Shareholders to be Held in June 2016






February 26, 2016 05:00 PM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Deutsche High Income Trust (NYSE:KHI) (the “Fund”) announced today that 
      the Board of Trustees has approved the termination of the Fund, pursuant 
      to which KHI will make a liquidating distribution to shareholders no 
      later than November 30, 2016. The Fund also announced that a special 
      meeting of shareholders will be held on June 30, 2016 at the offices of 
      Deutsche Investment Management Americas Inc. (“DIMA”) at 345 Park 
      Avenue, New York, NY 10154. As previously disclosed, at the special 
      meeting, shareholders will consider a proposal to convert the Fund from 
      a closed-end investment company to an open-end investment company. The 
      proposal to convert the Fund from a closed-end investment company to an 
      open-end investment company is being made to satisfy a requirement of 
      the Fund’s Agreement and Declaration of Trust. After careful 
      consideration of a range of factors, and in light of the Board’s 
      approval of the Fund’s termination and liquidating distribution to 
      shareholders no later than November 30, 2016, the Board recommends that 
      shareholders vote against the proposal to convert the Fund to an 
      open-end investment. A discussion of factors considered by the Board in 
      developing this recommendation will be set forth in the proxy statement 
      to be provided to Fund shareholders. Holders of record of common shares 
      of the Fund at the close of business on April 26, 2016 will be entitled 
      to vote at the meeting and any adjournments thereof.
    

      DIMA proposed to the Fund’s Board the termination of the Fund and 
      liquidating distribution pursuant to the terms of a Standstill Agreement 
      that DIMA and the Fund entered into with Saba Capital Management L.P. 
      (“Saba”), a large shareholder in the Fund, and certain parties 
      associated with Saba. Under the terms of the Standstill Agreement, Saba 
      has agreed, among other things, to vote in accordance with the Board's 
      recommendation on various matters affecting KHI, including any proposal 
      to convert KHI to an open-end investment company. The Fund has been 
      advised that Saba will file a copy of the Standstill Agreement with the 
      Securities and Exchange Commission as an exhibit to its Schedule 13D.
    

Important Information


Deutsche High Income Trust seeks to provide the highest current 
      income obtainable, consistent with reasonable risk, with capital gains 
      secondary. Bond investments are subject to interest-rate and 
      credit risks. When interest rates rise, bond prices generally fall. 
      Credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments 
      of principal and interest. Investments in lower-quality (“junk bonds”) 
      and non-rated securities present greater risk of loss than investments 
      in higher-quality securities. Investing in derivatives entails special 
      risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns 
      and/or increase volatility. Leverage results in additional risks and can 
      magnify the effect of any gains or losses. Investing in foreign 
      securities, particularly those of emerging markets, presents certain 
      risks, such as currency fluctuations, political and economic changes, 
      and market risks.


Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously 
      offered. There is a one-time public offering and once issued, shares of 
      closed-end funds are bought and sold in the open market through a stock 
      exchange. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount to 
      the net asset value. The price of a fund’s shares is determined by a 
      number of factors, several of which are beyond the control of the fund. 
      Therefore, a fund cannot predict whether its shares will trade at, below 
      or above net asset value.


Past performance is no guarantee of future results.


This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a 
      solicitation to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in 
      any state or jurisdiction in which such offer or solicitation or sale 
      would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the laws 
      of such state or jurisdiction.

Consensus Ratings for Deutsche High Income Trust (NYSE:KHI) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A
