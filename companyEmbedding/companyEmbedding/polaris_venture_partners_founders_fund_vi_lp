Investing in novel therapeutics, medical technologies and innovative delivery platforms that meet the critical needs of patients worldwide

We invest throughout the company life cycle – from the earliest creation through profitability – working closely with our teams to help reach their goals.

Creation

Later Stage




CreationVisterra
Polaris has been a visionary partner in the founding and building of Visterra, working with our scientific team on the initial concept in the MIT Labs, forming the company, in-licensing the IP, hiring our first employees and serving as interim leadership in those early days.  The firm has not only been our largest shareholder, but also a great champion, supporting a bold vision, leading our Board of Directors as we achieved each milestone and addressed every opportunity in building a platform that redefines the targeting of infectious disease.  As a result of our partnership, Visterra has a strong investor syndicate that understands our science and our business and a management team that works exceptionally well together in breaking new ground.  At each point where the company was ready to move to the next phase of development, the Polaris team has been there as an anchor, and will continue to be as we seek to help millions of patients worldwide.
– Brian Pereira, CEO, Visterra


 ExpansionReceptos
After raising a successful Series A investment in 2009, we worked closely with Polaris to galvanize our Series B round in 2010-2011, which was a challenging fundraising environment globally. During this time, Polaris came to the table, recognizing the opportunity from both a scientific and business perspective and throwing support behind our team. It was a critical inflection point in our evolution and Polaris was there for us when others were not.   Once on board, as an investor, Polaris was a “thought partner”, subscribing to our collective belief that the essence of strategy is choice.  Together, throughout our growth, we explored many divergent paths before converging on the right one.  This relationship allowed us to assess different options at the board level while supporting the team emotionally, spiritually and strategically.  The result:  Receptos was able to hit or exceed our milestones, and go public at a crucial time while developing important therapies to treat patients with debilitating diseases. Polaris played an important role in this success.
– Faheem Hasnain, President & CEO, Receptos 2010-2015

 Later StageAscend
We were was a single, 104-bed psychiatric hospital looking for an investment partner who believed in our model to deliver specialty behavioral health programs to patients in under-served markets.  Polaris quickly recognized Ascend’s opportunity in the $22 billion mental health arena where demand was outstripping supply.  I chose to partner with them because of their commitment to our innovative services business model.  It was a smart move.  Polaris stepped up quickly at a time when our business was accelerating but the capital markets were challenged.  Our behavioral health platform became validated with recognition of our programs for women, youth, active military affected by combat, and patients with co-occurring disorders. With Polaris as our largest investor, we expanded Ascend’s hospital chain to 5 states; our patient bed count went up more than 8 times; and we generated $200 million in annual revenue and $60 million in profits — all in 4 years.  At the time of our sale to Universal Health Services, Ascend was the largest private psychiatric hospital provider in the country.  Within months of the transaction, I chose Polaris as my lead investor in US Healthvest where we continue to do important work on behalf of psychiatric patients.

Later Stage




CreationImprivata
From prior to our founding through our IPO, Polaris has been by our side. Every step of the way. Through thick and thin and everything in-between. Their commitment has been crucial to our ability to make difficult, smart, crisp decisions which have enabled us to build critical business value for our customers, important leadership within our industry, a truly-special place for our workforce, and a  valuable company for our shareholders. In our early days, Polaris helped us attract world-class talent at every level of our team, as well as to our Board. They worked their networks and opened up doors to vital business and technology relationships. They understood what it meant to be partners, mentors, constructive critics and central contributors to our strategies to serve a rapidly-transforming healthcare market. Polaris believed in us from the very beginning, applied their operating expertise to our business, and helped us navigate an uncharted course in our journey. They’ve been true partners in every sense of the word.
– Omar Hussain, CEO, Imprivata


 ExpansionCliQr
Choosing Polaris as an investment partner was an easy decision for me and CliQr. The Polaris team is a highly seasoned partnership with tremendous operational background and experience in technology companies and startups. Working with such a team that is known to back strong technology plays and knows what it takes to win in the long term as an entrepreneur was a key factor in our motivation to work with Polaris. Within a short period of time, we have already seen the fruits of this, beyond just the initial investment. Polaris has been instrumental in opening up their network and introducing us to key prospective hires, partners and customers. Above all, the mentoring and coaching I have received to help scale a very rapidly growing company in a very exciting space – cloud –  has been personally invaluable to me.
– Gaurav Manglik, CEO, CliQr

 Later StageStrata Health
We chose Polaris as Strata Health’s partner because they invested in our relationship long before any funding took place.  The two-way dialogue that evolved over the course of three years, coupled with their proven expertise in SaaS healthcare solutions fostered a strong sense of trust, integrity and mutual respect, which is often hard to find in this business. Since the Polaris investment, many new doors have opened for Strata in terms of markets, clients and industry dialogue. The have helped us in many ways including recruiting strong new board members, introducing us to customer prospects, and helping us build out our development team. The Board has become more strategic in driving our business towards key milestones, and the culture of collaboration is accelerating the realization of Strata’s global vision.  Our decision to partner with Polaris was the absolute right one, and the organization and investors will be more successful because of it.
