EcoloCap Recycles Organic Waste into Cost-Effective Sustainable Products

Posted on June 16, 2017Categories Press releases







1 like (339)EcoloCap combines innovation, engineering, and industry knowledge to create ecofriendly and sustainable products from organic wasteBARRINGTON, Ill. – EcoloCap Solutions, the leader in organic waste recycling in the United States, will begin input operations at the end of June 2017.  This first installation is a framework that will be duplicated at future installations across the country. The first installation is located at a Lakeshore Recycling facility (3152 S California Ave, Chicago, IL 60608). Operations will start with an input of fifteen tons of fruits and vegetables to be converted into a high-grade compost and organic fertilizer ready to ship to local companies for distribution and mixing by fertilizer distributors.The byproduct created in the biological fermentation process is an organic fertilizer or animal feed depending on the material input. Output is discharged on a continuous basis, which can then be bagged/pelletized on or off site, or delivered in bulk depending on the customer requirements. The byproduct is free from any harmful pathogens as the organic material is heat-treated during fermentation.Newly appointed CEO, James Kwak, has mentioned that EcoloCap’s goal is to change how we dispose waste and make our world eco-friendlier. The first installation at LRS is going to be our template as a springboard to all future installations. EcoloCap’s goal is to make ECOS BioART the technology that every waste company is going to want to implement into their method of handling waste. The decision will be easy once the world is able to witness both the economic and environmental benefits of ECOS BioART.“We are very excited about the opportunities our technology provides to all industries by reducing their costs and by helping them become more sustainable, says James Kwak, CEO. “We can’t thank Lake Shore Recycling’s team enough for assisting us in setting up this pilot at their location along with all the resources spent associated with this exciting project,” Kwak concludes.For more information visit: http://www.ecolocap.comAbout EcoloCapThe Ecolocap compost technology redirects all organic waste into a valuable byproduct. The byproduct includes organic fertilizers, chicken, fish feed, or biomass in the form of a dry powder or pellet that can be efficiently stored, transported, and spread.This press release may contain statements of a forward-looking nature regarding future events. These statements are only predictions, and actual events may differ materially. Please refer to documents that EcoloCap Solutions Inc. files from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a discussion of certain factors that could cause actual results to differ materials from those contained in the forward-looking statements.Categories Press releases

This first installation is a framework that will be duplicated at future installations across the country. The first installation is located at a Lakeshore Recycling facility ( 3152 S California Ave , Chicago, IL 60608). Operations will start with an input of fifteen tons of fruits and vegetables to be converted into a high-grade compost and organic fertilizer ready to ship to local companies for distribution and mixing by fertilizer distributors.   The byproduct created in the biological fermentation process is an organic fertilizer or animal feed depending on the material input. Output is discharged on a continuous basis, which can then be bagged/pelletized on or off site, or delivered in bulk depending on the customer requirements. The byproduct is free from any harmful pathogens as the organic material is heat-treated during fermentation.   Newly appointed CEO, James Kwak , has mentioned that EcoloCap's goal is to change how we dispose waste and make our world eco-friendlier. The first installation at LRS is going to be our template as a springboard to all future installations. EcoloCap's goal is to make ECOS BioART the technology that every waste company is going to want to implement into their method of handling waste. The decision will be easy once the world is able to witness both the economic and environmental benefits of ECOS BioART.   "We are very excited about the opportunities our technology provides to all industries by reducing their costs and by helping them become more sustainable," says James Kwak , CEO. "We can't thank Lake Shore Recycling's team enough for assisting us in setting up this pilot at their location along with all the resources spent associated with this exciting project," Kwak concludes.

Ecolocap Solutions Inc. Sells First NPW-30 Biodiesel Processor to Kansas Producer



Share Article

















The NPW-30 represents the most efficient biodiesel processing technology today, reducing cost and time, opening the door for large production and profitable operation for alternative fuel producers







We are pleased to deal with a forward-looking company like R3 Energy. The R3 Energy management team recognized the opportunity that our processes offer to their industry and we commend them for their vision. For EcoloCap, this is a significant entry into the huge alternative fuel market. There will be a lot of industry observers watching with interest.


Barrington, IL (Vocus)
July 7, 2010
 EcoloCap Solutions Inc. (OTCBB: ECOS), an integrated network of environmentally-focused technology companies utilizing nanotechnology to develop efficient alternative energy solutions, today announced the sale of its first NPW-30 unit to R3 Energy LLC (http://www.R3energyllc.com) of Cottonwood Falls, Kansas. The contract price was $441,000 of which $175,000 was received, the balance due 20 days after commissioning. This introductory price includes one container of additive necessary for processing. This installation should require at least 5 container loads of additive per year. 
The NPW-30 produces 30 metric tons per day of biodiesel from either waste vegetable oil or animal fat, with no pre-processing.  EcoloCap’s process utilizes nanotechnology and proprietary additive, both factors in reducing production costs. The EcoloCap technology can process feedstock with Free Fatty Acid (FFA) of up to 99.2% into ASTM grade biodiesel. Feedstock with high FFA being much less expensive represents another factor in reducing the cost of the finished product. 
The ECOS efficiency claims are based upon side-by-side comparison with the traditional steps required to synthesize Biodiesel. The ECOS NPW-30 uses an automatic batch flow, which has only one processing step.  The ECOS process reduces the oils to nano-sized particles (less than 1 micron) and the process is independent of the amounts of FFA.  Nano sized particles take on unusual properties.  The solubility product and miscibility change and physical separations can occur on a molecular level. The addition of the additive performs the conversion of the fatty acids into glycerin not glycerol. The biodiesel resulting meets or exceeds all ASTM requirements.  The glycerin produced by the ECOS process is pharmaceutical grade and can be sold, as is, to the cosmetic, pharmaceutical and food industries.  There are no other by-products of manufacturing and no catalysts to recover.  The ECOS cost is a minimum of 25% less than standard transesterification.
Jerry McCalla, President of R3 Energy, stated: “With the NPW-30, we initially plan to produce some 9,000 gallons of high quality biodiesel per day. However, we have the capacity to produce over five times that quantity. After the first unit is operative, we plan to order additional equipment in order to reach that potential. This means a lot for our industry and could be a major factor in the alternative fuel market. We also will take advantage of EcoloCap’s Glycerin Refining Process that will extract glycerin from biodiesel to medical grade purity. This will represent a welcome additional bonus for our operation.”
Michael Siegel, President and CEO of EcoloCap stated: “We are pleased to deal with a forward-looking company like R3 Energy. The R3 Energy management team recognized the opportunity that our processes offer to their industry and we commend them for their vision. For EcoloCap, this is a significant entry into the huge alternative fuel market. There will be a lot of industry observers watching with interest.”
