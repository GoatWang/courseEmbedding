PT00114 activity in brain cells.

 


A Novel Neuropeptide Platform with Promising Therapeutic Applications
 
We have created a portfolio of novel neuropeptides that are in various stages of development and preclinical evaluation for the treatment of mood disorders. The lead product candidate, PT00114, is targeted to inhibit anxiety and depression without interfering with normal brain function.
 
Leveraging activity impacting multiple neuropathological processes, Protagenic is reaching beyond the boundaries of traditional therapeutics for anxiety and depression, by focusing on restoring the body’s natural equilibrium.
 
Through 15 years of accumulated research, Protagenic Therapeutics scientists are characterizing the actions of neuropeptides from the genetic level through systemic biological changes to characterize changes to the organisms’ physiology and behavior.
 
The potential to improve mental health by restoring the health of neuronal cells and cellular system represents an exciting paradigm shift in treatment approaches.

Recent studies report an important relationship between mood disorders and disturbances in neuropeptide circuits of the brain. Therapeutics that target the natural neuropeptide circuits that are responsible for restoring normal emotionality may offer effective and safe new treatment options.
