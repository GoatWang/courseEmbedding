Investment Strategy

A Conservative, Customized Approach
Capital preservation is Cumberland Advisors’ overriding priority in managing portfolios. We seek to offset the erosion of financial assets by inflation, to realize appreciation so that the real value of assets is maintained. Under a conservative umbrella, we construct portfolios of bonds or stocks or a mix of both.
Cumberland’s portfolio managers work as a team to develop the broad investment strategies, which underlay all accounts in our care. However, each client works primarily with one manager, enabling our relationship to be more personal and portfolios customized to address individual requirements.
Cumberland Advisors’ portfolios reflect our clients’ varying needs. Some clients are families with assets to be conserved and enhanced. Some are institutions seeking prudent supervision of retirement, endowment, or cash management funds. Our clients’ objectives range from growth oriented total return to current income.
Since appropriate and realistic investment goals must be defined before management begins, we first help develop portfolio objectives, which reflect each client’s financial needs and tolerance for risk. Once objectives are established, the test of their fulfillment is time. Consistent results evolve when portfolio themes are permitted to mature.
The Underlying Principles
Since its founding in 1973, Cumberland Advisors’ investment strategy has been based upon the following critical economic concepts:
We believe the value of stocks and bonds is enduringly linked to interest rates. The cost of money is paramount. Short term returns on stocks and bonds can vary greatly; however, interest rates eventually dominate that valuation process and are the market’s way of restoring equilibrium. When bond yields approach the long term return on stocks, a shift from stocks to bonds typically occurs. Investors rightfully demand a greater return for taking on the risk of owning stocks.
We believe that the cost of money – the nominal interest rate – has three parts: a “real” interest rate; an expectation of inflation; and a risk premium. These three components vary over time. Ongoing examination of each one and the ways in which they combine to form the nominal rate is essential to understanding how the nature of money controls the world in which we manage portfolios.
We believe opportunities in the markets are present at all times, especially in the midst of euphoria or hysteria. We strive to make portfolio changes at times of market extremes. Benefits accrue as stocks and bonds eventually move from excesses toward their historically established levels of return.
Cumberland’s management of bond, stock, and balanced portfolios has revolved around these concepts since the firm’s inception. Although technology and internationalization have made market participants more numerous, these three essential principles remain remarkably constant. We expect they will continue to govern market behavior and therefore remain the foundation of our investment advisory work.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.
