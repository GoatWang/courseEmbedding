PrivateBancorp, Inc. Files Form 15
Jul 3 17
PrivateBancorp, Inc. has announced that it has filed a Form 15 with the Securities and Exchange Commission to voluntarily deregister its common stock, no par value under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.


PrivateBancorp Request NASDAQ To File Form 25 With SEC To Delist And Deregister Common Stock
Jun 23 17
Further to the agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June 29, 2016, by and among Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (“CIBC”), PrivateBancorp, Inc., (“PrivateBancorp”) and CIBC Holdco Inc. (“Holdco”), On June 23, 2017, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, PrivateBancorp merged with and into Holdco (the “Merger”), with Holdco surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of CIBC. As a result of the Merger, PrivateBancorp no longer fulfills the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Global Select Stock Market (“Nasdaq”).  PrivateBancorp requested that Nasdaq suspend trading of PrivateBancorp common stock on Nasdaq, which will be effective as of the open of business on June 23, 2017, and file with the SEC a Form 25 to request the removal of the common stock from listing on Nasdaq and to deregister the common stock under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).  As a result, PrivateBancorp common stock will no longer be listed on Nasdaq. Following the effectiveness of the delisting, which will occur 10 days after filing of the Form 25, Holdco (as successor to PrivateBancorp by operation of law) intends to file with the SEC certifications on Form 15 under the Exchange Act requesting the deregistration of the PrivateBancorp common stock under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and the suspension of PrivateBancorp’s reporting obligations under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

PrivateBancorp, Inc. Announces Intent to Delist, Deregister and Redeem Debt Securities

PrivateBancorp, Inc.

 Share this article




























































CHICAGO, June 12, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- PrivateBancorp, Inc. (Nasdaq:    PVTB) today announced that it has notified the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") of its intention to delist its 7.125 percent Subordinated Debentures due 2042 (the "Debentures"), which currently trade under ticker symbol "PVTD," and has notified the Nasdaq Global Select Stock Market ("Nasdaq") of its intention to delist the 10 percent Trust Preferred Securities of PrivateBancorp Capital Trust IV (the "Listed TruPS"), which currently trade under ticker symbol "PVTBP."








Both actions are being taken in anticipation of the closing of the acquisition by Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce ("CIBC") of PrivateBancorp that, as previously announced, is expected to close on June 23, 2017, which will result in the successor company to PrivateBancorp being a wholly owned subsidiary of CIBC following the closing.  PrivateBancorp expects to file Form 25 notifications prior to market open on June 23, 2017, with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") to request the removal of the Debentures and the Listed TruPS from listing on the NYSE and Nasdaq, respectively, and to deregister such securities under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act").  In addition, as further described below, it is currently anticipated that, following the closing of the CIBC acquisition, the Debentures and the Listed TruPS will be called for redemption on their first available redemption date following the closing.
PrivateBancorp expects trading in the Debentures and the Listed TruPS will be suspended on June 23, 2017, and that the delisting of the Debentures and the Listed TruPS will become effective 10 days from the filing date of each respective Form 25.  Upon effectiveness of each Form 25 filing, it is expected that Form 15 filings will be made with the SEC to terminate the registration of the Debentures and the Listed TruPS under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act, and to notify the SEC of the suspension of PrivateBancorp's public reporting obligations with respect to the Debentures and Listed TruPS.
Anticipated Redemption of Debentures
In connection with an anticipated satisfaction and discharge of the indenture associated with the Debentures at closing, PrivateBancorp intends to make arrangements to call for redemption all of the outstanding Debentures on the first available redemption date of October 30, 2017, (the "Debentures Redemption Date") at a redemption price equal to 100 percent of the principal amount outstanding, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the Debentures Redemption Date. 
The Debentures are held only in book-entry form through the Depository Trust Company ("DTC"), and the Debentures will be redeemed in accordance with DTC procedures. Holders of Debentures need not take any action now to receive payment of the redemption price.
This press release does not constitute a notice of redemption of the Debentures, and the Debentures have not yet been called for redemption. Holders of the Debentures should refer to the notice of redemption, when available, to be delivered or made available at the time the Debentures are called for redemption.
Anticipated Redemption of Trust Preferred Securities
In connection with an anticipated satisfaction and discharge of the indenture associated with the debentures related to the Listed TruPS (the "TruPS Debentures") at closing, PrivateBancorp intends to make arrangements to call for redemption all of the outstanding TruPS Debentures on or about July 24, 2017, (the "TruPS Redemption Date") at a redemption price of 100 percent of the principal amount outstanding, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the TruPS Redemption Date.  The redemption of the TruPS Debentures will result in the mandatory redemption of the Listed TruPS on the TruPS Redemption Date. 
The Listed TruPS are held only in book-entry form through the DTC, and the Listed TruPS will be redeemed in accordance with DTC procedures. Holders of Listed TruPS need not take any action now to receive payment of the redemption price.
This press release does not constitute a notice of redemption of the Listed TruPS, and the Listed TruPS have not yet been called for redemption. Holders of Listed TruPS should refer to the notice of redemption, when available, to be delivered or made available at the time the Listed TruPS are called for redemption.
PrivateBancorp also expects that in connection with the CIBC acquisition, it will make arrangements to call for redemption all other series of its trust preferred securities currently outstanding, none of which are listed or traded on any exchange.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
