Versus Capital Multi-Manager Real Estate Income Fund Surpasses $500 
      Million in Assets




Versus Capital Registers an Incremental $1.25 Billion of Shares






February 11, 2016 04:49 PM Eastern Standard Time



GLENDALE, Colo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Versus Capital Advisors LLC (ticker: VCMIX), an asset management firm 
      that specializes in distinctive real estate investment funds, announced 
      today that the Versus Capital Multi-Manager Real Estate Income Fund 
      (“the Fund”), having recently reached $500 million in assets, registered 
      an additional $1.25 billion in shares as of February 2, 2016.
    


      The Fund is a continuously offered closed-end interval fund, registered 
      under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Fund serves as a core real 
      estate holding, providing access to institutional real estate managers. 
      “In a highly volatile investment environment, we feel that the 
      registered investment advisor community continues to validate our core 
      real estate strategy with additional investment dollars,” said Casey 
      Frazier, Chief Investment Officer of Versus Capital Advisors LLC.
    

      Mark Quam, CEO of Versus Capital Advisors, added, “Attractive 
      distributions, low volatility, and the potential for long-term capital 
      appreciation, are the investment attributes we are working to provide 
      advisors and their clients. We are continuing to see interest in the 
      product grow and as such, we needed to assure we had sufficient shares 
      registered to accommodate the investment demand.”
    

Performance data current to the most recent month-end may be obtained 
      by calling 877-343-7916.


Risks


      CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FUND'S INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES, RISKS, CHARGES, AND 
      EXPENSES BEFORE INVESTING. YOU CAN OBTAIN THE PROSPECTUS AND SUMMARY 
      PROSPECTUS WITH THIS AND OTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE FUND FROM THE 
      VERSUS CAPITAL WEB SITE (versuscapital.com). READ THEM CAREFULLY BEFORE 
      INVESTING. AN INVESTMENT IN THE FUND IS SUBJECT TO A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK.
    

      The Fund does not intend to list its Shares on any securities exchange 
      during the offering period, and a secondary market in the Shares is not 
      expected to develop. There is no guarantee that shareholders will be 
      able to sell all of their tendered shares during a quarterly repurchase 
      offer. An investment is not suitable for investors that require 
      liquidity, other through the Fund’s repurchase policy. You should not 
      expect to be able to sell your Shares other than through the Fund’s 
      repurchase policy, regardless of how the Fund performs.
    

      Real estate is subject to special risks, among which are tenant default, 
      environmental problems, and adverse changes in local economic 
      conditions. The yield from an underlying investment fund could be 
      significantly reduced if it fails to qualify as a REIT (real estate 
      investment trust) for tax purposes. The Fund's investments also may be 
      negatively affected by the broad investment environment. Although the 
      Fund is intended to provide a means by which investors can diversify 
      their portfolios into real estate, the Fund itself is "non-diversified" 
      under the Investment Company Act of 1940 since changes in the market 
      value of a single holding may cause a greater fluctuation in the Fund's 
      net asset value than in a "diversified" fund. The Fund is not intended 
      to be a complete investment program. Investors are reminded that 
      portfolio diversification does not ensure a profit or guarantee against 
      a loss
    

      A multi-manager strategy involves certain risks. For example, the 
      success of the Fund depends in large part upon the ability of the 
      Adviser to choose successful Investment Managers. It is possible that 
      some Investment Managers may take similar market positions, thereby 
      interfering with the Fund's investment goal. The Fund and underlying 
      Investment Managers may borrow as an investment strategy. The Fund 
      intends to limit borrowing to one third of its gross asset value. While 
      borrowing presents opportunities to increase the Fund's total return, it 
      potentially increases the losses as well. Under certain circumstances, 
      the Fund's distribution policy could result in a return of capital, 
      potentially causing the Fund's expense ratio to increase. The Adviser, 
      Sub-Adviser, and Investment Mangers manage portfolios for themselves and 
      for clients other than the Fund. A conflict between the interests of the 
      Fund and the interests of these other parties may arise in certain 
      situations which potentially could disadvantage the Fund. For example, a 
      suitable but limited investment opportunity might be allocated to 
      another client rather than to the Fund.

Real Asset



 By 
                        Investopedia Staff






What is 'Real Asset'Real assets are physical assets that have value due to their substance and properties. Real assets include precious metals, commodities, real estate, agricultural land, machinery and oil. They are appropriate for inclusion in most diversified portfolios because of their relatively low correlation with financial assets such as stocks and bonds.BREAKING DOWN 'Real Asset'Investing in real assets is particularly well-suited for inflationary times because of their tendency to outperform financial assets during such periods.Most businesses own a range of assets, and they typically fall into the real, financial or intangible category. For example, imagine XYZ Company owns a fleet of cars, a factory and a great deal of equipment. These are real assets. However, the company also owns several trademarks and copyrights. These are intangible assets. Finally, the company has a few stocks in a sister company, which are financial assets.Difference Between Real Assets and Financial AssetsReal assets are a separate and distinct asset class from financial assets. Unlike real assets, which have intrinsic value, financial assets derive their value from a contractual claim on an underlying asset which may be real or intangible. For example, commodities and property are real assets, but commodity futures, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and real estate investment trusts (REITs) constitute financial assets whose value depends on the underlying real assets.Advantages and Disadvantages of Real AssetsReal assets tend to be more stable than financial assets. Inflation, shifts in currency values and other macroeconomic factors affect real assets less than financial assets. However, real assets also have lower liquidity than financial assets, as they take longer to sell and have higher transaction fees in general. Finally, real assets have higher carrying and storage costs than financial assets.Difference Between Financial Assets and Intangible AssetsIntangible assets include trademarks, brand recognition and other intangible items, but this asset category does not include stocks and bonds. Similarly, financial assets include stocks and bonds, but the category does not include goodwill, patents or other intangible assets.Difference Between Tangible and Intangible AssetsTangible assets include stocks, bonds, property, cash, vehicles and a host of other things, while intangible assets include only a small sliver of items. Tangible assets include both financial and real assets, while intangible assets include items that exclusively fall into the intangible category.For tax purposes, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requires businesses to report intangible assets differently than tangible assets, but it groups real and financial assets together under the tangible asset umbrella.

Multi.
Total Income+ Real Estate Fund:
Diversifying through a multi-manager, multi-strategy, and multi-sector investment approach.









The Bluerock Total Income+ Real Estate Fund (the “Fund”) is a public fund utilizing a multi-manager, multi-strategy, and multi-sector approach. The Fund allows individuals to invest in private, institutional real estate securities alongside some of the nation’s largest endowment and pension plans. The Total Income+ Real Estate Fund is a continuously offered, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that is operated as an interval fund.
Potential Investment Benefits:

Income
Primarily derived from investing in income producing institutional real estate investment funds.
Portfolio Diversification
To seek a combination of current income, capital preservation and long-term capital appreciation, the Fund’s portfolio is intended to be widely diversified by manager, strategy, property sector and geography. The Fund intends to pursue an 80% private/20% public real estate allocation.
Daily Net Asset Value (NAV)
The Fund’s NAV is calculated and published each day after the close of the New York Stock Exchange.
Liquidity
The Fund’s interval structure allows for the redemption at NAV of a stated portion of outstanding shares each quarter.
Capital Appreciation
Sought through the selection of investments that provide the opportunity to achieve long-term growth with low to moderate volatility.
Low Correlation
The Fund strategically invests in a combination of institutional, private and publicly traded real estate investments that may be lower correlated to the broader equity and fixed income markets.
Low Volatility
The Fund primarily invests in institutional private equity real estate which has historically experienced less volatility than the broader markets.
This is an actively managed dynamic portfolio. There is no guarantee that any investment (or this investment) will achieve its objectives, goals, generate positive returns, or avoid losses.






Access.
Total Income+ Real Estate Fund:
Access to top institutional fund managers.








Asset Allocation
Decades ago, portfolio construction was simply a matter of allocating to stocks and bonds. Today, portfolio construction suggets a need for additional types of investments often referred to as "alternatives," including assets such as real estate, and many others.

Institutional Private Equity Real Estate (iPERE)
Institutional private equity real estate (iPERE) can be described as high-quality commercial properties that are usually congregated in large investment portfolios managed professionally on behalf of third-party owners or beneficiaries.
Since the National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries (NCREIF) began measuring iPERE in 1978, only four years have experienced negative returns. NPI tends to perform much like the traded REIT sector over long periods of time only with much less volatility.




           Institutional Private EquityReal Estate (iPERE)





Our Strategy
Adding real estate to a traditional investment portfolio of stocks, bonds, and treasury bills introduces a historically non-correlated asset that may reduce risk and enhance overall return. The Fund provides access to a diversified holding of large, private, real estate securities typically available only to institutions (and without the large minimum investment and long holding period normally required).

Funding Your LLC




Most LLCs need to raise capital to get started with their business. Read about some of the more commonly-used options for obtaining funding.

An essential element of starting a successful Limited Liability Company (LLC) is properly funding your LLC.   Many new businesses fail because they lack sufficient capital to survive their initial start-up phase.   A detailed, effective business plan may be an important initial step in raising funds so that you can illustrate to potential investors and lenders your ability to pay back loans or to reach profitability over time.   There are numerous options available for funding your LLC and here are some major avenues for you to consider.

Evaluate Your Own Assets.   Many future business owners look first to their personal assets to fund their new venture either by liquidating these assets or using them as collateral for loans.   In some instances, you might tap your personal cash savings and sell valuable personal or real property, such as your home, to raise cash for your new LLC.   If you have equity in your home, you may decide to seek out a home equity loan to help finance your business.   But beware that if you are unable to make your home loan payments, you will lose not only your new business, but also a roof over your head. If you have retirement accounts, you may be able to borrow from them to finance your start-up for limited time periods.   However, there may be hefty withdrawal fees and tax penalties for removing funds and not paying them back within required time periods.
Contact Your Personal Network for Informal Loans. Just about every entrepreneur has shared their dream of starting their own business with family and friends.   You have your strongest personal connections with those in your family and social circles. Those who know you best are likely to be more willing to put their trust in you and their cash behind your start-up.   This informal financing may be easy to obtain, but may create long-term trouble in your family and social relationships if the money is not paid back.   If you feel comfortable with this potential risk, it may be worthwhile to reach out to your personal network for financial support.
Invite New Members to Your LLC Team.   Bringing in additional members may be another option for funding your start-up.   Although you may want to go solo, think about the value of adding other LLC members or owners for funding purposes.   You can pool together your financial resources with your other members to support your new venture.   With other members, you also broaden your LLC’s social network of business contacts, and hopefully potential investors.  Aside from raising more funds for your LLC, new members may also yield the added benefits of learning from your fellow owners’ professional experiences.  
Look into Credit Cards for Short-Term Financing.   Many individuals may try to start out their business using personal credit cards, such as the entrepreneurs who started Google.   Many credit card services also offer business credit cards which may have low or no annual fees, competitive interest rates and travel rewards and cash back based on business purchases.   Credit cards can provide immediate credit without the paperwork of loan applications or business plans.   Since credit card interest can be quite high, new business owners may want to view credit cards as short-term solutions for LLC needs which should be paid back quickly.   Avoid racking up large amounts of extended credit card debt that could make this fast process for financing very costly long-term.
Apply for Conventional Loans From Institutional Lenders.   You might try the traditional route of seeking loans from banks and credit unions.   You will need a formal business plan as part of your loan application process.   Many conventional lenders may be wary of inexperienced business people so don’t be surprised if you face a great deal of rejection.   Borrowing against existing collateral may improve your chances of gaining financing, but it is likely to be a challenging path. If you decide to use your assets as collateral for an institutional loan, recognize that your failure to repay these business loans will mean the loss of your underlying collateral.  
Check Out Government-Sponsored Grant and Loan Programs.   Federal, state, and local governments may offer special grant or loan programs through traditional lenders or non-profit intermediaries to help finance your business.   These government-sponsored programs may target 1) types of industries, such as alternative energy, 2) certain business owners, such as military veterans, 3) designated geographic locations, such as economically disadvantaged communities, or 4) particular dollar amounts, such as microloans that may start at amounts as small as $100.   The Small Business Administration (SBA) offers an online search tool for identifying loans and grant programs that may apply to your start-up.
Connect with Peer-to-Peer Lending Sites.   In the past few years, peer-to-peer (P2P) or social lending websites have begun to emerge on the Web.   These P2P sites offer opportunities for creditworthy business people to seek out funding from individual or institutional investors. You can apply for a loan online through these sites and investors with site accounts can decide whether or not they wish to fund your proposed business through interest-based loans. These P2P sites are online alternatives to traditional lending institutions and are expected to continue to grow as quick, confidential sources of new business funding. Some well-known P2P sites are Lending Club  and Prosper.

							A Word On Risk

							Mutual fund investing involves risk; principal loss is possible. Equity investments such as those held by the Fund, are subject to market risk, call risk, derivatives risk, other investment companies risk, common stock risk, and tax risks associated with MLPs. Concentration in specific sectors may involve greater risk and volatility than more diversified investments: real estate sector involves the risk of exposure to economic downturns and changes in real estate values, rents, property taxes, interest rates and tax laws; infrastructure-related securities may involve greater exposure to adverse economic, regulatory, political, legal, and other changes affecting such securities. Foreign investments involve additional risks, including currency fluctuation, political and economic instability, lack of liquidity, and differing legal and accounting standards. These risks are magnified in emerging markets. Investments in small- and mid-cap companies are subject to greater volatility. In addition, the Fund will bear its proportionate share of any fees and expenses paid by the ETFs in which it invests.

	Debt or fixed income securities such as those held by the Fund, are subject to market risk, credit risk, interest rate risk and income risk. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall. Below investment grade or high yield debt securities are subject to liquidity risk and heightened credit risk. Preferred securities are subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company's capital structure and therefore are subject to greater credit risk. Asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities are subject to additional risks such as prepayment risk, liquidity risk, default risk and adverse economic developments.

						








Returns quoted represent past performance which is no guarantee of future performance. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate so that when shares are redeemed, they may be worth more or less than their original cost. Due to market conditions, current performance may be higher or lower than the data shown. Returns without sales charge do not reflect the imposition of the maximum sales charge, which would reduce returns. Total returns for a period of less than one year are cumulative. Performance assumes the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. Class A shares have a 5.75% maximum sales charge. Class C shares have a 1% CDSC for redemptions within less than one year, which is not reflected in the one-year total return. Class I shares have no sales charge and may be purchased under limited circumstances or by specified classes of investors. Class R6 shares have no sales charge and are available to certain qualified retirement plans and other investors as set forth in the statement of additional information.Distribution Rate is the most recent dividend per share (annualized) divided by the respective price per share. The SEC 30-Day Yield is computed under an SEC standardized formula and is based on the maximum offer price per share as of the date specified. The Distribution Rate also differs from the SEC 30-Day Yield because the Fund may be paying out more or less than it is earning and it may not include the effect of amortization of bond premium. Subsidized yields reflect fee waivers in effect. Without such waivers, yields would be reduced. Unsubsidized yields do not reflect fee waivers in effect.Expense ratios are based on the Fund's most recent fiscal year end. The net expense ratio reflects a contractual commitment by the Fund's investment adviser to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses through September 30, 2018. Absent the waiver and/or reimbursement, expenses would be higher and total returns would be less.

Investments | Aether Investment Partners



















































Investments


















Aether focuses on private, upstream investments in natural resources globally. Our primary sectors include oil and natural gas, metals and minerals and agriculture and timber. We opportunistically consider other real assets sectors, though we do not invest in commercial or residential real estate.
We have a bias toward smaller, often less efficient investment opportunities but will consider any opportunity provided the capitalization is right-sized for the strategy. Across all sectors, we seek investments where opportunities exist to add significant value post investment. We favor strategies focused on equity investments but may selectively consider credit and debt-oriented strategies. Investments that depend on high leverage or technological innovation to generate returns are typically avoided.
