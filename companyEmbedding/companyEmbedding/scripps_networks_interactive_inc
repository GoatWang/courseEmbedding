    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Company history[edit]
Scripps Networks Interactive's roots began in 1993, when the E. W. Scripps Company announced it would launch a 24-hour cable network in the fall of 1994. On December 30, 1994 HGTV went on the air to 6.5 million homes in 50 markets.
In 1995, the official opening for HGTV’s new headquarters in Knoxville took place. The network reached into 10 million homes on November 1 of that year, launched in Canada and online with HGTV.com in 1996, and hit the 25 million subscriber mark in 1997.
Also in 1997, Scripps Networks added its second network with the acquisition of Food Network. The year also saw HGTV execute its first HGTV Dream Home Giveaway, which received more than 1.2 million entries from across the country. By 2011, the number of entries had grown to nearly 80 million.[4]
In 1999 Scripps launched DIY Network, described as the "go-to destination for rip-up, knock-out home improvement television." With three brands now under the Scripps Networks umbrella, a $12 million addition was made to the company’s headquarters in Knoxville to provide the infrastructure and technology to support the networks’ growth.
Both HGTV (in November 2002) and Food Network (in September 2003) reached full distribution[clarification needed] with 80 million subscribers apiece, while Food Network followed HGTV’s footprint into Canada by launching Food Network Canada at the end of 2002.
The first half of the decade also saw Scripps Networks add its fourth and fifth networks to its mix, Fine Living Network (2002) and Great American Country (2004). A few months after the acquisition of Great American Country, Scripps Networks announced the move of the network’s headquarters from Denver, Colorado to Nashville, Tennessee.
In 2008, Scripps Networks Interactive split from the E.W. Scripps Company and received its own listing on the NYSE as ticker symbol SNI. The year also saw Great American Country reach 50 million subscribers, with DIY Network reaching the 50 million subscriber mark in 2009.
Scripps Networks acquired a majority interest in the Travel Channel from Cox Communications for a reported $975 million [5] in late 2009, and the following year rebranded Fine Living Network as Cooking Channel.
On February 8, 2011, the company's headquarters facility in Knoxville was awarded the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold certification, established by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) and verified by the Green Building Certification Institute (GBCI).
In April 2011, Scripps announced the sale of Shopzilla to Symphony Technology Group for $165 million. Scripps, from within its Travel Channel unit also invested in Oyster.com, a hotel research and booking site.[6]
On August 15, 2011, Virgin Media agreed to sell its 50% stake in UKTV to Scripps Networks in a deal worth £339m. Scripps paid £239m in cash, and about £100m to acquire the outstanding preferred stock and debt owed by UKTV to Virgin Media.[7] Completion of the transaction was contingent on regulatory approvals in Ireland and Jersey, which was received on October 3, 2011.[8] Related to the transaction, Scripps Networks and BBC Worldwide are negotiating an agreement whereby, after completion, BBC Worldwide would have the option, via a combination of cash and a package of digital rights for UKTV, to increase its shareholding from 50 percent to a maximum of 60 percent. Scripps Networks' existing voting rights and board representation would be unaffected by this proposed arrangement, which would be subject to BBC Executive and BBC Trust approvals.
On March 22, 2012, Scripps Networks announced that it had agreed to pay £65m (US$102.7m) to acquire Travel Channel International Limited, the UK-based distributor of the Travel Channel brand across the Europe, Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific markets.[9] The deal was completed on May 1, 2012 following regulatory approval.[10] The international channel will be integrated with Scripps Networks' own Travel Channel.
On December 11, 2012 One Kings Lane, a home decor website, announced that Scripps Networks had invested in its Series D financing. Scripps Networks invested $15M in exchange for a 3% equity stake in the company.[11]
On June 5, 2013, Scripps Networks launched ulive, a digital-only lifestyle video brand that combines video content from Scripps Networks’ media brands with premium third-party videos and original series. Consisting of ulive.com, this premium video portal and distribution network expands on Scripps Networks’ food, home and travel verticals, adding coverage for topics including parenting and wellness.[12]
Scripps Networks Interactive[edit]
Scripps Networks has launched Food Network in the United Kingdom and other European markets as well as in the Middle East and Africa. The company recently acquired a 50 percent interest in UKTV, one of the U.K. leading multi-channel television programming companies. Scripps Networks is also preparing to launch Food Network in Indonesia, bringing the channel to five countries in Asia in one year’s time. Scripps Networks' channels are also available through outlets on U.S. military bases and U.S. embassies around the world via the American Forces Network.
In May 2013, the company announced that it will open a Brazilian headquarters, in São Paulo,[13] and has appointed the former vice-president of strategy of FOX as managing director.[14] Scripps Networks will broadcast its channels to the entire Latin America region.[13]
On 2 July 2015 SNI finalized acquisition of 100% stake in N-Vision company which has 52.7% stake in Polish television group TVN.[15] The TVN group broadcasts 12 channels in Poland, including: TVN, TVN24 and TVN24 Biznes I Świat.

Shares of Scripps gain, Discovery stock slumps after reports that Viacom is out as potential buyer
Shares of Scripps Networks Interactive Inc.  were up more than 3% in premarket trade on Thursday, while Discovery Communication Inc.  shares fell more than 2% following media reports Wednesday evening that Viacom Inc.  is no longer in the hunt to acquire Scripps. That makes Discovery the leading contender for a potential deal to buy Scripps. According to a report in Variety, Viacom had made an all-cash bid for Scripps, which would have likely knocked the company to junk status. Shares of Viacom were inactive in premarket trade. Scripps shares have gained nearly 18% in the year to date, while shares of Discovery are down 3% and the S&P 500 index  is up nearly 11% in the year.

Potential Scripps Networks, Discovery merger could be coming at just the right time, analyst says
Shares of Scripps Networks Interactive Inc.  were up 14% during intraday trade on Wednesday, after a Wall Street Journal report Tuesday night that the media company was in talks to merge with Discovery Communications Inc. . Shares of Discovery were up nearly 4%. The potential tie-up not only makes sense, but could be coming at just the right time, according to MKM Partners analyst Eric Handler. A Scripps acquisition would give Discovery increased relevance and scale, and would be beneficial to Scripps shareholders, Handler wrote in a note to investors. "The possible acquisition of Scripps should prove beneficial for Discovery, and create a company with revenue of roughly $10.5 billion and EBITDA of more than $4 billion," Handler wrote. "The timing of this potential transaction could be coming at a good time for Scripps, which is seeing erosion in its ratings trends, especially with HGTV, while investment spending for new initiatives remains elevated." Shares of Discovery are down nearly 2% in the year to date, while Scripps shares have gained more than 16% in the year and the S&P 500 index  has gained more than 10%.

Scripps Networks stock upgraded to overweight at J.P. Morgan after Q1 earnings report
Analysts at J.P. Morgan upgraded shares of Scripps Networks Interactive Inc.'s  to overweight from neutral following the media networks first-quarter earnings report after the bell on Thursday. The stock was upgraded after a pullback in shares, strong commentary on advertising revenue thanks to higher demand and improving ratings at HGTV and the company's recent deal with Hulu to be included in the streaming platform's live TV service. Scripps Networks' domestic ad revenue increased 5.1% during the first quarter. Additionally, J.P. Morgan analysts expect elevated distribution revenue growth to continue with most of Scripps Networks affiliate agreements renewed. In the first quarter, domestic affiliate revenue rose 4.5%. "Scripps Networks Interactive continues to outperform most of its peers in ratings and advertising growth driven by the ongoing attractiveness of its lifestyle programming, which continues to have above-average live viewership and engagement and therefore commands high [cost per impression]," lead analyst Alexia Quadrani wrote in a note to clients. Scripps Networks reported per-share earnings of 1.53, compared with 1.37 per share in the year earlier period and above FactSet's consensus of 1.19. Revenue during the first quarter hit $855 million, up from $817 million a year ago, but shy of FactSet's $857 estimate. Shares of Scripps Network have declined 1.6% in the year to date, but are up 11.3% in the last 12 months. By comparison, the S&P 500 index  is up 6.7% in the year and 16.5% in the prior 12-month period.

Hulu launches live TV platform and adds channels from HGTV-owner Scripps Networks
TV streaming platform Hulu, jointly owned by Walt Disney Co. , 21st Century Fox Inc. , Comcast Corp.  and Time Warner Inc. , said during its advertising Upfront on Wednesday it's launching its live TV service and at the same time adding channels from Scripps Networks Interactive Inc.  to the service. Hulu Chief Executive Mike Hopkins said during the company's presentation in New York that the deal with Scripps gives Hulu live and on-demand access to the HGTV, Food Network and Travel Channel when Hulu's live streaming service launches in beta on Wednesday. Scripps joins Fox, Disney, NBCUniversal, CBS, Turner Networks and A&E Networks in providing channels to Hulu's live service. Live TV streaming platforms have increasingly become a focus in the landscape with companies competing to meet viewers where they are by giving them the content they want most -- live TV has been the last bastion of broadcast and cable TV. Hulu's live TV service, at $40 per month, joins offerings like Sling TV from Dish Network Corp. , DirecTV Now from AT&T Inc.  and even Google Inc.'s  YouTube TV.

Company history[edit]
Scripps Networks Interactive's roots began in 1993, when the E. W. Scripps Company announced it would launch a 24-hour cable network in the fall of 1994. On December 30, 1994 HGTV went on the air to 6.5 million homes in 50 markets.
In 1995, the official opening for HGTV’s new headquarters in Knoxville took place. The network reached into 10 million homes on November 1 of that year, launched in Canada and online with HGTV.com in 1996, and hit the 25 million subscriber mark in 1997.
Also in 1997, Scripps Networks added its second network with the acquisition of Food Network. The year also saw HGTV execute its first HGTV Dream Home Giveaway, which received more than 1.2 million entries from across the country. By 2011, the number of entries had grown to nearly 80 million.[4]
In 1999 Scripps launched DIY Network, described as the "go-to destination for rip-up, knock-out home improvement television." With three brands now under the Scripps Networks umbrella, a $12 million addition was made to the company’s headquarters in Knoxville to provide the infrastructure and technology to support the networks’ growth.
Both HGTV (in November 2002) and Food Network (in September 2003) reached full distribution[clarification needed] with 80 million subscribers apiece, while Food Network followed HGTV’s footprint into Canada by launching Food Network Canada at the end of 2002.
The first half of the decade also saw Scripps Networks add its fourth and fifth networks to its mix, Fine Living Network (2002) and Great American Country (2004). A few months after the acquisition of Great American Country, Scripps Networks announced the move of the network’s headquarters from Denver, Colorado to Nashville, Tennessee.
In 2008, Scripps Networks Interactive split from the E.W. Scripps Company and received its own listing on the NYSE as ticker symbol SNI. The year also saw Great American Country reach 50 million subscribers, with DIY Network reaching the 50 million subscriber mark in 2009.
Scripps Networks acquired a majority interest in the Travel Channel from Cox Communications for a reported $975 million [5] in late 2009, and the following year rebranded Fine Living Network as Cooking Channel.
On February 8, 2011, the company's headquarters facility in Knoxville was awarded the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold certification, established by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) and verified by the Green Building Certification Institute (GBCI).
In April 2011, Scripps announced the sale of Shopzilla to Symphony Technology Group for $165 million. Scripps, from within its Travel Channel unit also invested in Oyster.com, a hotel research and booking site.[6]
On August 15, 2011, Virgin Media agreed to sell its 50% stake in UKTV to Scripps Networks in a deal worth £339m. Scripps paid £239m in cash, and about £100m to acquire the outstanding preferred stock and debt owed by UKTV to Virgin Media.[7] Completion of the transaction was contingent on regulatory approvals in Ireland and Jersey, which was received on October 3, 2011.[8] Related to the transaction, Scripps Networks and BBC Worldwide are negotiating an agreement whereby, after completion, BBC Worldwide would have the option, via a combination of cash and a package of digital rights for UKTV, to increase its shareholding from 50 percent to a maximum of 60 percent. Scripps Networks' existing voting rights and board representation would be unaffected by this proposed arrangement, which would be subject to BBC Executive and BBC Trust approvals.
On March 22, 2012, Scripps Networks announced that it had agreed to pay £65m (US$102.7m) to acquire Travel Channel International Limited, the UK-based distributor of the Travel Channel brand across the Europe, Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific markets.[9] The deal was completed on May 1, 2012 following regulatory approval.[10] The international channel will be integrated with Scripps Networks' own Travel Channel.
On December 11, 2012 One Kings Lane, a home decor website, announced that Scripps Networks had invested in its Series D financing. Scripps Networks invested $15M in exchange for a 3% equity stake in the company.[11]
On June 5, 2013, Scripps Networks launched ulive, a digital-only lifestyle video brand that combines video content from Scripps Networks’ media brands with premium third-party videos and original series. Consisting of ulive.com, this premium video portal and distribution network expands on Scripps Networks’ food, home and travel verticals, adding coverage for topics including parenting and wellness.[12]
Scripps Networks Interactive[edit]
Scripps Networks has launched Food Network in the United Kingdom and other European markets as well as in the Middle East and Africa. The company recently acquired a 50 percent interest in UKTV, one of the U.K. leading multi-channel television programming companies. Scripps Networks is also preparing to launch Food Network in Indonesia, bringing the channel to five countries in Asia in one year’s time. Scripps Networks' channels are also available through outlets on U.S. military bases and U.S. embassies around the world via the American Forces Network.
In May 2013, the company announced that it will open a Brazilian headquarters, in São Paulo,[13] and has appointed the former vice-president of strategy of FOX as managing director.[14] Scripps Networks will broadcast its channels to the entire Latin America region.[13]
On 2 July 2015 SNI finalized acquisition of 100% stake in N-Vision company which has 52.7% stake in Polish television group TVN.[15] The TVN group broadcasts 12 channels in Poland, including: TVN, TVN24 and TVN24 Biznes I Świat.

Company history[edit]
Scripps Networks Interactive's roots began in 1993, when the E. W. Scripps Company announced it would launch a 24-hour cable network in the fall of 1994. On December 30, 1994 HGTV went on the air to 6.5 million homes in 50 markets.
In 1995, the official opening for HGTV’s new headquarters in Knoxville took place. The network reached into 10 million homes on November 1 of that year, launched in Canada and online with HGTV.com in 1996, and hit the 25 million subscriber mark in 1997.
Also in 1997, Scripps Networks added its second network with the acquisition of Food Network. The year also saw HGTV execute its first HGTV Dream Home Giveaway, which received more than 1.2 million entries from across the country. By 2011, the number of entries had grown to nearly 80 million.[4]
In 1999 Scripps launched DIY Network, described as the "go-to destination for rip-up, knock-out home improvement television." With three brands now under the Scripps Networks umbrella, a $12 million addition was made to the company’s headquarters in Knoxville to provide the infrastructure and technology to support the networks’ growth.
Both HGTV (in November 2002) and Food Network (in September 2003) reached full distribution[clarification needed] with 80 million subscribers apiece, while Food Network followed HGTV’s footprint into Canada by launching Food Network Canada at the end of 2002.
The first half of the decade also saw Scripps Networks add its fourth and fifth networks to its mix, Fine Living Network (2002) and Great American Country (2004). A few months after the acquisition of Great American Country, Scripps Networks announced the move of the network’s headquarters from Denver, Colorado to Nashville, Tennessee.
In 2008, Scripps Networks Interactive split from the E.W. Scripps Company and received its own listing on the NYSE as ticker symbol SNI. The year also saw Great American Country reach 50 million subscribers, with DIY Network reaching the 50 million subscriber mark in 2009.
Scripps Networks acquired a majority interest in the Travel Channel from Cox Communications for a reported $975 million [5] in late 2009, and the following year rebranded Fine Living Network as Cooking Channel.
On February 8, 2011, the company's headquarters facility in Knoxville was awarded the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold certification, established by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) and verified by the Green Building Certification Institute (GBCI).
In April 2011, Scripps announced the sale of Shopzilla to Symphony Technology Group for $165 million. Scripps, from within its Travel Channel unit also invested in Oyster.com, a hotel research and booking site.[6]
On August 15, 2011, Virgin Media agreed to sell its 50% stake in UKTV to Scripps Networks in a deal worth £339m. Scripps paid £239m in cash, and about £100m to acquire the outstanding preferred stock and debt owed by UKTV to Virgin Media.[7] Completion of the transaction was contingent on regulatory approvals in Ireland and Jersey, which was received on October 3, 2011.[8] Related to the transaction, Scripps Networks and BBC Worldwide are negotiating an agreement whereby, after completion, BBC Worldwide would have the option, via a combination of cash and a package of digital rights for UKTV, to increase its shareholding from 50 percent to a maximum of 60 percent. Scripps Networks' existing voting rights and board representation would be unaffected by this proposed arrangement, which would be subject to BBC Executive and BBC Trust approvals.
On March 22, 2012, Scripps Networks announced that it had agreed to pay £65m (US$102.7m) to acquire Travel Channel International Limited, the UK-based distributor of the Travel Channel brand across the Europe, Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific markets.[9] The deal was completed on May 1, 2012 following regulatory approval.[10] The international channel will be integrated with Scripps Networks' own Travel Channel.
On December 11, 2012 One Kings Lane, a home decor website, announced that Scripps Networks had invested in its Series D financing. Scripps Networks invested $15M in exchange for a 3% equity stake in the company.[11]
On June 5, 2013, Scripps Networks launched ulive, a digital-only lifestyle video brand that combines video content from Scripps Networks’ media brands with premium third-party videos and original series. Consisting of ulive.com, this premium video portal and distribution network expands on Scripps Networks’ food, home and travel verticals, adding coverage for topics including parenting and wellness.[12]

Company history[edit]
Scripps Networks Interactive's roots began in 1993, when the E. W. Scripps Company announced it would launch a 24-hour cable network in the fall of 1994. On December 30, 1994 HGTV went on the air to 6.5 million homes in 50 markets.
In 1995, the official opening for HGTV’s new headquarters in Knoxville took place. The network reached into 10 million homes on November 1 of that year, launched in Canada and online with HGTV.com in 1996, and hit the 25 million subscriber mark in 1997.
Also in 1997, Scripps Networks added its second network with the acquisition of Food Network. The year also saw HGTV execute its first HGTV Dream Home Giveaway, which received more than 1.2 million entries from across the country. By 2011, the number of entries had grown to nearly 80 million.[4]
In 1999 Scripps launched DIY Network, described as the "go-to destination for rip-up, knock-out home improvement television." With three brands now under the Scripps Networks umbrella, a $12 million addition was made to the company’s headquarters in Knoxville to provide the infrastructure and technology to support the networks’ growth.
Both HGTV (in November 2002) and Food Network (in September 2003) reached full distribution[clarification needed] with 80 million subscribers apiece, while Food Network followed HGTV’s footprint into Canada by launching Food Network Canada at the end of 2002.
The first half of the decade also saw Scripps Networks add its fourth and fifth networks to its mix, Fine Living Network (2002) and Great American Country (2004). A few months after the acquisition of Great American Country, Scripps Networks announced the move of the network’s headquarters from Denver, Colorado to Nashville, Tennessee.
In 2008, Scripps Networks Interactive split from the E.W. Scripps Company and received its own listing on the NYSE as ticker symbol SNI. The year also saw Great American Country reach 50 million subscribers, with DIY Network reaching the 50 million subscriber mark in 2009.
Scripps Networks acquired a majority interest in the Travel Channel from Cox Communications for a reported $975 million [5] in late 2009, and the following year rebranded Fine Living Network as Cooking Channel.
On February 8, 2011, the company's headquarters facility in Knoxville was awarded the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold certification, established by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) and verified by the Green Building Certification Institute (GBCI).
In April 2011, Scripps announced the sale of Shopzilla to Symphony Technology Group for $165 million. Scripps, from within its Travel Channel unit also invested in Oyster.com, a hotel research and booking site.[6]
On August 15, 2011, Virgin Media agreed to sell its 50% stake in UKTV to Scripps Networks in a deal worth £339m. Scripps paid £239m in cash, and about £100m to acquire the outstanding preferred stock and debt owed by UKTV to Virgin Media.[7] Completion of the transaction was contingent on regulatory approvals in Ireland and Jersey, which was received on October 3, 2011.[8] Related to the transaction, Scripps Networks and BBC Worldwide are negotiating an agreement whereby, after completion, BBC Worldwide would have the option, via a combination of cash and a package of digital rights for UKTV, to increase its shareholding from 50 percent to a maximum of 60 percent. Scripps Networks' existing voting rights and board representation would be unaffected by this proposed arrangement, which would be subject to BBC Executive and BBC Trust approvals.
On March 22, 2012, Scripps Networks announced that it had agreed to pay £65m (US$102.7m) to acquire Travel Channel International Limited, the UK-based distributor of the Travel Channel brand across the Europe, Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific markets.[9] The deal was completed on May 1, 2012 following regulatory approval.[10] The international channel will be integrated with Scripps Networks' own Travel Channel.
On December 11, 2012 One Kings Lane, a home decor website, announced that Scripps Networks had invested in its Series D financing. Scripps Networks invested $15M in exchange for a 3% equity stake in the company.[11]
On June 5, 2013, Scripps Networks launched ulive, a digital-only lifestyle video brand that combines video content from Scripps Networks’ media brands with premium third-party videos and original series. Consisting of ulive.com, this premium video portal and distribution network expands on Scripps Networks’ food, home and travel verticals, adding coverage for topics including parenting and wellness.[12]
Scripps Networks Interactive[edit]
Scripps Networks has launched Food Network in the United Kingdom and other European markets as well as in the Middle East and Africa. The company recently acquired a 50 percent interest in UKTV, one of the U.K. leading multi-channel television programming companies. Scripps Networks is also preparing to launch Food Network in Indonesia, bringing the channel to five countries in Asia in one year’s time. Scripps Networks' channels are also available through outlets on U.S. military bases and U.S. embassies around the world via the American Forces Network.
In May 2013, the company announced that it will open a Brazilian headquarters, in São Paulo,[13] and has appointed the former vice-president of strategy of FOX as managing director.[14] Scripps Networks will broadcast its channels to the entire Latin America region.[13]
On 2 July 2015 SNI finalized acquisition of 100% stake in N-Vision company which has 52.7% stake in Polish television group TVN.[15] The TVN group broadcasts 12 channels in Poland, including: TVN, TVN24 and TVN24 Biznes I Świat.

Shares of Scripps gain, Discovery stock slumps after reports that Viacom is out as potential buyer
Shares of Scripps Networks Interactive Inc.  were up more than 3% in premarket trade on Thursday, while Discovery Communication Inc.  shares fell more than 2% following media reports Wednesday evening that Viacom Inc.  is no longer in the hunt to acquire Scripps. That makes Discovery the leading contender for a potential deal to buy Scripps. According to a report in Variety, Viacom had made an all-cash bid for Scripps, which would have likely knocked the company to junk status. Shares of Viacom were inactive in premarket trade. Scripps shares have gained nearly 18% in the year to date, while shares of Discovery are down 3% and the S&P 500 index  is up nearly 11% in the year.

Potential Scripps Networks, Discovery merger could be coming at just the right time, analyst says
Shares of Scripps Networks Interactive Inc.  were up 14% during intraday trade on Wednesday, after a Wall Street Journal report Tuesday night that the media company was in talks to merge with Discovery Communications Inc. . Shares of Discovery were up nearly 4%. The potential tie-up not only makes sense, but could be coming at just the right time, according to MKM Partners analyst Eric Handler. A Scripps acquisition would give Discovery increased relevance and scale, and would be beneficial to Scripps shareholders, Handler wrote in a note to investors. "The possible acquisition of Scripps should prove beneficial for Discovery, and create a company with revenue of roughly $10.5 billion and EBITDA of more than $4 billion," Handler wrote. "The timing of this potential transaction could be coming at a good time for Scripps, which is seeing erosion in its ratings trends, especially with HGTV, while investment spending for new initiatives remains elevated." Shares of Discovery are down nearly 2% in the year to date, while Scripps shares have gained more than 16% in the year and the S&P 500 index  has gained more than 10%.

Scripps Networks stock upgraded to overweight at J.P. Morgan after Q1 earnings report
Analysts at J.P. Morgan upgraded shares of Scripps Networks Interactive Inc.'s  to overweight from neutral following the media networks first-quarter earnings report after the bell on Thursday. The stock was upgraded after a pullback in shares, strong commentary on advertising revenue thanks to higher demand and improving ratings at HGTV and the company's recent deal with Hulu to be included in the streaming platform's live TV service. Scripps Networks' domestic ad revenue increased 5.1% during the first quarter. Additionally, J.P. Morgan analysts expect elevated distribution revenue growth to continue with most of Scripps Networks affiliate agreements renewed. In the first quarter, domestic affiliate revenue rose 4.5%. "Scripps Networks Interactive continues to outperform most of its peers in ratings and advertising growth driven by the ongoing attractiveness of its lifestyle programming, which continues to have above-average live viewership and engagement and therefore commands high [cost per impression]," lead analyst Alexia Quadrani wrote in a note to clients. Scripps Networks reported per-share earnings of 1.53, compared with 1.37 per share in the year earlier period and above FactSet's consensus of 1.19. Revenue during the first quarter hit $855 million, up from $817 million a year ago, but shy of FactSet's $857 estimate. Shares of Scripps Network have declined 1.6% in the year to date, but are up 11.3% in the last 12 months. By comparison, the S&P 500 index  is up 6.7% in the year and 16.5% in the prior 12-month period.

Hulu launches live TV platform and adds channels from HGTV-owner Scripps Networks
TV streaming platform Hulu, jointly owned by Walt Disney Co. , 21st Century Fox Inc. , Comcast Corp.  and Time Warner Inc. , said during its advertising Upfront on Wednesday it's launching its live TV service and at the same time adding channels from Scripps Networks Interactive Inc.  to the service. Hulu Chief Executive Mike Hopkins said during the company's presentation in New York that the deal with Scripps gives Hulu live and on-demand access to the HGTV, Food Network and Travel Channel when Hulu's live streaming service launches in beta on Wednesday. Scripps joins Fox, Disney, NBCUniversal, CBS, Turner Networks and A&E Networks in providing channels to Hulu's live service. Live TV streaming platforms have increasingly become a focus in the landscape with companies competing to meet viewers where they are by giving them the content they want most -- live TV has been the last bastion of broadcast and cable TV. Hulu's live TV service, at $40 per month, joins offerings like Sling TV from Dish Network Corp. , DirecTV Now from AT&T Inc.  and even Google Inc.'s  YouTube TV.

Company history[edit]
Scripps Networks Interactive's roots began in 1993, when the E. W. Scripps Company announced it would launch a 24-hour cable network in the fall of 1994. On December 30, 1994 HGTV went on the air to 6.5 million homes in 50 markets.
In 1995, the official opening for HGTV’s new headquarters in Knoxville took place. The network reached into 10 million homes on November 1 of that year, launched in Canada and online with HGTV.com in 1996, and hit the 25 million subscriber mark in 1997.
Also in 1997, Scripps Networks added its second network with the acquisition of Food Network. The year also saw HGTV execute its first HGTV Dream Home Giveaway, which received more than 1.2 million entries from across the country. By 2011, the number of entries had grown to nearly 80 million.[4]
In 1999 Scripps launched DIY Network, described as the "go-to destination for rip-up, knock-out home improvement television." With three brands now under the Scripps Networks umbrella, a $12 million addition was made to the company’s headquarters in Knoxville to provide the infrastructure and technology to support the networks’ growth.
Both HGTV (in November 2002) and Food Network (in September 2003) reached full distribution[clarification needed] with 80 million subscribers apiece, while Food Network followed HGTV’s footprint into Canada by launching Food Network Canada at the end of 2002.
The first half of the decade also saw Scripps Networks add its fourth and fifth networks to its mix, Fine Living Network (2002) and Great American Country (2004). A few months after the acquisition of Great American Country, Scripps Networks announced the move of the network’s headquarters from Denver, Colorado to Nashville, Tennessee.
In 2008, Scripps Networks Interactive split from the E.W. Scripps Company and received its own listing on the NYSE as ticker symbol SNI. The year also saw Great American Country reach 50 million subscribers, with DIY Network reaching the 50 million subscriber mark in 2009.
Scripps Networks acquired a majority interest in the Travel Channel from Cox Communications for a reported $975 million [5] in late 2009, and the following year rebranded Fine Living Network as Cooking Channel.
On February 8, 2011, the company's headquarters facility in Knoxville was awarded the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold certification, established by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) and verified by the Green Building Certification Institute (GBCI).
In April 2011, Scripps announced the sale of Shopzilla to Symphony Technology Group for $165 million. Scripps, from within its Travel Channel unit also invested in Oyster.com, a hotel research and booking site.[6]
On August 15, 2011, Virgin Media agreed to sell its 50% stake in UKTV to Scripps Networks in a deal worth £339m. Scripps paid £239m in cash, and about £100m to acquire the outstanding preferred stock and debt owed by UKTV to Virgin Media.[7] Completion of the transaction was contingent on regulatory approvals in Ireland and Jersey, which was received on October 3, 2011.[8] Related to the transaction, Scripps Networks and BBC Worldwide are negotiating an agreement whereby, after completion, BBC Worldwide would have the option, via a combination of cash and a package of digital rights for UKTV, to increase its shareholding from 50 percent to a maximum of 60 percent. Scripps Networks' existing voting rights and board representation would be unaffected by this proposed arrangement, which would be subject to BBC Executive and BBC Trust approvals.
On March 22, 2012, Scripps Networks announced that it had agreed to pay £65m (US$102.7m) to acquire Travel Channel International Limited, the UK-based distributor of the Travel Channel brand across the Europe, Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific markets.[9] The deal was completed on May 1, 2012 following regulatory approval.[10] The international channel will be integrated with Scripps Networks' own Travel Channel.
On December 11, 2012 One Kings Lane, a home decor website, announced that Scripps Networks had invested in its Series D financing. Scripps Networks invested $15M in exchange for a 3% equity stake in the company.[11]
On June 5, 2013, Scripps Networks launched ulive, a digital-only lifestyle video brand that combines video content from Scripps Networks’ media brands with premium third-party videos and original series. Consisting of ulive.com, this premium video portal and distribution network expands on Scripps Networks’ food, home and travel verticals, adding coverage for topics including parenting and wellness.[12]
Scripps Networks Interactive[edit]
Scripps Networks has launched Food Network in the United Kingdom and other European markets as well as in the Middle East and Africa. The company recently acquired a 50 percent interest in UKTV, one of the U.K. leading multi-channel television programming companies. Scripps Networks is also preparing to launch Food Network in Indonesia, bringing the channel to five countries in Asia in one year’s time. Scripps Networks' channels are also available through outlets on U.S. military bases and U.S. embassies around the world via the American Forces Network.
In May 2013, the company announced that it will open a Brazilian headquarters, in São Paulo,[13] and has appointed the former vice-president of strategy of FOX as managing director.[14] Scripps Networks will broadcast its channels to the entire Latin America region.[13]
On 2 July 2015 SNI finalized acquisition of 100% stake in N-Vision company which has 52.7% stake in Polish television group TVN.[15] The TVN group broadcasts 12 channels in Poland, including: TVN, TVN24 and TVN24 Biznes I Świat.
