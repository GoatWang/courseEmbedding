About KemPharm, Inc.







































Company
KemPharm is a clinical-stage specialty  pharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of proprietary  prodrugs that are designed to be improved versions of widely prescribed,  approved drugs. 
We employ our Ligand Activated Therapy (LAT™) platform technology to create new molecular entity (NME) prodrugs in order to improve one or more of the attributes of approved drugs, such as susceptibility to abuse, bioavailability and safety.  We create NME prodrugs by chemically attaching one or more molecules, or ligands, to an FDA-approved parent drug. When combined with the parent drug, our ligands create prodrugs designed to have improved drug attributes while maintaining efficacy equivalent to the parent drug. Once administered, targeted human metabolic processes, such as those in the GI tract, separate the ligand from the prodrug and release the parent drug, which can then exert its therapeutic effect.
KemPharm has employed its LAT™ prodrug platform to create a diverse pipeline of prodrug therapeutics that target large market opportunities in pain, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and other central nervous system indications.  
KemPharm’s co-lead clinical development candidates are KP415, an extended-release (ER) prodrug of methylphenidate (MPH) for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and KP201/IR, an acetaminophen (APAP)-free formulation of our immediate release (IR) abuse deterrent hydrocodone product, KP201. In addition, KemPharm is rapidly advancing the development of KP484, a super-extended release (SER) methlyphenidate prodrug  for the treatment of ADHD, while continuing its development of KP511, an NME prodrug of hydromorphone designed to be abuse-deterrent.  KemPharm is developing KP511 in both extended release (ER) and immediate release (IR) formulations.

KemPharm, Inc. Announces Two Significant Advances Involving its prodrug Development Pipeline for the Treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder
Jun 28 17
KemPharm, Inc. announced two significant advances involving its prodrug development pipeline for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). These advances include the development of a new prodrug product candidate of d-threbo-methylphenidate (d-MPH), KP484, for ADHD indications that may benefit from a super-extended duration of treatment and the successful completion of an End-of-Phase 1 (EOP1) meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for KP415. KP484 is the company’s newly developed prodrug product candidate for a super-extended release (SER) d-MPH being designed for the treatment of ADHD in patients that respond best when a long duration of therapy beyond both KP415 and all current methylphenidate treatments is required. The new therapeutic application was developed during a data analysis of the KP415 Phase 1 study, in which the company observed that the prodrug molecule demonstrated an ability to produce a longer duration release of d-MPH relative to comparator products available on the market today. As a result, the company is now planning to initiate development of KP484 and anticipates filing an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for KP484 as early as the third quarter of 2017. The company expects to leverage data from certain clinical and nonclinical trials of KP415 to expedite the development of KP484. The company believes that this may enable it to realize key cost and R&D efficiencies and target a New Drug Application (NDA) submission as soon as 2019. KP415 is the company’s extended release (ER) d-MPH prodrug product candidate designed for the treatment of ADHD with patients that could benefit from both earlier onset as well as better total duration of effect. As previously indicated, The company held an EOP1 meeting with the FDA to discuss the data from the Phase 1 proof-of-concept clinical trial of KP415 (KP415.101), additional nonclinical and manufacturing data sets, and the proposed clinical and nonclinical programs required for eventual submission of an NDA for KP415. Additionally, the company and the FDA discussed the proposed commercial formulation of KP415, which the company plans to develop with a layer of methylphenidate to potentially support a superior early onset profile. Based on the feedback from the FDA, the company believes that its ongoing and anticipated research of KP415, including the pivotal efficacy trial, which the company plans to initiate in the second half of 2017, remains on schedule and in alignment with an NDA submission as soon as late 2018. The company also anticipates that it will initiate a human abuse liability (HAL) program of KP415 beginning in the second half of 2017 to assess the potential for the prodrug to deter intranasal, intravenous and oral abuse. The company expects data from the HAL program and the ongoing pharmacokinetic (PK) studies will be available in the second half of 2017 and early 2018. The company plans to utilize the data from both studies in the development KP484, as well.

KemPharm Strengthens ADHD Prodrug Pipeline with Development of KP484, A New, Super-Extended Release ADHD Methylphenidate Product Candidate




















June 28, 2017 07:30 ET

 | Source: KemPharm






KP415 End-of-Phase 1 Meeting with FDA Affirms KemPharm’s Development Plan and Potential NDA Submission as early as late 2018 Conference Call and Live Audio Webcast with Slide Presentation Scheduled for Today at 4:30 p.m. ET CORALVILLE, Iowa, June  28, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- KemPharm, Inc. (NASDAQ:KMPH), a clinical-stage specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of proprietary prodrugs, today announced two significant advances involving its prodrug development pipeline for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).  These advances include the development of a new prodrug product candidate of d-threo-methylphenidate (d-MPH), KP484, for ADHD indications that may benefit from a super-extended duration of treatment and the successful completion of an End-of-Phase 1 (EOP1) meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for KP415. KP484 – Prodrug of d-MPH for Super-Extended Duration Treatment of ADHDKP484 is KemPharm’s newly developed prodrug product candidate for a super-extended release (SER) d-MPH being designed for the treatment of ADHD in patients that respond best when a long duration of therapy beyond both KP415 and all current methylphenidate treatments is required.  The new therapeutic application was developed during a data analysis of the KP415 Phase 1 study, in which KemPharm observed that the prodrug molecule demonstrated an ability to produce a longer duration release of d-MPH relative to comparator products available on the market today.  As a result, KemPharm is now planning to initiate development of KP484 and anticipates filing an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for KP484 as early as the third quarter of 2017.  KemPharm expects to leverage data from certain clinical and nonclinical trials of KP415 to expedite the development of KP484. KemPharm believes that this may enable it to realize key cost and R&D efficiencies and target a New Drug Application (NDA) submission as soon as 2019. KP415 – Prodrug of d-MPH for Treatment of ADHD with Early On-set and Better Total DurationKP415 is KemPharm’s extended release (ER) d-MPH prodrug product candidate designed for the treatment of ADHD with patients that could benefit from both earlier onset as well as better total duration of effect.  As previously indicated, KemPharm held an EOP1 meeting with the FDA to discuss the data from the Phase 1 proof-of-concept clinical trial of KP415 (KP415.101), additional nonclinical and manufacturing data sets, and the proposed clinical and nonclinical programs required for eventual submission of an NDA for KP415.  Additionally, KemPharm and the FDA discussed the proposed commercial formulation of KP415, which KemPharm plans to develop with a layer of methylphenidate to potentially support a superior early onset profile.  Based on the feedback from the FDA, KemPharm believes that its ongoing and anticipated research of KP415, including the pivotal efficacy trial, which KemPharm plans to initiate in the second half of 2017, remains on schedule and in alignment with an NDA submission as soon as late 2018.  KemPharm also anticipates that it will initiate a human abuse liability (HAL) program of KP415 beginning in the second half of 2017 to assess the potential for the prodrug to deter intranasal, intravenous and oral abuse.  KemPharm expects data from the HAL program and the ongoing pharmacokinetic (PK) studies will be available in the second half of 2017 and early 2018.  KemPharm plans to utilize the data from both studies in the development KP484, as well. “We now believe KemPharm’s ADHD prodrug portfolio is the company’s most valuable asset. In our view, the advances that we have made with KP415 and our newly developed product candidate for a super extended treatment, KP484, further support this belief,” stated Travis C. Mickle, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of KemPharm.  “We continue to view KP415 as our highest value product candidate, and we are excited to now take this prodrug to the next phase of its development. Since our quarterly update in May, we have initiated several pharmacokinetic studies of KP415 with data from these studies expected during the second half of 2017 and in early 2018. Now, following the End-of-Phase 1 meeting with the FDA, we are prepared to develop the commercial formulation of KP415 and initiate the pivotal efficacy study and human abuse liability program for KP415 in the second half of 2017; all pointing towards an NDA submission for KP415 as soon as late 2018.” “The success of our KP415 program is now heightened by the development of a new product we are designating as KP484, which we are planning to develop for patients that require a product that provides a much longer duration of treatment for their ADHD,” Dr. Mickle continued.  “In contrast to Shire’s recently approved amphetamine-based MYDAYISTM for extended duration of treatment for ADHD, initial clinical data on KP484 suggest our new methylphenidate product could offer substantially longer duration when compared to other methylphenidate ADHD drugs which is clearly an unmet need in treatment with methylphenidate. Given this, we have now activated the development program for KP484 with our first milestone being an IND filing in the third quarter.” “We believe physicians need products, such as KP415 and KP484, which are designed to provide solutions for their patients’ individual needs, recognizing that many may respond differently to different treatments.  Thus, it is important for patients to have multiple treatment options,” Dr. Mickle concluded.  “For example, some patients need milder therapies such as a methylphenidate-based option that may be just as effective and have fewer side effects when compared to amphetamine-based products.” Conference Call Information: The company will host a conference call and live audio webcast with slide presentation today, June 28, 2017, at 4:30 p.m. ET.  Interested participants and investors may access the conference call by dialing either: (866) 395-2480 (U.S.)(678) 509-7538 (international)Conference ID: 45888929 The live webcast with accompanying slides will be accessible via the Investor Relations section of the KemPharm website http://investors.kempharm.com/.  An archive of the webcast and presentation will remain available following the call.
