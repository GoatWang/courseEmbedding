North Dakota Gas Production, Producing Wells Break Records set Last Month

1,854 MMcf/d produced in May
The North Dakota Industrial Commission released its latest Oil and Gas Production Report today, outlining hydrocarbon activity in the state for May 2017.
13,876 wells producing
The NDIC reported that oil production fell in May, averaging 1,040 MBOPD. This is down slightly from the 1,050 MBOPD produced in North Dakota in April. 95% of all oil produced in May came from the Bakken and Three Forks, while only 5% was produced from legacy pools.
The number of producing wells in North Dakota continues to grow, reaching 13,876 in May. This is a new all-time high, and marks the third month in a row that the number of producing wells in the state has reached record highs.
Gas production setting records, portion flared decreases
Gas production has also broken an all-time high set last month, with 1,854 MMcf/d produced in May. This surpasses April’s record of 1,836 MMcf/d. Despite the increasing gas production, the percentage of gas flared in May decreased slightly to 10.1%. Additional gas gathering systems in a portion of the Williston basin have been approved, meaning this percentage may decrease in the future. According to the NDIC, the all-time high flared percent was 36% in late 2011.
Permitting activity is up, with 109 drilling permits, compared to 58 permits in April and 100 in May. Similarly, statewide rig count is up slightly, from 50 in April to 58 today. 99% of all drilling now targets the Bakken and Three Forks formations. The NDIC reports that the utilization for rigs capable of 20,000+ feet remains 30-35%. Well completions increased slightly from 53 in April to 58 in May, despite 16 days with wind speeds too high for completion work.
The NDIC estimates that there were 830 wells waiting on completion in North Dakota at the end of May, which is the same number as were waiting on completion at the end of April.
Williston producers coming to EnerCom’s The Oil & Gas Conference® 22
North Dakota represents a significant portion of the Williston basin and a number of oil and gas companies with Williston basin operations and assets will be presenting at the upcoming EnerCom conference Aug. 13-17, 2017 in Denver.

09:00 07 Jul 2017






The company's oil and gas assets are all located offshore of Western Australia.


 

Cash increased by $1.9 million from last quarter








Carnarvon Petroleum Ltd (ASX:CVN) has ended the June quarter and will consequently enter the September quarter with a cash balance of $53 million.

	During the June quarter, Carnarvon and its joint venture partner advanced multiple work streams in the Phoenix project located offshore from Western Australia.

	Of particular note was the work in preparing for drilling the Phoenix South-3 and Dorado-1 wells, development planning for the Roc field and prospect mapping over the greater Phoenix area, using the partnership’s extensive seismic database.

	The Phoenix South-3 well is expected to commence in early 2018 with the Phoenix South-2 insurance claim expected to fund most of the cost.

	The operator, Quadrant Energy, is in the final stages of evaluating tenders for a semisubmersible rig with a contract expected to be signed shortly.


Project portfolio

	Carnarvon holds 12 permits across 5 projects all based off-shore from northern Western Australia.

	Details of the five projects includes:

	- Phoenix: 4 permits with 20% interest in 2 and 30% interest in 2, operated by Quadrant Energy;
	- Labyrinth: 1 permit with 100% interest;
	- Buffalo: 1 permit with 100% interest;
	- Maracas: 1 permit with 100% interest;
	- Outtrim: 1 permit with 28.5% interest, operated by Quadrant Energy; and
	- Cerberus: 4 permits with 100% interest.


Phoenix Project

	The Phoenix South-3 well, a redrill of the Phoenix South-2 well, is being designed to test the Caley interval.

	The structure is estimated to contain a gross mean recoverable prospective resource of 489 billion cubic feet of gas and 57 million barrels of associated condensate.

	The Caley interval is also the primary target for the Dorado-1 well which Carnarvon is expecting to commence in mid-2018.

	Development work around the discovered gas at Roc was progressed and the joint venture has commenced pre-FEED (Front End Engineering and Design) work aimed at determining the most robust concept for developing both the known hydrocarbons and potential future discoveries.


Labyrinth Project

	Carnarvon has completed its interpretation of the newly reprocessed 2D seismic data and has identified a number of significant prospects.

	In particular, the Labyrinth and Mouse prospects which are estimated to contain circa 400 million barrels of recoverable oil each at the Pmean confidence level.

	Additionally, Carnarvon has identified numerous other high-graded prospects and leads estimated to contain over 1.5 billion barrels of recoverable prospective resource.


Buffalo Project

	More data at Buffalo has been collected and processed which has considerably improved the data quality, allowing clearer analysis of key intervals in and around the Buffalo oil field.

	As a result, Carnarvon has identified a potentially significant undrilled and unproduced area to the east of the original Buffalo development which was not previously identified.

	In addition, Carnarvon joined Northern Oil & Gas Pty Limited (NOGA) on a collaborative data sharing project.

	NOGA are the operator of production in the Laminaria oil field less than 10 kilometres from the Buffalo oil field.

	The collaboration is aiming to better understand the area and to de-risk potential development opportunities, including the option to bring the Buffalo field back into production.

Investor Relations

























	Northern Oil and Gas, Inc. (NYSE MKT: NOG) is the leading non-operator franchise in the core of the Bakken and Three Forks plays in the Williston Basin of North Dakota and Montana. The foundation of the Company’s success is the long-term relationships it has built in the Williston Basin with premier operators, landowners and minerals rights owners. Northern has targeted specific areas in the Williston Basin that offer the highest rates of return on oil drilling projects. The Company’s size and intimate knowledge of the region gives it an advantage in making quick decisions, which attracts vigorous deal flow. As a result, Northern is the established “go to” buyer of non-operated acreage in the Williston Basin.

Strategy 







Northern believes that the best way for it to generate long-term value is the continued capital allocation process that has been fine-tuned over the last several years seeing a high volume of acreage and well participation opportunities with which to make capital allocation decisions.  That capital allocation process follows a business model:

Acquire non-operated positions in high quality acreage about to be drilled, that provide for high internal rates of return on capital.
Partner with leading E&P operators with a successful track record in the Williston Basin, ensuring reliable performance and diversification of operational risk.
Maintain the financial flexibility, liquidity and discipline to deploy capital quickly where it will generate the highest rates of return.
Increase visible growth potential over the long-term, strengthening our ability to deliver on our commitments for decades to come.

 
This model has successfully grown production and proved reserves since inception.  Northern continues to evaluate and expand its acreage footprint and multi-year drilling inventory through selective, bolt-on acquisitions in areas identified by the Company as being prospective for the Bakken and Three Forks plays in the Williston Basin and that will generate high rates of return throughout commodity cycles. Leading operators recognize Northern as the “go to” buyer of non-operated positions in the Bakken oil play.

Williston Basin Overview 






7.4 Billion Barrels of Recoverable Oil
On April 30, 2013, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) released an updated oil and gas resource assessment for the Bakken Formation and a new assessment for the Three Forks Formation in North Dakota, South Dakota and Montana. The assessments found that the formations contain an estimated mean of 7.4 billion barrels of undiscovered, technically recoverable oil. The updated assessment for the Bakken and Three Forks represents a twofold increase over what has previously been thought.
The USGS assessment found that the Bakken Formation has an estimated mean oil resource of 3.65 billion barrels and the Three Forks Formation has an estimated mean resource of 3.73 BBO, for a total of 7.38 billion barrels, with a range of 4.42 (95 percent chance) to 11.43 BBO (5 percent chance). This assessment of both formations represents a significant increase over the estimated mean resource of 3.65 billion barrels of undiscovered oil in the Bakken Formation that was estimated in the 2008 assessment.
