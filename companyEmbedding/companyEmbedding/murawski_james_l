               Company: Clancy-gernon Funeral Homes Inc
Job Details
               Although the names and faces of the staff may have changed over the last 89 years, the dedication and quality service at Clancy-Gernon Funeral Homes has remained consistent throughout. In 1915, Thomas Morgan began his funeral business and was joined in 1928 by Michael "Bud" Clancy. Their business was located just south of the Kankakee Court House on the corner of Merchant and Harrison Streets in Kankakee. Together these two men were highly respected leaders in their profession.  In 1955, Richard "Dick" Clancy joined his father, Bud, in the family business. Bud and Dick Clancy saw their business grow and in 1963 they built the location at 1151 E. Court St. in Kankakee. In January 1972, tragedy struck the Clancy family with the sudden death of Dick Clancy, followed by the death of his father, Bud, five months later. The business was then operated by Bud's wife, Catherine, who was also a licensed funeral director. Tim Gernon joined his Aunt Catherine in 1972 and together they managed the business. 1986 marked the opening of the new Clancy Funeral Home in Bourbonnais. A mere two years later, Catherine Clancy passed away. That same year, they acquired Sexton Funeral Home in Manteno and Houk Funeral Home in St. Anne. Patty Clancy, Dick's daughter, joined her cousin Tim in the family business in 1990. This brings us to where we are today. In January of 2004, Hertz-Thoma Funeral Chapel was purchased by the Clancy-Gernon Funeral Homes. Hertz-Thoma has been a Kankakee funeral home since 1904 when it was started by Ben Hertz and later run by Gilbert Hertz. The Hertz-Thoma staff of Herb Hunn, manager; Joe Harvell, crematory manager, and Sara Beth Eaker, licensed funeral director have joined Tim Gernon, President; and Patty Clancy, Vice-President; Robert Gernon, Tim's son and licensed funeral director; Paul Tezak, licensed funeral director since 1973; Eric Mayo, licensed funeral director; Colleen Regnier, business manager; Glenn and Lynn Houk, St. Anne managers and former owners; Marlene Clancy; Lynn Sheehan; Charley Frame; and Kathy Goodrich to form the new Clancy-Gernon Funeral Homes staff. Services will be conducted in the finest facilities available in Kankakee County at the following locations: Clancy-Gernon Funeral Home at 295 Main St. NW in Bourbonnais; Clancy-Gernon-Hertz Funeral Home at 1480 W. Court St., in Kankakee; Clancy-Gernon-Houk Funeral Home at 214 W. Sheffield in St. Anne; and Clancy-Gernon Funeral Home at 291 N. Main St. in Manteno. Clancy-Gernon Funeral Homes continue to offer sincere and compassionate funeral service at affordable prices. These services include a wide range of funeral packages, cremation options, and pre-arrangement plans. At Clancy-Gernon Funeral Homes you will ALWAYS meet with a licensed funeral director whether you need their services immediately or are planning for the future. The diverse and experienced staff enables them to provide the premier funeral service for your family. They offer unique personalization of services, 24 hours/day availability, the only on-site crematory in the Kankakee County, and many other resources to best serve families in the community. Clancy-Gernon Funeral Homes continue to honor the tradition of generations past and respect the changes of the future.
