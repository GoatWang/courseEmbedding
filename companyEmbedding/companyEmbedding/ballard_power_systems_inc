Ballard Culture
Green Initiatives
Many people come to Ballard for the opportunity to advance green technology. It is at the heart of our vision - to be the leading global provider of innovative clean energy solutions. Fuel cells reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve local air quality, compared to the technologies they replace. That is something we are all proud of. By channeling employees' ideas to help reduce Ballard’s environmental footprint, we have implemented a number of green initiatives internally and we’re always open to new ideas.
Innovation Sessions
We participate in Challenge Solving Innovation Sessions (CSIS) where we set time aside to work on problems and look for solutions that drive strategic innovation. In some places it might be called a Hackathon. These innovation sessions were started in our R&D group a few years ago and have since grown across the organization. Twice a year, cross-functional teams from different departments compete to present and implement their new ideas. 

Community Involvement
At Ballard, we believe in giving back to the communities we work and live in. Each year we work closely with specific charities in our local communities to raise money and awareness through a combination of fund raising activities and volunteering.

Play
We are a hardworking group and sometimes it’s nice to take a break and have some fun together. We are involved in a number of activities throughout the year, including holiday celebrations, skating parties, soccer tournaments, ski trips, golf tournaments and we’re always open to ideas for something new.

                        About Us
                    


Ballard Power Systems, Inc. is a global leader in PEM (proton exchange membrane) fuel cell technology. We provide clean energy fuel cell products enabling optimized power systems for a range of applications. Ballard offers smarter solutions for a clean energy future. We are actively putting fuel cells to work in high-value commercial uses every day. In fact, Ballard has designed and shipped close to 150 MW of hydrogen fuel cell technology to date.






Current Business Focus                    


Current Business Focus
Ballard has a multi-market growth focus in fuel cell products. This drives greater revenue and margin potential, while lowering risk for all stakeholders. Fuel cell applications are expected to broaden in the mid-term, although our focus today remains sharply on commercial opportunities in backup power, distributed generation, material handling and bus applications

Backup Power - Fuel cells provide a highly reliable and cost-competitive power source for backup power in wireless telecom networks worldwide.
Distributed Generation – Fuel cells can take advantage of low-cost hydrogen streams from chemical and bio-gas production to generate power locally for onsite use or sale back to the grid.
Material Handling - Fuel cell-powered material handling equipment improves productivity in high-throughput warehouses and distribution centers, creating a compelling return on investment.
Bus - Fuel cell buses are clean vehicles, emitting no greenhouse gas or particulates matters and operate to the highest standards from the perspective of drivers, passengers and transit agencies.







Corporate Transformation                    


Corporate Transformation
Ballard Power Systems, Inc. was founded in 1979, under the name 'Ballard Research Inc.', to conduct research and development on high-energy lithium batteries.  In the course of investigating environmentally clean energy systems with commercial potential, the Company began developing fuel cells in 1983. Over time Ballard entered into a number of strategic alliances related to fuel cell R&D, including an alliance with Daimler AG and Ford Motor Company. The company undertook a major corporate transformation from 2007 to 2009. Strategic focus shifted from long-term, high cost automotive fuel cell R&D technology development to clean energy fuel cell products for near-term commercial markets.





                        Our Advantage
                    





At the heart of each Ballard PEM (proton exchange membrane) fuel cell product lies a stack of unit cells based on our proprietary technology, for unsurpassed performance, durability and versatility. Ballard fuel cells can power a light bulb, a bus or even a city.Ballard draws on intellectual property from together with unmatched years of 'know-how' in key areas:

Fuel cell stack operation
System integration
Fuel processing

The fundamental knowledge enables optimization of fuel cell designs across a wide range of applications. In short, our fuel cell products deliver the required functionality at the right scale and lowest cost.
