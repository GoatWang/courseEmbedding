Happy Customers
"I just bought another can of Scotts Liquid Gold. Love the product and have for years. I happened to notice the "Proudly made for over 50 years in Denver CO USA". I can't tell you what a good feeling this gave me. I love supporting American made products, but it's nearly impossible these days. Thanking you."

How to Clean & Polish Stainless Steel
First spray the piece liberally with vinegar, then use a very soft cloth to wipe the vinegar off. This should remove any debris, dust and grime and begin to give the piece a bit of a shine. Next apply Scott’s Liquid Gold with a dry, soft cloth and polish. It won’t take long until your stainless steel looks as shiny as new.


How to Clean and Restore Luster to Wood Paneling
Even your biggest natural wood cleaning projects are made easy with the pourable version of Scott’s Liquid Gold Wood Care. Simply pour into a paint tray and saturate a roller (with a long handle) or sponge mop. Apply Scott’s evenly and thoroughly. You’ll clean, restore and protect wood panels with ease.




How to Dust Wooden Shelves
For light cleaning and dusting, spray the aerosol version of Scott’s Liquid Gold Wood Care on a cloth and gently wipe each shelf. Scott's Liquid Gold cleans away dust, dirt and grime, leaving only a lusturous shine behind.


How to Clean Hardwood Floors
Safely clean your beautiful hardwood floors and leave behind no residue, build-up or streaking. Mix ¼ cup of Scott’s Liquid Gold Wood Wash Concentrate with 1 gallon of warm water. Wring out the mop and clean your floors with the mixture – no rinsing required!



Faqs


Do any of the Scott's Liquid Gold products contain nuts?+

Though the fragrance in Scott's Liquid Gold Wood Care and Dust 'n Go is almond, neither contains any nuts or nut by-products.




What is naturally finished wood?+

It is wood that has been coated with a finish that allows the natural wood characteristic to show through. Varnish, shellac and lacquer are examples of natural finishes used on wood. Polyurethane is not a natural finish. Polyurethanes do not survive well in contact with most organic solvents. Scott's Liquid Gold is an organic oil formula that contains an organic solvent.




How can I tell what type of finish the wood has on it?+


Dampen a cotton ball with acetone-based nail polish remover.
Choose an inconspicuous test spot on the wood and dab it with the cotton ball.

If the cotton ball sticks or the finish softens, the finish is varnish, lacquer or shellac. If there is no effect, the finish is polyurethane.




Can Scott's Liquid Gold be used outdoors?+

Scott's Liquid Gold Wood Care provides the same protection outdoors where drying, bleaching, cracking and warping can be a real problem.
NOTE: We recommend the use of a UV inhibitor. Otherwise, prior sun damage may become very visible. Wood that has been exposed to excessive moisture may darken when Scott's Liquid Gold is used.




Does Scott's Liquid Gold contain silicone?+

Scott's Liquid Gold Wood Care contains no silicone.




How many square feet will Scott's Liquid Gold cover?+

Scott's Liquid Gold Wood Care will cover approximately 13 square feet per ounce of product.




Does Scott's Liquid Gold darken wood?+

Scott's Liquid Gold Wood Care contains no dyes but the oil penetrates into the pores of wood to restore lost moisture and color. This tends to darken the shade of the wood closer to its original state. Raw wood will sometimes darken 6 to 8 shades but will lighten over time between uses.




Where should I avoid using Scott's Liquid Gold?+

Scott's Liquid Gold Wood Care is not recommended for use on food preparation surfaces or eating utensils, paste wax or polyurethane finishes, brick, fireplaces, painted surfaces, photo finishes, veneer or laminated finishes, bleached or whitewashed wood, compressed or particle board, veneer, parquet flooring, marble or finishes that are deteriorated or damaged (if uncertain, spot test on a hidden area of the wood.)




Why can't I use Scott's Liquid Gold on items that have been finished with polyurethane?+

Polyurethanes do not survive well in contact with most organic solvents. Scott's Liquid Gold is an organic oil formula that contains an organic solvent, not to mention that applying oil-based products to polyurethane can make items oily and even slippery.




Can Scott's Liquid Gold be used to remove wax buildup?+

Scott's Liquid Gold Wood Care will remove light wax buildups. When applied to previously waxed furniture, the wax will soften, leaving a smeary, cloudy surface. Apply Scott's Liquid Gold liberally and let stand for several hours before wiping dry. Turn cloth repeatedly, to avoid spreading the softened wax. This process may need to be repeated several times before all of the old waxes are completely removed. When finished, the surface should look clean and feel slightly oily. Once the wax has been completely removed, Scott's Liquid Gold will penetrate the wood to restore lost moisture.
NOTE: If white circles develop you may need to refinish the wood. This occurs when products containing silicone were previously used. For faster results on extremely heavy wax buildups, use a commercial grade wax remover or talk with a wood professional about doing the job for you.




I remember my dad using Scott's Liquid Gold on metal tools. He said it kept them from rusting. What other ways can Scott's Liquid Gold be used?+

Over the years, we have heard the following ways that our consumers have discovered for using Scott's Liquid Gold Wood Care:

As a lubricant for squeaky hinges, household fans, bicycle chains, swivel chairs, nuts and bolts, sliding door tracks and garden hand tools
To clean and soften the leather on ball mitts and hiking boots, luggage, saddles, old/antique books and dashboards
To clean and prevent rust on metal and wood garden and farm hand tools

To clean and restore:

   Window screens, stained glass, unpainted wood or metal window blinds, metal tools
   Plexiglas™, metal or plastic office equipment (unpainted)
   Stickers from bumpers, window, appliances, etc.
   Stainless steel, silver, copper, chrome, wrought iron and brass items (wash thoroughly before using)
   Golf irons, gun stocks

Will Scott's Liquid Gold dissolve the grease buildup on my wood kitchen cabinets?+

Use Scott's Liquid Gold Wood Wash Ready-to-Use to remove grease and grime for kitchen cabinets. Follow with an application of Scott's Liquid Gold Wood Care.




Is Scott's Liquid Gold good for dusting furniture?+

Scott's Liquid Gold Wood Care is excellent for wood dusting and its unique organic oil formula actually repels dust, cutting down on cleaning time. Between applications of Scott's Liquid Gold Wood Care, use Scott's Liquid Gold Wood Wipes for quick dusting and wood polishing.




We use Scott's Liquid Gold products in our facility and I need an SDS sheet to keep on file. How can I obtain one?+

Simply scroll to the bottom of this page, click on Policies and MSDS to download our SDS sheets.




I have water spots on my favorite side table. How can I get rid of them?+

Dampen the spots with Scott's Liquid Gold Wood Care. Let stand for 1/2 hour. Use a very fine steel wool pad (0000) to lightly rub damaged areas going with the grain of the wood. Wipe clean with a soft cloth. Stubborn spots may require several tries and may sometimes require professional help.




There are light scratches on my woodwork. How do I make them go away?+

The scratches won't completely go away without sanding and refinishing. However, Scott's Liquid Gold Wood Care can help lessen the appearance of scratches and nicks. First apply Scott's Liquid Gold Wood Care to clean away dust, grime and dirt. Then, reapply liberally and allow to sit for 1/2 hour. Wipe surface dry. If the scratched area is large and the finish is broken to the bare wood, refinishing may be required for a permanent fix.




I inherited a beautiful dining table from my great aunt but it has a burn spot on it. Is there anything that can be done to fix it?+

Rub mayonnaise into the burn. Let it sit for one hour. Wipe clean with a soft cloth then apply Scott's Liquid Gold Wood Care. If the burn is deep, the entire surface may need to be refinished.




I accidentally washed the cloth that I used to apply Liquid Gold  with clothes that were in the washer. Now, everything smells like Scott's Liquid Gold. What can I do?+

This is a common occurrence. All you need to do is wash the clothes again but this time add about a cup of vinegar to the wash. The fragrance of Scott's Liquid Gold will be gone.




Someone set a hot pizza box on my wood dining table, leaving numerous white spots on it. Is there anything I can do to remove them?+

The moisture condensing under the hot cardboard made the polish that was on the table turn white. Try fixing it by rubbing a bit of white toothpaste on the spots with either your finger or a cloth. Rub with the grain until the wood gets warm. Then wipe with a slightly damp cloth and dry well. You may have to repeat this process several times. The spots will gradually begin to look less cloudy. Once the spots are gone, polish to finish.




Is Floor Restore a permanent finish?+

Scott's Liquid Gold Floor Restore is a permanent coating that can be used 3-4 times a year.




Does Floor Restore clean and shine floors?+

Scott's Liquid Gold Floor Restore is not a cleaner. You should clean and dry floors thoroughly prior to applying Floor Restore.




Is a spot test recommended prior to application of Floor Restore?+

To ensure compatibility with finish, test Floor Restore in an inconspicuous spot.




How many square feet will Floor Restore cover?+

The average coverage of Floor Restore is approximately 300 sq. feet.




What is the best way to apply Floor Restore?+

Doing one section at a time, apply Floor Restore directly on the floor and spread evenly with a clean, damp sponge mop.




How long should Floor Restore be allowed to dry before walking on the floor?+

Allow Floor Restore at least one hour to dry before walking on floors and eight hours before replacing rugs and furniture.




How do I care for my floors between applications of Floor Restore?+

Simply sweep and damp mop as needed.




How do I remove Floor Restore?+

A light sanding with a very fine grain sandpaper should do the trick.




Are there any surfaces on which Floor Restore should not be used?+

Do not use Floor Restore on unsealed, unfinished, waxed or oiled floors.




I want to place an order but I'd rather mail or fax it in than place it on your website. How can I do this?+

Simply select all items you wish to order on our web site and add each to the shopping cart in the quantities you desire. Then all you need to do is print the order form and mail or fax it to us at:

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
