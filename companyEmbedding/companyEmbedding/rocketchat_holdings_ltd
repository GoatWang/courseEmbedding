  Mobile Internet Conference (GMIC) 2015 in

  Reuters



  By Yimou Lee and Paul Carsten

  HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - Tencent Holdings Ltd is not only
  China's largest social network and online entertainment firm, it
  is now big in mobile payments too.

  It has quietly built one of the world's largest payments systems,
  with transactions which could total more than $500 billion this
  year, according to Reuters calculations.

  While most of Tencent's money still comes from online gaming, it
  has also developed a hit mobile messaging app called WeChat which
  had 697 million monthly active users at the end of December, up
  from 650 million at the end of September.

  And it is building new businesses on WeChat, including gaming,
  social advertising akin to Facebook Inc's , and mobile banking.
  Tencent does not disclose whether it is making money from its
  mobile payments business.





  However Tencent's fourth quarterly earnings report on Thursday,
  which showed overall revenue grew at its quickest rate in three
  years and beat analysts' estimates, also revealed how much it
  paid banks in fees for customers sending each other money via
  WeChat.

  These fees, which Tencent Chief Executive Pony Ma said amount to
  0.1 percent of each transaction, were more than 300 million yuan
  in January. That would mean such transactions on WeChat Payment
  totaled over 300 billion yuan ($46 billion) that month, according
  to Reuters calculations.

  And this figure does not include transactions for popular
  services such as paying for taxis, restaurants and online media
  like video games and music.

  If that pace continues for the rest of the year, Tencent will see
  at least 3.6 trillion yuan ($556 billion) transacted across
  WeChat Payment in 2016. That would make it almost twice as big as
  all of PayPal Holdings Inc's $282 billion in transactions in
  2015.

  WeChat Payment has also become a serious rival to Alibaba Group
  Holding Ltd , whose Alipay dominated online payments in China
  before WeChat Payment.

  Alipay had a total payment volume of $519 billion in 2013, the
  last year Alibaba or Alipay published such figures.

  As for Alipay's mobile payments, most similar to WeChat Payment,
  these were 900 billion yuan ($139 billion) in 2013, although
  Alipay has since grown, as smartphone use has spread in China. A
  spokeswoman for Ant Financial Services Group, the holding company
  for Alipay, declined to comment.

  Tencent's revenue for the three months through December grew 45
  percent from a year earlier to 30.4 billion yuan, topping the
  27.88 billion average forecast of 12 analysts polled by Reuters.

  The group's online advertising revenue more than doubled in the
  period to 5.7 billion yuan, while net income rose 22 percent to
  7.16 billion yuan, its slowest rate in three quarters.

Meet Zhang Xiaolong, the man behind WeChat 


 by @ronnierocket
Posted on October 11, 2014





There is a saying in Beijing that even if nothing interesting could be written about 99 percent of Beijing’s approximately 20 million people, there would still be 200,000 great stories remaining. 
Meet Zhang Xiaolong, Senior Vice President, Tencent Holdings Ltd.
Why he’s interesting: By all accounts a mild-mannered man from Hunan province, Zhang Xiaolong quietly started a revolution, developing a product that has help make his company, Tencent, one of China’s most important technology firms, and started people across the world talking and sharing pictures on their mobile devices, all for free: WeChat. Multi-lingual and cross-platform, WeChat has soared past rivals including Whatsapp and Apple’s iMessage. 
What he says: “When talking about development, most of us think of the technical side, but I say feelings are much more important, and most of us never pay any attention to them. There’s no girl you can take out on a date? The answer is definitely no, you just didn’t try asking any of them. At least you could buy a smartphone for less than RMB 1000 and then ‘Shake’ it.”
