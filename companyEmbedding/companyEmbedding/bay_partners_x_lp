The Rumors of My Death are Highly Exaggerated

Posted on June 1, 2014  by  admin 

Reply 


Once a week or more, we get a call from someone asking if Bay Partners is still going or if we’re retiring.   The answer is, we are not retiring and Bay is alive and well.  With major exits recently from Guidewire, Eloqua, Buddy Media, Zenprise, TeaLeaf and others, our funds are still growing strong and bringing in one of the top ROIs for our investors in the industry.  Our General Partner Neal Dempsey even made the Forbes Midas list with some of our portfolio liquidity events.  We have more to come too, so stay tuned.
At Bay, we continue to focus on early stage enterprise software companies, and enjoy meeting with entrepreneurs around the world.  We attend events where we can interact with entrepreneurs and learn about new innovations and what technologies might be of interest to us.  There’s still a lot of exciting things happening in Silicon Valley and we plan to be part of that buzz for a long time to come.
Check out our new web site here, which we think will give you some of the latest information about what we’re up to and the kinds of portfolio companies we’re managing these days.  But no matter what technology is hot right now or what the buzz of Silicon Valley is, we remain focused on the same thing that has driven us since our founding – exits.  Whatever that finish line may look like for our portfolio companies – an IPO, acquisition or sustained growth and expansion.  We’re here to guide companies to that finish line and help them live their dreams.
Bay is thriving, and we want your company to thrive too.  We will be posting some guiding principles for entrepreneurs here on our blog, and we want to hear from you too.  Tell us what lessons you’ve learned and we’ll share and compare notes.  Get in touch with us here, or follow our Twitter page @baypartnersnews.  We’re listening.

At Bay Partners, we focus on the finish line. We've helped over 250 companies go from start-up to successful liquidity, resulting in over $1 billion in exit returns.  Funding a company is one thing.  Bringing it to the perfect exit takes experience. We have been helping companies achieve gainful M&A and IPO transactions since 1976.  Our founders were pioneers in Silicon Valley, funding legendary companies like Informatica, Geoworks, Shiva and Brocade.

				Bay's latest two funds, Bay X and Bay XI, have produced some of the most successful returns in the industry, with 3 IPOs and 2 large M&A transactions in 2012 alone.  In fact, 2012 was a good year for Bay Partners. Neal Dempsey was included in the Forbes Midas List because of the firm's successful transactions, including Guidewire, Eloqua and Enphase.  In fact, the Wall Street Journal listed the Guidewire IPO as one of the most successful IPOs of the year.
				

				Choosing an investment isn't the hard part for a Venture Capital firm.  The hard part is guiding a company towards profitability and success.  Bay Partners was one of the first VC firms established in Silicon Valley and has been driving liquidity for almost 40 years.  Our experience in Silicon Valley is unmatched by any other firm, and we use our breadth and depth of industry knowledge to help companies grow, shift as needed and achieve market leadership.  We've experienced all kinds of obstacles and survived even the toughest of times with our portfolio companies.  Therefore, we know how to keep a company moving towards the finish line so they can ultimately feel the exhilaration of success.
