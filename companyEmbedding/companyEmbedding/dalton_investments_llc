            Dalton Investments LLC was established in 1999 in the state of California as the corporate vehicle for the investment management business of three partners: James Rosenwald, Steve Persky and Gifford Combs. Prior to the establishment of the firm, the three partners had informally worked and invested together from 1981 through 1998 and have known each other on a personal level for many years. Mr. Combs and Mr. Persky were classmates at Harvard College and Mr. Persky and Mr. Rosenwald met in 1970 as classmates at Dalton School from which the firm derives its name.
