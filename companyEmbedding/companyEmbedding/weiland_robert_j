From the web: Wieland obituary … Robert J. Wieland passed away on July 13, 2011.  Elder Wieland was a true Seventh-day Adventist who lived a long life of service and sacrifice to further the gospel.  To his ministry the Seventh-day Adventist church is deeply indebted.  The current and strengthening interest in the messages of Jones and Waggoner and deepening study into the message of Christ’s righteousness is to no small extent a result of the courageous work of Elder Wieland.  
In 1950, Elder Wieland and Elder Donald K. Short served as missionaries in Africa.  At that time they both stood as delegates to the General Conference held in San Francisco.  When a call was given for delegates to communicate their concerns or advice to the elected leadership, Robert Wieland had something to say.  With a deep soul burden of the work of God, he wrote a letter of concern about misunderstandings of the gospel that were infiltrating the church.  His colleague, Donald Short, assisted him with advice and much prayer.  Elder Short decided that he would also sign the letter, so Elder Wieland changed the pronouns and added the second name.   
The two missionaries were asked to stay in America for further review of their document and of their position in the church.  In the meantime, they prepared a more complete disclosure of their concern in a manuscript for church leadership that would be known as 1888 Re-Examined.   Ultimately, church leadership discerned that Elders Wieland and Short were being faithful to
their calling as Seventh-day Adventist pastors and missionaries.  The men were sent back to Africa to continue in service.  From that point on, the names Wieland and Short became inextricably linked together.  They were leaders in calling for the Seventh-day Adventist church to gain all the blessings God intended when He sent us the “most precious message” which was presented at the Minneapolis General Conference in 1888.  
In the providence of God, the 1888 Re-Examined manuscript passed from one person to another, stirring many minds.  Conscientious Seventh-day Adventists began to understand that the reason why Christ’s coming had been so long delayed was to be found in our failure to appropriate the blessings that were contained in messages God sent through Jones at Waggoner at Minneapolis.  Many church leaders, who felt good about the status quo in the denomination, worked to quell
and stifle the concerns.  Numerous books and responses to the 1888 Re-examined manuscript were written asserting that the “1888 Message” of Christ’s righteousness had already been widely accepted in the years since Minneapolis.  These claims rang hollow as the denomination descended into deeper division and controversy concerning the nature of the gospel itself.  
Wieland and Short, for their part, worked vigorously to bring to light the hundreds of testimonies Ellen White wrote with regard to the 1888 message.  They also worked to make the message available through publishing Jones’ and Waggoner’s books and sermons.  In addition, they demonstrated clearly how this message is supported throughout the Bible.   
The names “Wieland and Short” were synonymous with dedicated Seventh-day Adventists trying to reform the church when i was little in the 1960s-70s.  I thank God so much for their dedication and zeal in seeing that the 1888 Message did not fall to the ground, but was carried on to a new generation.  Personally i had a few email exchanges with him around 2004, as he strongly supported Jack Sequiera’s book “Beyond Belief”, which clearly is teaching universalism.  In his replies, he showed a strong leaning towards that view also, which i hope he repented of before his passing.  May i be as true and faithful to the cause of God as he was, and i hope to see him in heaven!

Thank you brother for bringing this up for discussion. I have read their publications for over three decades and I have come to the conclusion that they themselves were not able to decipher the 1888 message. This is what they themselves confessed, the first time in their first edition of The 1888 Message Re-Examined, pp.242,243 saying, “Many even in the world today are trying to discover the light which God revealed to His people in 1888. No one has so far been successful. Religious thinkers are yearning for something no one clearly understands, though it would seem that a few are on the verge of discovery.” 1950 
Then, in 1987, 37 years later, in their revised edition, on page 184, they again confessed that the message was still elusive to them: “It would seem that 1888 presents a problem unique in the long history of God’s confrontations with His people. There is a message involved therein that seems more elusive than any in the history of past ages.” 
Can you imagine that? Ellen White had declared that the message was just as simple as ABC but that we did not understand it. “The matter of salvation is just as simple as ABC but we don’t understand it.” Faith & Works, 64. (May 11, 1889)
In January of 1999, after many years of searching, the Lord opened the eyes of my understanding as to what constituted that message. It was then that I saw how simple it was and how we must receive it with the simple faith of a little child. Here is that message in a nutshell: 
“Present your case before God pleading the MERITS of the blood shed for you upon Calvary’s cross.” Faith & Works,106. Here is why: “The MERITS of Christ’s sacrifice are SUFFICIENT to present to the Father in our behalf.” Steps to Christ,36. 
“We shall come in repentance and contrition with a despairing sense of our own finite weakness and learn that we must DAILY APPLY to the MERITS of the blood of Christ that we may become vessels FIT for the Master’s use.” Faith and Works, 86.
Unless we do this daily, we cannot be saved.
“Unless he makes it his LIFE BUSINESS to BEHOLD the uplifted Saviour and to ACCEPT the MERITS which it is his PRIVILEGE to CLAIM, the sinner can no more be saved than Peter could walk upon the water unless he kept his eyes fixed steadily upon Jesus.” Testimonies to Ministers, 93.
The message was, indeed, clear and simple. It is our privilge to come to God just as we are, sinful, helpless dependent, claiming the merits of the Saviour. As we do this, we become one with Christ and we are clothed with His robe of righteousness which is made manifest in obedience to all the commandments of God. See Testimonies to Ministers, p.92,97, and Faith and Works, p.64,65.
This is the only true faith which leads to the keeping of all the commandments of God.
This is the message in a nutshell.
I did not find this message presented in clear and distinct lines in the publications of the 1888 Message Study Committee, simply because this message was elusave to them.
Reflecting on the message, Mrs. White wrote: “How long will you hate and despise the messengers of God’s righteousness. God has given them HIS MESSAGE. They bear the Word of the Lord: There is SALVATION (pardon and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit) for you but ONLY through the MERITS of Jesus Christ. The grace of the Holy Spirit has been offered to you again and again.” Testimonies to Ministers, 96,97.
“Looking unto Jesus and TRUSTING in His MERITS, we appropriate the blessings of light and joy and peace in the Holy Spirit.” Testimonies, Vol.5, 744
Thus she wrote, “The ONLY FAITH that will BENEFIT us is that which embraces Him as a personal Saviour: which APPROPRIATES His MERITS to ourselves.” Desire of Ages, 347.
As we daily appropriate the merits of Jesus by claiming them, Jesus places us close by His side, encircling us with His human arm while with His divine arm He grasps the throne of the Infinite. He places HIS OWN MERITS in the censor in our hands to encourage our petitions.
To conclude: “You cannot explain this faith that lays right hold upon the MERITS of the blood of a crucified and risen Saviour TO BRING Christ’s RIGHTEOUSNESS into your life. Clothed with the righteousness of Christ and not your own righteousness, you will not depend upon what you can do or what you will do,” for “Christ’s righteousness accomplishes everything.” Faith & Works,64,65,27.
The Lord used Wieland and Short to make me enquire about the 1888 message, so much so that it became my sole passion while taking theology in one or our universities in the early eighties.
I will always be thankful to Him for that.
God bless,
laval

Brother laval, pls review your theology. I was worrying when I read your statement “Unless we do this daily, we cannot be saved”. it seems that your you have a galatians’ mind.  I pray for you
peace be with you.  ruben

Thank you pastor Wieland.  Your sermons have been breath of fresh air  We need more pastors like Wieland to clean-up the tainted message coming from the pulpits of MOST Seventh-day Adventist churches

Six Questions With . . . Robert Wieland





Robert J. Wieland is a retired missionary and an ordained minister living in California. He has served the church in varying capacities for over 50 years. Born into a Lutheran home, he discovered the Sabbath truth while attending Sunday School at a Presbyterian church when he was in High School. After attending Southern Junior College for two years, he had to withdraw when he could not pay his tuition. He later went on to attend Washington Missionary College, and it was there that he discovered the beauty of the gospel by reading The Glad Tidings, by E. J. Waggoner. His love for these truths met with opposition, and he was told that there was no place “in the work” for him. As a result, he colporteured for a short time, with little success, and it was then that the General Conference publishing director helped him eventually find a position pastoring a small church. From there, he went on to become a missionary in Africa. In the 1950’s, he, along with Donald K. Short, first started to raise the General Conference’s consciousness about the church’s rejection of the message of Righteousness by Faith, as proclaimed by E. J. Waggoner and A. T. Jones at the 1888 General Conference in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Since then, Wieland and Short (who is now deceased) have continued to proclaim this message, ultimately publishing the book 1888 Re-Examined in 1987. In addition to this book, he has also published over 20 other books, including Corporate Repentance, In Search of the Cross, and Grace on Trial. Now 92, he is still as hopeful as ever that the Lord will return during his lifetime. 1. For the last 50+ years, you and the late Donald Short have been promoting the 1888 message and calling for a corporate repentance for the church's rejection of the message. What has changed since you first began? [I] must make [it] plain, DKS [Donald K. Short] and I do not "call for denominational repentance"; we have said that the Laodicean message describes our denominational history, and verse 19 is the Lord Jesus Himself calling for corporate and denominational repentance. Over a hundred times Ellen White has said that "we" in a corporate sense brought on our record denominationally the sin of "insulting" the Holy Spirit and rejecting Christ "just like the Jews" and the guilt "in a great degree" of withholding the message from our people and from the world. The prime issue: is this true? Arthur L White led the General Conference personnel to believe that as leadership, "we" accepted the message and we have it as our firm possession, and "we" have been proclaiming the Loud Cry message intact ever since. We are "in need of nothing." Has anything changed in half a century? Yes, thousands of people around the world have a rudimentary knowledge now of the significance of our SDA history. They can now pray intelligently and are better equipped to meet the issues of the last days. Anyone who wants to learn about the story of the latter rain and the loud cry beginning among us can find information readily available. 2. In what way(s) are many Adventists guilty of "Baal worship" today? Only unconsciously. But that was the case with the people also in the days of Elijah—apostasy had come on them gradually, and Elijah understood. Ellen White recognized that the rejection of the message in 1888 would make possible deception into a counterfeit. She recognized in Jones and Waggoner's message the fulfillment of the prophecy of the coming of Elijah: before the great and terrible day of the Lord. Baal worship is the subtle deception of the worship of self disguised as the worship of Christ. The widespread adulation of people and leaders is evidence. 3. What has been the general attitude toward you in the past few years among the church governing body? A sincere effort was made by a former General Conference president over a decade ago to investigate the 1888 history and message (the "Primacy of the Gospel Committee"). The chairman at first showed a keen interest and seemed to be understanding; then when the president had to resign, the opponents took over the committee. The original agreement was that if the committee should end in disagreement, both sides would make a report to be published by the General Conference. But only one was published. 4. According to your understanding, what is the main idea of the 1888 message that the church finds so repulsive? The ultimate answer: the idea of overcoming sin per se, and thus preparing to honor Christ at the close of probation. The 1888 idea of the cleansing of the sanctuary is misrepresented as the false doctrine of "perfectionism." 5. At this late stage in your life, do you think that Christ will return while you're still alive? I am in my 92nd year; I cherish the same faith in the nearness of the Lord's return as I held when I was baptized at the age of 12—I thought the Lord would come so soon that I would not be able to finish high school. This is what the Bible speaks of as "the blessed hope." I cherish it today. I understand that the Lord Jesus Himself wants to come; the ongoing misery in the world weighs on His heart, He longs to put an end to sin and cruelty. But He cannot act unilaterally because He has taken upon His sinless nature our sinful nature and has become forever one of the human race. The original dictum is still true, "it is not good that the man should be alone," and that applies to Jesus as the Son of God and now the Son of man. He must have "an help meet," a bride who can understand Him and sympathize with Him. It is she, not He, who has delayed "the marriage of the Lamb." The agenda before the church now is to grow up out of our spiritual infancy, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ, prepared to stand at His side as a bride stands at the side of her husband whom she has learned to know and to appreciate for what he is. She gives him her heart. In order for this development to take place it is necessary that the church learn to "comprehend" the length, breadth, depth, and height of the love (agape) of Christ. The latter rain and the loud cry are not emotional excitement, but a message, the ultimate one of Christ and Him crucified. The church at present does not comprehend what Christ accomplished by His sacrifice on the cross. The Sunday-keeping Evangelical understanding has gradually and unconsciously absorbed our attention. The "third angel's message in verity" will be Christ and Him crucified in its ultra high fidelity reality of truth. 6. Why hasn't Christ returned yet? The "most precious message" that "the Lord in His great mercy sent" to prepare a people for Christ's coming has been kept from the church and from the world "in a great degree." He dares not come until His people are ready; otherwise they would perish by the brightness of His coming. Be of good courage in the Lord. He will bless your work; let us trust Him. Even if He permits you to meet opposition. Hang on. Please keep me personally in the background as much as you can. The ultimate blessing to come on the church must not be of a personal nature. Self must forever be out of sight.

Thanks! A couple of papers  you might be interested in - "In search of the GUT (the Unpardonable Sin in the Light of the Gospel) and "Born Forgiven (the Unpardonable sin in the writings of ellen G. White). they were written by K. M. Duncan and E.D. Peters and were presented at Andrews university a couple of years ago. Good exploration of why people are lost in spite of the gospel's legal justification.

Righteousness by Faith is a wonderful Biblical truth unfortunately this message is being used to teach that obediance to the law of God won't affect our salvation. Lucifer's lie in Eden was that you can break Gods law and not surely die. This is the same lie being preached in the pulpits today.  While we are justified by our faith in Jesus Christ and his sacrifice we have the ability as free moral agents to turn away from Christ and choose evil.  Eternal life will be given to thoes who maintain their relationship with Christ by abiding in his love which is walking in his ways and keeping his commandments.  The 5 lies being used to destroy the Adventist church are.1) Sin is a condition and not a choice. 2)Sin can not be overcome while on this earth due to our sinful nature.  3) Christ had a special nature a special advantage over us.4) Salvation is by faith only...obediance to Gods Commandments are not necessary.5) All Future sins are already forgiven.  No final attonment.6) The Law was nailed to the cross.These lies have laid the foundation by the deciever to make void the Sabbath in the last days.

Great questions and great answers!  I believe that He is able to complete the work He has started in me and is able to present me faultless before presence of His glory - with exceeding joy Jude 24.This is the harvest time.  We are all maturing into the likeness of the master we have chosen.  At the time of the harvest all will be fully mature.Thank you for having a site that promotes the truth as it is in Jesus.

AUTHOR BIOGRAPHY:






Robert J. Wieland


Robert J. Wieland was a retired missionary and an ordained minister. He served the church in varying capacities for over 50 years.
Born into a Lutheran home, he discovered the Sabbath truth while attending Sunday School at a Presbyterian church when he was in High School. After attending Southern Junior College for two years, he had to withdraw when he could not pay his tuition. He later went on to attend Washington Missionary College, and it was there that he discovered the beauty of the gospel by reading The Glad Tidings, by E. J. Waggoner. His love for these truths met with opposition, and he was told that there was no place “in the work” for him. As a result, he colporteured for a short time, with little success, and it was then that the General Conference publishing director helped him eventually find a position pastoring a small church. From there, he went on to become a missionary in Africa.
In the 1950’s, he, along with Donald K. Short, first started to raise the General Conference’s consciousness about the church’s rejection of the message of Righteousness by Faith, as proclaimed by E. J. Waggoner and A. T. Jones at the 1888 General Conference in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Since then, Wieland and Short (who is now deceased) have continued to proclaim this message, ultimately publishing the book 1888 Re-Examined in 1987. In addition to this book, he has also published over 20 other books, including Corporate Repentance, In Search of the Cross, and Grace on Trial.
He passed away in 2011 at the age of 95.
