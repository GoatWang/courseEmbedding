Lindsay Chief Executive Officer, Rick Parod, Announces Intention to 
      Retire
























OMAHA, Neb., Feb 08, 2017 (BUSINESS WIRE) --
Lindsay Corporation                 

/quotes/zigman/232307/composite LNN
-2.08%


, a leading provider of irrigation 
      systems and infrastructure products, announced today that its president 
      and chief executive officer, Rick Parod, 63, has informed the Board of 
      Directors of his intention to retire on December 1, 2017 to spend time 
      with his family, travel and pursue other interests.


                                        








“I am extremely proud to have been a part of the Lindsay Corporation 
      family for nearly 17 years. We have a wonderful team of dedicated people 
      throughout our global organization who exemplify our core values and 
      work hard to provide valuable services to our customers and value for 
      our shareholders. Lindsay has a very bright future and is poised for 
      continued, profitable growth,” said Parod.


                                        








Chairman of the Board Michael Nahl commented, “Rick Parod has been a 
      tremendous leader for Lindsay. Under his leadership, Lindsay has grown 
      from a single plant generating approximately $100 million in revenues to 
      an international leader in irrigation solutions, water management and 
      infrastructure products with revenues of over $500 million. During his 
      tenure he and his talented management team have created over $1 billion 
      in shareholder value as measured by share price appreciation, share 
      buybacks and dividends. Rick's compassion for our customers and 
      coworkers, his strong sense of values and ethics and his professional 
      and sincere approach to everything he does has solidified a strong 
      foundation for the company that shows deep respect and a commitment to 
      excellence for our shareholders, customers and coworkers.


                                        








“The Board of Directors has retained Spencer Stuart, a leading executive 
      recruiting firm to assist in the search for a CEO. The Board will 
      conduct a thorough search, considering both internal and external 
      candidates, to identify a new CEO who can lead the Company to continued 
      growth and success while maintaining the culture of professionalism and 
      integrity that Rick has instituted throughout the organization.”


                                        

About the Company

Shares of Omaha-based Lindsay Corp. rose about 4 percent Thursday after the company reported gains in sales and profits.Lindsay, a maker of crop irrigation systems and road infrastructure products, reported that third-quarter revenue was up 7 percent to $151.5 million.Revenue was up in both of Lindsay’s businesses: up 2 percent for irrigation and up 31 percent in infrastructure.

Lindsay Chief Executive Officer, Rick Parod, Announces Intention to 
      Retire






February 08, 2017 06:45 AM Eastern Standard Time



OMAHA, Neb.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Lindsay Corporation (NYSE: LNN), a leading provider of irrigation 
      systems and infrastructure products, announced today that its president 
      and chief executive officer, Rick Parod, 63, has informed the Board of 
      Directors of his intention to retire on December 1, 2017 to spend time 
      with his family, travel and pursue other interests.
    

      “I am extremely proud to have been a part of the Lindsay Corporation 
      family for nearly 17 years. We have a wonderful team of dedicated people 
      throughout our global organization who exemplify our core values and 
      work hard to provide valuable services to our customers and value for 
      our shareholders. Lindsay has a very bright future and is poised for 
      continued, profitable growth,” said Parod.
    

      Chairman of the Board Michael Nahl commented, “Rick Parod has been a 
      tremendous leader for Lindsay. Under his leadership, Lindsay has grown 
      from a single plant generating approximately $100 million in revenues to 
      an international leader in irrigation solutions, water management and 
      infrastructure products with revenues of over $500 million. During his 
      tenure he and his talented management team have created over $1 billion 
      in shareholder value as measured by share price appreciation, share 
      buybacks and dividends. Rick's compassion for our customers and 
      coworkers, his strong sense of values and ethics and his professional 
      and sincere approach to everything he does has solidified a strong 
      foundation for the company that shows deep respect and a commitment to 
      excellence for our shareholders, customers and coworkers.
    

      “The Board of Directors has retained Spencer Stuart, a leading executive 
      recruiting firm to assist in the search for a CEO. The Board will 
      conduct a thorough search, considering both internal and external 
      candidates, to identify a new CEO who can lead the Company to continued 
      growth and success while maintaining the culture of professionalism and 
      integrity that Rick has instituted throughout the organization.”
