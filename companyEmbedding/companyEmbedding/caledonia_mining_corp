About Caledonia



Caledonia is an exploration, development and mining company focused on Southern Africa. Caledonia's primary asset is a 49% interest in the Blanket Mine in Zimbabwe which produced 50,351 ounces of gold in 2016 at an All in Sustaining Cost of US$912/oz.
The Blanket Mine re-started production in April 2009 after a temporary shut-down due to the economic difficulties in Zimbabwe. In late 2010, Blanket successfully completed an expansion project which increased production capacity from 24,000 ounces of gold per annum to 40,000 ounces of gold per annum.
As an indigenised entity, Blanket can implement its long term growth strategy. The Blanket board, which includes representatives of the Indigenous Zimbabwean shareholders, approved a capital investment programme for a 4 year growth strategy for 2014 to 2017. This investment programme, which was endorsed by the Caledonia board, is estimated at US$65 million, is being funded from Blanket's internally generated cash, and is expected to result in progressive increases in gold production.
Blanket is engaged in the exploration of the down-dip extensions of the known ore bodies and the first two satellite exploration projects which are within trucking distance of the Blanket metallurgical recovery plant.
Blanket's metallurgical plant has substantial surplus capacity. Increased production arising from increased mining throughput should therefore be processed with moderate capital investment and incurring only consumable costs to treat any increased throughput.
Caledonia has a strong, experienced management team and board of directors with diverse expertise in gold production, exploration, mine development, finance and marketing. The group’s management team is based in Johannesburg, South Africa, London, United Kingdom and Jersey, Channel Islands.
Caledonia paid its initial dividend in February 2012. On April 4, 2013 Caledonia announced an annual dividend in respect of the year to December 31, 2012. On November 25, 2013 Caledonia announced that in 2014 it intended to pay an annual aggregate dividend of 6 Canadian cents per common share, payable on a quarterly basis. The first quarterly dividend of 1.5 Canadian cents per common share was declared and paid in January 2014. Further quarterly dividends were paid thereafter. On December 16, 2015, Caledonia announced that henceforth it would report its financial results in United States Dollars. The dividend paid at the end of January 2016 was therefore denominated in United States Dollars. In Q3 of 2016 Caledonia increased its quarterly dividend from 1.125 US cents per share to 1.375 US cents per share, an increase of 22%, representing an annual dividend of 5.5 US cents. In conjunction with the overall 1 for 5 share consolidation which became effective on June 26, 2017, Caledonia announced on July 4, 2017 that it had made a commensurate adjustment to the dividend by increasing it fivefold.

Caledonia Mining lines up expansion of gold output from Zimbabwe




			Posted by John on 26th July 2017		





The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) has approved the listing of Caledonia Mining Corp’s common shares on the NYSE American stock exchange. Steve Curtis, CEO, stated “This listing for the company on the NYSE American is another significant step for Caledonia which joins some of the world’s best-known gold and precious metals companies with a listing on this prestigious US exchange. This further step in the development of Caledonia’s corporate status has taken place against the backdrop of continued progress on our major operational development projects, principally the sinking of the Central Shaft at the Blanket mine in Zimbabwe.
“The Central Shaft, which is being funded from Blanket’s internal resources, is expected to fundamentally change the nature of Blanket’s operations by improving operating efficiencies and providing access to deeper levels for exploration, development and production. Completion of the Central Shaft remains on schedule for the fourth quarter of 2018.
“ The listing on the NYSE American is intended to provide the company with greater access to US institutional and retail investors which in turn is hoped will result in better overall trading liquidity, a lower cost of capital and other benefits for Caledonia and its shareholders”.
Following the implementation of indigenisation in Zimbabwe in September 2012, Caledonia’s primary asset is a 49% interest in the operating Blanket gold mine. Blanket plans to increase production from 50,351 oz in 2016 to approximately 80,000 oz in 2021.

Caledonia Mining Corporation: Q2 2017 Production Update
Caledonia Mining Corporation: Q2 2017 Production Update St Helier, 20 July 2017: Caledonia Mining Corporation Plc (“Caledonia” or the “Company” - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BnoVI6kmu0) announces gold production from the Blanket Mine (“Blanket”) in Zimbabwe, for the quarter ended 30 June 2017 (“Q2 2017” or the “Quarter”).  All production numbers are expressed on a 100 per cent basis and are based on mine production data and are therefore subject to adjustment following final assay at the refiners. Approximately 12,522 ounces of gold were produced during the Quarter, this amount was approximately equivalent to the gold produced in Q2 2016 (12,510 ounces). Gold produced for the first half of 2017 was 25,316 ounces, an 8.5 per cent increase on the 23,322 ounces produced in the first half of 2016. Caledonia maintains its’ 2017 full year production guidance of between 52,000 ounces and 57,000 ounces and remains on track with progress towards its long-term target of 80,000 ounces by 2021. Commenting on the production for Q2 of 2017, Steve Curtis, Caledonia’s Chief Executive Officer, said: “Notwithstanding the 8.5 per cent increase in production in the first six months of 2017 compared to the first six months of 2016, the second quarter of 2017 presented some operating challenges at Blanket.  Although we have improved the infrastructure on 750 metre level in recent years, we are still constrained in our ability to move increased quantities of ore and development waste.  Accordingly, in quarter 2, Caledonia took the decision to safeguard the long-term production target of 80,000 ounces in 2021 by prioritizing capital development tonnage over ore production tonnage.  This resulted in the 2017 production target being reduced from 60,000 ounces to a revised target of between 52,000 and 57,000 ounces.  “The existing infrastructure constraints at Blanket are temporary and are expected to be fully alleviated when the new Central Shaft is commissioned in the second half of 2018.  I am pleased to say that work on the Central Shaft remains on track.   “In the meantime, management has implemented further measures to address the short-term infrastructure constraints.  We are optimistic that these measures will result in a higher quarterly production in the remaining quarters of 2017 and we are confident that will achieve the revised production guidance for 2017 of between 52,000 and 57,000 ounces of gold.” About Caledonia Mining  Following the implementation of indigenisation in Zimbabwe, Caledonia’s primary asset is a 49 per cent interest in an operating gold mine in Zimbabwe (“Blanket”).  Caledonia’s shares are listed in Canada on the Toronto Stock Exchange as “CAL”, on London’s AIM as “CMCL” and are also currently traded on the American OTCQX as “CALVD”.   On 26 June 2017, Caledonia implemented a share consolidation on an effective basis of 1 new Caledonia share for every pre-existing 5 shares.  This consolidation was implemented with the objective of securing a listing for Caledonia’s shares on the NYSE MKT.  It is anticipated that the Caledonia’s shares will commence trading on the NYSE MKT by the end of July 2017. At 31 March 2017, Caledonia had cash of US$11.7m.  Blanket plans to increase production from 50,351 ounces in 2016 to approximately 80,000 ounces in 2021; Blanket’s target production for 2017 is 52,000 – 57,000 ounces. Caledonia expects to publish its results for the quarter to 30 June 2017 on 14 August 2017. For further information please contact: Caledonia Mining Corporation PlcMark LearmonthTel: +44 1534 679800 marklearmonth@caledoniamining.com Maurice MasonTel: +44 759 078 1139mauricemason@caledoniamining.com  WH IrelandAdrian Hadden/Ed AllsoppTel: +44 20 7220 1751 BlytheweighTim Blythe/Camilla Horsfall/Megan RayTel: +44 20 7138 3204 Swiss Resource Capital AGJochen Staigerinfo@resource-capital.ch www.resource-capital.ch   Cautionary Note Concerning Forward-Looking Information Information and statements contained in this news release that are not historical facts are “forward-looking information” within the meaning of applicable securities legislation that involve risks and uncertainties relating, but not limited to Caledonia’s current expectations, intentions, plans, and beliefs.  Forward-looking information can often be identified by forward-looking words such as “anticipate”, “believe”, “expect”, “goal”, “plan”, “target”, “intend”, “estimate”, “could”, “should”, “may” and “will” or the negative of these terms or similar words suggesting future outcomes, or other expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions, intentions or statements about future events or performance. Examples of forward-looking information in this news release include: production guidance, estimates of future/targeted production rates, and our plans and timing regarding further exploration and drilling and development.  This forward-looking information is based, in part, on assumptions and factors that may change or prove to be incorrect, thus causing actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by forward-looking information.  Such factors and assumptions include, but are not limited to: failure to establish estimated resources and reserves, the grade and recovery of ore which is mined varying from estimates, success of future exploration and drilling programs, reliability of drilling, sampling and assay data, assumptions regarding the representativeness of mineralization being inaccurate, success of planned metallurgical test-work, capital and operating costs varying significantly from estimates, delays in obtaining or failures to obtain required governmental, environmental or other project approvals, inflation, changes in exchange rates, fluctuations in commodity prices, delays in the development of projects and other factors. Shareholders, potential shareholders and other prospective investors should be aware that these statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements.  Such factors include, but are not limited to: risks relating to estimates of mineral reserves and mineral resources proving to be inaccurate, fluctuations in gold price, risks and hazards associated with the business of mineral exploration, development and mining, risks relating to the credit worthiness or financial condition of suppliers, refiners and other parties with whom the Company does business; inadequate insurance, or inability to obtain insurance, to cover these risks and hazards, employee relations; relationships with and claims by local communities and indigenous populations; political risk; availability and increasing costs associated with mining inputs and labour; the speculative nature of mineral exploration and development, including the risks of obtaining or maintaining necessary licenses and permits, diminishing quantities or grades of mineral reserves as mining occurs; global financial condition, the actual results of current exploration activities, changes to conclusions of economic evaluations, and changes in project parameters to deal with unanticipated economic or other factors, risks of increased capital and operating costs, environmental, safety or regulatory risks, expropriation, the Company’s title to properties including ownership thereof, increased competition in the mining industry for properties, equipment, qualified personnel and their costs, risks relating to the uncertainty of timing of events including targeted production rate increase and currency fluctuations.  Shareholders are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking information.  By its nature, forward-looking information involves numerous assumptions, inherent risks and uncertainties, both general and specific, that contribute to the possibility that the predictions, forecasts, projections and various future events will not occur.  Caledonia undertakes no obligation to update publicly or otherwise revise any forward-looking information whether as a result of new information, future events or other such factors which affect this information, except as required by law.  NEWSLETTER REGISTRIERUNG:

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.
