Overview



Skadden represents private equity firms in connection with all aspects of their businesses, including structuring and organizing fund sponsors and their investment funds; executing acquisitions, financings and exit transactions; and providing corporate, securities, financing and litigation advice to portfolio companies. We were ranked in the top tier for leveraged buyouts and private equity law by U.S. News — Best Lawyers “Best Law Firms” 2017, ranked as a leading firm for private equity by IFLR1000 2017, repeatedly recognized as having attorneys who are “leading lawyers” by Chambers Global  and Chambers USA, and listed among Law360’s Private Equity Groups of 2014.








Fund Formation and Sponsor Representations


 Skadden provides advice on the formation and ongoing operations of private equity funds and the companies organized to sponsor and manage them. The firm’s attorneys have more than two decades of in-depth experience representing the sponsors and investors in private equity funds. We have organized numerous U.S. and offshore private equity funds and funds of funds (including merchant banking, mezzanine and venture capital funds) involving a variety of structures and jurisdictions.
 We work extensively on every category of private equity funds, including hedge funds, leveraged buyout or merchant banking funds, venture capital funds, real estate funds, including REITs, and hybrid funds that meld attributes usually linked either to traditional venture capital or buyout funds or to hedge funds.




Leveraged Finance


 Our banking and corporate finance practices advise clients worldwide on all types of financings, including integrated bank and bond financings and bridge financings. Our attorneys are located in the major financial centers of all five continents and provide our clients in the U.S., Asia, Australia, Europe and South America with an in-depth understanding of the global markets. In addition to advising private equity sponsors and their portfolio companies, our perspective on leveraged financing structures is enhanced by our extensive experience in representing most of the leading banks and underwriters providing or arranging bank and high-yield financing in private equity transactions.
 Our finance-related capabilities are enhanced by a leading corporate restructuring practice, which has extensive experience in the special issues faced by private equity sponsors and their portfolio companies in workouts, bankruptcies and similar situations. For example, we advised Quadriga Capital (Germany) in the debt restructuring of Süddekor (Germany), and Vulcan Capital as principal shareholder of Charter Communications in connection with the prearranged Chapter 11 bankruptcy cases of Charter Communications and certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates.
