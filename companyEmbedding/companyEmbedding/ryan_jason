Promising Cowboys rookie Ryan Switzer suffers hamstring injury - Sportsnaut.com

















 


























 






























NFL
Promising Cowboys rookie Ryan Switzer suffers hamstring injury
18 hours agoby Jesse Reed






 
Written by Jesse Reed



The Dallas Cowboys have some high hopes for North Carolina product, Ryan Switzer, who’s been wowing throughout the offseason. Unfortunately, the rookie receiver suffered a hamstring injury during Thursday’s practice, and the ‘Boys don’t have any idea how severe it is at this time.                				

Jason Garrett says it's a hamstring for Switzer, but he doesn't have details on the severity.
— David Helman (@HelmanDC) July 27, 2017
 
There’s a bit of good news and a bit of bad news associated with this.
The bad news first: Switzer is going to be counted on heavily now as a return man now that Lucky Whitehead is out of the picture following a series of very unfortunate events. So, if this is a serious hamstring issue, Dallas could have some decisions to make about finding help on special teams.               				 	
Now the good news: As it relates to the team’s slot receiver depth, fellow small white guy, Cole Beasley, has been cleared for practice after hamstring issues of his own kept him off the field this offseason.
Hopefully this isn’t a big deal. Though, even with minor hamstring tweaks, there’s room for caution. Like feet, these can be tricky, so we expect the Cowboys to not take any chances with their talented rookie.

Product Hero: Ryan Frere and Jason Moens of Flywire

June 12, 2017


Fresh Tilled Soil – by C. Todd Lombardo
Product Hero is our bi-weekly series that highlights outstanding members of the product management community. These industry leaders share tips on processes, team building, how to be a better product manager, and who they are outside of their careers. This week our product heroes are Ryan Frere, VP of global payments at Flywire and Jason Moens, VP of product.
C. Todd: I’m here with two product heroes from Flywire here in Boston. I’ll let you two introduce yourselves and tell us how you got into product. Jason, do you want to start?
Jason: Hi I’m Jason Moens, VP of product at Flywire. I’ve been here for about seven years. I joined Flywire when it was just an interesting idea, but had no customers, revenue, or product. It seemed like a compelling idea – to help change the way people around the world move money, especially for big purchases like medical care and tuition payments. My history before Flywire was in the payments and software space at a few startups and larger companies.
I was a software developer for about 10 years, but the intersection of technology and business was always my focus, so product always seemed like the best home for me. Now I’ve spent the last 15 years in product.
C. Todd: Awesome. Thank you. Ryan, how about you? Tell us a little about your background. How did you get into product and design?
Ryan: Sure, I’m Ryan Frere, VP of global payments at Flywire. It’s funny hearing Jason’s story because I came from the business path to product. Originally I was at a larger, enterprise software company in an inside sales role. I have a bit of a technical background and the more I dug into that product, the more I knew there was a better way to build it. At the time, I didn’t know about product management as a function. Working closely with the product manager at the time, he thought I could be a good fit for a product role. So in 2006 I moved over to product.
Fast forward eight years, Mike Massaro, the CEO of Flywire, (it was called peerTransfer at the time) called me about a product job here. He saw my experience in education and international payments and here I am now.
It complimented very nicely to where Jason was coming from on that side of domestic payments first. And now, we both jointly run product here from the two different perspectives.
C. Todd: Can you describe your relationship a bit more? How do you deal with being two heads of product? What does the division of work look like?
Jason: When Flywire began, we had really fundamental questions we kept asking ourselves. We needed to validate that people were having difficulties moving money internationally, and that we could create a sustainable company to provide that solution. What is interesting is that our core area of business is in something we didn’t expect: education payments. We were expanding the use cases for our product. As we’re trying to uncover different ways to apply our solution, we have a sort of laboratory function where we do a lot of experimentation. Right now, Ryan has been driving the established product lines, focused on the stuff we’ve proved to work. I’m on the other side figuring out what will be valuable or not but uncovering new learnings and then driving through ideas.
Ryan: What’s funny is I came from a 30-year-old technology company that was relatively stagnant with innovation. They wouldn’t want to invest in an idea if they didn’t know it that it was going to result in a lot of revenue. But, how would we know that yet without actually getting something going and learning along the way? So it was a lot of fun to start working with Jason, where we can experiment.
Where we are as a business, one of the smartest investments we can make is drawing a line between what is known that works and what we don’t know. We can cause a lot of disruption by experimenting in the realm of what we don’t know.
C. Todd: Can you explain what Flywire does?
Jason: Most people were using their local banks to send money to another country. Almost entirely, those payments were sent by international bank wires. They’re very expensive when you take fees and foreign exchange markups in the cost. For example, if you live in Spain and you want to attend MIT, you would end up paying an additional 5% because of transfer fees. We process payments for 200 countries and territories.
Under the traditional model, while the money disappears from your account right away, there’s a delay for MIT to recognize the payment. Two weeks after you send the payment, MIT can finally credit your account. Our intention was to provide a solution to improve the experience on the payer’s side and streamline the process on the recipient’s side.
We partner with the world’s biggest billers: universities, colleges, hospitals, and businesses that are trying to receive funds from any country. We localize the experience of the payers. Instead of a student or parent in China having to visit their bank for a transfer, they can use their UnionPay, WeChat Pay, or Alipay for example.
C. Todd: So this isn’t to transfer $20 to my friends in Spain for dinner. This is for bigger ticket spends.
Jason: Exactly. A number of companies help with small balance transfers. Our goal was to help streamline on the receiver side. These big billers have challenges with traditional bank transfers like money showing up and all the fees were missing so the balance was short of the actual bill. Or, they didn’t know who the payment belonged to because the message was lost in the transfer.
C. Todd: What are some of the challenges that keep you up at night?
Ryan: The nature of running an international payments company is stressful. Regulations, currency fluctuation and all the fun stuff that comes with it are all involved. We have teams all dedicated to those aspects of the business. Thinking about products specifically, wondering if we’re growing fast enough is one of the big concerns. I also think about if we’re learning fast enough, not just from what we’re releasing, but with getting better from a process perspective.
C. Todd: Is there any specific thing around process that you’re looking at and trying to solve right now?
Jason: I’m quick to say that running a very small, efficient team is one of the easiest things you can do. The question is how you scale that up.
Ryan: How can I forget scaling?
C. Todd: Scale breaks everything.
Jason: Exactly.
Ryan: Which is good. I mean it’s actually okay if it breaks it. You’ve just got to learn and iterate on it fast enough.
Jason: What’s the expression, that growth brings complexity and complexity kills growth?
C. Todd: How do you work with the broader team like marketing and sales? How do you ship products out the door?
Ryan: My team consists of product management, design, and product marketing functions when it is needed. We need to make sure that all of those people are informed and aligned as to what’s going on.
If we look to the experimental lab side of the business, analytics actually sits there. So much of the decision-making for the future is data-driven.
Jason: Just to elaborate, the analytics team is actually embedded within each of those teams. We pretty much follow the Spotify model: Autonomous squads that consist of a product lead, an engineering lead, additional engineers, and a design lead where it makes sense. Some of the internal payment processing doesn’t have much of a design need.
Each squad is given a mission. The mission starts with guardrails and guidance from people from all levels and functions of the company. These people could be on the global payments team, or marketing, or sales. They’re pulled into the conversations but are not embedded within the squads themselves. We want to tap into their brains while also letting them know what’s being worked on. Squads are pretty autonomous and use their best judgement to get stuff out the door.
The makeup of each squad takes into account the mission. It’s a very scalable approach. With this model we’re poised to commit to investing in an idea that works to become a permanent part of the company. That idea would then transition from my side of the business to Ryan’s.
C. Todd: Could you describe the Spotify model you referenced in terms of your squad?
Jason: Sure. We haven’t had enough people to get into the tribe and alliance guilds like Spotify. We’ll keep an eye on our squads to see if we can flesh it out further. The concept is people from different functions, who work on wildly different things, coming together as a cross-functional team.
The program here is called Fly Stronger, which is the ability for anyone to raise their hand and express interest in something. If there are enough people interested, the company will provide money, time, and space to explore that idea. We’re a global company, which leads to interesting challenges. We do an all-company gathering somewhere around the world and it gives tremendous opportunities for people to travel. It gives us the experience of learning about a different culture where we might struggle to pay for something and understand how currency may be different.
Ryan: It’s cool. One of our product guys who’s based in Singapore does a lot of work in China. Last week, on his own, he planned a trip to China and vowed not use any cash to see how far he could get. He only ran into one challenge with a taxi, but that was about it.
Jason: The way I framed it is – this is an international payments company, I’m the least international person here. So if the ideas that we are going to pursue are limited by what’s in my head, we’re definitely going to fail. Every single person on the development team has lived, studied, and traveled immensely. We incorporate the collective experiences of all the people who work here into our product.
We support the ability for people to get out of their comfort zone in a whole bunch of different ways. And that feeds back into us making better product decisions. So I think the travel aspect of our jobs is immensely important. We’re really fortunate to have gotten to this stage of the company where we can give people those opportunities. At the same time it feeds the product and yields a ton of return for us.
C. Todd: What problems are product people not talking enough about? What’s missing from the conversation?
Ryan: People are definitely talking about how to hire a product manager. You can find many conversations about whether you should hire an internal person and train them or hire a seasoned product manager externally.
What I don’t see is enough talk about the personality traits you need to do the job. It’s not always about experience. I don’t necessarily look for people with 10 plus years of experience in product. In some ways, that experience takes you back to a very old way of doing things, neglecting more modern approaches.
We need to stress the ability for people to break down a problem. Also, everyone does product a bit differently. There are some consistencies, but as a whole, we need to see that person has the ability to influence without authority, which is a key piece of product roles. Assessing that ability is hard when you need to see if they fit with the culture, that they love to learn, they’re curious, can problem solve, and so on. All of those pieces are part skill-based but also behavioral.
C. Todd: What are some products that you really admire?
Jason: I’ll say, within the payment space, I think Stripe has done a great job. They’ve continuously added more functionality, almost as though from the beginning they knew these functions would be coming. Everything is seamlessly integrated.
Then with the expansion into Atlas, I love the way that they’ve seamlessly stretched that into a legal aspect, and a global presence, and a whole bunch of things which I think are probably anything beyond what their original focus was.
Ryan: I’m going to put my own personal consumer hat on – if I can pick a product that saves me and solves the problem for me every day – it’s Waze. I commute into the city from the North Shore. Route 1 is a blast but there’s a lot of ways around it. So I don’t start my car without lighting up Waze to get to work.
C. Todd: What advice would you offer anyone who is new to product?
Ryan: Put a focus on understanding your customer and the problem. Get out of the building and spend some time in the world. I always use Jane Goodall as my analogy. She didn’t read books, she didn’t “study,” she lived in the jungle to understand chimpanzees. Even if the problem is on the outskirts of our product, you don’t know the exact customer problems you can solve until you’re actually in their environment.
Jason: Regardless of the size of the company you work for, small or big, whether you like it or not, you are at war. I love the concept of insurgency and guerilla tactics. And at the end of the day, clawing, scratching, kicking, and finding a way to be able to uncover new learning and to do it better and faster than anybody else.
A few years ago someone asked me since we didn’t have any patents: What would stop someone else from doing the same thing we did? My only response was that if they could understand the customer, their pain points, and build something that is better than our product, then they deserved the business.

These industry leaders share tips on processes, team building, how to be a better product manager, and who they are outside of their careers. This week our product heroes are Ryan Frere, VP of global payments at Flywire and Jason Moens, VP of product.
C. Todd: I’m here with two product heroes from Flywire here in Boston. I’ll let you two introduce yourselves and tell us how you got into product. Jason, do you want to start?
Jason: Hi I’m Jason Moens, VP of product at Flywire. I’ve been here for about seven years. I joined Flywire when it was just an interesting idea, but had no customers, revenue, or product. It seemed like a compelling idea – to help change the way people around the world move money, especially for big purchases like medical care and tuition payments. My history before Flywire was in the payments and software space at a few startups and larger companies.
I was a software developer for about 10 years, but the intersection of technology and business was always my focus, so product always seemed like the best home for me. Now I’ve spent the last 15 years in product.
C. Todd: Awesome. Thank you. Ryan, how about you? Tell us a little about your background. How did you get into product and design?
Ryan: Sure, I’m Ryan Frere, VP of global payments at Flywire. It’s funny hearing Jason’s story because I came from the business path to product. Originally I was at a larger, enterprise software company in an inside sales role. I have a bit of a technical background and the more I dug into that product, the more I knew there was a better way to build it. At the time, I didn’t know about product management as a function. Working closely with the product manager at the time, he thought I could be a good fit for a product role. So in 2006 I moved over to product.
Fast forward eight years, Mike Massaro, the CEO of Flywire, (it was called peerTransfer at the time) called me about a product job here. He saw my experience in education and international payments and here I am now.
It complimented very nicely to where Jason was coming from on that side of domestic payments first. And now, we both jointly run product here from the two different perspectives.
C. Todd: Can you describe your relationship a bit more? How do you deal with being two heads of product? What does the division of work look like?
Jason: When Flywire began, we had really fundamental questions we kept asking ourselves. We needed to validate that people were having difficulties moving money internationally, and that we could create a sustainable company to provide that solution. What is interesting is that our core area of business is in something we didn’t expect: education payments. We were expanding the use cases for our product. As we’re trying to uncover different ways to apply our solution, we have a sort of laboratory function where we do a lot of experimentation. Right now, Ryan has been driving the established product lines, focused on the stuff we’ve proved to work. I’m on the other side figuring out what will be valuable or not but uncovering new learnings and then driving through ideas.
Ryan: What’s funny is I came from a 30-year-old technology company that was relatively stagnant with innovation. They wouldn’t want to invest in an idea if they didn’t know it that it was going to result in a lot of revenue. But, how would we know that yet without actually getting something going and learning along the way? So it was a lot of fun to start working with Jason, where we can experiment.
Where we are as a business, one of the smartest investments we can make is drawing a line between what is known that works and what we don’t know. We can cause a lot of disruption by experimenting in the realm of what we don’t know.
C. Todd: Can you explain what Flywire does?
Jason: Most people were using their local banks to send money to another country. Almost entirely, those payments were sent by international bank wires. They’re very expensive when you take fees and foreign exchange markups in the cost. For example, if you live in Spain and you want to attend MIT, you would end up paying an additional 5% because of transfer fees. We process payments for 200 countries and territories.
Under the traditional model, while the money disappears from your account right away, there’s a delay for MIT to recognize the payment. Two weeks after you send the payment, MIT can finally credit your account. Our intention was to provide a solution to improve the experience on the payer’s side and streamline the process on the recipient’s side.
We partner with the world’s biggest billers: universities, colleges, hospitals, and businesses that are trying to receive funds from any country. We localize the experience of the payers. Instead of a student or parent in China having to visit their bank for a transfer, they can use their UnionPay, WeChat Pay, or Alipay for example.
We can cause a lot of disruption by experimenting in the realm of what we don’t know.

C. Todd: So this isn’t to transfer $20 to my friends in Spain for dinner. This is for bigger ticket spends.
Jason: Exactly. A number of companies help with small balance transfers. Our goal was to help streamline on the receiver side. These big billers have challenges with traditional bank transfers like money showing up and all the fees were missing so the balance was short of the actual bill. Or, they didn’t know who the payment belonged to because the message was lost in the transfer.
C. Todd: What are some of the challenges that keep you up at night?
Ryan: The nature of running an international payments company is stressful. Regulations, currency fluctuation and all the fun stuff that comes with it are all involved. We have teams all dedicated to those aspects of the business. Thinking about products specifically, wondering if we’re growing fast enough is one of the big concerns. I also think about if we’re learning fast enough, not just from what we’re releasing, but with getting better from a process perspective.
C. Todd: Is there any specific thing around process that you’re looking at and trying to solve right now?
Jason: I’m quick to say that running a very small, efficient team is one of the easiest things you can do. The question is how you scale that up.
Ryan: How can I forget scaling?
C. Todd: Scale breaks everything.
Jason: Exactly.
Ryan: Which is good. I mean it’s actually okay if it breaks it. You’ve just got to learn and iterate on it fast enough.
Jason: What’s the expression, that growth brings complexity and complexity kills growth?
C. Todd: How do you work with the broader team like marketing and sales? How do you ship products out the door?
Ryan: My team consists of product management, design, and product marketing functions when it is needed. We need to make sure that all of those people are informed and aligned as to what’s going on.
If we look to the experimental lab side of the business, analytics actually sits there. So much of the decision-making for the future is data-driven.
We incorporate the collective experiences of all the people who work here into our product.

Jason: Just to elaborate, the analytics team is actually embedded within each of those teams. We pretty much follow the Spotify model: Autonomous squads that consist of a product lead, an engineering lead, additional engineers, and a design lead where it makes sense. Some of the internal payment processing doesn’t have much of a design need.
Each squad is given a mission. The mission starts with guardrails and guidance from people from all levels and functions of the company. These people could be on the global payments team, or marketing, or sales. They’re pulled into the conversations but are not embedded within the squads themselves. We want to tap into their brains while also letting them know what’s being worked on. Squads are pretty autonomous and use their best judgement to get stuff out the door.
The makeup of each squad takes into account the mission. It’s a very scalable approach. With this model we’re poised to commit to investing in an idea that works to become a permanent part of the company. That idea would then transition from my side of the business to Ryan’s.
C. Todd: Could you describe the Spotify model you referenced in terms of your squad?
Jason: Sure. We haven’t had enough people to get into the tribe and alliance guilds like Spotify. We’ll keep an eye on our squads to see if we can flesh it out further. The concept is people from different functions, who work on wildly different things, coming together as a cross-functional team.
The program here is called Fly Stronger, which is the ability for anyone to raise their hand and express interest in something. If there are enough people interested, the company will provide money, time, and space to explore that idea. We’re a global company, which leads to interesting challenges. We do an all-company gathering somewhere around the world and it gives tremendous opportunities for people to travel. It gives us the experience of learning about a different culture where we might struggle to pay for something and understand how currency may be different.
Ryan: It’s cool. One of our product guys who’s based in Singapore does a lot of work in China. Last week, on his own, he planned a trip to China and vowed not use any cash to see how far he could get. He only ran into one challenge with a taxi, but that was about it.
Jason: The way I framed it is – this is an international payments company, I’m the least international person here. So if the ideas that we are going to pursue are limited by what’s in my head, we’re definitely going to fail. Every single person on the development team has lived, studied, and traveled immensely. We incorporate the collective experiences of all the people who work here into our product.
We support the ability for people to get out of their comfort zone in a whole bunch of different ways. And that feeds back into us making better product decisions. So I think the travel aspect of our jobs is immensely important. We’re really fortunate to have gotten to this stage of the company where we can give people those opportunities. At the same time it feeds the product and yields a ton of return for us.
Regardless of the size of the company you work for, small or big, whether you like it or not, you are at war. 

C. Todd: What problems are product people not talking enough about? What’s missing from the conversation?
Ryan: People are definitely talking about how to hire a product manager. You can find many conversations about whether you should hire an internal person and train them or hire a seasoned product manager externally.
What I don’t see is enough talk about the personality traits you need to do the job. It’s not always about experience. I don’t necessarily look for people with 10 plus years of experience in product. In some ways, that experience takes you back to a very old way of doing things, neglecting more modern approaches.
We need to stress the ability for people to break down a problem. Also, everyone does product a bit differently. There are some consistencies, but as a whole, we need to see that person has the ability to influence without authority, which is a key piece of product roles. Assessing that ability is hard when you need to see if they fit with the culture, that they love to learn, they’re curious, can problem solve, and so on. All of those pieces are part skill-based but also behavioral.
C. Todd: What are some products that you really admire?
Jason: I’ll say, within the payment space, I think Stripe has done a great job. They’ve continuously added more functionality, almost as though from the beginning they knew these functions would be coming. Everything is seamlessly integrated.
Then with the expansion into Atlas, I love the way that they’ve seamlessly stretched that into a legal aspect, and a global presence, and a whole bunch of things which I think are probably anything beyond what their original focus was.
Ryan: I’m going to put my own personal consumer hat on – if I can pick a product that saves me and solves the problem for me every day – it’s Waze. I commute into the city from the North Shore. Route 1 is a blast but there’s a lot of ways around it. So I don’t start my car without lighting up Waze to get to work.
C. Todd: What advice would you offer anyone who is new to product?
Ryan: Put a focus on understanding your customer and the problem. Get out of the building and spend some time in the world. I always use Jane Goodall as my analogy. She didn’t read books, she didn’t “study,” she lived in the jungle to understand chimpanzees. Even if the problem is on the outskirts of our product, you don’t know the exact customer problems you can solve until you’re actually in their environment.
Jason: Regardless of the size of the company you work for, small or big, whether you like it or not, you are at war. I love the concept of insurgency and guerilla tactics. And at the end of the day, clawing, scratching, kicking, and finding a way to be able to uncover new learning and to do it better and faster than anybody else.
A few years ago someone asked me since we didn’t have any patents: What would stop someone else from doing the same thing we did? My only response was that if they could understand the customer, their pain points, and build something that is better than our product, then they deserved the business.

Ryan Reynolds and Jason Bateman star in the outrageous comedy from the director of Wedding Crashers and the writers of The Hangover.  One drunken night, two friends admit that they wish they had the other’s life. Mitch (Reynolds) thinks Dave has it all: a beautiful, loving family and a high-paying job at a prestigious law firm. But Dave (Bateman) thinks Mitch’s stress-free life without obligation or consequence is the real dream come true. The next morning they wake up, hungover, in each other’s bodies, and proceed to freak out! With time not on their side, Mitch and Dave comically struggle to avoid completely destroying each other’s lives before they can find a way to get their old ones back.

Ryan Reynolds is by far at his best in comedies. Even Deadpool was more of a comedy than a superhero flick, and that's what pulled it off for me. This one has been done many times before, so there is nothing new. Two buddies, one a straight laced father with a law career, the other an arrested development man child with commitment issues hook up for a night of glory days boozing, and the hi-jinx ensue from there. A fate full stop at a fountain causes them to switch bodies, and forces them to live each others lives for the next week. The real fun is watching these two comic masterminds slide into the dueling roles. Although highly predictable, it is fun to watch, as Bateman plays his toned down father character who unfolds in his new body, and Reynolds going over the top as the clueless friend who now has to take on all the responsibilities. What will happen? Will they grow as people, and come to a mutual understanding of each other? Who cares! It's ridiculous and dumb, but watching the scenes when these two interact together are hysterical and laugh out loud. Park your brain and waste an hour and a half on this one.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsMiddle age was never this funny!ByD. RobertsVINE VOICEon June 15, 2016Format: DVD|Verified PurchaseIf ever there were an introspective Romantic comedy about the proverbial mid-life crisis, then this one is it.  Mitch (Ryan Reynolds) and Dave (Jason Bateman) are 2 friends who live antipodal lives.  Dave is married with 3 children;  his life is structured and he is well compensated as a lawyer for a major firm.  Mitch, on the other hand, is single, free-wheeling, independent but has little $$ as he has difficulties finding steady employment.  He wants to be an actor, but can't score anything higher than commercials & softcore porn flicks.  Dave & Mitch want what the other has;  Dave envies Mitch's autonomy to do whatever he pleases, while Mitch covets the stability of Dave's life.One day, when they announce their wish simultaneously to a magic fountain, they trade places.  Mitch gets to live like Dave, and Dave gets to live like Mitch.  They both find out that the other person's life is not so neat & tidy & easy as they assumed it would be.  One thing that is clear is that the situations are ripe for a great many laughs!!The primary reason I bought this film was the inclusion of Olivia Wilde.  After seeing her in the recent TRON movie, I was "hooked."  She does not disappoint as the sultry Sabrina.  Dave has always had an infatuation for her, but he's married.  However......what about if he dates her as Mitch?  Does that "count" as adultery.....given that he's no longer the same person?  Hmmmm......what is not in dispute is that, for myself, I'm Wilde about Olvia!  I am presently binge-watching her movies.If you want a different kind of Romantic comedy, one that actually includes a married couple (whoa!) & is on the raunchy side,  then this flick might be just for you.  While I am not huge on bathroom humor, I will say this flick had the funniest BH I've ever seen  & they didn't over-do it.  If you're a middle aged fellow (like myself) then you will find this romp particularly poignant!Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsChange-UpByRather be at the BeachTOP 1000 REVIEWERon June 27, 2012Format: DVD|Verified PurchaseThis one comes with a warning.....totally, TOTALLY, inappropriate!  I am SHOCKED that I like it!  This is as risque as it gets for me, and I will still like a movie.  Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds are awesomely funny, and their characters are SO WELL-WRITTEN!  This movie has been done before (two people change into each other's bodies accidentally, there are LOTS of outrageously funny situations because of this, and then they change back), but RARELY has it been done so well!  This is pretty vulgar but is done so exceedingly well that I have watched it a number of times with my 24 year old son.  Jason Bateman is Dave, a married conservative, successful lawyer with twin babies who is trying for a partnership in his firm.  Ryan Reynolds is Mitch, an immature dolt of a wanna be actor whose main goal in life is bedding every woman he can, sleeping 'til noon and having fun.  One night they pee in a fountain and wake up the next morning in each other's bodies!  I can't begin to explain the clever situations the writers thought of to exploit every bit of humor from this.  This movie is full of surprises and laughs!  Gotta love both of those, right?  The supporting actors are wonderful, too.  I recommend this movie!Read more77 comments|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse4.0 out of 5 starsA great cast in a great funny movieByMike Tripolion July 30, 2015Format: Amazon Video|Verified PurchaseIn the genre of "trading bodies" movies, this one stands out. Ryan Reynolds and Jason Bateman are both very funny, and as silly as it is, manage to make one believe they have actually "traded" places. In one scene in which Ryan Reynolds character is in bed with his best friends wife, the acting is done well enough that you feel the embarrassment for Reynolds character coming through. The hallmark of good acting is when the viewer can empathize with the characters.Of course, let's not forget about the women in this movie; Leslie Mann and Olivia Wilde. Leslie Mann is, in my opinion, a brilliant actress in these types of roles (she was great in "Knocked Up" and "Big Daddy" (Hooters girl)). Olivia Wilde always does a great job portraying the "serious professional office worker" with a secret - a tiny slip of a tattoo to let you now she's not "all business".Lastly, the writer for the "twin babies" should have received an award for these two. The mischief these two get into is hysterical on its own.Read more0Comment|

As Seen on Mary Donovan (Amy Ryan) in Bridge of Spies


 LOYAL WIFE:  					When family man James Donovan (Tom Hanks) gets entangled in a Cold War espionage scandal in Bridge of Spies, his wife Mary (Amy Ryan) stands by his side. In a classic 50s wardrobe of printed frocks, pearls, and double-breasted coats, Mary does whatever it takes to protect her family and stand up for what is right—justice. In the shadow of war, one family shows America what they stand for.  Scroll down to see more clothes, outfits and products identified from Bridge of Spies.

US-based Ryan Specialty Group has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Georgia-based wholesale insurance brokerage and binding authority N-Surance Outlets (NSO).
Headquartered in Roswell, NSO specialises in commercial property/casualty (P&C), transportation, and garage risks.
Following the deal, NSO will become part of RT Specialty, the wholesale brokerage unit of Ryan Specialty Group. Jason Murrey, president of NSO, and his team will continue to service and expand their client base from their current location.



 
RT Specialty chairman and CEO, Timothy Turner, commented: "NSO is an outstanding brokerage house and has built a strong offering, particularly in the binding authority space. Bringing NSO into RT expands our presence in the Southeast and further strengthens our product offerings and services. Under Jason’s leadership and with the team he’s developed, we’re thrilled to make such a dynamic addition to RT Specialty.”
Murrey added: "It is an honor and great opportunity to join RT Specialty at this stage of our business. My team and I are excited to be able to expand our solutions to our retail clients under the RT platform."

The Jason Ryan 12' is a great all-around board. If you are looking for the most versatile board on the market, this is it. At over 32" wide and 5.25" thick, this board offers maximum stability and flotation.
The rocker on the 12' is relaxed at both ends. The nose accommodates for both wave catching and trim capabilities on the flat water, while the tail rocker is forgiving in the waves to help turn on a dime. The shape of the nose is round and full, with wide hips coming down to the full tail, which allows for heavy weight on the deck while paddling, such as a packed cooler with your rods and reels or your favorite little paddle partner sitting on the nose with you. Air vent on the deck, with deep handle. 2+1 fin setup, with FCS plugs. Light-weight at 35 lbs with a 'tuck under' easy-grip handle.

      The COMPLETE PACKAGE.  This board is a classic.  Looks like a work of art, handles like a dream, light as a feather, and stands up to the test of time.  ALWAYS  gets compliments, pleases everyone; men, women, beginners to advanced.

Gorgeous, light weight, easy to balence, tracks like a dream.

Cons
Nothing...wish i could afford to buy all models!
Usage
Mostly flat surf/inlet backwater.  Ok in light surf.

      I just recently bought the Jason Ryan from Three Brothers Boards. The board was superbly wrapped and was delivered on time and in perfect condition. The board is an heirloom quality board which has fantastic tracking ability, great speed, high quality components and great stability. I have been paddleboarding for about a year and as a beginner I have built up so much confidence with a quality board such as this one. I would recommend any Three Brothers product. 

Pros
I have to mention how pleased I am with the level of customer service given to me by the folks at Three Brothers. I am a very loyal customer when I am treated like I matter. The folks at Three Brothers go out of their way to accommodate the customer. For me that included answering the phone and spending time talking to me about which board to buy. I live in VA and have no way to access a distributor near by. I fell in love with the board, and then the company. The board itself is made with very high quality materials, it is beautiful and will last forever if you care for it.. The 2+ 1 fin set up really allows for great tracking. I like the fact that it is a small family owned company. That translates into good customized service and a quality product that they stand behind. 

Cons
Nothing.
Usage
I use the board on flat water (lake) for touring, yoga and fishing. The board is nice and big so it is really stable and that allows for universal use no matter what you plan on doing on the water. Take your dog, take your radio, take your cooler. The bungies at the top will hold all your gear.

      I think this is the best looking board made, I get comments and complements every time someone sees the board. I had never paddled before and first time I got on it went for 4 hours with no problems and enjoyed every minute.

Pros
It's beautiful, light weight, easy to manage and so much fun

Cons
Have not found anything that I don't like.
Usage
Exercise, relaxation & family fun.

12′ Jason Ryan
$1,449.00or pay $242 for 6 monthsOur 12′ is a great all-around board. If you are looking for the most versatile board on the market, this is it. At  32” wide and 5.25″ thick, this board offers maximum stability and flotation. The rocker on the 12′ is relaxed at both ends. The nose accommodates for both wave catching and flat water, while the tail rocker is forgiving in the waves to help turn on a dime. The shape of the nose is round and full, with wide hips coming down to the full tail, which allows for heavy weight on the deck while paddling, such as a packed cooler with your rods and reels or your favorite little paddle partner sitting on the nose. Air vent on the deck, with deep handle. 2+1 fin setup, with FCS plugs. Light-weight at 35 lbs with a ‘tuck under’ easy-grip handle.

Full nose for stability
2+1 Fin setup for tracking
Tucked under handle for easy transport
Wide body for maximum buoyancy
Bungee tie-down system for storage
Reinforced rails for maximum strength
Mellow rocker for flatwater and surf
5″+ thick for maximum capacity (300 lbs)
3D diamond cut EVA deck pad
