A Company Built on Quality and Service

Matthews International Corporation has become a leader in the industries we serve by adhering to our belief that continuous quality improvement is paramount in every aspect of
our business.


A 165-Year Tradition

John Dixon Matthews emigrated from his native England and opened up a small shop in Pittsburgh in 1850. A skilled engraver, John Matthews set a simple goal for his small company – to become no less than the pre-eminent provider of the highest-quality identification products and services. Word of his superior craftsmanship and service spread, his company flourished, and – by 1902 – Matthews became a corporation.

In the early 1900s, James H. Matthews, the youngest son of the company’s founder, introduced life insurance and profit distribution for employees – a truly progressive concept for its time. But for Mr. Matthews, it was just a logical extension of one of the company’s founding principles, “what’s good for employees is good for the company and that’s good for customers.”

Matthews’ outstanding growth continued throughout the 20th century and into the 21st. When the organization first went public in 1994, it reported sales of $159 million. In 2014, Matthews achieved more than $1.1 billion in sales. Today, the company is divided into three distinct business segments: Brand Solutions, Memorialization and Industrial. It boasts more than 10,000 employees on six continents at more than 100 locations.
 

Commitment to Values

While the organization may be significantly larger and more diverse than it was in 1850, it continues to emphasize the importance of core values as the basis of individual, segment and enterprise success. It calls on every employee to:
      – always be our best
      – be honest with our customers and with each other
      – continually develop our colleagues within our company
      – look for new and innovative products and services to better serve our customers
      – be the embodiment of the ‘Spirit of Matthews.’

“At our core, we share a common purpose,” said Joseph C. Bartolacci, President and Chief Executive Officer of Matthews. “We work hard to create exceptional, high-quality products; we take great pride in our craftsmanship, across all of our businesses; and, we serve our customers and clients with unparalleled service.
