					IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE IN AND FOR NEW CASTLE COUNTY  RSUI INDEMNITY COMPANY, Plaintiff, v. SEMPRIS, LLC D/B/A BUDGET SAVERS AND PROVELL, INC. F/K/A BUDGET SAVERS, Defendants.  ) ) ) ) ) ) C.A. No. N13C-10-096 MMJ CCLD ) ) ) ) )  Submitted: June 23, 2014 Decided: September 3, 2014 Upon Sempris, LLC    s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment GRANTED Upon RSUI Indemnity Company    s Motion for Summary Judgment DENIED OPINION Brian L. Kasprzak, Esquire, Marks, O    Neill, O    Brien, Doherty & Kelly, P.C., Thomas K. Hanekamp, Esquire (argued), Kathryn A. Formeller, Esquire, Tressler LLP, Attorneys for Plaintiff Jennifer C. Wasson, Esquire, Richard L. Horwitz, Esquire, Michael B. Rush, Esquire, Potter Anderson & Corroon LLP, Craig C. Martin, Esquire, Christopher C. Dickinson, Esquire, Brienne M. Letourneau, Esquire (argued), Jenner & Block LLP, Attorneys for Defendants  JOHNSTON, J.   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL CONTEXT This insurance coverage dispute arises out of a lawsuit filed against Sempris, LLC d/b/a Budget Savers (    Sempris    ). The underlying suit, Sarah Toney, et al. v. Quality Resources, Inc., et al. (    Toney Lawsuit    ), is pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.1 RSUI Indemnity Company (    RSUI    ) issued a Directors and Officers Liability Policy to Sempris bearing policy number NHP650549 (    Policy    ). The effective Policy Period ran from March 1, 2013 through March 1, 2014. The maximum aggregate limit of liability under the Policy is $3,000,000. Sempris paid a premium of $29,400 for the Policy. Sempris tendered the Toney Lawsuit to RSUI for coverage under the Policy. RSUI has denied that it owes a duty to defend or a duty to indemnify Sempris for the Toney Lawsuit. RSUI is an insurance company organized under New Hampshire law with its principle place of business in Atlanta, Georgia. Sempris is a Delaware corporation with its principle place of business in Minnesota. The Toney Lawsuit is a putative class action alleging two claims under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (    TCPA    ), 47 U.S.C. § 227. Count I      TCPA      Do Not Call Registry      alleges that the defendants made unsolicited telemarketing phone calls to the plaintiff and the class in violation of the TCPA 47 1  Case No. 1:13-cv-42 (N.D. Ill.). 1   U.S.C. § 227(c) and 47 C.F.R § 64.1200(c). 2 Count II      TCPA      Autodialed Calls to Cell Phones      alleges that the defendants made improper calls to the plaintiff and others     cellular telephones using an automatic telephone dialing system and/or artificial or prerecorded voice, in violation of the TCPA 47 U.S.C. § 227(b) and 47 C.F.R § 64.1200(a). 3 RSUI filed this action on October 8, 2013, seeking a declaratory judgment that RSUI owes no insurance coverage obligations to Sempris or Provell, Inc. f/k/a Budget Savers (    Provell    ).  Sempris is currently the sole defendant. 4  February 28, 2014, RSUI filed a Motion for Summary Judgment.  On  Also on  February 28, 2014, Sempris filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment seeking a declaration that RSUI has a duty to defend Sempris against the underlying Toney Claim. RSUI seeks summary judgment on Count II (    No Claim First Made During the Policy Period    ); Count III (    Section IV., Exclusions, Paragraph 11 Precludes Coverage for the Toney Lawsuit    ); Count IV (    The Endorsement Titled     Exclusion      Specific     Precludes Coverage for the Toney Lawsuit    ); Count V (    Section IV., 2  Joint Stipulation of Material Facts (    JSF    ), Ex. A. ¶ 60.  3  JSF, Ex. A ¶ 79.  4  The parties entered into a Joint Stipulation and Order regarding Count I (    Provell Is Not An Insured Under the RSUI Policy    ) of the Complaint. The parties agreed that Provell is not an Insured under the Policy and is not entitled to a defense or indemnity under the Policy. 2   Exclusions, Paragraph 13.b Precludes Coverage for the Toney Lawsuit    ); and Count VI (    The Endorsement Entitled     Exclusion      Professional Errors and Omissions     Precludes Coverage for the Toney Lawsuit    ) of its Complaint for Declaratory Judgment. RSUI is also seeking summary judgment on Sempris     counterclaims for breach of contract and declaratory judgment. STANDARD OF REVIEW Summary judgment is granted only if the moving party establishes that there are no genuine issues of material fact in dispute and judgment may be granted as a matter of law. 5 All facts are viewed in a light most favorable to the non-moving party. 6 Summary judgment may not be granted if the record indicates that a material fact is in dispute, or if there is a need to clarify the application of law to the specific circumstances. 7 When the facts permit a reasonable person to draw only one inference, the question becomes one for decision as a matter of law. 8 If the non-moving party bears the burden of proof at trial, yet     fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party    s case,     then summary judgment may be granted against that party. 9  5  Super. Ct. Civ. R. 56(c).  6  Hammond v. Colt Indus. Operating Corp., 565 A.2d 558, 560 (Del. Super. 1989).  7  Super. Ct. Civ. R. 56(c).  8  Wootten v. Kiger, 226 A.2d 238, 239 (Del. 1967).  9  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986). 3   Where the parties have filed cross motions for summary judgment, and have not argued that there are genuine issues of material fact,     the Court shall deem the motions to be the equivalent of a stipulation for decision on the merits based on the record submitted with the motions.    10 Neither party's motion will be granted unless no genuine issue of material fact exists and one of the parties is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.11 ANALYSIS Contract Interpretation The parties agree that Delaware law applies to this dispute. 12 Insurance contracts     are construed as a whole, to give effect to the intention of the parties.    13 Where the language of an insurance policy is     clear and unambiguous, the parties     intent is ascertained by giving the language its ordinary and usual meaning.     14 Where the language in an insurance policy is ambiguous, it is construed in favor of the insured.15  A contract is ambiguous when the provisions at issue     are  10  Super. Ct. Civ. R. 56(h).  11  Emmons v. Hartford Underwriters Ins. Co., 697 A.2d 742, 744-45 (Del. 1997).  12  JSF ¶ 19.  13  AT&T Corp. v. Faraday Capital Ltd., 918 A.2d 1104, 1108 (Del. 2007).  14  Id.  15  Weiner v. Selective Way Ins. Co., 793 A.2d 434, 440 (Del. Super. 2002). 4   reasonably or fairly susceptible of different interpretations or may have two or more different meanings.    16 To determine if an insurer has a duty to defend or indemnify a claim asserted against a policy holder     the Court will look to the allegations in the underlying complaint to decide whether the action against the policy holder states a claim covered by the policy.     17 An insurer    s duty to defend generally is broader than its duty to indemnify. 18 An insurer    s duty to defend is triggered     where the factual allegations in the underlying complaint potentially support a covered claim.    19     [W]here there exists some doubt as to whether the complaint against the insured alleges a risk insured against, that doubt should be resolved in favor of the insured.     20 The duty to defend is broad,     if even one count or theory of plaintiff    s complaint lies within the coverage of the policy, the duty to defend arises.     21  16  Id.  17  Virtual Bus. Enter., LLC v. Maryland Cas. Co., 2010 WL 1427409, at *4 (Del. Super.). 18  Id.  19  Id.  20  Nat    l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, PA v. Rhone-Poulenc Basic Chems. Co., 1992 WL 22690, at *6 (Del. Super.) (citing Con    t Cas. Co. v. Alexis I. du Pont School Dist., 317 A.2d 101, 105 (Del. Super. 1974)). 21  Id. 5   In a coverage dispute, the insured has the burden to prove that the insurance policy    s provisions cover the claimed loss. 22 The burden then shifts to the insurer to prove that an exclusion applies to bar coverage.23 Relevant Policy Provisions The Insuring Agreement provides, in relevant part: In consideration of the payment of premium and in reliance upon all statements made to the Insurer in the Application, and subject to the terms, conditions, definitions, exclusions and limitations hereinafter provided, the Insurer agrees: * C.  *  *  With the Insured Organization that if a Claim for a Wrongful Act is first made against the Insured Organization during the Policy Period and reported in accordance with Section V.

Return of an indictment (in case of a criminal proceeding); or c. Receipt of a notice of charges; . . . *  *  *  K. Loss means damages (including back and front pay), settlements, judgments . . . and Defense Expenses. The DEFINITION of Loss shall include punitive or exemplary damages and the multiplied portion of any multiplied damage award, if and where insurable. For purposes of determining whether punitive or exemplary damages, or the multiplied portion of any multiplied damage award arising from any Claim shall be insurable by law, the Insurer agrees to abide by the law of whichever jurisdiction is applicable to such Claim and is most favorable to the Insured in that regard. *  *  *  N. Wrongful Act means any actual or alleged act, error, omission, misstatement, misleading statement, neglect or breach of duty or any actual or alleged Employment Practices Wrongful Act, by: 1. An Insured Person acting in his or her capacity as such and on behalf of the Insured Organization or any matter claimed against them solely by reason of their status as an Insured Person; or 2. The Insured Organization. Section IV. of the Policy provides, in part, the following exclusions: The Insurer shall not be liable to make any payment for Loss in connection with any Claim made against the Insured: 10.  Alleging, arising out of, based upon or attributable to, in whole or in part, any litigation involving any Insured that was 7   commenced or initiated prior to, or pending as of 02/19/03, or arising out of or based upon, in whole or in part, any facts or circumstances underlying or alleged in any such prior or pending litigation. 11.  Alleging, arising out of, based upon or attributable to, directly or indirectly, the same or essentially the same facts underlying or alleged in any matter which, prior to the inception date of this policy, has been the subject of notice to any insurer of a Claim, or a potential or threatened Claim, or an occurrence or circumstance that might give rise to a Claim under any policy of which this insurance is a renewal or replacement or which it may succeed in time; *  13.  *  *  With respect to INSURING AGREEMENT C. of this policy, only: b. For actual or alleged violation of any law, whether statutory, regulatory or common law, with respect to any of the following activities: anti-trust, business competition, unfair trade practices or tortuous interference in another    s business or contractual relationships;  The Endorsement entitled     Exclusion      Professional Errors and Omissions     provides as follows: The Insurer shall not be liable to make any payment for Loss arising out of or in connection with any Claim made against any Insured alleging, arising out of, based upon or attributable to, in whole or in part, the performance or rendering of or failure to perform professional services, where such services are undertaken for others for a fee. The Endorsement entitled     Exclusion      Specific     provides as follows: The Insurer shall not be liable to make any payment for Loss arising out of or in connection with any Claim, including but not limited to 8   any subsequent stockholders derivative or representative actions, made against any Insured alleging, arising out of, based upon or attributable to, directly or indirectly relating to: Dioquino v. Sempris, LLC, Case No. 11-CV-05556-SJO-MRW (C.D. Cal.) Daniell v. Sempris, LLC, 12-CH-44123 (Cook Cty. Ill.) Valencia v. Sempris, LLC, 12-CV-2985 (S.D. Cal.) Herman v. Sempris, LLC, 13-CV-0020 (W.D. Mich.) Section V. Conditions, paragraph B.3 of the Policy (    Deemer Clause    ) provides as follows: All Claims based on, arising out of, directly or indirectly resulting from, in consequence of, or in any way involving the same or related facts, circumstances, situations, transactions or events, or the same or related series of facts, circumstances, situations, transactions or events, shall be deemed to be a single Claim for all purposes under this policy, shall be subject to Retention stated in item 4. of the Declarations Page, and shall be deemed first made when the earliest of such Claims is first made, regardless of whether such date is before or during the Policy Period. Prior Lawsuits and the Toney Lawsuit The parties contest the impact that four prior lawsuits (    Prior Lawsuits    ) 24 have regarding RSUI    s coverage obligations for the Toney Lawsuit.   ¢ On July 6, 2011, Sempris was named as a defendant in class action lawsuit Dioquino v. Sempris, LLC. 25 The plaintiff made an outbound telephone call  24  Dioquino v. Sempris, LLC, Case No. 2:11-CV-05556-SJO-MRW (C.D. Cal.); Daniell v. Sempris, LLC, Case No. 2012-CH-44123 (Cook Cty.

Wealth Systems is a partner of Sempris. The plaintiff was subsequently charged fees for Sempris     Value Plus Membership Program.  The suit alleged fraud, negligence, unfair  competition, and violation of the Electronic Funds Transfer Act.   ¢ On December 13, 2012, Sempris was named as a defendant in class action lawsuit Daniell v. Sempris, LLC. 26 The plaintiff visited Defendant Emson    s website to order a     Super Wave Oven.     The plaintiff provided her billing information on the website. The order confirmation from Emson contained a link to an enrollment page for a Sempris Membership Program. The plaintiff did not click the link or opt in to join a Sempris membership program.  The plaintiff was subsequently charged for membership in  Sempris     Budget Savers Membership Program.  The suit alleged fraud,  deceptive business practices, breach of contract, and unjust enrichment.   ¢ On December 14, 2012, Sempris was named as a defendant in class action lawsuit Valencia v. Sempris, LLC. 27 The plaintiff saw an infomercial for Defendant Ontel Products Corporation    s (    Ontel    ) product Slushy Magic. The plaintiff placed an outbound telephone call to Ontel to order the Slushy Magic. The plaintiff, allegedly under the belief that he had qualified for a 25  Dioquino v. Sempris, LLC, Case No. 11-CV-05556-SJO-MRW (C.D. Cal.).  26  Daniell v. Sempris, LLC, 12-CH-44123 (Cook Cty. Ill.).  27  Valencia v. Sempris, LLC, 12-CV-2985 (S.D. Cal.). 10       free trial     of a program, was enrolled in Sempris Membership Program. The plaintiff did not have to repeat his billing information; however, he was charged membership fees for three months. The suit alleged violations of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act, California    s Unfair Competition Law, fraud by omission, breach of contract, and unjust enrichment.   ¢ On January 7, 2013, Sempris was named as a defendant in class action lawsuit Herman v. Sempris LLC. 28 The plaintiff saw an infomercial for Defendant Emson    s product, the Chair Gym. Herman placed an outbound telephone call to order the Chair Gym. The Emson representative told Herman that she could not authorize the purchase of the Chair Gym without enrollment in a     risk free trial     in a Sempris Membership Program. Herman only provided his billing information one time. After placing the order, Herman immediately called the number provided by the representative and canceled his membership.  Herman was subsequently charged for two  nonconsecutive months of membership. The suit alleges violations of the Michigan Consumer Protection Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, fraud by omission, and unjust enrichment.   ¢ The Toney Lawsuit was filed on October 8, 2013. The Toney Lawsuit alleges that after Ms. Toney placed an online order for Stompeez children    s 28  Herman v. Sempris, LLC, 13-CV-0020 (W.D. Mich.). 11   slippers, she received several calls on her cellular telephone from Quality Resources, Inc. (    Quality Resources    ) to verify her order information.29 Quality Resources is a third party telemarketer.30 The telephone calls at issue were allegedly made using an automated dialing system without prior consent of Ms. Toney, whose cellular telephone number was on the national Do Not Call Registry. 31 After Ms. Toney    s order was verified, the Quality Resources representative tried to sell Ms. Toney Sempris     Budget Savers goods and/or services. 32 Ms. Toney was never charged for membership in a Sempris program. The Toney Lawsuit alleges two violations of the TCPA. The Toney Lawsuit falls within the Insuring Agreement The parties agree that the Toney Lawsuit meets the definition of a Claim under the Policy and reflects alleged Wrongful Acts as defined by the Policy. 33 The Toney Lawsuit is not Related to the Prior Lawsuits RSUI argues that Toney does not meet the requirements of the Insuring Agreement.  The Insuring Agreement provides coverage     if a Claim for a  Wrongful Act is first made against the Insured Organization during the Policy  29  JSF, Ex. A, ¶¶ 22-24.  30  JSF, Ex. A, ¶ 10.  31  JSF, Ex. A, ¶¶ 9, 45.  32  JSF, Ex. A, ¶ 24.  33  JSF ¶ 14. 12   Period . . . .     RSUI contends that the Toney Lawsuit is related to the Prior Lawsuits and therefore, the Toney Lawsuit is not a Claim first made during the Policy Period.  RSUI argues that coverage is barred by Section V. Conditions,  paragraph B.3, which provides in part: All Claims based on, arising out of, directly or indirectly resulting from, in consequence of, or in any way involving the same or related facts, circumstances, situations, transactions or events, or the same or related series of circumstances, transactions or events, shall be deemed to be a single Claim for all purposes under this policy . . . and shall be deemed first made when the earliest of such Claims is first made . . . . The Policy Period ran from March 1, 2013 through March 1, 2014. The Toney Lawsuit was filed on July 31, 2013, within the Policy Period. The Prior Lawsuits were filed before the Policy Period. RSUI argues that the Court should use a broad interpretation of the phrases     arising out of     and     or in any way involving     to find that the Toney Lawsuit is related to the Prior Lawsuits. The Delaware Supreme Court found that     the term     arising out of     is broadly construed to require some meaningful linkage between the two conditions imposed in the contract.     34 The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit found that     the     or in any way involving     clause is a mop-up clause intended to exclude anything not already excluded by the other clauses.     35 34  Pacific Sun Ins. Co. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 956 A.2d 1246, 1257 (Del. 2008).  35  Clark School for Creative Learning, Inc. v. Philadelphia Indem. Ins. Co., 734 F.3d 51, 57 (1st Cir. 2013). 13   The Court recognizes the precedent instructing broad interpretation of these clauses. However, the facts alleged in Toney are different from those in the Prior Lawsuits. In Toney, an outbound call was made from an autodialer to Ms. Toney    s cellular telephone, which was listed on the National Do Not Call Registry. The underlying facts in the Prior Lawsuits, as alleged at the time the Toney Lawsuit was filed, would not give rise to a cause of action under the TCPA. RSUI relies on United Westlabs, Inc., et al. v. Greenwich Insurance Co., et al.36 in support of its position that the Toney Lawsuit is related to the Prior Lawsuits and, therefore, cannot be considered as a Claim first made within the Policy Period. In Westlabs, this Court applied an     interrelated claims     provision to bar coverage where the subsequent claim was asserted against additional defendants (who were officers of the original Defendant corporation) and included new causes of action and alleged conduct.37 United Westlabs, Inc. (    UWL    ) sought insurance coverage from two Insurers for liability and expenses stemming from UWL    s dispute with Seacoast Laboratory Data Systems (    Seacoast    ). 38  UWL commenced arbitration with  Seacoast in January 2007, alleging breach of contract. 39 Seacoast counterclaimed, 36  2011 WL 2623932 (Del. Super.).  37  Id.  38  Id. at *1.  39  Id. at *2. 14   alleging breach of contract and copyright infringement (    2007 Counterclaims    ). 40 UWL brought a claim against Seacoast in the United States District Court for the Central District of California in February 2007.41 UWL subsequently obtained insurance policies from two Insurers. UWL did not disclose its dispute with Seacoast to the Insurers.  In December 2008, UWL brought claims against  Seacoast in United States District Court for the Central District of California asserting that Seacoast breached the March 2007 Settlement Agreement.42 Seacoast filed counterclaims (    2009 Counterclaims    ) adding two UWL officers as defendants. 43 The Court found the wrongful acts giving rise to the 2007 and 2009 Counterclaims were     fundamentally identical.    44     Both involve a breach of the . . . Agreement claim, a claim for copyright infringement or     hacking,     and the same facts, circumstances, situations, transactions, and events.     45 The insurance policy at issue in Westlabs contained an Interrelated Claims provision, stating:     All Claims arising from Interrelated Wrongful Acts shall be deemed to constitute a single claim and shall be deemed to have been made at the  40  Id.  41  Id.  42  Id. at *5.  43  Id.  44  Id. at *11.  45  Id. at *14. 15   earliest time at which the earliest Claim is made . . . .     46 The Court found that Seacoast    s 2007 and 2009 Counterclaims arose from Interrelated Wrongful Acts and therefore the Counterclaims were treated as a single claim made in January 2007. 47  The Court found that coverage was barred because the claims were  deemed to have been made before the inception of UWL    s policies with both Insurers.48 Westlabs is distinguishable from this case. The underlying wrongful acts in Westlabs which gave rise to the 2007 and 2009 Counterclaims were fundamentally identical and arose from a dispute among the same parties. 49 The Court is not persuaded that the facts in this case are analogous or warrant a similar finding. The Court finds that the Prior Lawsuits are not related to the Toney Lawsuit. The Prior Lawsuits all arise out of a plaintiff contacting a third-party product vendor, and in that same transaction, the third party enrolls the plaintiff in, and initiates billing for, membership in a Sempris Membership Program. In contrast, Ms. Toney placed an online order. She subsequently was contacted by Quality Resources, a third-party telemarketer. Unlike the prior lawsuits, both claims in Toney are TCPA claims. It is this initiation of contact from an autodialer to Ms. 46  Id.  47  Id. at *15.  48  Id.  49  Id. at **14-15. 16   Toney    s cellular telephone    listed on the National Do Not Call Registry    which gave rise to the Toney Lawsuit. Further, Ms. Toney never was enrolled in a Sempris Membership Program, separating her from the fraud-based claims of the Prior Lawsuits. The date the Toney Lawsuit is deemed to have been filed is not affected by the Prior Lawsuits. The Toney Lawsuit was filed within the Policy Period, and falls within the Insuring Agreement. Exclusions do not Apply to Bar Coverage for the Toney Lawsuit The Court finds that Sempris met its burden to prove the Claim falls within the Insuring Agreement. The burden then shifts to RSUI to demonstrate that an exception applies to bar coverage.50 The Prior Notice Exclusion does not Apply to Bar Coverage RSUI has not shown that the Prior Notice Exclusion bars coverage for the Toney Lawsuit. The Prior Notice Exclusion bars coverage for a Claim     [a]lleging, arising out of, based upon or attributable to, directly or indirectly, the same or essentially the same facts underlying or alleged in any matter which, prior to the inception date of this policy, has been the subject of notice to any insurer of a Claim . . . .     As previously discussed, the Court finds that the Toney Lawsuit is based on alleged TCPA violations and does not     arise out of     the Prior Lawsuits. 50  First Bank of Del., Inc. v. Fidelity & Dep. Co. of Maryland, 2013 WL 5858794, at *3 (Del. Super.). 17   The Court has distinguished the Prior Lawsuits, which arise out of allegedly fraudulent enrollment in Sempris Membership Programs initiated through contact from the consumer. The Endorsement Entitled     Exclusion      Specific     does not Apply to Bar Coverage RSUI fails to demonstrate that the Endorsement entitled     Exclusion      Specific     bars coverage. The Exclusion      Specific provides that RSUI     shall not be liable to make any payment for Loss arising out of or in connection with any Claim . . . made against the Insured alleging, arising out of, based upon or attributable to, directly or indirectly relating to     the Prior Lawsuits. As discussed above, the Court finds the Toney Lawsuit does not arise out of the Prior Lawsuits. The Unfair Trade Practices Exclusion does not Apply to Bar Coverage RSUI fails to show that coverage is barred by the Unfair Trade Practices Exclusion. The Exclusion bars coverage:     For actual or alleged violation of any law . . . with respect to any of the following activities: . . . unfair trade practices or tortuous interference in another    s business or contractual relationships.     The Court finds that the exclusion is limited to     another    s business or contractual relationships.      The Court finds that the alleged tortious interference with an  individual, at issue in Toney, is not within the scope of the Unfair Trade Practices Exclusion.  18   The Professional Services Exclusion does not Apply to Bar Coverage RSUI fails to demonstrate that the Professional Services Exclusion applies to bar coverage. The Exclusion bars coverage for any     Claim made against any Insured alleging, arising out of, based upon or attributable to . . . the performance or rendering of or failure to perform professional services . . . .     To qualify as     Professional Services,     as defined in the Policy, services must be     undertaken for others for a fee.     The Complaint merely states:     As the company whose products and services are being sold, Budget Savers, Sempris and their clients reap the benefit of these sales calls.     Similarly, in the Prior Lawsuits the complaints do not allege that fees were paid for professional services. Based on the record, the only fees generated here are the membership fees consumers pay to Sempris. The Toney Claim alleges that Quality Resources made calls at the direction of Sempris. There is no suggestion in the complaint that Sempris provided professional services to others for a fee. Therefore, this exclusion is not applicable to the facts in the Toney Lawsuit. CONCLUSION No genuine issue of material fact exists that would prevent the Court from granting summary judgment. Sempris has met its burden to prove the Toney Lawsuit falls within the Policy    s grant of coverage. The Court finds that the Toney Lawsuit, arising from alleged violations of the TCPA, is not related to the Prior 19   Lawsuits. The Court finds that RSUI has failed to prove that any exception exists that bars coverage for the Toney Lawsuit. Counts II, III, IV, V and VI are not dismissed, as requested by RSUI. The Court finds that RSUI has a duty to defend Sempris in the underlying Toney Lawsuit. THEREFORE, RSUI    s Motion for Summary Judgment is hereby DENIED. Sempris     Motion for Partial Summary Judgment is hereby GRANTED. IT IS SO ORDERED.  /s/ _Mary M. Johnston_________ The Honorable Mary M. Johnston  20

Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

JOHNSTON, J.
                   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL CONTEXT

        This insurance coverage dispute arises out of a lawsuit filed against Sempris,

LLC d/b/a Budget Savers (“Sempris”). The underlying suit, Sarah Toney, et al. v.

Quality Resources, Inc., et al. (“Toney Lawsuit”), is pending in the United States

District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.1

        RSUI Indemnity Company (“RSUI”) issued a Directors and Officers

Liability Policy to Sempris bearing policy number NHP650549 (“Policy”). The

effective Policy Period ran from March 1, 2013 through March 1, 2014. The

maximum aggregate limit of liability under the Policy is $3,000,000. Sempris paid

a premium of $29,400 for the Policy. Sempris tendered the Toney Lawsuit to

RSUI for coverage under the Policy. RSUI has denied that it owes a duty to

defend or a duty to indemnify Sempris for the Toney Lawsuit.

        RSUI is an insurance company organized under New Hampshire law with its

principle place of business in Atlanta, Georgia. Sempris is a Delaware corporation

with its principle place of business in Minnesota.

        The Toney Lawsuit is a putative class action alleging two claims under the

Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”), 47 U.S.C. § 227. Count I – TCPA

– Do Not Call Registry – alleges that the defendants made unsolicited

telemarketing phone calls to the plaintiff and the class in violation of the TCPA 47

1
    Case No. 1:13-cv-42 (N.D. Ill.).

                                           1
U.S.C. § 227(c) and 47 C.F.R § 64.1200(c). 2 Count II – TCPA – Autodialed Calls

to Cell Phones – alleges that the defendants made improper calls to the plaintiff

and others’ cellular telephones using an automatic telephone dialing system and/or

artificial or prerecorded voice, in violation of the TCPA 47 U.S.C. § 227(b) and 47

C.F.R § 64.1200(a). 3

         RSUI filed this action on October 8, 2013, seeking a declaratory judgment

that RSUI owes no insurance coverage obligations to Sempris or Provell, Inc. f/k/a

Budget Savers (“Provell”).        Sempris is currently the sole defendant. 4     On

February 28, 2014, RSUI filed a Motion for Summary Judgment.                Also on

February 28, 2014, Sempris filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment seeking

a declaration that RSUI has a duty to defend Sempris against the underlying Toney

Claim.

         RSUI seeks summary judgment on Count II (“No Claim First Made During

the Policy Period”); Count III (“Section IV., Exclusions, Paragraph 11 Precludes

Coverage for the Toney Lawsuit”); Count IV (“The Endorsement Titled ‘Exclusion

– Specific’ Precludes Coverage for the Toney Lawsuit”); Count V (“Section IV.,


2
    Joint Stipulation of Material Facts (“JSF”), Ex. A. ¶ 60.
3
    JSF, Ex. A ¶ 79.
4
  The parties entered into a Joint Stipulation and Order regarding Count I (“Provell
Is Not An Insured Under the RSUI Policy”) of the Complaint. The parties agreed
that Provell is not an Insured under the Policy and is not entitled to a defense or
indemnity under the Policy.

                                            2
Exclusions, Paragraph 13.b Precludes Coverage for the Toney Lawsuit”); and

Count VI (“The Endorsement Entitled ‘Exclusion – Professional Errors and

Omissions’ Precludes Coverage for the Toney Lawsuit”) of its Complaint for

Declaratory Judgment. RSUI is also seeking summary judgment on Sempris’

counterclaims for breach of contract and declaratory judgment.

                                STANDARD OF REVIEW

         Summary judgment is granted only if the moving party establishes that there

are no genuine issues of material fact in dispute and judgment may be granted as a

matter of law. 5 All facts are viewed in a light most favorable to the non-moving

party. 6 Summary judgment may not be granted if the record indicates that a

material fact is in dispute, or if there is a need to clarify the application of law to

the specific circumstances. 7 When the facts permit a reasonable person to draw

only one inference, the question becomes one for decision as a matter of law. 8 If

the non-moving party bears the burden of proof at trial, yet “fails to make a

showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party’s

case,” then summary judgment may be granted against that party. 9

           Where the parties have filed cross motions for summary judgment, and have

not argued that there are genuine issues of material fact, “the Court shall deem the

motions to be the equivalent of a stipulation for decision on the merits based on the

record submitted with the motions.”10 Neither party's motion will be granted

unless no genuine issue of material fact exists and one of the parties is entitled to

judgment as a matter of law.11

                                      ANALYSIS

                                 Contract Interpretation

           The parties agree that Delaware law applies to this dispute. 12 Insurance

contracts “are construed as a whole, to give effect to the intention of the parties.”13

Where the language of an insurance policy is “clear and unambiguous, the parties’

intent is ascertained by giving the language its ordinary and usual meaning.” 14

Where the language in an insurance policy is ambiguous, it is construed in favor of

the insured.15       A contract is ambiguous when the provisions at issue “are

reasonably or fairly susceptible of different interpretations or may have two or

more different meanings.”16

           To determine if an insurer has a duty to defend or indemnify a claim asserted

against a policy holder “the Court will look to the allegations in the underlying

complaint to decide whether the action against the policy holder states a claim

covered by the policy.” 17 An insurer’s duty to defend generally is broader than its

duty to indemnify. 18 An insurer’s duty to defend is triggered “where the factual

allegations in the underlying complaint potentially support a covered claim.”19

“[W]here there exists some doubt as to whether the complaint against the insured

alleges a risk insured against, that doubt should be resolved in favor of the

insured.” 20 The duty to defend is broad, “if even one count or theory of plaintiff’s

complaint lies within the coverage of the policy, the duty to defend arises.” 21

           In a coverage dispute, the insured has the burden to prove that the insurance

policy’s provisions cover the claimed loss. 22 The burden then shifts to the insurer

to prove that an exclusion applies to bar coverage.23

The Insuring Agreement provides, in relevant part:

           In consideration of the payment of premium and in reliance upon all

            whether punitive or exemplary damages, or the multiplied portion
            of any multiplied damage award arising from any Claim shall be
            insurable by law, the Insurer agrees to abide by the law of
            whichever jurisdiction is applicable to such Claim and is most
            favorable to the Insured in that regard.

                                  *      *       *

      N. Wrongful Act means any actual or alleged act, error, omission,

                       Prior Lawsuits and the Toney Lawsuit

         competition, and violation of the Electronic Funds Transfer Act.

     • On December 13, 2012, Sempris was named as a defendant in class action

         website to order a “Super Wave Oven.” The plaintiff provided her billing

         information on the website. The order confirmation from Emson contained

         a link to an enrollment page for a Sempris Membership Program. The

         plaintiff did not click the link or opt in to join a Sempris membership

         program.    The plaintiff was subsequently charged for membership in

         Sempris’ Budget Savers Membership Program.           The suit alleged fraud,

         deceptive business practices, breach of contract, and unjust enrichment.

     • On December 14, 2012, Sempris was named as a defendant in class action

         lawsuit Valencia v. Sempris, LLC. 27 The plaintiff saw an infomercial for

         Defendant Ontel Products Corporation’s (“Ontel”) product Slushy Magic.

         The plaintiff placed an outbound telephone call to Ontel to order the Slushy

         Magic. The plaintiff, allegedly under the belief that he had qualified for a

        “free trial” of a program, was enrolled in Sempris Membership Program.

        The plaintiff did not have to repeat his billing information; however, he was

        charged membership fees for three months. The suit alleged violations of

        the Consumers Legal Remedies Act, California’s Unfair Competition Law,

        fraud by omission, breach of contract, and unjust enrichment.

     • On January 7, 2013, Sempris was named as a defendant in class action

        lawsuit Herman v. Sempris LLC. 28 The plaintiff saw an infomercial for

        Defendant Emson’s product, the Chair Gym. Herman placed an outbound

        telephone call to order the Chair Gym. The Emson representative told

        Herman that she could not authorize the purchase of the Chair Gym without

        enrollment in a “risk free trial” in a Sempris Membership Program. Herman

        only provided his billing information one time. After placing the order,

        Herman immediately called the number provided by the representative and

        canceled his membership.      Herman was subsequently charged for two

        nonconsecutive months of membership. The suit alleges violations of the

        Michigan Consumer Protection Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act,

        fraud by omission, and unjust enrichment.

     • The Toney Lawsuit was filed on October 8, 2013. The Toney Lawsuit

        alleges that after Ms. Toney placed an online order for Stompeez children’s

28
     Herman v. Sempris, LLC, 13-CV-0020 (W.D. Mich.).

                                          11
         slippers, she received several calls on her cellular telephone from Quality

         Resources, Inc. (“Quality Resources”) to verify her order information.29

         Quality Resources is a third party telemarketer.30 The telephone calls at

         issue were allegedly made using an automated dialing system without prior

         consent of Ms. Toney, whose cellular telephone number was on the national

         Do Not Call Registry. 31 After Ms. Toney’s order was verified, the Quality

         Resources representative tried to sell Ms. Toney Sempris’ Budget Savers

         goods and/or services. 32 Ms. Toney was never charged for membership in a

         Sempris program. The Toney Lawsuit alleges two violations of the TCPA.

                 The Toney Lawsuit falls within the Insuring Agreement

         The parties agree that the Toney Lawsuit meets the definition of a Claim

under the Policy and reflects alleged Wrongful Acts as defined by the Policy. 33

                  The Toney Lawsuit is not Related to the Prior Lawsuits

         RSUI argues that Toney does not meet the requirements of the Insuring

Agreement.        The Insuring Agreement provides coverage “if a Claim for a

Wrongful Act is first made against the Insured Organization during the Policy

Period . . . .” RSUI contends that the Toney Lawsuit is related to the Prior

Lawsuits and therefore, the Toney Lawsuit is not a Claim first made during the

Policy Period.      RSUI argues that coverage is barred by Section V. Conditions,

paragraph B.3, which provides in part:

         All Claims based on, arising out of, directly or indirectly resulting
         from, in consequence of, or in any way involving the same or related
         facts, circumstances, situations, transactions or events, or the same or
         related series of circumstances, transactions or events, shall be
         deemed to be a single Claim for all purposes under this policy . . . and
         shall be deemed first made when the earliest of such Claims is first
         made . . . .

The Policy Period ran from March 1, 2013 through March 1, 2014. The Toney

Lawsuit was filed on July 31, 2013, within the Policy Period. The Prior Lawsuits

were filed before the Policy Period.

         RSUI argues that the Court should use a broad interpretation of the phrases

“arising out of” and “or in any way involving” to find that the Toney Lawsuit is

related to the Prior Lawsuits. The Delaware Supreme Court found that “the term

‘arising out of’ is broadly construed to require some meaningful linkage between

the two conditions imposed in the contract.” 34 The United States Court of Appeals

for the First Circuit found that “the ‘or in any way involving’ clause is a mop-up

clause intended to exclude anything not already excluded by the other clauses.” 35

                                           13
           The Court recognizes the precedent instructing broad interpretation of these

clauses. However, the facts alleged in Toney are different from those in the Prior

Lawsuits. In Toney, an outbound call was made from an autodialer to Ms. Toney’s

cellular telephone, which was listed on the National Do Not Call Registry. The

underlying facts in the Prior Lawsuits, as alleged at the time the Toney Lawsuit

was filed, would not give rise to a cause of action under the TCPA.

           RSUI relies on United Westlabs, Inc., et al. v. Greenwich Insurance Co., et

al.36 in support of its position that the Toney Lawsuit is related to the Prior

Lawsuits and, therefore, cannot be considered as a Claim first made within the

Policy Period. In Westlabs, this Court applied an “interrelated claims” provision to

bar coverage where the subsequent claim was asserted against additional

defendants (who were officers of the original Defendant corporation) and included

new causes of action and alleged conduct.37

           United Westlabs, Inc. (“UWL”) sought insurance coverage from two

Insurers for liability and expenses stemming from UWL’s dispute with Seacoast

Laboratory Data Systems (“Seacoast”). 38          UWL commenced arbitration with

Seacoast in January 2007, alleging breach of contract. 39 Seacoast counterclaimed,

alleging breach of contract and copyright infringement (“2007 Counterclaims”). 40

UWL brought a claim against Seacoast in the United States District Court for the

Central District of California in February 2007.41 UWL subsequently obtained

insurance policies from two Insurers. UWL did not disclose its dispute with

Seacoast to the Insurers.        In December 2008, UWL brought claims against

Seacoast in United States District Court for the Central District of California

asserting that Seacoast breached the March 2007 Settlement Agreement.42

Seacoast filed counterclaims (“2009 Counterclaims”) adding two UWL officers as

defendants. 43 The Court found the wrongful acts giving rise to the 2007 and 2009

Counterclaims were “fundamentally identical.”44 “Both involve a breach of the . . .

Agreement claim, a claim for copyright infringement or ‘hacking,’ and the same

facts, circumstances, situations, transactions, and events.” 45

           The insurance policy at issue in Westlabs contained an Interrelated Claims

provision, stating: “All Claims arising from Interrelated Wrongful Acts shall be

deemed to constitute a single claim and shall be deemed to have been made at the

earliest time at which the earliest Claim is made . . . .” 46 The Court found that

Seacoast’s 2007 and 2009 Counterclaims arose from Interrelated Wrongful Acts

and therefore the Counterclaims were treated as a single claim made in January

2007. 47      The Court found that coverage was barred because the claims were

deemed to have been made before the inception of UWL’s policies with both

Insurers.48

           Westlabs is distinguishable from this case. The underlying wrongful acts in

Westlabs which gave rise to the 2007 and 2009 Counterclaims were fundamentally

identical and arose from a dispute among the same parties. 49 The Court is not

persuaded that the facts in this case are analogous or warrant a similar finding.

           The Court finds that the Prior Lawsuits are not related to the Toney Lawsuit.

The Prior Lawsuits all arise out of a plaintiff contacting a third-party product

vendor, and in that same transaction, the third party enrolls the plaintiff in, and

initiates billing for, membership in a Sempris Membership Program. In contrast,

Ms. Toney placed an online order. She subsequently was contacted by Quality

Resources, a third-party telemarketer. Unlike the prior lawsuits, both claims in

Toney are TCPA claims. It is this initiation of contact from an autodialer to Ms.

Toney’s cellular telephone—listed on the National Do Not Call Registry—which

gave rise to the Toney Lawsuit. Further, Ms. Toney never was enrolled in a

Sempris Membership Program, separating her from the fraud-based claims of the

Prior Lawsuits.

      The date the Toney Lawsuit is deemed to have been filed is not affected by

the Prior Lawsuits. The Toney Lawsuit was filed within the Policy Period, and

falls within the Insuring Agreement.

        Exclusions do not Apply to Bar Coverage for the Toney Lawsuit

      The Court finds that Sempris met its burden to prove the Claim falls within

the Insuring Agreement. The burden then shifts to RSUI to demonstrate that an

exception applies to bar coverage.50

           The Prior Notice Exclusion does not Apply to Bar Coverage

      RSUI has not shown that the Prior Notice Exclusion bars coverage for the

Toney Lawsuit. The Prior Notice Exclusion bars coverage for a Claim “[a]lleging,

arising out of, based upon or attributable to, directly or indirectly, the same or

essentially the same facts underlying or alleged in any matter which, prior to the

inception date of this policy, has been the subject of notice to any insurer of a

Claim . . . .” As previously discussed, the Court finds that the Toney Lawsuit is

based on alleged TCPA violations and does not “arise out of” the Prior Lawsuits.
50
   First Bank of Del., Inc. v. Fidelity & Dep. Co. of Maryland, 2013 WL 5858794,
at *3 (Del. Super.).

                                       17
The Court has distinguished the Prior Lawsuits, which arise out of allegedly

fraudulent enrollment in Sempris Membership Programs initiated through contact

from the consumer.

The Endorsement Entitled “Exclusion – Specific” does not Apply to Bar Coverage

      RSUI fails to demonstrate that the Endorsement entitled “Exclusion –

Specific” bars coverage. The Exclusion – Specific provides that RSUI “shall not

be liable to make any payment for Loss arising out of or in connection with any

Claim . . . made against the Insured alleging, arising out of, based upon or

attributable to, directly or indirectly relating to” the Prior Lawsuits. As discussed

above, the Court finds the Toney Lawsuit does not arise out of the Prior Lawsuits.

      The Unfair Trade Practices Exclusion does not Apply to Bar Coverage

      RSUI fails to show that coverage is barred by the Unfair Trade Practices

Exclusion. The Exclusion bars coverage: “For actual or alleged violation of any

law . . . with respect to any of the following activities: . . . unfair trade practices or

tortuous interference in another’s business or contractual relationships.” The Court

finds that the exclusion is limited to “another’s business or contractual

relationships.”   The Court finds that the alleged tortious interference with an

individual, at issue in Toney, is not within the scope of the Unfair Trade Practices

Exclusion.




                                           18
       The Professional Services Exclusion does not Apply to Bar Coverage

      RSUI fails to demonstrate that the Professional Services Exclusion applies to

bar coverage. The Exclusion bars coverage for any “Claim made against any

Insured alleging, arising out of, based upon or attributable to . . . the performance

or rendering of or failure to perform professional services . . . .” To qualify as

“Professional Services,” as defined in the Policy, services must be “undertaken for

others for a fee.” The Complaint merely states: “As the company whose products

and services are being sold, Budget Savers, Sempris and their clients reap the

benefit of these sales calls.” Similarly, in the Prior Lawsuits the complaints do not

allege that fees were paid for professional services. Based on the record, the only

fees generated here are the membership fees consumers pay to Sempris. The

Toney Claim alleges that Quality Resources made calls at the direction of Sempris.

There is no suggestion in the complaint that Sempris provided professional

services to others for a fee. Therefore, this exclusion is not applicable to the facts

in the Toney Lawsuit.

                                  CONCLUSION

      No genuine issue of material fact exists that would prevent the Court from

granting summary judgment. Sempris has met its burden to prove the Toney

Lawsuit falls within the Policy’s grant of coverage. The Court finds that the Toney

Lawsuit, arising from alleged violations of the TCPA, is not related to the Prior


                                         19
Lawsuits. The Court finds that RSUI has failed to prove that any exception exists

that bars coverage for the Toney Lawsuit. Counts II, III, IV, V and VI are not

dismissed, as requested by RSUI. The Court finds that RSUI has a duty to defend

Sempris in the underlying Toney Lawsuit.

      THEREFORE, RSUI’s Motion for Summary Judgment is hereby

DENIED. Sempris’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment is hereby GRANTED.

      IT IS SO ORDERED.

RSUI INDEMNITY COMPANY, INC., Plaintiff,
v.
VISION ONE, LLC, et al., Defendants.


United States District Court, W.D. Washington, Seattle.
February 21, 2013.









ORDER GRANTING IN PART DEFENDANTS' MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
ROBERT S. LASNIK, District Judge.
This matter comes before the Court on the "Motion By Vision One and Berg Equipment for Lifting of Stay and For Certain Rulings Based on Outcome of RSUI's State Court Appeal" (Dkt. # 123). In February 2010, the Court stayed this case pending the outcome of Plaintiff RSUI Indemnity Company, Inc.'s ("RSUI") appeal of the state court decision that the underlying settlement agreement between Defendants Vision One, LLC ("Vision One") and Berg Equipment & Scaffolding Co., Inc. ("Berg") (collectively "Defendants") was reasonable. The Court of Appeals of the State of Washington affirmed the trial court's reasonableness determination and issued its mandate on August 28, 2012. Notice (Dkt. # 125-1). On October 29, 2012, the Court held a status conference, during which the Court granted Defendant Vision One's request to lift the stay, and based on the parties' agreement, allowed the parties to submit additional briefing regarding Vision One's motion for summary judgment regarding damages.
The Court described the background facts underlying this matter in the Court's "Order on Cross Motions Regarding Coverage" (Dkt. # 81). It will not repeat those facts here.
Vision One seeks summary judgment that the presumptive measure of RSUI's liability in this case is $2.3 million, the value of the settlement between Vision One and Berg in the underlying litigation. RSUI opposes Vision One's motion on the basis that there must be a finding of bad faith before the presumptive value of the damages may exceed the limits of the underlying insurance policy.
The Court, having reviewed the memoranda, supporting documents, and the remainder of the record, GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART Vision One's motion.
II. ANALYSIS
A. Summary Judgment Standard
Summary judgment is appropriate when, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, the records show that "there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The party seeking summary dismissal of the case "bears the initial responsibility of informing the district court of the basis for its motion," Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986), and identifying those portions of the materials in the record that show the absence of a genuine issue of fact, Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1). Once the moving party has satisfied its burden, it is entitled to summary judgment if the non-moving party fails to designate "specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 324. "The mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the non-moving party's position is not sufficient." Triton Energy Corp. v. Square D Co., 68 F.3d 1216, 1221 (9th Cir. 1995). "[S]ummary judgment should be granted where the nonmoving party fails to offer evidence from which a reasonable jury could return a verdict in its favor." T.W. Elec. Serv., Inc. v. Pac. Elec. Contractors Ass'n, 809 F.2d 626, 631 (9th Cir. 1987).
B. Presumptive Damages
Under Washington law, an insured defendant may independently negotiate a settlement if the insurer declines in bad faith to participate in the liability action, and then seek recovery from the insurer in a bad faith action. Besel v. Viking Ins. Co., 146 Wn.2d 730, 736 (2002). The presumptive measure of damages in the bad faith action is the settlement amount, as long as the settlement is reasonable and not the product of fraud or collusion. Id. This type of settlement agreement, often called a covenant judgment, includes three features: "(1) a stipulated or consent judgment between the plaintiff and the insured, (2) a plaintiff's covenant not to execute on that judgment against the insured, and (3) an assignment to the plaintiff of the insured's coverage and bad faith claims against the insurer." Bird v. Best Plumbing Group, LLC, 175 Wn.2d 756, 764-65, 287 P.3d 551 (2012) (en banc).
RSUI opposes Vision One's request for presumptive damages first, on the basis that presumptive damages are not appropriate in this case because Berg, and therefore Vision One as Berg's assignee, has not been harmed by the underlying litigation. Response (Dkt. # 134) at 12. However, Washington courts have repeatedly rejected this argument, finding that "[an] agreement not to execute does not preclude a showing of harm." Besel, 146 Wn.2d at 737 (alteration in original) (quoting Safeco Ins. Co. of Am. v. Butler, 118 Wn.2d 383, 397 (1992)). "[A] covenant not to execute coupled with an assignment and settlement agreement is not a release permitting the insurer to escape its obligation." Kagel v. Aetna Life & Cas. Co., 40 Wn.App. 194, 198 (1985).
Second, RSUI contends that even if presumptive damages are appropriate in this case, the amount of the presumed damages cannot exceed the $1 million limit of Berg's policy with RSUI, absent a finding of bad faith. Response at 6-10. Vision One, relying primarily on Mut. of Enumclaw Ins. Co. v. T&G Const., Inc., 165 Wn.2d 255 (2008), argues that this Court's earlier finding of coverage under the RSUI policy and the recent appellate court decision affirming the trial court's reasonableness finding mandate a finding that the presumptive measure of RSUI's liability in this case is $2.3 million, the settlement value. Motion (Dkt. # 123) 6-11.
In T&G Construction, the insurance company defended the insured in the liability case, but neglected to participate in the final round of settlement negotiations. T&G Construction, 165 Wn.2d at 259. The parties settled for $3.3 million and the insurance company challenged the reasonableness of the settlement. The trial court found the settlement reasonable, but later reduced the settlement to $3 million on the insurer's motion for reconsideration. In a separate coverage action, the insurer objected to paying the amount of the settlement, contending that the policy only obligated it to "pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of. . . property damage," and the insurer believed that the insured should have prevailed on an affirmative defense. Id. at 262-63 (quotations omitted). The Washington Supreme Court disagreed, finding that "[w]hen the insurer had an opportunity to be involved in a settlement fixing the insured's liability, and that settlement is judged reasonable by a judge, then it is appropriate to use the fact of settlement to establish liability and the amount of settlement as the presumptive damage award for purposes of coverage." Id. at 267. Here, there is no indication that the covenant judgment was the product of fraud or collusion and the state appellate court recently upheld the lower court's finding that it was reasonable. The Court, therefore, finds that presumptive damages are appropriate in this case.
Having found that damages may be presumed in this case, the Court now must determine the amount of presumptive damages. Unlike the present case, T&G Construction did not involve a covenant judgment that exceeded the insured's policy limits. Vision One concedes that T&G Construction does not expressly address the circumstances presented here, but it concludes that the Washington Supreme Court nevertheless intended its holding in that case to apply to situations in which the covenant judgment is higher than the insured's policy limits. Reply (Dkt. # 136) at 6-7. The Court disagrees.
In T&G Construction, the court extended its earlier decision in Besel that a covenant judgment in the liability case establishes the presumptive damages in subsequent bad faith actions to situations in which the insurer did not act in bad faith. In Besel, the court expressly required a finding of bad faith before allowing the insured to recover more than the policy limits. Besel, 146 Wn.2d at 740 ("Because [the insurer] acted in bad faith, [it] is liable for the entire amount of the settlement."). The court reassured insurers that they can avoid this extreme result by acting in good faith. Id.
Furthermore, in T&G Construction, the court refers to situations in which a plaintiff may recover more than the policy limits to distinguish certain coverage issues from those present in the case before it. The court, in a footnote, affirmed the appellate court's finding that coverage by estoppel is only applicable when the insurer acts in bad faith and therefore, did not apply to the case before it. In making this distinction, the court explained that "[f]urther, coverage by estoppel will require the insurer to pay all damages regardless of policy limits." T&G Construction, 165 Wn.2d at 267 n.4. That the court expressly distinguished the present coverage issues from those involving bad faith and coverage by estoppel by that doctrine's ability to reach beyond the insured's policy limits suggests that the court did not intend its holding to apply to situations in which the covenant judgment exceeds the policy limits. See id.
In addition to relying on T&G Construction, Vision One recommends that the Court follow the reasoning of a 1978 New Hampshire case, Lawton v. Great Southwest Fire Ins. Co., 118 N.H. 607, 392 A.2d 576 (1978). However, Lawton does not support the broad ruling that Vision One seeks. In Lawton, the New Hampshire Supreme Court determined that an insured's breach of contract claim seeking damages in excess of his insurance policy limits survives a motion to dismiss. Lawton, 118 N.H. at 612-13. On the defendant's motion to dismiss, the court held that the plaintiff may be able to recover damages in addition to the policy limits, not that he was entitled to such damages. Id. ("Whether the [insurer's] delay was in fact in bad faith, whether the damages alleged to have resulted from the delay were in fact foreseeable, and whether these damages could have been avoided with reasonable efforts by the insured are questions for the jury."). Lawton does not stand for the proposition that an insured is presumptively entitled to damages exceeding the policy limits based on a covenant judgment.
Consistent with Lawton, this Court's decision does not preclude an award of damages greater than $1 million. Despite this Court's earlier ruling that RSUI did not act in bad faith by making an unreasonable coverage determination, Vision One may still be able to establish RSUI's bad faith based on its failure to investigate, Order (Dkt. # 82) at 6-8, which could enable Vision One to recover more than the policy limits. Besel, 146 Wn.2d at 737 ("The principles in Butler do not depend on how an insurer acted in bad faith. Rather, the principles apply whenever an insurer acts in bad faith, whether by poorly defending a claim under a reservation of rights, refusing to defend a claim, or failing to properly investigate a claim.") (citations omitted). Vision One's bad faith claim based on RSUI's failure to investigate and post-denial conduct remain for trial and thus, Vision One may pursue the additional $1.3 million, but it must establish that RSUI acted in bad faith before it will be entitled to such damages. The Court, therefore, GRANTS IN PART Vision One's motion to set the amount of RSUI's presumptive liability above the express policy limits.1
C. Pre-Judgment Interest
In addition to seeking presumptive damages equal to the total covenant judgment, Vision One argues that it is entitled to prejudgment interest at the rate of 12% per year since the date of the reasonableness hearing in the underlying superior court case. Motion at 11-12. RSUI contends that the amount RSUI owes Vision One, if anything, is not liquidated and therefore, there is no justification for prejudgment interest. Response at 14-15.
A party is entitled to prejudgment interest where the amount due is "liquidated." Prier v. Refrigeration Eng'g Co., 74 Wn.2d 25, 32 (1968). A claim is "liquidated" where "the evidence furnishes data which, if believed, make it possible to compute the amount due with exactness, without reliance on opinion or discretion." Id. Even if the claim is disputed, it may still be liquidated. Weyerhaeuser Co. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., 142 Wn.2d 654, 685 (2000) (quoting Prier, 74 Wn.2d at 33).
RSUI argues that even if the covenant judgment sets the presumptive measure of damages in this case, the presumptive amount of damages is not liquidated because it constitutes "some indeterminate amalgamation of putative contract and tort damages." Response at 15. However, the Washington Court of Appeals has addressed a similar situation in an action concerning indemnification for a settlement in an underlying case. See King Cnty v. Puget Sound Power & Light Co., 70 Wn.App. 58 (1993). In Puget Sound Power, the trial court interpreted an indemnity agreement to require the defendant to fully reimburse the plaintiff for the earlier settlement with a third party and the court ordered the defendant to pay prejudgment interest from the date of the settlement. Puget Sound Power, 70 Wn. App. at 60. The appellate court upheld the trial court's award of prejudgment interest, stating that
a claim for a definite sum due to the plaintiff is still liquidated although the facts upon which the claim is based may be disputed, and even though the adversary successfully challenges the amount and succeeds in reducing it .... In short, it is the character of the claim and not of the defense that is determinative of the question whether an amount of money sued for is a `liquidated sum.'
Id. at 62-63 (emphasis in original) (quoting Prier, 74 Wn.2d at 33). As the Washington Supreme Court stated in Prier, the award of prejudgment interest "has been based upon the view that one who has had the use of money owing to another should in justice make compensation for its wrongful detention." Prier, 74 Wn. 2d at 32. Having determined that coverage existed and that the presumptive measure of damages is the policy limit, the Court finds that the amount Vision One seeks to recover is a "liquidated sum," and therefore, Vision One is entitled to prejudgment interest.
Having found that Vision One is entitled to prejudgment interest, the Court must determine the applicable rate. Even if Vision One is entitled to prejudgment interest on a liquidated amount, RSUI contends, the applicable rate is the rate set forth in RCW 4.56.110(3)(b) for tort claims, not 12 percent. Id. at 16. Vision One argues that the rates in RCW 4.56.110 apply to postjudgment interest, not prejudgment interest, and the applicable rate is 12 percent per year, as described in RCW 19.52.010. Reply at 10.
Contrary to Vision One's argument, Washington courts use RCW 4.56.110 to determine the applicable prejudgment interest rate. Unigard Ins. Co. v. Mut. of Enumclaw Ins. Co., 160 Wn.App. 912, 925 (2011). Therefore, the relevant inquiry is whether RCW 4.56.110(3)(b) or RCW 4.56.110(4) applies to this case. RCW 4.56.110(3)(b) (setting interest rate for tort claims); RCW 4.56.110(4) (catch all provision setting the interest rate for judgments not described elsewhere in statute at 12%).
"A `mixed judgment,' a judgment based on more than one type of claim, is subject to only one interest rate. Unigard, 160 Wn. App. at 925. To determine which interest rate is the controlling interest rate, courts examine the components of the final judgment to determine the primary basis of the judgment, and therefore, the most applicable interest rate. Woo v. Fireman's Fund Ins. Co., 150 Wn.App. 158, 173 (2009).
While the Court finds that the presumptive amount of damages in this case is $1 million, the Court is not in a position to determine the applicable prejudgment interest rate because the components of the final judgment are unknown. Vision One's bad faith claims and related CPA claims remain for trial. Order (Dkt. # 82). The Court therefore, GRANTS IN PART Vision One's request for prejudgment interest and declines to set the rate until each component of the judgment is known.
III. CONCLUSION
For all the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART Vision One's motion regarding damages (Dkt. # 123). The Court GRANTS Vision One's request to set the presumptive value of damages and DENIES Vision One's request to set the presumptive value of damages above Berg's policy limits. The presumptive measure of damages in this case is $1 million. The Court GRANTS Vision One's request for prejudgment interest, but declines to set the rate until the full extent of the damages is determined.


FootNotes 
1. Vision One requests for the first time in its reply that the Court certify to the Washington Supreme Court the question of whether a covenant judgment can set the presumptive damages above the policy limits absent a finding of bad faith. Reply at 7. The Court is not persuaded that the law in this case is either unascertainable or not clearly determined. Therefore, the Court declines to certify the issue.
