Dr. Osborn performed a laminectomy of L2-L5 vertebrae and spinal fusion.  I had slight scoliosis which he also straightened out.  From the very first visit I have felt completely confident with Dr. Osborn as my Physician and also with Jeffrey Trimble.  In short I have gone from being in constant pain to being pain free.  I have had some ghost pain which is expected.  I have my life back thanks to Dr. Osborn!!!  55-Robert in Marietta, ga | Jan 25, 2017Dr Osborn has performed 2 surgeries on me. Both were successful and free of any complications. He is one of the most caring physicians I have ever met. And time I had a test or film he would call the next day after officie hours with the results. He would stay on the phone as long as I needed to feel comfortable with the results  and plan of treatment. His office staff is proficient and caring. I have never had to  wait more than 5-10 minutes past my appointment time to be seen.Have you seen Dr. Keith Osborn, MD?Leave a Review.Are you Dr. Osborn?Make it easy for patients to share their feedback.

Healthgrades also receives sanction and malpractice data throughout the year, depending on how frequently the state medical boards release updates. We remove a newly sanctioned doctor from the Recognized Doctor list as soon as we receive the information. However, it is important to note that malpractice information is publically available in only 14 states.Media & PublicationsDr. Osborn has no media or publications listed.Background Check 0 Malpractice ClaimsNo malpractice history found for Georgia.What is medical malpracticeWhat is medical malpractice?Medical malpractice is issued when negligence by a doctor causes injury to a patient. For example, a doctor may improperly diagnose, treat or medicate outside the standard of medical care. The three types of malpractice are: a settlement, an arbitration award, or a judgment.If my doctor has malpractice history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact the quality of care you receive. Claim settlements and arbitration awards may occur for a variety of reasons, which should not necessarily reflect negatively on the doctor's professional competence or conduct.You may want to use this information to start a discussion with the doctor about his or her history and specific ability to provide healthcare for you.How far back does Healthgrades malpractice history go?Healthgrades reports details of a doctor’s malpractice history when the doctor has at least one closed medical malpractice claim within the last five years, even if he or she no longer practices in that state.For which states does Healthgrades collect malpractice history?Healthgrades collects malpractice information from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia. If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact your quality of care. Sometimes multiple states report the same claim. If a provider practices in a state where data is unavailable, please reach out to your local state legislature to help make this data publicly available.0SanctionsNo sanctions history found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What is a sanction or disciplinary actionWhat is a sanction or disciplinary action?A sanction, also known as a disciplinary action, is an action taken to punish or restrict a doctor who has demonstrated professional misconduct. Sanctions may be imposed by a state medical board, professional medical licensing organization, or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.If my doctor has sanction history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a sanction, it does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor-quality doctor. Some sanctions are not related to medical care, and involve a doctor’s finances or administrative activities. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, we recommend that you evaluate the doctor’s sanction information and determine how severe or relevant you think the sanction cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades sanction history go?Healthgrades reports state and federal sanctions from the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect sanction history?Healthgrades collects sanction history from all 50 U.S. states. Physicians with a disciplinary action in one state may move to another state where they have a clean record. Since Healthgrades painstakingly compiles disciplinary action information from all 50 states, Healthgrades website will show if a physician has a disciplinary action in more than one state.0Board ActionsNo board actions found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What are board actionsWhat are board actions?Board actions are non-disciplinary actions imposed upon a doctor based on a complaint investigation. A patient or medical colleague may file a complaint with that state medical board or professional licensing organization, which then investigates the complaint. Board actions are intended to ensure that a doctor is able to perform safe medical and health care tasks.Types of non-disciplinary actions include an advisory letter, a corrective action agreement, a limitation or restriction on the medical or healthcare tasks a doctor can perform, or a voluntary agreement by the doctor not to practice. A board action can also include a termination of a corrective action agreement or voluntary agreement, which allows the doctor to return to full practice.If my doctor has a board action, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a board action, it means he or she has had a non-disciplinary action imposed upon him or her. It does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor quality doctor. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, evaluate the doctor's board action information and determine how severe or relevant you think the cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades non-disciplinary board action history go?Healthgrades reports non-disciplinary board action history from for the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect non-disciplinary board actions?Healthgrades collects non-disciplinary board actions from all 50 U.S. states.Board CertificationsWhy It Matters: Dr. Osborn's Board CertificationsBoard certification should be one of your top considerations when choosing a doctor.

More Why It Matters: Dr. Osborn's Board CertificationsBoard certification should be one of your top considerations when choosing a doctor. Board certification is an official recognition given to doctors who have met specific requirements set by national medical specialty boards in the United States.Board certification indicates that a doctor is highly qualified in the medical field in which he or she practices.

Orthopedic Surgery 

                                As an orthopedic surgeon in Georgia, Dr. Osborn is trained to detect and treat all forms of damage to the musculoskeletal system, including the tendons, ligaments, joints, bones, and muscles. Once a diagnosis has been achieved, Dr. Osborn will typically resort to surgery when other treatment plans have been exhausted or eliminated. Patients may require the attention of an orthopedic surgeon for sports injuries, sprains, torn ligaments, fractures, and more.

KressOrthopedic Surgeon27 reviewsRatings for Dr. Keith D. Osborn 5Staff 5Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeDr. Osborn did my spinal fusion surgery in 1993...L4 & L5 lamimectomy with fusion. I found him to be very kind, informative, and helpful during and after my surgery. He was always present for follow-up visits and answered any, and all concerns I had at the time. Now, 17 years later, I am looking at cervical fusion and have absolutely NO hesitation about using Dr. Osborn again. If my neck surgery goes as well as my lower back surgery did, I look forward to a much better quality of life than the one I have now. I have complete confidence in Dr. Osborn and would not use anyone else!Was this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted February 24, 2017 1Staff 2Punctuality 1Helpfulness 1KnowledgeMade an appointment to see Dr Osborne, after 5 visits I never clapped eyes on him, saw his PA, was passed from one Doctor to the next, when I had a question about a procedure the answer was inaccurate from the staff and left me upset and frustrated. Without ever seeing me Dr Osborne made a determination on my mobility condition. The whole experience was a series of frustration and annoyance, will not go back, never, saw Dr Osborne. Was this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted October 14, 2016 5Staff 5Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeI have been a patient for 19 years, he has guided me through major pain. I now have no leg or lower back pain! Thanks Dr. Osborn.....Was this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted July 27, 2016 5Staff 5Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeSucceeded in relief of my pain when no one else could.Was this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted November 13, 2014 5Staff 5Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeMy name is Michael Doctor Osborn is a layer back kind of a man. He is a great listener and a great Doctor. He preform surgery on my L-3,4 and L-4,5.I know longer have the pain in my legs. Thanks Doc!Was this rating useful? 1 flag | Submitted May 29, 2014 1Staff 1Punctuality 1Helpfulness 1KnowledgeThis Doctor did surgery on me and made it worst. Including is nurse who treated me horrible. When I told them that my pain is worst now after the surgery than before the surgery. I got told to go and find a pain management Doctor. As, I sit every night crying my self to sleep, because I hurt so bad. All I can think of I hope he would feel every bit of my pain 10 x the amount. including his family.Was this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted February 4, 2014 5Staff 5Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeInjured in 3 years ago at work. After taking an MRI was told by 3 different doctors I needed Cervical surgery. I have never had surgery & this was really shocking news. Dr Osborn did not push me nor did he try to convince me to have surgery. Dr Osborn is conservative & we tried other treatment options which in the end did not work for me. After several office visits & listening to the wife, I finally had the surgery & it went very well. Dr. Osborn & all the folks at Saint Joseph Hosp were just awesome. Just let me say this. If you are scared of having lower back or cervical surgery or are unsure/scared, please give Dr Osborn a shot at your treatment. Being a military veteran I did not trust doctors, that is until I met Dr Osborn & had him perform surgery on me. I placed my trust in him & he came tru with flying colors.Was this rating useful? 1 flag | Submitted November 23, 2012 Rate this DoctorDr. Keith D.

The information in this online directory is updated periodically. The availability of physicians, hospitals, providers, and services may change. Before receiving care at a facility, select that location in our directory and verify the accepted plan types under "About this facility" to make sure it is available in your plan.  If no plan types are listed, the facility is available for all plan types.
Kaiser Permanente uses the same quality, member experience, or cost-related measures to select practitioners and facilities in Marketplace Silver-tier plans as it does for all other Kaiser Foundation Health Plan (KFHP) products and lines of business. Members enrolled in KFHP Marketplace plans have access to all professional, institutional and ancillary health care providers who participate in KFHP plans' contracted provider network, in accordance with the terms of the members' KFHP plan of coverage. All Kaiser Permanente Medical Group physicians and network physicians are subject to the same quality review processes and certifications.
Kaiser Permanente uses the same geographic distribution consideration to select hospitals in Marketplace plans as it does for all other Kaiser Foundation Health Plan (KFHP) products and lines of business.
Information about a practitioner is provided to us by the practitioner or the practitioner's network, or is obtained as part of the credentialing process. Board certification may not reflect contracted services available from practitioners listed in our directory.

In addition to comparing prices, it's important to compare the coverages that would be provided by each policy. Because the kinds of protections — and how much coverage they'll offer — can vary between policies, you'll likely want to ensure you're making an apples-to-apples comparison as you decide which policy best fits your needs.Learn More Car Insurance for College StudentsWhen you think about college, you may think about choosing a school, how to decorate a dorm or apartment and what classes to take. Car insurance may not be on your radar, but it's something you should review if you're heading off to school. You may be eligible for discounts, especially if you're not bringing a car to campus or if you maintain good grades. Be smart and call me before you start your school year!Learn More Rent Or Own CalculatorIf you're wondering whether you should rent or own, there's a lot to consider. Aside from whether the space is right for you, how much maintenance you want to be responsible for and how to decorate, this decision can have financial implications. You'll need to consider monthly as well as long-term expenses in your decision. Use this calculator to help you compare the costs and whether renting or buying makes the most sense for you.Learn More New ParentsWhen you find out a new baby is on the way, you'll probably dive head-first into decorating the baby's room, researching the perfect stroller and stocking up on diapers.
