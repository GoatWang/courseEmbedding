unreasonably withheld, to be used in connection with the marketing and          
distribution of the Phoenix Contract. PLIC and PHLVIC shall retain the sole     
ownership of the Phoenix Contract logo.                                         

Section 1.3 General Design of Phoenix Contract                            

(a) PLIC and PHLVIC will design the Phoenix Contract based on the   
 Monument Advisor Contract. PLIC and PHLVIC will design the Phoenix Contract
to include the standard features of a variable annuity contract, including
an accumulation phase,

annuitization phase, and a death benefit equal to account value. In       
addition, the Phoenix Contract will provide a GMWB rider for a separate   
charge. The Parties will use commercially reasonable efforts to offer the 
GMWB at launch.                                                           

     (b) The Phoenix Contract will initially offer as investment options those
 portfolios (the "Portfolios") of mutual funds (the "Underlying Funds") that
are mutually agreed upon by the Parties. The initial Phoenix Contract     
 design, Portfolios and Underlying Funds will be mutually agreed upon within
forty five days of the date of this Agreement.                            

     (c) Neither PLIC nor PHLVIC will add, remove or modify any Portfolios, or
Underlying Funds without the consent of Jefferson National, which consent 
shall not be unreasonably withheld.                                       

   (d) The Parties currently anticipate that the initial pricing structure
of the Phoenix Contract will be the same as that of the Monument Advisor  
  Contract, with the exception of an additional charge for the GMWB; provided,
however, that PLIC and PHLVIC shall have the right, subject to prior      
approval by Jefferson National, such approval not to be unreasonably      
withheld, to (i) establish a different initial pricing structure for the  
Phoenix Contract (including differing versions of the Phoenix Contract if 
PLIC and PHLVIC develop differing versions), or (ii) change the pricing   
 structure of the Phoenix Contract (including differing versions thereof) at
any time thereafter, subject to the terms and provisions of the Phoenix   
Contract and any necessary State approval.                                

 Section 1.4 Separate Account Establishment. PLIC and PHLVIC shall establish
separate segregated asset accounts or "separate accounts" (the "Accounts")      
pursuant to Applicable Law through which the Phoenix Contract will be funded.   

  Section 1.5 Registration of the Phoenix Contract. PLIC and PHLVIC shall each
file a registration statement on Form N-4 under the 1933 Act and the 1940 Act   
to register the Phoenix Contracts in accordance with the requirements of those  
Acts. PLIC and PHLVIC acknowledge that time is of the essence in this endeavor, 
and agree to take reasonable steps to file the Form N-4 registration statements 
by November 1, 2007.                                                            

Section 1.6 Regulatory Filings. PLIC and PHLVIC shall have sole           
responsibility for preparing, filing, obtaining necessary approvals of, and     
maintaining and updating all disclosure documents and reports required under    
applicable Federal and State laws and regulations, except for the filing of     
marketing materials with FINRA pursuant to Section 2.3.                         

Section 1.7 Administration. Jefferson National and/or its Affiliates shall
provide the administrative services in connection with the Phoenix Contract     
specified in Article III of this Agreement.                                     

 Section 1.8 Insurance Filings. As well as registering the Phoenix Contracts
with the SEC, PLIC and PHLVIC collectively shall file the Phoenix Contracts     
with the insurance departments of the fifty States of the United States. PLIC   
and PHLVIC acknowledge that time is of the essence in this endeavor, and agree  
to take reasonable steps to file the various policy forms in the states that do 
not require domiciliary state approval by November 1, 2007.

enter with any Underlying Fund relating to the provision of administrative,     
distribution or other types of services, including any fees, expenses, or other

review any such Jefferson National Marketing Materials expeditiously upon       
receipt and to provide prompt (but, in any event, within ten business days)     
notification to Jefferson National and JNSC as to whether they will permit such 
materials to be used to market the Phoenix Contracts. If PLIC or PHLVIC, as     
applicable, does not respond within ten business days, such Jefferson National

and approval of such written policies and procedures, including, without        
limitation, furnishing such mutually agreed upon certifications and             
sub-certifications as PLIC or PHLVIC shall reasonably request from time to      
time. Jefferson National agrees that it shall promptly furnish PLIC and PLVIC   
with copies of any material amendments to its Rule 38a-1 Policies and           
Procedures and that it shall promptly notify PLIC or PHLVIC in the event that a 
"material compliance matter" (as such term is defined pursuant to Rule 38a-1    
under the 1940 Act) arises with respect the services it provides under the      
Agreement.                                                                      

Section 3.12 Regulation S-P. Jefferson National shall not, directly or    
indirectly, disclose or use any nonpublic personal information regarding the    
consumers or customers of PLIC or PHLVIC (as the terms "consumer" and           
"customer" are defined in Rule 3(g) and 3(i), respectively, of Regulation S-P   
of the Securities and Exchange Commission), other than to carry out the         
functions contemplated by the Agreement, and Jefferson National shall establish 
appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect the    
security, confidentiality and integrity of any such nonpublic personal          
information.

shares, whether or not in good order, that are accepted by Jefferson National   
after 4:00 p.m. Eastern time (or such earlier time as is required by the        
Underlying Fund) on any Business Day, shall be processed at prices calculated   
as of the next Business Day. For the purposes hereof, a "Business Day" shall    
mean any day on which the New York Stock Exchange is open for trading and on    
which an Underlying Fund calculates its net asset value pursuant to the rules   
of the SEC as amended from time to time, subject to such terms and conditions   
as may be set forth in the registration statement for the Underlying Fund as    
filed with the SEC, as the same shall be amended from time to time.             

Section 3.14 Market Timing. In connection with its administration of the  
Phoenix Contracts, and in no way in limitation thereof, Jefferson National      
agrees to implement the same automated market timing prevention system that as  
of the date of this Agreement it uses in connection with Monument Adviser       
Contracts. Jefferson National further agrees to notify PLIC and PHLVIC in       
advance of any intended material changes to such automated market timing        
prevention system and to not implement any such proposed material change        
without PLIC's or PHLVIC's consent, such consent not to be unreasonably         
withheld.                                                                       

  Section 3.15 Limitation on Administration of PLIC Contracts. Notwithstanding
anything contained herein to the contrary, PLIC acknowledges that Jefferson     
National is only permitted to perform ministerial functions on its behalf in    
administering the PLIC Contracts, and at no point shall Jefferson National      
exercise discretion in administering the PLIC Contracts. In the event           
discretion is required, Jefferson National shall request direction from PLIC,   
and PLIC shall provide such direction promptly. In these instances, PLIC agrees 
to use its commercially reasonable efforts to respond quickly enough for        
Jefferson National to administer the PLIC Contracts in accordance with its Rule 
38a-1 Policies and Procedures. PLIC shall provide Jefferson National with its   
policies and procedures for administering New York business within thirty days  
of the date of this Agreement.

operation of the administrative services for the Phoenix Contracts. PLIC and    
PHLVIC shall give Jefferson National non-exclusive authority over the Bank      
Accounts in providing the administrative services. PLIC and PHLVIC agree that   
without Jefferson National's prior written consent they shall not make any      
changes to the authorized Jefferson National signatories on the Bank Accounts.  
Upon the Conversion Date (as defined in Section 7.2(e)), Jefferson National's   
authority over the Bank Accounts shall cease and shall promptly return to PLIC  
and PHLVIC all unused check stock and other documents held by it in connection  
with this Agreement.                                                            

Section 3.17 Access. PLIC and PHLVIC may from time to time reasonably     
request, and Jefferson National shall provide, at reasonable times during       
normal business hours, reasonable access for PLIC and PHLVIC or its designee(s) 
(including PLIC and PHLVIC's auditors) to examine any books and records         
relating to the Phoenix Contracts and/or the administrative services provided   
by Jefferson National hereunder and to speak with employees and agents of

(v) the investigation, arbitration, litigation and final disposition of any     
claims that may have been or may be made against PLIC, PHLVIC or an Affiliate   
in connection with the Phoenix Contracts or that PLIC, PHLVIC or an Affiliate   
may make with respect to the Phoenix Contracts; provided, that any data or      
information developed by Jefferson National in support or defense of any        
indemnification claim under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement,          
including without limitation any document subject to attorney-client privilege  
or the work product doctrine, will not be required to be made available to PLIC 
and PHLVIC, and (vi) the audit of the adequacy of the administrative services   
and Jefferson National's compliance with this Agreement. Such access shall      
include the right of PLIC and PHLVIC, at its sole expense, to make and retain   
copies of any such books and records as PLIC and PHLVIC reasonably deem         
necessary. PLIC and PHLVIC shall give Jefferson National reasonable prior       
notice of the need for such access and shall comply with any written            
instructions provided by Jefferson National in connection with the use of or    
access to any of Jefferson National's information, personnel, facilities,       
office and storage space. Without limiting the foregoing, each Party shall      
cooperate with the other in all commercially reasonable respects in order to    
accomplish the objectives of this Agreement.

been duly authorized by all other necessary corporate action on the part of     
each such person. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each

insurance companies or creditors' rights generally; and (b) general principles

obligations of such Party, as the case may be, enforceable against such Party   
in accordance with their respective terms, subject to: (a) bankruptcy,          
insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent transfer, moratorium and other similar   
laws now or hereafter in effect relating to or affecting the rights of          
creditors of insurance companies or creditors' rights generally; and

Section 5.3 Appropriate Registration and Qualification. Jefferson National
represents and warrants that it is an insurance company duly qualified and      
admitted to sell insurance in each state in which the Phoenix Contracts are     
offered and sold, other than New York. JNSC represents and warrants that it is, 
and will continue to be, registered as a broker-dealer under the 1934 Act and a 
member of FINRA. Jefferson National and JNSC each represents and warrants that  
it will have, prior to the commencement of the offering and marketing of the    
Phoenix Contract, and will continue to have, all requisite appointed insurance  
agents, and registered principals and representatives, each of whom is, and     
will continue to be, properly registered, licensed and/or qualified under all   
applicable federal and state laws and regulations (including without limitation 
the rules of FINRA).                                                            

Section 5.4 Tax Qualification. Jefferson National represents and warrants 
that the Monument Advisor Contract qualifies as an annuity contract under       
Section 72(s) of the Internal Revenue Code. Jefferson National acknowledges     
that PLIC and PHLVIC are relying on this representation and warranty with       
respect to the qualification of the Phoenix Contract as an annuity contract     
under Section 72(s). In the event that Jefferson National becomes aware of any  
facts or circumstances that have resulted in, or may reasonably be believed to  
potentially result in, the Monument Advisor Contract no longer qualifying as an 
annuity contract under Section 72(s), Jefferson National shall immediately      
notify PLIC and PHLVIC in writing of such facts or circumstances. In the event  
an appropriate authority commences a proceeding against Jefferson               

20  

P-->EX-99.24B8B121st�Page�of�43TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�21st
National seeking to terminate the Monument Advisor Contract's qualification     
under Section 72(s), such proceeding is not dismissed or vacated within sixty   
(60) days, and the reason for such disqualification is a provision              
substantially identical to a corresponding provision of the Phoenix Contract,   
PLIC and PHLVIC shall have the right to terminate pursuant to Section 9.2(iv).  
PLIC and PHLVIC acknowledge that, to the extent the Phoenix Contract is not     
substantially identical to the Monument Advisor Contract, in this regard,       
neither PLIC nor PHLVIC is relying on Jefferson National to make the            
determination that the Phoenix Contract qualifies as an annuity under           
Section 72(s) of the Internal Revenue Code. PLIC and PHLVIC further acknowledge 
that, with respect to the guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit right included  
in the Phoenix Contract and any other provision in the Phoenix Contract that is 
not substantially identical to the Monument Advisor Contract Jefferson National 
is relying on PLIC and PHLVIC to make the determination that such rider or      
difference will not disqualify the Phoenix Contract as an annuity under         
Section 72(s) of the Internal Revenue Code and will be administered by          
Jefferson National accordingly.                                                 

Section 5.5 Registration and Regulation Under the Federal Securities Laws.
As provided in Section 1.9 of this Agreement, in order to facilitate PLIC's and 
PHLVIC's duties under this Agreement, Jefferson National will provide PLIC and  
PHLVIC with policy forms, contracts, state and federal filings, marketing and   
sales materials, and similar forms and documents relating to the Monument       
Advisor Contract. Jefferson National personnel shall also provide assistance as 
necessary to facilitate the design, registration, and filing of the Phoenix     
Contracts. Jefferson National acknowledges that PLIC and PHLVIC are relying on  
it to ensure that these documents comply with Applicable Laws to the extent the 
Phoenix Contract is substantially identical to the Monument Adviser Contract,   
and with due regard to such reliance, Jefferson National represents and         
warrants that (i) the Monument Advisor policy forms and contracts that it will  
provide PLIC and PHLVIC are in substantial compliance with applicable state     
insurance laws, regulations, insurance department bulletins and other           
department interpretations; (ii) the state and federal filings for the Monument 
Advisor Contract that it will provide to PLIC and PHLVIC will provide full and  
fair disclosure regarding the Monument Advisor Contract and comply in all       
material respects with Applicable Law. Jefferson National agrees to provide     
PLIC and PHLVIC with copies of any and all SEC, FINRA or other governmental     
releases, administrative decisions, no-action letters, examination reports      
(including so-called "deficiency letters"), correspondence, and any other       
communications relating to the Monument Advisor Contract.                       

Section 5.6 Amendments to Phoenix Contract Materials. Jefferson National  
agrees to deliver to PLIC and PHLVIC a copy of (i) any amended documents or     
materials listed in the foregoing Section 5.5 of this Agreement, including, but 
not limited to, any contract and form amendments, prospectuses and Statements   
of Additional Information and supplements thereto, which relate to the Monument 
Advisor Contract's core product design or its qualification as an annuity under 
Section 72(s) of the Internal Revenue Code, within five (5) days from the time  
that such documents or materials are amended and in final form.                 

Section 5.7 Separate Account Compliance Procedures. Jefferson National    
acknowledges and agrees that by providing the administrative services relating  
to the Phoenix Contract to PLIC and PHLVIC as provided in the Agreement, it     
will be an "administrator" as that term is defined in Rule 38a-1 under the 1940 
Act. Jefferson National further acknowledges                                    

21  

P-->EX-99.24B8B122nd�Page�of�43TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�22nd
that because of this status under Rule 38a-1, PLIC and PHLVIC (acting on behalf 
of their respective Accounts) are required to review and approve compliance     
policies and procedures developed and adopted by Jefferson National that are    
reasonably designed to prevent material violations of the federal securities    
laws in accordance with the requirements and standards set forth in Rule 38a-1. 
In furtherance of assisting PLIC and PHLVIC in complying with Rule 38a-1, but   
in no way in limitation of its duties and obligations under this Section 5.7,   
Jefferson National agrees to prepare compliance policies and procedures         
(hereinafter the "Phoenix Compliance Policies and Procedures") that shall       
govern its provision of administrative services to PLIC and PHLVIC relating to  
the Phoenix Contracts as provided in this Agreement. Jefferson National         
represents and warrants that the Phoenix Compliance Policies and Procedures     
will comply in all material respects with Rule 38a-1, including, without        
limitation, the requirement that they be reasonably designed to prevent         
material violations of federal securities laws. PLIC and PHLVIC agree that, to  
the extent consistent with the provisions of this Section 5.7 and with this     
Agreement generally, that the Phoenix Compliance Policies and procedures may be 
developed based on Rule 38a-1 compliance policies and procedures currently used 
by Jefferson National to administer the Monument Adviser Contracts.             

Section 5.8 Compliance With Applicable Laws and Regulations. The Parties  
acknowledge that the Phoenix Contract, like the Monument Advisor Contract, will 
be developed and administered based on an innovative design that will permit    
the Phoenix Contract to be administered electronically. In recognition of the   
innovative nature of the Phoenix Contract and the associated administrative     
system, but in no way in limitation of its responsibilities and obligations     
with respect thereto, Jefferson National represents and warrants that (i) the   
issuance, sale and administration of the Phoenix Contracts will comply in all   
material respects with all Applicable Laws; and (ii) that the automated market  
timing prevention system it currently uses in connection with its Monument      
Adviser Contracts and the system it has agreed, pursuant to Section 3.14 of     
this Agreement, to implement with respect to the Phoenix Contracts, are fully   
and accurately described in all material respects in the Monument Adviser       
Contract registration statement and will continue to be so described for the    
Monument Adviser Contracts as of the date of this Agreement, and that such      
system is reasonably designed to detect and deter harmful or abusive frequent   
trading. Each of Jefferson National and JNFC further represents that it has all 
licenses, permits and approvals necessary to perform its obligations under this 
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and will maintain such licenses, permits 
and approvals in full force and effect during the term of such agreements.      

 Section 5.9 No Conflicts. Jefferson National, JNFC and JNSC each represents
and warrants that the execution and delivery by it of this Agreement, the       
performance of its duties hereunder, and the receipt of payments hereunder do   
not and will not conflict with or result in a violation of or material breach   
of or constitute a default under any material agreement to which it is a party. 

Section 5.10 Continuing Disclosure Obligation. Jefferson National, JNFC or
JNSC, as the case may be, shall promptly inform PLIC and PHLVIC in the event    
that any representation and warranty herein becomes inaccurate in any material  
respect, or upon having a reasonable basis for believing that a representation  
and warranty has ceased to be accurate in all material respects.

  Section 5.11 Jefferson National Restriction. During the Initial Term and any
Renewal Term of this Agreement, Jefferson National and its Affiliates shall     
not, directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of PLIC, PHLVIC  
or its Affiliates, enter into any arrangements or strategic alliance agreements 
that are similar to the arrangements contemplated under this Agreement and the  
Ancillary Agreements to register, market, offer, distribute or sell, on behalf  
of another life insurance company, a conventional deferred variable annuity     
(i) that is qualified under Section 817(h) of the Internal Revenue Code and     
registered under the 1940 Act, with a base variable contract fee (i.e,          
mortality and expense risk charge) that is not an asset-based charge and        
(ii) that will dilute the benefit to PLIC and PHLVIC and their Affiliates as    
anticipated under this Agreement. In addition to all other remedies available,  
PLIC and PHLVIC shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including without   
limitation, injunction and specific performance, as a remedy for                
non-performance or breach under this Section.                                   

Article VI  
Use of Marks, Co-Branding and Marketing Materials 

Section 6.1 Use of Phoenix Marks. Without limitation of Sections 1.1 and  
1.2, PLIC and PHLVIC hereby grant to Jefferson National a limited,              
non-transferable, royalty-free license to use the Phoenix Marks (as defined     
below) for the Initial Term and any Renewal Term, solely for the purpose of     
carrying out Jefferson National's duties set forth in this Agreement, and       
solely in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Jefferson 
National shall not alter, modify or change the Phoenix Marks in any way, and    
shall utilize the Phoenix Marks in accordance with the Style Guide provided by  
PLIC and PHLVIC. If PLIC and PHLVIC determine in their sole discretion that     
Jefferson National is using or displaying the Phoenix Marks in a manner that is 
or may be detrimental to PLIC or PHLVIC's interest, PLIC or PHLVIC, as the case 
may be, may issue reasonable instructions to Jefferson National concerning the  
manner, if any, in which Jefferson National may continue to use the Phoenix     
Marks. Upon receipt of such instructions, Jefferson National shall promptly     
comply with such instructions. PLIC and PHLVIC shall provide Jefferson National 
with all the Phoenix Marks production materials (i.e. camera ready art)         
required for use by Jefferson National. In accordance with Sections 2.3 and     
6.4(d), Jefferson National shall obtain the prior approval of PLIC and PHLVIC   
for all materials to be used by Jefferson National in connection with the       
marketing, sale and administration of the Phoenix Contract which contain the    
Phoenix Marks, including but not limited to solicitation materials, disclosure  
statements, account statements, enrollment materials, customer agreements,      
correspondence, and web pages and any material amendments thereto. Jefferson    
National shall not combine or allow others to combine any Phoenix Marks with    
any other mark or term without the prior written approval of PLIC and PHLVIC.   
The consent of PLIC and PHLVIC in connection with the use of the Phoenix Marks  
by Jefferson National shall not be construed as imposing any responsibility or  
liability upon PLIC or PHLVIC for the compliance of any such materials with     
Applicable Law, it being understood, unless otherwise provided herein, that     
Jefferson National shall be responsible for the compliance of such materials    
with all Applicable Law. The license and authorization granted by PLIC and      
PHLVIC to Jefferson National pursuant to this Section 6.1 shall not be assigned 
by Jefferson National except to the extent that this Agreement is assignable    
pursuant to Section 10.3. All usage of the Phoenix Marks shall inure to PLIC's  
and PHLVIC's benefit. For the Phoenix Contract materials it prepares or uses,   
Jefferson National shall ensure that the Phoenix Marks, including product and   
service marks used for the Phoenix Contract, appear clearly and prominently on  
the Phoenix

Contract materials including, without limitation, the marketing and promotional 
materials for the Phoenix Contract created and distributed by Jefferson         
National. Except as set forth in this Section 6.1, PLIC and PHLVIC each         
otherwise reserves all of its right, title and interest in and to the Phoenix   
Marks. It is expressly agreed by the Parties herein that, except as set forth   
in this Section 6.1, Jefferson National is not purchasing or acquiring any      
ownership right, title or interest in Phoenix Marks or any other intellectual   
property right owned by PLIC and PHLVIC. The term "Phoenix Marks" means the     
registered, statutory or common law trademarks, logos, service marks, trade     
names and other proprietary markings identified to Jefferson National by PLIC   
and PHLVIC from time to time as being owned by or licensed to PLIC and PHLVIC   
as set forth in the Style Guide. PLIC and PHLVIC may from time to time amend    
the list of Phoenix Marks set forth in the Style Guide, provided that PLIC and  
PHLVIC provide a copy of such amended schedule to Jefferson National prior to   
the effective date thereof. Jefferson National agrees that, upon the request of 
PLIC and PHLVIC, it will promptly provide PLIC and PHLVIC with copies of the    
materials using the Phoenix Marks.                                              

Section 6.2 Limitation on Use of PLIC and PHLVIC Names. No party shall use
the names of PLIC, PHLVIC, or their Affiliates other than as permitted under    
this Agreement; provided, however, that the approval of PLIC and PHLVIC shall   
not be required for the use of PLIC's, PHLVIC's, or their Affiliates' names by  
any Party in connection with performing its duties and obligations hereunder in 
a manner not inconsistent with this Agreement, or exercising its rights under   
this Agreement to the extent provided herein, or which is required by the SEC,  
FINRA, any state insurance authority or any other appropriate regulatory,       
governmental or judicial authority or, if such party is PLIC and PHLVIC, in     
connection with marketing and related materials not related to the Phoenix      
Contract for PLIC and PHLVIC and its Affiliates.                                

  Section 6.3 Clearance of Third Party Intellectual Property Rights. Under the
terms of this Agreement, Jefferson National will undertake the development and  
maintenance of a customer and partner website for the Phoenix Contract, and     
Jefferson National will undertake the creation, reproduction, and dissemination 
of marketing and promotional materials. In implementing these aspects of the    
Agreement, the Parties recognize the likelihood of using trademarks, service    
marks, logos, photographs, artwork, and textual materials that may be owned, or 
exclusively licensed, by others. In such cases, Jefferson National at its       
expense shall clear all rights for the use of any proprietary products prior to 
their incorporation into the web site or the marketing and promotional          
materials. Furthermore, the Parties will include the appropriate copyright      
notices and indications of trademark protection in the website and marketing    
materials to ensure that customers, and others with access to them, understand  
both their proprietary nature and the limitations on their unauthorized use.    

Section 6.4 Website Development and Maintenance.                          

(a) As provided for in Section 3.1 above, Jefferson National shall  
 develop, host and implement a customer and partner Phoenix Contract website
for the offering and maintenance of the Phoenix Contract (together, the   
  "Website"), which Website shall contain functional web pages for the Phoenix
Contract that include access to account histories for both the contract   
 holders in the Phoenix Contract and broker-dealers and investment advisers,
 and which shall be operational on a date mutually agreed to by the Parties.
Jefferson National shall retain and own rights to the uniform resource    
locator ("URL") and domain name on which the                              

24  

P-->EX-99.24B8B125th�Page�of�43TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�25th
Website resides; provided, however, Jefferson National shall convey its   
right, title and interest in and to the URL (but not Website content) to  
PLIC, PHLVIC or its affiliate (i) upon termination of this Agreement      
pursuant to Sections 9.2(ii) (but only if Jefferson National terminates), 
  9.2(iii), 9.2(iv) (but only if Jefferson National is the breaching party) or
9.2(vi), or (ii) if this Agreement is terminated for any reason and       
Jefferson National or any of its Affiliates is not providing any          
administrative services to the Phoenix Contracts; provided that in this   
case, PLIC and PHLVIC shall only use the URL for purposes of administering
the Phoenix Contracts. Without obligating Jefferson National to obtain or 
perform any such services, to the extent Jefferson National obtains any   
service reports tracking the statistics of activities on the Website,     
  Jefferson National agrees to make such reports available to PLIC and PHLVIC.

(b) Jefferson National shall develop a single version of custom web 
content to fill the content sections of the Websites. To assist in the    
 content development, Jefferson National will draw upon the existing content
sections of the Monument Advisor Contract website, provided that Jefferson
 National shall retain all intellectual property rights with respect to such
  content, except as provided herein. The content section of the Website shall
 contain an "Investment Options" section, which shall include, if available,
underlying fund fact sheets, fund prospectuses, and portfolio level fact  
  sheets, as well as any other investment related information the Parties wish
to place in the Investment section.                                       

(c) Jefferson National shall bear all costs associated with the     
development, implementation, improvement and maintenance of the Website.  
Jefferson National shall be responsible for securing the web development  
resources to develop, host and implement the Website.                     

     (d) In an effort to control the development costs of all content sections
of the Website, Jefferson National, PLIC, and PHLVIC agree to make        
 commercially reasonable efforts to limit the review and approval process of
content materials to two "rounds" of review upon which such content       
materials shall be approved with no further change other than minor       
editorial changes.                                                        

  (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Jefferson National shall
retain ultimate ownership and control of the Website, including without   
 limitation, ownership and control of all content pages, tools, services and
 other aspects of the Websites in connection with the Phoenix Contract, and,
subject to the conveyance described in Section 6.4(a) above, the URL and  
domain name on which the Website resides.                                 

    (f) Jefferson National shall ensure that all site content on the Website
 complies with all applicable regulatory requirements and Jefferson National
 and/or JNSC, as the case may be, shall make appropriate filings relating to
the Website content sections as may be required by Applicable Law.        

  Section 6.5 License of Patent Rights and Technology. During the Initial Term
and any Renewal Term of this Agreement or the life of any intellectual property 
right, whichever is shorter, JNFC and Jefferson National grant PHLVIC and PLIC  
a sole, paid up, royalty free license, with the right to sublicense only to     
PHLVIC and PLIC's Affiliates, to use their respective intellectual property,    
including without limitation, any and all rights under U.S. Patent              

25

Application No. 11/501,719, filed on August 10, 2006, and any patent that       
issues therefrom, or any reissue, re-examination, division, continuation, or    
continuation in part thereof for the purpose of offering, selling, issuing and  
administering the Phoenix Contracts pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.    

Section 6.6 Post Termination License.                                     

(a) If Jefferson National terminates this Agreement pursuant to     
  Section 9.2(ii), or if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to 9.2(iv) (but
only if Jefferson National is the breaching party) or 9.2(vi), Jefferson  
National and JNFC shall enter into a licensing agreement on commercially  
reasonable terms, granting PHLVIC and PLIC a post termination license for 
any then valid and continuing intellectual property rights described in   
Section 6.5 above for purposes of PHLVIC's and PLIC's marketing, sale and 
administration of new and existing Phoenix Contracts.                     

    (b) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to termination events other
than those under Section 6.6(a) and as long as there are Phoenix Contracts
outstanding, Jefferson National and JNFC shall enter into a licensing     
 agreement on commercially reasonable terms, granting PHLVIC and PLIC a post
 termination license for any then valid and continuing intellectual property
rights described in Section 6.5 above solely for purposes of PHLVIC's and 
PLIC's administration of the then existing Phoenix Contracts.             

Article VII 
Additional Reinsurance Agreement and Recapture Events 
Under the Phoenix Reinsurance Agreement 

Section 7.1 JNL Reinsurance Agreement.                                    

(a) In connection with Jefferson National's issuance of the Monument
Advisor Contracts, the parties hereto agree that each twelve-month period 
with the initial such period beginning January 1, 2010, and each following
  twelve-month period starting after the last day of the previous twelve-month
 period shall be a "Calculation Period." For purposes of this Agreement, the
payment and premiums (including any renewal premiums) collected on the    
Monument Advisor Contracts during each Calculation Period less the sum of 
(i) the premiums (including any renewal premiums) collected on the Phoenix
 Contracts during such Calculation Period and (ii) $250 million shall be the
"Differential Amount;" provided, however, that the renewal premium on any 
Monument Advisor Contract shall not be included in the calculation for any
 Calculation Period if such Monument Advisor Contract is already included in
  an existing JNL Reinsurance Agreement (as defined below). Jefferson National
shall calculate the Differential Amount in good faith and communicate such
amount to PHLVIC within thirty (30) days after the end of each Calculation
  Period. If PHLVIC disagrees with any calculation of the Differential Amount,
the Parties shall resolve any dispute in good faith as promptly as        
practicable. If for any Calculation Period, the Differential Amount is    
greater than zero, Jefferson National and PHLVIC shall enter into a       
  reinsurance agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B
effective as of the beginning of such Calculation Period for the Monument 
Advisor Contracts issued during such Calculation Period (the "JNL         
Reinsurance Agreement").                                                  

26  

P-->EX-99.24B8B127th�Page�of�43TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�27th
    (b) The quota share of the Monument Advisor Contracts issued during such
Calculation Period to be reinsured by PHLVIC under any JNL Reinsurance    
Agreement shall be a percentage equal to (i) divided by (ii), where:      

         (i) shall equal the sum of (1) 25% of the Differential Amount for the
  Calculation Period subject to such JNL Reinsurance Agreement greater
than zero but not exceeding $250 million and (2) 10% of such      
Differential Amount greater than $250 million, and                

     (ii) shall equal the total premiums and payments collected during
     such Calculation Period on the Monument Advisor Contracts issued during
such Calculation Period.                                          

Section 7.2 Recapture under the Phoenix Reinsurance Agreement.            

(a) From and after the effective date of the Phoenix Reinsurance    
Agreement, any of the following occurrences shall allow, but not obligate,
PHLVIC to exercise the recapture remedy set forth in this Section 7.2 with
respect to the PHLVIC Contracts reinsured under the Phoenix Reinsurance   
Agreement (individually or collectively, as the context indicates, a      
"Recapture Event"):                                                       

(i) a petition for insolvency, rehabilitation, conservation,
   supervision, liquidation or similar proceeding is filed by or against
     Jefferson National or its statutory representative in any jurisdiction;

        (ii) Jefferson National has not, within 60 days of being notified of
 its failure to maintain any licenses or authorizations necessary to
      perform its obligations under the Phoenix Reinsurance Agreement and this
     Agreement, taken substantial steps to obtain any such necessary license
  or authorization, and the failure of Jefferson National to hold such
license or authorization causes PHLVIC to be in violation of any  
  Applicable Law or otherwise adversely affects PHLVIC in any material
      respect, or Jefferson National materially breaches this Agreement or any
     Ancillary Agreement (provided such material breach is not substantially
 cured within sixty (60) days of notice of such breach; or Jefferson
 National becomes subject to a criminal indictment or information or
similar proceedings;                                              

         (iii) Upon notice from Jefferson National that its authorized control
   level risk based capital at the end of a calendar quarter falls below
 250% for two consecutive quarters (such notice shall be provided by
Jefferson National within 7 days of knowledge of such event); or  

       (iv) Jefferson National provides notice to PHLVIC to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.2(ii) thereof.                    

(b) Upon the occurrence of a Recapture Event described in (a) above,
 PHLVIC shall have the right to recapture all, and not less than all, of the
PHLVIC Contracts reinsured under the Phoenix Reinsurance Agreement, by    
providing Jefferson National with written notice of its                   

27  

P-->EX-99.24B8B128th�Page�of�43TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�28th
intent to effect recapture not later than ninety (90) days of receiving   
 notice of the occurrence of the relevant Recapture Event. PHLVIC shall give
Jefferson National written notice (the "Recapture Notice") specifying     
(x) the grounds for the exercise of its remedies pursuant to this         
 Section 7.2 and (y) the fact of recapture; provided that the effective date
of such recapture shall be the Conversion Date (as defined below).        

(c) If PHLVIC or PLIC provides notice to terminate this Agreement   
  pursuant to Section 9.2(ii) hereof, and within ninety (90) days of receiving
such termination notice, Jefferson National provides PHLVIC notice to     
exercise its right pursuant to Section 9.3(c) hereof, then the Phoenix    
Reinsurance Agreement shall be terminated effective as of the Conversion  
Date.                                                                     

    (d) Any recapture by PHLVIC under above clause (b) or termination of the
Phoenix Reinsurance Agreement under above clause (c) or otherwise pursuant
to the provisions under the Phoenix Reinsurance Agreement shall not be    
 deemed to have been consummated until (i) PHLVIC or Jefferson National have
  made a final settlement in accordance with the Phoenix Reinsurance Agreement
 and with a termination charge as applicable, and (ii) administration of the
Phoenix Contracts has been converted to PHLVIC or PLIC as applicable      
pursuant to Section 7.2(e). Following the consummation of the recapture of
the PHLVIC Contracts or the termination of the Phoenix Reinsurance        
Agreement, no additional premiums, deposits or other amounts payable under
or in connection with such PHLVIC Contracts shall be paid to Jefferson    
National under the Phoenix Reinsurance Agreement. The amount of any       
termination charge shall be determined and payable in accordance with the 
provisions set forth in the Phoenix Reinsurance Agreement.                

(e) In connection with any recapture or termination of the Phoenix  
Reinsurance Agreement, PHLVIC, PLIC or their designated third-party       
administrator shall assume the administration of the Phoenix Contracts    
within twelve (12) months from the date PHLVIC sent the recapture notice  
under Section 7.2(b) or the date either PHLVIC or Jefferson National      
provides notice to terminate the Phoenix Reinsurance Agreement, as        
 applicable and the Parties agree that, notwithstanding any other provisions
to the contrary, the termination or recapture, as applicable, under the   
Phoenix Reinsurance Agreement shall be effective on the date the          
administration of the Phoenix Contracts is assumed by PHLVIC and PLIC or  
their designated third-party administrator (the "Conversion Date").       
 Jefferson National shall use commercially reasonable efforts to convert the
administrative services functions to PHLVIC or such designated third-party
administrator as smoothly as possible during the period between the       
  recapture notice or the termination notice, as applicable and the Conversion
Date. The Parties agree to cooperate and make every reasonable effort to  
effectuate any such conversion or transfer and to complete a conversion or
transfer as soon as reasonably practicable.                               

Article VIII

any and all direct losses, claims, demands, liabilities, damages, charges,
  payments, costs and expenses, interest and penalties (including the costs of
  investigating or defending any alleged losses, claims, demands, liabilities,
damages, charges, payments, costs or expenses and any reasonable counsel  
fees incurred in connection therewith) ("Losses") which any Phoenix       
 Indemnitee may incur under the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act, any other statute or
any rule or regulation thereunder, or under any other Applicable Law or   
otherwise,                                                                

     (i) arising out of or based upon any untrue, or allegedly untrue,

  Phoenix Contract Marketing Materials, or other descriptive materials
     relating to the Phoenix Contract to the extent that such materials were

National's, JNSC's and JNFC's obligation to indemnify the Phoenix 
    Indemnitees shall not be deemed to cover any Losses arising out of any
 untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with information 
   furnished to Jefferson National, JNFC, JNSC or their counsel by PLIC,
PHLVIC, or PEPCO in writing, for the purpose of and used in the   
preparation thereof,                                              

         (ii) arising out of or result from the willful misfeasance, bad faith
or negligence of any of Jefferson National, JNSC, their respective
    employees, officers, managers, directors or members in the performance
      of its duties, or by reason of its reckless disregard of its obligations
and/or duties, under this Agreement, or                           

        (iii) arising out of a breach of or inaccuracy in the representation
      and/or warranty of Jefferson National, JNSC or JNFC or any other breach,
     nonfulfillment or default in the performance of any of the covenants or
    terms of Jefferson National, JNFC, or JNSC contained in this Agreement
or any Ancillary Agreement.                                       

(b) Promptly after receipt by a Phoenix Indemnitee of notice of the 
commencement of an investigation, action, claim or proceeding, PLIC and   
PHLVIC shall, if a claim for indemnification in respect thereof is to be  
made under this section, notify Jefferson National, JNFC and JNSC         
(collectively, the "JNL Parties") in writing of the commencement thereof, 
although the failure to do so shall not prevent recovery by any Phoenix   
Indemnitee, unless the JNL Parties are materially prejudiced thereby. The 
JNL Parties shall be entitled to participate at their own expense in the  
defense or, if they so elect, to assume the defense of any suit brought to
enforce any such investigation, action, claim or proceeding, but if JNL   
Parties elect to assume the defense, such defense shall be conducted by   
counsel chosen by the JNL Parties and approved by PLIC and PHLVIC, which  
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. In the event the JNL Parties 
elect to assume the defense of any such suit and retain such counsel and  
notifies PLIC and PHLVIC of such election, the indemnified defendant or   
defendants in such suit shall bear the fees and expenses of any additional
counsel retained by them subsequent to the receipt of the JNL Parties'    
 election. If the JNL Parties do not elect to assume the defense of any such
suit, or in case PLIC and PHLVIC does not, in the exercise of reasonable  
judgment,

  approve of counsel chosen by the JNL Parties, or in case there is a conflict
of interest between any JNL Party and PLIC and PHLVIC or any Phoenix      
  Indemnitee, the JNL Parties will reimburse the indemnified person or persons
named as defendant or defendants in such suit, for the reasonable fees and
  expenses of any counsel retained by PLIC and PHLVIC. Any proposed settlement
or other disposition of such investigation, action, claim, or proceeding  
must be approved by the JNL Parties (which approval shall not be          
unreasonably withheld) prior to finalizing any such settlement or         
disposition. Each JNL Party's indemnification agreement contained in this 
Section 8.1 and its representations and warranties in this Agreement shall
remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of any           
investigation made by or on behalf of a Phoenix Indemnitee, and shall     
survive the delivery of any interests under the Phoenix Contract and the  
  termination of this Agreement subject to applicable statutes of limitations.
This agreement of indemnity will inure exclusively to the Phoenix         
  Indemnitees and their estates and successors. Each JNL Party agrees promptly
to notify PLIC and PHLVIC of the commencement of any litigation or        
proceedings against Jefferson National or any of its current or former    
officers, trustees, agents or Affiliates in connection with the issue and 
sale of any interests under the Phoenix Contract.                         

Section 8.2 PLIC and PHLVIC Indemnity to Jefferson National, JNSC and     
Affiliates.                                                                     

  (a) Each of PLIC, PHLVIC and PEPCO (the "Phoenix Party") severally but
 not jointly, shall indemnify, defend and hold Jefferson National, JNSC, and
each of their present or former directors, members, officers, employees,  
  representatives, and any of their present or former Affiliates to the extent
  such Affiliate(s) directly perform or performed services with respect to the
 Phoenix Contract (collectively, "Jefferson National Indemnitees"), free and
harmless from and against any and all Losses which Jefferson National, and
each of the other Jefferson National Indemnitees, may incur under the 1933
Act, the 1934 Act, any other statute (including state "Blue Sky" laws) or 
any rule or regulation thereunder, or under any other Applicable Law or   
otherwise,                                                                

(i) arising out of or based upon any untrue, or allegedly untrue,   
statement from PLIC, PHLVIC or PEPCO as applicable of a material fact     
 contained in disclosure documents, the Phoenix Contract Marketing Materials
 or the descriptive materials relating to the Phoenix Contract to the extent
such materials were prepared, or accurately derived from information      
 provided in writing for the purpose of and used in the preparation thereof,
by PLIC, PHLVIC, or PEPCO, or any amendments or supplements to the        
  foregoing, or the omission, or alleged omission, to state therein a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statement by  
PLIC, PHLVIC or PEPCO not misleading; provided, however, that each Phoenix
Party's obligation to indemnify Jefferson National and any of the other   
Jefferson National Indemnitees shall not be deemed to cover any Losses    
 arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission
or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with  
information furnished to the Phoenix Parties or their counsel by Jefferson
National or a Jefferson National Indemnitee in writing for the purpose of 
and used in the preparation thereof,                                      

    (ii) arising out of or result from the willful misfeasance, bad faith or
negligence of such Phoenix Party, and its employees, officers, managers,  
directors, members,

 brokers or agents in the performance of their duties, or by reason of their
  reckless disregard of their obligations and/or duties, under this Agreement,

(iii) arising out of a breach of or inaccuracy in the representation
  and/or warranty of such Phoenix Party or any other breach, nonfulfillment or
 default in the performance of any of the covenants or terms of such Phoenix
Party contained in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement; or          

     (iv) arising out of the inappropriate marketing, solicitation, or sale of
a Phoenix Contract by PLIC's or PHLVIC's appointed agents.                

     (b) Promptly after receipt by any Jefferson National Indemnitee of notice
of the commencement of an investigation, action, claim or proceeding,     
 Jefferson National shall, if a claim for indemnification in respect thereof
is to be made under this section, notify the Phoenix Parties in writing of
the commencement thereof, although the failure to do so shall not prevent 
 recovery by Jefferson National or any Jefferson National Indemnitee, unless
the relevant Phoenix Party is materially prejudiced thereby. Each Phoenix 
Party shall be entitled to participate at their own expense in the defense
or, if they so elect, to assume the defense of any suit brought to enforce
any such investigation, action, claim or proceeding, but if such Phoenix  
Party elects to assume the defense, such defense shall be conducted by    
counsel chosen by such Phoenix Party and approved by Jefferson National,  
  which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. In the event such Phoenix
 Party elects to assume the defense of any such suit and retain such counsel
  and notify Jefferson National of such election, the indemnified defendant or
defendants in such suit shall bear the fees and expenses of any additional
counsel retained by them subsequent to the receipt of such Phoenix Party's
election. If the Phoenix Parties do not elect to assume the defense of any
such suit, or in case Jefferson National does not, in the exercise of     
reasonable judgment, approve of counsel chosen by any Phoenix Party, or in
  case there is a conflict of interest between any Phoenix Party and Jefferson
National or any Jefferson National Indemnitee, the relevant Phoenix Party 
will reimburse the indemnified person or persons named as defendant or    
  defendants in such suit, for the reasonable fees and expenses of any counsel
retained by Jefferson National and them. Any proposed settlement or other 
disposition of such investigation, action, claim, or proceeding must be   
approved by the relevant Phoenix Party (which approval shall not be       
unreasonably withheld) prior to finalizing any such settlement or         
disposition. The Phoenix Parties' indemnification agreement contained in  
 this Section 8.2 and the Phoenix Parties' representations and warranties in
this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect        
regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of Jefferson National
  or any of the Jefferson National Indemnitees, and shall survive the delivery
of any interests under the Phoenix Contract and the termination of this   
Agreement subject to applicable statutes of limitations. This agreement of
indemnity will inure exclusively to Jefferson National's benefit, to the  
 benefit of each of the Jefferson National Indemnitees and their estates and
successors. PLIC and PHLVIC agree promptly to notify Jefferson National of
the commencement of any litigation or proceedings against the Phoenix     
Parties or any of their current or former officers, directors, managers,  
members, agents or Affiliates in connection with the issue and sale of any
interests under the Phoenix Contract. PLIC and PHLVIC will require any    
selling broker-dealer, in the Phoenix Contract's selling agreements, to   
indemnify Jefferson National against losses caused by the willful         
misfeasance, bad faith or negligence of such selling broker-dealer and its
registered representatives.

Section 8.3 Limitation of Liability.                                      

(a) In no event shall any Party hereunder or any of such Party's    
Affiliates have any liability under this Agreement, any related agreement,
or otherwise in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or   
thereby for special, speculative, consequential, incidental, punitive, or 
indirect damages, except that the foregoing shall not apply to any such   
damages payable by and indemnified party to an unaffiliated third party.  

 (b) Each indemnified party shall be obligated to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate to the extent reasonably practicable the   
amount of any Losses for which it is entitled to seek indemnification     
hereunder                                                                 

Article IX  
Term  

 Section 9.1 Effective Date. This Agreement shall become effective as of the
date hereof (the "Effective Date"). Unless sooner terminated as provided        
herein, this Agreement shall continue for an initial term of five (5) years     
(the "Initial Term"), and unless terminated, shall automatically renew for      
successive one (1) year terms thereafter (each, a "Renewal Term").              

Section 9.2 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated (i) immediately 
without penalty upon mutual consent of all Parties; (ii) by either PLIC or      
PHLVIC, on the one hand, or Jefferson National, on the other hand upon giving   
twelve months notice prior to the end of the Initial Term or any subsequent     
Renewal Term, (iii) upon the termination of the Phoenix Reinsurance Agreement   
whether through recapture or otherwise; (iv) immediately by either Phoenix      
Party or JNL Party if the other Party materially breaches this Agreement or any 
Ancillary Agreement (provided such material breach is not substantially cured   
within sixty (60) days of notice of such breach; or if a petition for           
insolvency, rehabilitation, conservation, supervision, liquidation or similar   
proceeding is filed by or against such other Party or its statutory             
representative in any jurisdiction; or if the other Party becomes subject to a  
criminal indictment or information or similar proceedings; (v) by Jefferson     
National if PLIC or PHLVIC is downgraded by A.M. Best to a financial strength   
rating that is less than A-; or (vi) by either PLIC or PHLVIC, on the one hand, 
or Jefferson National, on the other hand upon giving twelve months notice after 
its change of control; provided that such twelve-month notice is given within   
ninety days of the change in control. For the avoidance of doubt, in the        
absence of recapture or termination right exercised by the Parties hereto, any  
termination under this Section 9.2 shall mean only a termination with respect   
to distribution and sale of new Phoenix Contracts under Article II hereof and   
to the extent any Phoenix Contracts are administered by Jefferson National      
despite a termination under this Section the provisions set forth in            
Section 9.5(a) shall not be terminated.                                         

Section 9.3 Jefferson National Purchase Right. If PLIC or PHLVIC provides 
notice to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.2(ii), Jefferson       
National shall have the option to (a) accept such termination in which case the 
distribution and marketing of any new Phoenix Contract will terminate; or       
(b) acquire the 40% quota share retained by PHLVIC under the Phoenix            
Reinsurance Agreement, for a purchase price determined by using the same        
economic principles described in Section VII.5 of the Phoenix Reinsurance       
Agreement; or (c) force a                                                       

32  

P-->EX-99.24B8B133rd�Page�of�43TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�33rd
termination of the Phoenix Reinsurance Agreement. Jefferson National shall      
provide written notice to PHLVIC of its intention to exercise one of its        
options above within ninety days of receiving PLIC's or PHLVIC's termination    
notice under Section 9.2(ii).                                                   

Section 9.4 Phoenix Material Adverse Effect.                              

   (a) For purposes of this Agreement, a "Phoenix Material Adverse Effect"
means material adverse tax, regulatory, rating or other effect on PLIC and
PHLVIC (taken as a whole) resulting from the issuance of any new business 
under this Agreement by PLIC or PHLVIC, other than such material adverse  
 effects resulting from a change in general economic or market conditions or
  matters affecting, life or annuity business generally. If a Phoenix Material
Adverse Effect has occurred and is continuing, PLIC and PHLVIC may give   
 written notice of such event to Jefferson National and in such notice, PLIC
and PHLVIC may set forth a termination date for the new sales of the GMWB 
rider in the Phoenix Contract.                                            

   (b) Upon receiving such notice from PLIC and PHLVIC, Jefferson National
 shall choose to either (i) terminate the Phoenix Reinsurance Agreement with
respect to new business and terminate distribution and marketing of any   
Phoenix Contract under this Agreement within thirty (30) days of receiving
 such notice; provided that upon such termination, PHLVIC and PLIC shall pay
to Jefferson National $1,000,000 on the effective date of the termination 
  with respect to new business, or (ii) elect to continue new business without
the GMWB rider in the Phoenix Contract and amend the Phoenix Reinsurance  
Agreement and this Agreement to change the reinsurance quota share        
percentage under the Phoenix Reinsurance Agreement from 60% to 90% within 
thirty (30) days of receiving such notice; provided that the expense      
 allowance payable by PHLVIC under the Phoenix Reinsurance Agreement and the
  fees payable by PLIC under Section 1.11(a) shall be correspondingly adjusted
to reflect such change in the reinsurance quota share and PHLVIC and PLIC 
shall also pay to Jefferson National $1,000,000 upon the effectiveness of 
such amendment.                                                           

Section 9.5 Survival of Provisions.                                       

   (a) The Parties hereto agree that if this Agreement is terminated under
  Section 9.2 or 9.4 but as long as the Phoenix Reinsurance Agreement is still
in effect, the provisions of this Agreement set forth in Articles I, III, 
  IV, V, VI (except for Section 6.5), VII (except for Section 7.1), VIII and X
and Sections 9.2(i), (iii), (iv) and 9.5 shall survive the termination of 
this Agreement and Jefferson National shall retain all right, title and   
interest in and to the Jefferson National Marketing Materials upon        
termination of this Agreement.                                            

    (b) The Parties hereto further agree that if both this Agreement and the
Phoenix Reinsurance Agreement are terminated and all PHLVIC Contracts have
been recaptured, the provisions of this Agreement set forth in Sections   
1.12, 6.6, Articles VIII and X and Section 9.5 shall nevertheless survive 
such termination and Jefferson National shall retain all right, title and 
interest in and to the Jefferson National Marketing Materials upon        
termination of this Agreement.

Miscellaneous 

Section 10.1 Confidentiality.                                             

(a) PLIC, PHLVIC, and PEPCO agree on behalf of themselves, their    
officers, directors, members, employees and representatives, to treat     
confidentially and as proprietary information, information relating to the
Phoenix Contract, the contract holders therein and the accounts thereof,  
Jefferson National and JNSC and their activities, and not to use such     
  information for any purpose other than performance of their responsibilities
and duties under this Agreement or as otherwise approved by Jefferson     
National in writing.                                                      

(b) Jefferson National and JNSC agree on behalf of themselves, their
officers, directors, members, employees and representatives, to treat     
confidentially and as proprietary information, information relating to the
Phoenix Contract, the contract holders therein and the accounts thereof,  
  PLIC, PHLVIC, and PEPCO and their Affiliates, and their activities, acquired
in the course of negotiating and performing this Agreement, and not to use
such information for any purpose other than performance of their          
  responsibilities and duties under this Agreement or as otherwise approved by
PLIC and PHLVIC in writing.                                               

(c) Each Party agrees that, in furtherance of the purpose of this   
Section 10.1, it will hold and ensure that its employees and agents, its  
Affiliates and employees and agents of such Affiliates will hold the      
information referenced herein in strict confidence, (ii) not give, sell or
  disclose such information to its Affiliates or any other third party for any
 purposes whatsoever other than as required for the provision of services as
contemplated by this Agreement, and (iii) advise each of its employees who
  may be exposed to such information to keep such information confidential. It
is understood that in the event of a breach of this Section 10.1, damages 
may not be an adequate remedy, and the other Party shall be entitled to   
remedies including, but not limited to injunctive relief to restrain any  
breach, threatened or actual, pending the outcome of any litigation,      
arbitration or mediation.                                                 

     (d) In the case of any request or demand for the inspection or disclosure
  of such information by another party, the Party receiving such inspection or
disclosure request shall notify such other Party with respect to whose    
 information such inspection or disclosure request was made, instructions as
 to permitting or refusing such inspection or disclosure; provided, however,
a Party may permit the inspection or make such disclosures without the    
  approval of the other Party to any person in any case where it is advised by
 its counsel that it would be exposed to potential liability, loss or damage
 resulting from or relating to the failure to do so (the costs of counsel in
considering the matter to be borne by such disclosing Party).             
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 10.1 to the contrary, a Party may
  disclose that any other Party has instructed it not to permit the inspection
  or make the disclosures or otherwise limited or restricted its ability to do
so, as the case may be. Records and information which have become known to
 the public through no wrongful act of any person or entity, and information
which was already legally in the possession of any party prior to receipt 
thereof, shall not be subject to this Section 10.1.

   (e) Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 10.1 to the contrary,
each Party agrees not to use or disclose nonpublic personal information of
customers and consumers of the Phoenix Contract for any purpose other than
performance of its responsibilities and duties under this Agreement or as 
required or permitted by Applicable Law. Each Party agrees to comply with 
all federal and state privacy laws applicable to such party, including, to
the extent applicable, Title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ("GLBA") and 
any implementing rules, regulations and authoritative guidelines of any   
applicable regulatory agency thereunder.                                  

Section 10.2 Relationship of Parties. Nothing herein shall constitute     
Jefferson National, JNSC, or either of their agents, officers, or employees as  
agents, officers, or employees of PLIC, PHLVIC, or PEPCO. Nor shall anything    
herein constitute PLIC, PHLVIC, PEPCO, or any of their agents, officers, or     
employees as agents, officers, or employees of Jefferson National or JNSC.      
Jefferson National and JNSC shall have no authority and will not represent      
themselves as having any authority with respect to PLIC, PHLVIC, or PEPCO, nor  
shall PLIC, PHLVIC, or PEPCO have any authority or represent themselves as      
having any authority with respect to Jefferson or JNSC, other than as is        
specifically set forth in this Agreement. Each Party is responsible for its own 
conduct, for the employment, control and conduct of its brokers, agents and     
employees and for injury to such brokers, agents or employees or to others      
through its brokers, agents or employees. Each Party assumes full               
responsibility for its brokers, agents, employees, officers, directors,         
members, representatives, Affiliates, and any third party vendors retained by   
such Party in the performance of its duties and obligations under this          
Agreement, and for its own compliance and the compliance of each of its         
brokers, agents, employees, officers, directors, members, representatives,      
Affiliates, and vendors with all Applicable Laws.                               

 Section 10.3 Agreement Not Assignable. Without the prior written consent of
the other Party hereto, no Party may assign this Agreement to any other person; 
provided, however, that, upon not less than thirty (30) days prior written      
notice, a Party may assign this Agreement in whole, but not in part, to an      
Affiliate if, in any such case, said Affiliate shall either automatically by    
operation of law or expressly in writing assume all obligations of the          
assigning Party as fully as if it had originally been a Party hereto; and       
provided further that such Affiliate must possess all necessary ability, power  
and authority and financial and other resources for it to perform fully all of  
the assigning Party's duties and obligations under this Agreement. Any          
assignment in violation of this Section 10.3 shall be null and void. Subject to 
the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall inure to the     
benefit of, the legal successors and assigns of the respective Parties hereto,  
including, without limitation, any assignment by merger, operation of law,      
consolidation, asset transfer, or otherwise.                                    

Section 10.4 Use of Third Party Service Providers. Subject to the terms of
this Agreement, each Party may utilize the services of any third party in       
fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement; provided, however, that in     
such event, the Party utilizing the services of a third party shall enter into  
a contractual arrangement with such third party that prohibits the third party  
from disclosing or using any information obtained by it for any purpose other   
than to carry out the purposes of this Agreement; and further provided that the 
Party retaining and such third party shall remain responsible for such          
obligations and be fully responsible for any acts or omissions of such third    
party.

  Section 10.5 Waiver and Amendment. Except as otherwise specifically provided
herein, this Agreement may only be amended by the written consent of the        
Parties hereto. The terms of this Agreement shall not be waived, altered,       
modified, amended or supplemented in any manner whatsoever except by a written  
instrument signed by the Party waiving its rights.                              

Section 10.6 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by the law of
state of New York, without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of laws 
thereof.                                                                        

Section 10.7 Entire Agreement and Severability. This Agreement (including 
the Ancillary Agreements, the other agreements contemplated hereby and thereby, 
and the Exhibits hereto and thereto) contains the entire agreement among the    
Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior      
agreements, written or oral, with respect thereto. If any provision of this     
Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or  
future law or if determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be          
unenforceable, and if the rights or obligations of the Parties under this       
Agreement will not be materially and adversely affected thereby, such provision 
shall be fully severable, and this Agreement will be construed and enforced as  
if such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part  
of this Agreement, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain  
in full force and effect and will not be affected by the illegal, invalid or    
unenforceable provision or by its severance herefrom.                           

Section 10.8 Notice. Any notice required or to be permitted to be given by
either Party to the other shall be in writing and shall be deemed given upon    
delivery if delivered personally, upon telephonic or electronic confirmation of 
transmission if sent by facsimile or email, upon the third Business Day after

proceeding is improper or that this Agreement or the subject matter hereof may  
not be enforced in or by such court, and (iii) waives and agrees not to seek

hereto hereby consents to service of process by registered mail at the address  
to which notices are to be given. Each Party hereby agrees that its submission  
to jurisdiction and its consent to service of process by mail are made for the  
express benefit of the other parties hereto. Final judgment against any party   
hereto in any such action, suit or proceeding may be enforced in other          
jurisdictions by suit, action or proceeding on the judgment, or in any other    
manner provided by or pursuant to the laws of such other jurisdiction;          
provided, however, that any party hereto may at its option bring suit, or       
institute other judicial proceeding for such purpose, in any state or federal   
court of the United States or of any country or place where the other party or  
its assets, may be found.                                                       

 Section 10.13 Force Majeure. The Parties hereto shall not be liable for any
failure or delay in the performance of their respective obligations (other than 
payment obligations) under this Agreement to the extent such failure or delay   
both:                                                                           

(a) is caused by any of the following: acts of war, terrorism, civil
riots or rebellions, quarantines, embargoes and other similar unusual     
governmental action, extraordinary elements of nature or nature or acts of
God; and                                                                  

(b) could not have been prevented by the non-performing Party's     
reasonable precautions or commercially accepted processes, or could not   
reasonably be circumvented by the non-performing Party through the use of 
substitute services, alternate sources, work around plans or other        
reasonable means.                                                         

     (c) Events meeting both of the criteria set forth in Section 10.13(a) and
10.13(b) are referred to individually and collectively as "Force Majeure  
 Events." The Parties expressly acknowledge that Force Majeure Events do not
  include vandalism, the regulatory acts of governmental authorities, or labor
  strikes, or the non-performance by third-parties or Subcontractors relied on
for the delivery of the services to be provided hereunder, unless such    
failure or non-performance by a third party or subcontractor is itself    
caused by a Force Majeure Event.                                          

(d) Upon the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, the non-performing
Party shall be excused from any further performance of the affected       
 obligation(s) for so long as such circumstances prevail, provided that such
 party continues to attempt to recommence performance to the greatest extent
possible without delay.                                                   

    (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, a Force Majeure
Event that results in failure or substantial delay of the performance by a
 Party of its obligations under this Agreement shall obligate such party, if
  appropriate, to implement its disaster recovery plan within the time periods
described therein.                                                        

  (f) If a Force Majeure Event causes a material failure or delay in the
performance of any obligation by Jefferson National, JNSC, or JNFC under  
  this Agreement for more than thirty (30) consecutive days, at the request of
 PHLVIC and PLIC, Jefferson National shall cooperate with PHLVIC and PLIC in
good faith to transition the administrative services of the Phoenix       
  Contracts to a third party service provider at a fee arrangement as mutually
agreed to by the Parties in good faith.
