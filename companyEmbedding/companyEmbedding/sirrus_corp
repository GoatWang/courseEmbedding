	Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement



	  


	On May 8, 2017 (the "

	Effective Date

	"), Sirrus Security, Inc. ("

	Sirrus

	"), a Georgia corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Registrant, entered into a Strategic Partnership Agreement (the "

	Agreement

	") with RelifyTime, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company ("

	Relify

	"), pursuant to which Relify has engaged Sirrus to develop and design a software applications program and hosting platform to be known as "Relify Time" (the "

	Product

	").


	 


	As consideration for the development and use of the Product, Relify has agreed to pay Sirrus a royalty fee in an amount equal to 40% of the gross profit (gross sales less cost of goods sold), commencing on the date when Relify first sells licensed services incorporating the Product until an aggregate of $500,000 has been paid to Sirrus (the "

	Royalty Period

	").


	 


	During the Royalty Period, Sirrus will provide maintenance and support for Product. Any support and maintenance services, updates, versions or new releases after the expiration of the Royalty Period shall be contracted under a separate agreement between the parties to be executed no later than 30 days prior to the end of the Royalty Period.


	 


	At any time during the term of the Agreement and up to one year thereafter, if Relify decides to sell the Product to a third party, Sirrus will have a 30-day right of first refusal to acquire the Product from Relify. At any time during the term of the Agreement and one year thereafter, Relify shall grant Sirrus the right of first refusal for any financing transaction, expiring 14 days after notice is given.


	 


	Upon the completion of the Royalty Period, all intellectual property rights developed by Sirrus in connection with the provision of the services to Relify under the Agreement, or jointly by Sirrus or Relify, or by Sirrus pursuant to the specifications or instructions provided by Relify, shall belong exclusively to Relify. All pre-existing intellectual property rights shall remain the sole property of Sirrus. Notwithstanding anything contained in the Agreement, Sirrus shall be free to use any ideas, concepts, or know-how developed or acquired by Sirrus during the performance of the Agreement to the extent obtained and retained by Sirrus’ personnel.


	 


	The term of the Agreement commences on the Effective Date and continues until the completion of the Royalty Period. The Agreement may be terminated by either party upon written notice to the other, if the other party breaches any material obligation under the Agreement and fails to cure such breach within 30 days of receiving notification. In the case of a termination of the Agreement, Relify has agreed to pay Sirrus for all services rendered and work performed up to the effective date of the termination.


	 


	The Agreement also contains customary indemnification and confidentiality provisions. Neither party may assign its rights or obligations under the Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party.


	 


	A copy the Agreement is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Report and incorporated by reference herein.

	Under no circumstances shall SIRRUS, its contracted providers, officers, agents, or anyone else involved in creating, producing, or distributing RELIFY's Product be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special or consequential damages that result from the use of or inability to use the Product; or that results from mistakes, omissions, interruptions, deletion of files, errors, defects, delays in operation, or transmission or any failure of performance, whether or not limited to acts of God, communication failure, theft, destruction or unauthorized access to RELIFY's records, programs or services. RELIFY hereby acknowledges that this paragraph shall apply to all content on said Hosting Service. THE TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND CAUSES OF ACTION (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE) TO THE OTHER SHALL NOT EXCEED THE DEVELOPMENT PRICE (AS DEFINED IN SECTION 0). THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL APPLY EVEN IF THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES SET FORTH ABOVE FAIL IN THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.







	 






	 




	4







	 




	 




	 







	8.




	INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS:





	  







	 




	8.1.





	RELIFY INDEMNITY:

	RELIFY agrees that it shall defend, indemnify, save and hold SIRRUS harmless from any and all demands, liabilities, losses, costs and claims, including reasonable attorneys' fees, (collectively "Liabilities") asserted against SIRRUS, its contracted providers, agents, RELIFYs, servants, officers and employees, that may arise or result from any service provided or performed or agreed to the performance of any product sold by RELIFY, its agents, employees or assigns. RELIFY agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless SIRRUS against Liabilities arising out of (i) any injury to any person or property caused by any products sold or otherwise distributed in connection with the Product; (ii) any material supplied by RELIFY infringing or allegedly infringing on the proprietary rights of a third party; or (iii) copyright infringement and/or litigation regarding content-related disputes.








	 

	 







	 




	8.2.




	SIRRUS INDEMNITY:

	SIRRUS shall indemnify and hold harmless RELIFY (and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, co-branders or other partners, and employees) from any and all claims, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees and all related costs and expenses) incurred by RELIFY as a result of any claim, judgment, or adjudication against RELIFY arising from a claim that RELIFY's use of the SIRRUS Content, as permitted under this Agreement, infringes Intellectual Property rights of a third party or arising from a claim which results from SIRRUS’s breach of the warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement. To qualify for such defense and payment, RELIFY must: (i) give SIRRUS prompt written notice of a claim; and (ii) allow SIRRUS to control, and fully cooperate with SIRRUS in, the defense and all related negotiations. SIRRUS shall have no obligation to indemnify RELIFY under this Section to the extent the infringement arises from (i) the RELIFY Content, (ii) specifications provided by RELIFY or its agents; (iii) derivative works of the Product created by RELIFY, (iv) use of the Product in combination with non-SIRRUS approved third party products, including hardware and software, (v) modifications or maintenance of the Product by a party other than SIRRUS, (vi) misuse of the Product, and (vii) failure of RELIFY to implement any improvement or updates to the Product, if the infringement claim would have been avoided by the use of the improvement or updates.







	 

	 







	 




	8.3.



	Promptly after receipt by a person entitled to indemnification pursuant to the foregoing Section 9.1 or 9.2 (the "Indemnified Party") of notice of the commencement of any action, the Indemnified Party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be or has been made against a party who has agreed to provide indemnification under Section 9.1 or 9.2 (an "Indemnifying Party"), promptly notify in writing the Indemnifying Party of the commencement thereof; but the omission to so notify the Indemnifying Party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to the Indemnified Party except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by the delay or failure to notify it. In case any such action is brought against an Indemnified Party, and it notifies the Indemnifying Party of the commencement thereof, the Indemnifying Party will be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other Indemnifying Party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, subject to the provisions herein stated, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, and after notice from the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of its election to so assume the defense thereof, the Indemnifying Party will not be liable to the Indemnified Party under this Section 9 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. The Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall not be at the expense of the Indemnifying Party if the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of the action with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party; provided that the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnifying Party if (i) the employment of such counsel has been specifically authorized in writing by the Indemnifying Party or (ii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnified Party or parties and the Indemnifying Party and, in the judgement of counsel for the Indemnified Party, it is advisable for the Indemnified Party or parties to be represented by separate counsel (in which case the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action on behalf of the Indemnified Party or parties, it being understood, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall not, in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys for the Indemnified Party or parties. No settlement of any action against an Indemnified Part shall be made without the consent of the Indemnifying Party and no Indemnifying Party, in the defense of any such claim or action, shall, except with the consent of the Indemnified Party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnified Party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation. If the Indemnified Party fails to execute a release or other settlement agreement under circumstances where all of the conditions of the preceding sentence have been met, the Indemnifying Party shall have no further obligation to the Indemnified Party pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise.

	DISPUTES:

	RELIFY and SIRRUS agree to make a good-faith effort to resolve any disagreement arising out of, or in connection with, this Agreement through negotiation. Should the parties fail to resolve any such disagreement within ten (10) days, any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including, without limitation, the interpretation or breach thereof, shall be submitted by either party to arbitration in Fulton County, Georgia and in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.

	Neither party shall be deemed by mere lapse of time (without giving notice or taking other action hereunder) to have waived any breach by the other party of any of the provisions of this Agreement. Further, the waiver by either party of a particular breach of this Agreement by the other party shall not be construed as, or constitute, a continuing waiver of such breach, or of other breaches of the same or other provisions of this Agreement.





	 




	 






	17.




	TRADEMARKS:

	The RELIFY unconditionally warrants and guarantees that any elements of text, graphics, photos, designs, trademarks, or other artwork furnished to SIRRUS, Inc. and/or its assigns for inclusion in the Product are owned by the RELIFY, or that the RELIFY has permission from the rightful owner to use each of these elements, and will hold harmless, protect, indemnify and defend SIRRUS, Inc. its assigns and its subcontractors from any liability (including attorney's fees and court costs), including any claim or suit, threatened or actual, arising from the use of such elements furnished by the RELIFY.

RELIFY agree that in such an event RELIFY shall pay all resulting costs, damages, expenses and reasonable attorneys’ fees that a court awards and settlements incurred by SIRRUS in connection with any such claims.







	 






	 




	7







	 




	 





	 







	19.




	LAW AFFECTING ELECTRONIC COMMERCE:

	The RELIFY agrees that the RELIFY is solely responsible for complying with such laws, taxes, and tariffs, and will hold harmless, protect, and defend SIRRUS and its subcontractors from any claim, suit, penalty, tax, or tariff arising from the RELIFY’s use of Internet electronic commerce. SIRRUS, Inc warrants that it will secure, as needed on e-commerce sites, a valid SSL certificate on any site which will transmit, receive, process or have access to sensitive data of any sort.

* This includes reporting expenses for the year (including legal, audit, EDGAR
  services).  Increases in costs can be attributed to an increase in reporting
  complexity due to expanding operations.

The actual costs may differ from the above values, because those were estimated
by the Company.

The proceeds will not be used, fully or in part, to pay salary or make any other
payments to the Company’s sole officer and Director, Mr. Guled.  The funds
invested by our president to acquire the shares he now holds have been used to
pay for all the costs incurred to date and will be added to the funds (if any)
received through this offering to be used for the development of our Business,
pursuant to our Use of Proceeds and Plan of Operations.

According to our Use of Proceeds, we intend to prioritize the proceeds from this
offering to ensure maintenance of reporting status for the next twelve months.

If we cannot raise enough funds to start our Plan of Operations, we would need
to seek capital from other resources such as debt financing in order to develop
our products. Even if we are able to raise enough funds to implement our plan of
operations, we will need to seek capital from other sources to fully develop our
products.


The e-cigarette industry is extremely competitive with low barriers to
entry. Competition is based on availability, brand development and recognition
and price. We compete with other sellers of e-cigarettes, such as big tobacco
companies- through their electronic cigarettes business segments, independent
domestic and international e-cigarette companies, small internet and kiosk
e-cigarette companies as well as multiple resellers and distributors.

Our direct competitors sell products that are substantially similar to
ours and through the same channels we use to sell our products.  We compete
primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty,
service, marketing, advertising and price. We are subject to highly competitive
conditions in all aspects of our business. The competitive environment and our
competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic
conditions, erosion of consumer confidence, competitors’ introduction of
low-priced products or innovative products, cigarette excise taxes, higher
absolute prices and larger gaps between price categories, and product regulation
that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products. We compete with
these direct competitors for sales through the internet as well as distributors,
wholesalers and retailers including national chain stores, tobacco shops, gas
stations, grocery chains and other outlets associated with the selling of
tobacco products.


Company Description
We are seeking to engage in the designing, marketing and distribution of 
electronic cigarettes (“e-cigarette”) in East Africa.

E-cigarettes are battery-powered products that simulate tobacco smoking through 
inhalation of nicotine vapor without the fire, flame, tobacco, tar, carbon 
monoxide,


 ash, stub, smell and other chemicals found in traditional combustible 
cigarettes.

Africa is poised to become the “future epicenter of the tobacco epidemic,” 
according to a new analysis from the American Cancer Society [1]. It indicates 
that the number of adults in Africa who smoke could increase to 572 million by
2100, from 77 million today, unless leaders take steps to curb current trends. 
The report highlights several reasons for the increase in smoking rates:

. In Africa, 9% of boys and 3% of girls smoke -- both rates are high compared
  with other developing regions.

. Africa is set for massive population growth. The region now accounts for 12%
  of the global population -- this will climb to 30% by 2100. The study 
  concludes that because of this, Africa will have the second-highest number 
  of smokers of any region by 2060.

. African nations experienced strong economic growth in the 2000s, which means
  more people have more money to spend on cigarettes.

We believe this strong consumer demand will lead retailers to allocate
additional shelf space to smoking related products and we will strive to offer
our e-cigarette products at or near points of distribution where traditional
cigarettes are available in the markets we serve.  We believe e-cigarettes offer
a compelling alternative for smokers, relative to traditional cigarettes.

Our goal is to become the leading e-cigarette marketer and distributor in
the East Africa. We expect to achieve our goal by maximizing our points of
distribution, maintaining our low-cost position and continuing to differentiate
our products and brands in order to resonate with consumers in local markets
around the region.  Our plan is to finalize our first distribution agreement by
the end of February 2015 with a health food company that has multi locations and
distribution agreements with three of the top 3 grocery chains in Kenya. We are
currently in negotiations to finalize this distribution agreement.

Our strategy is to increase our future sales by penetrating new and
emerging markets where we expect rising consumer incomes and an increase in
demand for e-cigarettes.  Cigarette smokers in these emerging markets are our
target demographic and will represent our primary source of future revenue
growth.

We will focus on rapidly securing retail distribution in Kenya and East
African markets through strategic partnerships with key retailers and
distributors.  We believe strong consumer demand will lead retailers to allocate
additional shelf space to smoking related products and we strive to offer our
products at or near every point of distribution where traditional cigarettes are
available in the markets we serve.  We believe e-cigarettes offer a compelling
alternative for smokers, relative to traditional cigarettes. Our goal is to
become the leading e-cigarette marketer and distributor in the East Africa. We
expect to achieve our goal by maximizing our points of distribution, maintaining
our low-cost position and continuing to differentiate our products and brands in
order to resonate with consumers in local markets around the region.

An Invitation to industry What it means for products




 Fast cure speeds at ambient temperatures significantly reducing cycle times, increasing throughput, reducing energy costs, and enabling new material selections in a broad range of customer and consumer applications, automotive, electronics, millwork, packaging, and hygiene. 






Drastically Reduce
Cure Time

Cure time, from automotive component bonding, to protective and maintenance coating, to can coatings, poses the key bottleneck to expedited access to these respective markets. This feature translates to lower applied costs via a combination of lower labor costs, increased overall throughput, reduced asset downtimes, no heat or ultraviolet light associated with the cure of many other adhesives and coatings, and in many cases, lower rework rates. Combined, these benefits reduce applied costs of fifty percent or more in many applications.









Reduction of Thermal Energy Input

Tied with expedited cure time, applications such as vehicle paint, injection molding, and wind blade manufacturing currently require thermal heating to cure. Our Chemilian monomer platform cures at ambient temperatures, and diminishes the need for thermal heat curing, a process that requires an extraordinary amount of energy and significant capital costs. These benefits are particularly salient for new construction and regions where energy delivery is expensive or challenging.










Elimination of
Hazardous Materials

BPA in can coatings, formaldehyde in wood composites, and styrene in glass fibers pose insidious threats to human health. Regulatory limits have been imposed, especially on BPA usage in children’s products. The Sirrus-developed monomer platform offers viable substitutes for these harmful chemicals, many of which currently lack performance-driven solutions.









Performance Improvement

Our class of monomers have physical properties that allow the resulting polymer to be exposed to tough environmental conditions, including high heat, high humidity, solvents and other environmental exposure. Additionally, due to the unique cure system that our products enable, we allow for a change in partner business model and substrate selection. Potential results include lower cost manufacturing, enhanced just in time manufacturing, and discrete assembly.














The chemical reaction Anionic Polymerization
This reaction occurs in our materials rapidly at room temperature, allowing partners to make high molecular weight reactive products, such as, coatings, adhesives, inks, resins and sealants. 
















"As a step-change in technology, Chemilian and Forza invite industrial customers of all types to think about their assembly and manufacturing processes in new ways."
- Jeff Sullivan, Ph.D., Senior VP R&D 















Meet ChemilianTM & ForzaTM Introducing a breakthrough





 
 
ChemilianTM
ChemilianTM products have one alkene group with the potential to have a wide variety of substituent terminal or functional groups, that can be used to make high molecular weight polymers.





 
 


 
 
ForzaTM
ForzaTM products contain multiple alkene groups allowing cross-linking for the development of polymers exhibiting high strength, thermal and chemical resistance.














Brought to you by Sirrus A step-change in technology










 
Sirrus has developed a new chemical platform based on 1,1-disubstituted alkene monomers that will allow many current chemical processes to be done faster and/or with less energy.
 









 
The materials we are manufacturing will be used to make new components that can be formulated into plastics, rubber, films, coatings, inks, sealants, adhesives and other products.
 









 
The combination of multiple reactive sites that includes a fast curing alkene group allow for the creation of many new compounds having a unique combination of properties.
 














Our proprietary technology enables us to manufacture, stabilize, activate and formulate a new class of materials.





















About UsOur HeritageOur LeadershipBoard of DirectorsInvestorsCareers 
Sirrus advances manufacturing technology through chemistry relating to the synthesis, stabilization, activation and formulation of a unique and reactive class of monomers commonly known as methylene malonates. These monomers, their derivatives and resulting polymer platforms provide the foundation for enabling our customers to meet their customers needs through our game-changing technology.
Currently known for Chemilian™ and Forza™, Sirrus provides the next generation of adhesive, sealant, coating and resin solutions for various manufacturing and assembly industries. The Sirrus polymerization-on-demand technology currently provides fast cure speeds at ambient temperatures to significantly reduce cycle times, increase throughput, reduce energy costs, and enable new material selection in a broad range of customer and consumer applications, including auto, electronics, packaging and hygiene.
