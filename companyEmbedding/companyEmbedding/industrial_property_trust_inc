				* Please see Supplement No. 10, dated December 13, 2016, to the Industrial Property Trust, Inc. (“IPT”) prospectus, dated April 21, 2016 (the “Prospectus”), as previously supplemented by Supplement No. 3, dated August 15, 2016 and as subsequently supplemented thereafter. Supplement No. 10 describes that IPT’s board of directors has determined that IPT will cease new sales of primary offering shares at the earlier to occur of either (i) June 30, 2017 or (ii) the date on which IPT sells all of the shares that remain available for sale pursuant to the offering. If IPT’s board of directors determines, in its sole discretion, to terminate the sale of primary shares pursuant to the offering earlier or later than the dates set forth above, IPT will notify stockholders by filing a supplement to the Prospectus with the SEC. 

Supplement No. 3 includes disclosure that IPT’s board of directors determined to reallocate $325 million in shares previously allocated to the distribution reinvestment plan portion of IPT’s public offering to the primary portion of the offering. As of April 4, 2017, IPT had received gross proceeds of approximately $1.645 billion from the sale of shares of common stock in the primary offering. 
Accordingly, as of April 4, 2017, approximately $232.7 million in shares of IPT’s common stock remained available for sale pursuant to the primary offering and approximately $122.0 million in shares may be issued pursuant to IPT’s distribution reinvestment plan, all of which may be sold in any combination of Class A shares or Class T shares.
 IPT plans to continue to offer shares pursuant to its distribution reinvestment plan following the cessation of the sale of primary shares in the offering. IPT reserves the right to reallocate the shares further between the primary portion of the offering and the distribution reinvestment plan. All prospectus supplements should be read in conjunction with the Prospectus.



Please be aware that IPT, Industrial Property Trust Advisors LLC, Industrial Property Trust Advisors Group LLC, Black Creek Capital Markets, LLC and their respective officers, directors, employees and affiliates are not undertaking to provide impartial investment advice or to give advice in a fiduciary capacity in connection with IPT’s public offering or the purchase of IPT’s common stock and that the Advisor and the Dealer Manager have financial interests associated with the purchase of IPT’s common stock, as described in IPT’s prospectus, including fees, expense reimbursements and other payments they anticipate receiving from IPT in connection with the purchase of IPT’s common stock. These materials are not intended as a recommendation to make an investment in IPT’s common stock and investors should consult their financial advisors before making an investment decision.

(“IPT”) prospectus, dated April 21, 2016 (the “Prospectus”), as previously supplemented by Supplement No. 3, dated August 15, 2016 and as subsequently supplemented thereafter. Supplement No. 10 describes that IPT’s board of directors has determined that IPT will cease new sales of primary offering shares at the earlier to occur of either (i) June 30, 2017 or (ii) the date on which IPT sells all of the shares that remain available for sale pursuant to the offering. If IPT’s board of directors determines, in its sole discretion, to terminate the sale of primary shares pursuant to the offering earlier or later than the dates set forth above, IPT will notify stockholders by filing a supplement to the Prospectus with the SEC. 

Supplement No. 3 includes disclosure that IPT’s board of directors determined to reallocate $325 million in shares previously allocated to the distribution reinvestment plan portion of IPT’s public offering to the primary portion of the offering. As of April 4, 2017, IPT had received gross proceeds of approximately $1.645 billion from the sale of shares of common stock in the primary offering. 
Accordingly, as of April 4, 2017, approximately $232.7 million in shares of IPT’s common stock remained available for sale pursuant to the primary offering and approximately $122.0 million in shares may be issued pursuant to IPT’s distribution reinvestment plan, all of which may be sold in any combination of Class A shares or Class T shares.
 IPT plans to continue to offer shares pursuant to its distribution reinvestment plan following the cessation of the sale of primary shares in the offering. IPT reserves the right to reallocate the shares further between the primary portion of the offering and the distribution reinvestment plan. All prospectus supplements should be read in conjunction with the Prospectus.
