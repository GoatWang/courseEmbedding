Outsmart Burglars  the Moment You Plug It In





“I built SimpliSafe to make home security simpler and smarter. It uses advanced wireless technology, there’s no annual contracts, and it saves you hundreds. I’m proud of that.”
Chad Laurans, CEO & Chief Engineer

After his friends were robbed, Chad Laurans discovered a serious problem in the home security industry. You want your home to be safe, but alarm companies charge huge fees of $45 a month and lock you in long-term contracts. The demands are just too high.
So Chad Built Something New.
Relying on his electrical engineering degree from Yale and an MBA from Harvard, he designed an advanced home security system. He called it SimpliSafe.
Now it’s the fastest growing home security company in the nation. SimpliSafe won’t lock you in a long-term contract and 24/7 professional monitoring is only $14.99 a month.
Protect your home—the smart way. 










Award-Winning Home Security
Winner of CNET Editor’s Choice Award, Angie’s List Super Service Award, and A+ Rated by the Better Business Bureau.








Dave Ramsey, Personal Finance Expert:
“Protecting your family is important, but don’t ever sign a long-term contract. Do it the right way with SimpliSafe. These are the good guys!”





Joe Balog, Police Chief:
"My force used SimpliSafe to stop a serial burglary ring. It still helps us catch other criminals in the act today."





Unlike SimpliSafe, most burglar alarms are far too expensive, here’s why...



With so many people making a profit, they need to use sneaky tactics to extract money from you

They bait you with a “$99” offer though there’s typically $1,500 of hidden fees beneath the hood.
They lock you into 2-3 year contracts that contain fine print such as auto-renewal clauses. (Click to find out why the Government is considering making them illegal).
Their alarms use old wired technology and they’re hard to use (so you need to pay a service engineer for even the most straightforward task).




At SimpliSafe, There Are No Middlemen.
SimpliSafe has sliced out shady annual contracts, intrusive installations, and costly middlemen. We designed our system from scratch to give you everything you need in a security system plus some exciting bells and whistles. We sell direct to you, online. Our system is easy to self-install, and we pass the savings onto you with excellent equipment pricing and monthly monitoring for just $14.99/month.

 describes SimpliSafe alarms as

Many alarm companies have absolutely huge sneaky hidden fees. They advertise their alarms as being “from $99”, then they get you to sign a contract for over $1,000—and you can’t leave them for at least 3 years. But SimpliSafe alarms have no hidden charges.
We’re so confident you’ll love your SimpliSafe alarm that we’ll let you try it RISK-FREE with an incredible no-risk 60-day money back guarantee. SimpliSafe alarms are reliable, easy to use, have no annual contracts and
                no hidden costs.

9 Things to Avoid When Choosing A Traditional Alarm Company
We listened to all the things you dislike about traditional burglar alarm companies... then fixed them.




Traditional Alarm Company
SimpliSafe: a Better Way






                        Old wired technology. Traditional alarm companies 
                        want to put wires in your walls, because they know 
                        that ripping their wires out is hard and expensive.
                        



                        State-of-the-art 100% wireless technology. We 
                        took micro-chip technology and 
                        developed smarter software to offer you a robust 
                        and reliable security system. With wireless, there 
                        are no holes in your walls.
                        






                        Monitoring is $42.99 a month.
                        



                        Ours is just $14.99 a month. SimpliSafe protects your home 
                        with COPS Monitoring - named BEST MONITORING in the 
                        Industry by the Central Station Alarm Association.
                        





                        The moment you let them put a system into your home, you’re 
                        typically locked into a $1,547 contract with no way out.
                        



                        No annual contracts! Our customers stay with us because of 
                        our excellent product quality and helpful customer support.
                        





                        Auto-renewal clauses grab another $1,547 from you if you don’t 
                        cancel them within 90 days of the end of your three-year term. 
                        Forget to cancel? You’re legally trapped—there’s no way out.
                        




                        No hidden charges, no 
                        commitments, no sneaky tricks.
                        





                        Many frustrated customers (just google “alarm system 
                        complaints” or “alarm contract complaints” and see 
                        for yourself).
                    



                        Growing by word of mouth. See our Facebook fan page.
                        





                        Uses a phone line to connect to the monitoring center. 
                        Burglars sometimes cut phone lines.
                        



                        Uses its built-in and independent cellular connection, which is 
                        5-10 seconds faster, and is uncuttable. No phone line required.
                        





                        Prices are kept high because there are so many 
                        middlemen and salespeople involved.
                        



                        We don’t have expensive salespeople or middlemen. That’s 
                        how we can afford to keep our prices so low.
                        





                        Installation typically costs between $99 and $500. You’ll 
                        need to take a day off of work, while the installer drills 
                        holes in your walls.
                        



                        Set-up is easier than you could ever imagine. No tools 
                        needed, just adhesive pads. The unit actually talks to you 
                        while you’re setting it up. One of our customers purchased a 
                        second system for his daughter’s home and was “looking 
                        forward to the joy of installing it for her.” Watch our

                        easy installation video to see what he means.
                        

                        Does easy set-up mean the system is flimsy or less secure?  
                        No! Quite the opposite. No wires means there’s nothing for 
                        burglars to cut.
                        




                        As soon as you sign up, there’s no going back: 
                        you cannot cancel even if you try.

Nearly One Million Americans TrustSimpliSafe to Protect Them. Here’s Why:



Dennis R.
Amarillo, TX



This morning at 6:45 AM, my phone rang. It was the SimpliSafe operator, telling me that my alarm was going off. I had them call the police and they were there within minutes. The glass in the back door had been broken but the system worked perfectly and the intruders ran away. We only had to replace a small pane of glass.







Greg W.
Clarksville, TN



Our home was burglarized two weeks ago. I purchased a system that night and installed it within the week. Today, the thieves returned and the alarm scared them off. The officers were at my home within minutes. Nothing was taken.  SimpliSafe works.







Lauren B.
Tacoma, WA



We installed our system and within one week, the water sensor placed at our water heater set off the alarm. Sure enough, the T/P valve had opened on our water heater. The monitoring service alerted us in under 60 seconds. No water damage whatsoever! Way to go Simplisafe! Our system paid for itself that day.







Stephanie T.
Toledo, OH



I love my system. It saved us from thousands of dollars in damage when the power went out in our house in Northern Ohio on the coldest day in February (-17°!). The monitoring center alerted us in Florida that the power was out and the temperature in the house was dropping fast. We were able to contact an electrician to repair the problem. Without the system we never would have known and would have had major freeze damage.






SimpliSafe is recommended by ABC, Fox News, NBC & more!





















“No installation, no annual contracts, very smart.”






“Everything is included, and it’s portable so if you change apartments, you can just bring it with you.”






“David vs Goliath, SimpliSafe vs ADT: 
                SimpliSafe aims to upstage their larger 
                rivals by giving consumers what they really
                 want. Even without fancy marketing, word 
                 is spreading.”  see review








SimpliSafe is not for you if...


1
You have a HUGE home: If your home is larger than 20,000 
            square feet (about the size of a football field)—or if it has more 
            than 50 windows on the first floor—you would probably benefit 
            from a system that can handle a huge number of sensors. Our 
            advice would be to go to a traditional contract security company
            —and keep in mind the things we’ve warned you about.


2
You run a large commercial property such as a 
            shopping mall—you would probably benefit from a 
            system that has CCTV or security guards, in which 
            case you should probably go to one of the traditional 
            contract security companies—and keep in mind the 
            things we’ve warned you about.



However, if you’re one of the 95% of people who don’t run a large commercial property, then SimpliSafe is probably the best
            choice for you. If you’re in any doubt, contact one of our security consultants at 1-888-957-4675 for free friendly advice.

Most Alarms Have Two Dangerous Defects—SimpliSafe Doesn’t
Learn the Two Powerful Secrets for Stopping Intruders In Their Tracks:
				Most wireless alarm systems have a dangerous defect—if an intruder smashes the Keypad quickly enough, the police don’t get alerted. SimpliSafe has solved this problem: we took the brains of your system out of your keypad, and hid them in your Base Station.

This is the most affordable and comprehensive protection possible. 24/7 professional protection is just $14.99—with a free cellular connection built-in!
Most alarm companies charge you over $30, $40 or sometimes $50 every month…for the exact same level of monitoring.

You can cancel at any time

SimpliSafe is the ONLY alarm company that gives you the freedom to subscribe to our monitoring service for as long as you want and cancel at any time, without any termination fees or hassles. You pay $14.99 per month and that’s it.

Please note: While SimpliSafe has no annual contracts, all our monitored customers sign a Terms of Service.





SimpliSafe is There...Even When the Lights Go Out


Never fear a power outage or electricity failure again. SimpliSafe runs on powerful lithium batteries that last 5 years—so you stay secure when the electricity fails. Plus, the Base Station comes equipped with a built-in rechargeable backup battery, which can power your system for 24 hours and be recharged at any time.


Customer Review: Donald Meehan
“I have had my system for about 6 weeks now my wife and I love it. We just lost power for four days, I took the base to my in-laws and recharged it twice. It worked great during the power outage. I spoke to some neighbors who have also recently got alarms with other companies, they were very upset because their system died pretty quickly and were not able to recharge it.”









You’ll Save Up to 20% on Home Insurance With this Certificate


Home insurance companies know the value of professional alarm monitoring. That’s why you will save 5% to 20% on your insurance premiums when your protect your home with SimpliSafe monitoring!
With savings that great, your professional alarm monitoring might even pay for itself. Over 100,000 SimpliSafe customers are saving money on their insurance premiums! These are just a small sample of the insurance companies we work with:













Firefighters Straight to your Door


When a fire is burning in your home every second counts. SimpliSafe smoke detectors are built with photoelectric sensors for faster detection of a fire before it breaks into a flame, giving you and your family more time to get up and out of your home. Photoelectric sensors like ours are less likely to trigger annoying false alarms.
Never worry about sleeping through a fire alarm. This monitored detector will sound its own internal siren as well as trigger the full security system alarm.






Our competitor’s model sells for $79.99. Ours is $29.99. How do we sell the highest quality sensors at half the price? No middlemen.






Extreme Range—and Fully Customizable for Your Home





SimpliSafe sensors have a huge range of 400 ft., so our system is perfect for homes and businesses of any size (unless you live in the Superdome).
Some alarm companies make it almost impossible to personalize your alarm for your home. Every SimpliSafe alarm system is 100% customizable to meet your home’s unique needs. Our systems support up to 41 sensors—you can add more at any time via our online security shop or with a quick call to our friendly support team.





Smart Sensors Never Mistake Pets for Burglars


SimpliSafe uses more precise motion sensors to ensure your pets won’t trigger your alarms. Simply place your motion sensors where your pets can’t fiddle with them, and your cats or dogs can comfortably play at home without triggering an alarm.

It’s Easier Than Ever to Test Your Sensors

It’s easy to make sure your pets won’t set off your alarm with SimpliSafe’s unique Test Mode. And our security specialists are available for a consultation if you’re having trouble finding the right position!

Homeowners with big pets love this trick

Normally, the Motion Sensor looks straight out and down towards the ground. If your pet is triggering the sensor, just place it about 4-5 feet above ground level, and turn it upside down! This way, your pet can’t trigger it, but an intruder will!








Moving is Easier than Ever—Fully Portable Alarms





All SimpliSafe Equipment will fit a new home quickly and easily. Moving to a larger place? No problem. Order extra sensors anytime

Simple Re-Installation

We include extra 3M command strips in every box, making it easy for you to move sensors to a new home. These adhesive strips are super strong, but are also engineered to pull off cleanly without damaging your walls.





Total Security— Exceptional Savings



CNET calls SimpliSafe “better, smarter home security...you’ll have a hard time finding a better option at a better price.” Here’s why:
We protect your home 24 hours a day with a state-of-the-art security system, professional alarm monitoring, and instant police dispatch. Your security system is so effective that actual Wisconsin police uses it to catch criminals. We use COPS monitoring—winner of CSAA’s Best-in-Industry Monitoring.
...and it’s only 14.99/month Compare that to the $50/month most other companies charge. That adds up to savings of over $500 every year.

100% Satisfaction Guaranteed

We at Simplisafe are committed to providing you with 
		   only the best products and services. Our goal is to 
			make your life safer and easier. If you are in any way 
			unsatisfied with your SimpliSafe product or service,

		   a replacement part, completely free of charge. We can afford 
		   to offer this because our components are so reliable.







What is an “auto-renewal clause” anyway?
Most alarm companies have an automatic renewal clause in their monitoring and service contract (and use teeny tiny font). This means that your contract will be renewed for anywhere from 12 months to three years, unless you cancel by mail within 30 days before the end of your contract. Many of the nationwide and local alarm companies use this tactic. Cancelling early usually involves a penalty of 75% to 100% of the value of the contract. 

SimpliSafe offers monthly alarm monitoring. There are no contracts to sign, so there’s no fear of getting tricked by fine print and hidden fees. You can cancel your SimpliSafe alarm monitoring anytime by simply giving us a call.

"SimpliSafe security system is inexpensive, transportable..."








"All the bells and whistles for a lot less money"








SimpliSafe is our idea of not getting robbed.








"Some things can keep you tethered to landline service, such as your home's security system. Not so with SimpliSafe Inc."








SimpliSafe was featured in Elle Decor's top punchlist.








"This ingenious security system uses wireless technology..."








I really like the SimpliSafe security system for its easy setup, expandability, custom setup options and ability to move with you if you relocate. I think the price for the system is really affordable when you compare it to other security systems on the market. It gets a thumbs up from me.








SimpliSafe offers wireless, plug-and-play security for urban dwellers—increasingly being used in the era of disappearing land lines.








Wireless Wonders: SimpliSafe is an affordable, but full-featured, wireless security system similar to the expensive, professionally installed ones.








"David vs Goliath, SimpliSafe  vs ADT: SimpliSafe aims to upstage their larger rivals by giving consumers what they really want. Even without fancy marketing, word is spreading."








Security Doesn't Get Any Easier. Setup took less than 15 minutes from start to finish and drastically improved my peace of mind.









Rating: Strong Recommend (the highest rating). "This is a system anyone could setup in under 30 minutes." See full review  
If you've got a car alarm, using the SimpliSafe home security system will come as naturally and easily.

Motion Sensor
(always on the lookout)



Full Room Coverage
Detects motion within 30 feet. The sensor has a “field of vision” of 90 degrees, giving you a full 
			range of coverage when placed in a corner. 
Flexible Install
The sensor is shaped to stand on a shelf, adhere to a wall, or fit in a corner for maximum room 
			coverage. Set the sensor to be active only in “away” mode (so that you won’t trigger it when you’re 
			at home) or both “home” and “away” modes (for rooms that you want covered with a motion 
			sensor while you’re home).
Pet Friendly
Your dogs and cats under 50 lbs won’t trigger the alarm. We’ve designed the sensor to be less
			sensitive to motion close to the ground.

SimpliSafe Works Even If the Keypad is Destroyed


Away mode:
When you go out,  this activates all  sensors.
Home mode:
When you come home,  this deactivates motion detectors but protects  windows and doors



(dimensions: 6.5 x 3.5 in.)




Problem: Most wireless alarm systems have an Achilles heel—if a burglar
		  smashes the keypad quickly enough, the police don’t get alerted.
Solution: SimpliSafe took the “brains” out of the Keypad and put them into a
		  separate Base Station, which is hidden somewhere in your home or office building. When an alarm is triggered, the Keypad beeps to distract burglars.
Meanwhile, the Base Station stays quiet while it alerts the monitoring
			  service (which takes just a few seconds). Once the alert has been safely
			  sent, the Base Station will blast its sirens.
Unlike other wireless security systems, if a SimpliSafe keypad is
			smashed, the alarm continues to function.
















Works with Nest requires ourInteractive Monitoring Plan





Nest Learning Thermostat




			The Nest Learning Thermostat programs itself, automatically saves 
			energy when you’re away, and can be controlled using your phone. In 
			independent studies, Nest Thermostat saved an average of 10-12% on 
			heating bills and 15% on cooling bills. That means it can pay for itself
			 in under two years.
		  


			SimpliSafe helps your Nest Thermostat know when you’re home or 
			away. When you arm SimpliSafe to leave home, SimpliSafe tells Nest 
			Thermosat, so Nest Thermostat knows it’s time to lower your energy 
			use. When you come home and disarm SimpliSafe, Nest Thermostat 
			knows you’re back and makes home cozy.
		  














(dimensions: 3 x 1.25 in.)




Closed: Less than 2 in. between the magnet and  the grooves of the  sensor.



Open: More than 2 in. between the magnet and the grooves on the sensor.











Entry Sensors
(defend your windows and doors)



Easy to install on every type of door or window
The magnet goes on the door or window, and the sensor goes on the  frame (or vice 
		 versa).  Magnet can be placed up to 2 inches from the  sensor, so sensors fit on all types of 
		 doors and windows. SimpliSafe sensors come with the battery pre-installed and adhesive 
	   tape  pre-applied, making installation a snap.
Door Chime
When your system is OFF and a door or window opens, the Base Station will sound a 
		door-chime so you’ll know if someone is entering.
How does it work?
The sensor detects whenever the magnet moves more than two inches away from 
		it- so it knows whenever the door or  window opens.






 Our competitor’s model sells for $34.00. Ours is $14.99. How do we  sell the highest
	quality sensors at half the price? No middlemen.















The Base Station
(the brains of your system)



The base is Plug-and-Play: Plug it in and it will locate  and
control all of your sensors, making SimpliSafe  the easiest security system in the world to install.
It’s also responsible for sending all your alarm signals  to our 24/7 alarm monitoring center. Your Base
Station  will arrive equipped with the same cellular technology  that’s in your cellphone: Inside there is a SIM card that  gets activated when you subscribe to our alarm  monitoring
service. If you’re subscribed to our  Interactive Monitoring Plan, it will also
send you SMS  text Smart Alerts & Secret Alerts.

Built-in 85 Decibel Siren
Voice Prompts guide you  through installation.
Cellular Technology: No  Phoneline needed for 24/7 alarm  monitoring! However, if you want 
redundancy, you can also plug in  your phoneline or use an internet  connection.
41 Sensor Capacity: Get all the  sensors you need to protect any
home, large or small.
Backup Battery lasts up to 24 hours  during a power outage. Base Station 
will recharge them once the power  is restored to your home.

105dB Extra Siren
(the burglar blaster)



This 105 decibel siren will feel like sitting in the front row of an ear-piercing rock
		  concert. Get two or more and your entire neighborhood will peek out of their windows.
		  This siren will ensure any foolish burglar knows you’re protected. Look out, burglar -
		  the sheriff’s in town.


Weather resistant for outdoor use

Easily mounts under an eave outside or adhere to a wall inside

Panic Button
(instantly trigger your alarm)



Emergency Alert
Pressing the panic button will instantly trigger the alarm and our monitoring center will
		  call to check if you’re okay. If you don’t answer the phone or don’t give your “safe word”
		  when you answer, we’ll alert the police that you’re in danger.
Silent Panic
If you are a retail or business customer, we can program your system to activate a “silent
		  panic” feature for you, allowing you to signal for help without alerting the intruder.



















(dimensions: 3 x 1.6 in.)






Water Sensors
(stop damage from leaks & floods)



Your Water Sensor will trigger an audible alarm whenever it comes into contact with water.  Our
		  alarm monitoring plans offer additional options to get an phone call and SMS/email alert of any
		  water alarms. 
Why do I need this?
Flood damage is the most common Home Insurance claim, and it’s certainly one of the most
		  expensive. Place it near major plumbing to detect breaks or in the attic to detect a leaky
		  roof.  Undetected floods and leaks can lead to nasty mold infestations, ruined carpets, warped
		  wood floors, and damaged cabinetry and more.

Freeze Sensors
(Prevents burst pipes)



The freeze sensor will trigger an alarm if the temperature in your  home falls below 41°. Our alarm monitoring plans also give you the  options to get:  


A phone call and SMS/Email in the even of a freeze alarm.

Access to hourly readings of your home’s temperature in the Online Command Center.


Why do I need this?
If you have a vacation home, this sensor is worth it’s weight in gold if it saves you from repairing expensive burst pipes. It’s also a perfect device  for protecting precious objects like instruments, paintings and plants in a climate controlled room.
















(height: 3 in.)






Glassbreak Sensor
(Detects the sound of smashing glass)




		If a burglar breaks a window in order to enter your home, this Glassbreak Sensor will detect the sound and trigger your burglar alarm. Pair it with a Motion Detector in any rooms on the first floor that have multiple windows.

Smoke Detector
(firefighters straight to your door)



When a fire is quickening in your home every second counts.  SimpliSafe Smoke
		  detectors are built with photoelectric sensors for increased safety over Ionization
		  sensors. Photoelectric smoke detectors respond faster (typically 30 minutes or
		  more) to fire in its early, smouldering stage before it breaks into flame, giving you
		  and your family more time to get up and out of your home. Photoelectric sensors
		  are also less likely to trigger annoying false alarms.
Never worry about sleeping through a fire alarm.  This monitored smoke detector
		  will sound its own internal siren as well as trigger a full-blown security system
		  alarm.
In addition alarm monitoring plans give you the options to receive: 


A call to alert you and firefighters sent to your home to ensure you and
			  your family are safe.

SMS & Email Notifications automatically sent to your phone and to the
			  phones of loved ones.

















(height: 5in.)






Carbon Monoxide Detector
(sniff out deadly gas leaks)



Carbon Monoxide is a gas that you cannot see, smell or taste. Deaths due to CO
		 poisoning most often occur at night, when  everyone is sleeping. SimpliSafe’s CO
		 detector uses  electrochemical sensing technology for highly accurate and early
		 detection of this invisible but deadly gas.
Dangerous levels of CO will trigger both the sensor’s internal  audible alarm and 
		  the siren in your SimpliSafe security system.
Our alarm monitoring plans give you the option to receive:  


A call to alert you and emergency responders sent to
			  your home to ensure you and your family are safe.

SMS & Email notifications automatically sent to your
			  phone and to the phones of loved ones.

Listen to Dave's Words:
                        





                    “Protecting your family is important, but don’t ever sign a
                    long-term contract. Do it the right way with SimpliSafe. They
                    are the good guys.” -Dave Ramsey,  Financial Expert











                    “All the bells and whistles for a lot less.”
                    









                    “David vs Goliath, SimpliSafe vs ADT: SimpliSafe aims to
                    upstage their larger rivals by giving consumers what they
                    really want. Even without fancy marketing, word is spreading.”
                    









                    “Some things can keep you tethered to landline service, such
                    as your home’s security system. Not so with SimpliSafe.”

9 Things to Avoid When Choosing A Traditional Alarm Company
We listened to all the things you dislike about traditional burglar alarm companies... then fixed them.




Traditional Alarm Company
SimpliSafe: a Better Way






                        Old wired technology. Traditional alarm companies 
                        want to put wires in your walls, because they know 
                        that ripping their wires out is hard and expensive.
                        



                        State-of-the-art 100% wireless technology. We 
                        took micro-chip technology and

                        and reliable security system. With wireless, there 
                        are no holes in your walls.
                        






                        Monitoring is $42.99 a month.
                        



                        Ours is just $14.99 a month. SimpliSafe protects your home 
                        with COPS Monitoring - named BEST MONITORING in the 
                        Industry by the Central Station Alarm Association.
                        





                        The moment you let them put a system into your home, you’re 
                        typically locked into a $1,547 contract with no way out.
                        



                        No annual contracts! Our customers stay with us because of 
                        our excellent product quality and helpful customer support.
                        





                        Auto-renewal clauses grab another $1,547 from you if you don’t 
                        cancel them within 90 days of the end of your three-year term. 
                        Forget to cancel? You’re legally trapped—there’s no way out.
                        




                        No hidden charges, no 
                        commitments, no sneaky tricks.
                        





                        Many frustrated customers (just google “alarm system 
                        complaints” or “alarm contract complaints” and see 
                        for yourself).

                        Uses a phone line to connect to the monitoring center. 
                        Burglars sometimes cut phone lines.
                        



                        Uses its built-in and independent cellular connection, which is 
                        5-10 seconds faster, and is uncuttable. No phone line required.
                        





                        Prices are kept high because there are so many 
                        middlemen and salespeople involved.
                        



                        We don’t have expensive salespeople or middlemen. That’s 
                        how we can afford to keep our prices so low.
                        





                        Installation typically costs between $99 and $500. You’ll 
                        need to take a day off of work, while the installer drills 
                        holes in your walls.
                        



                        Set-up is easier than you could ever imagine. No tools 
                        needed, just adhesive pads. The unit actually talks to you 
                        while you’re setting it up. One of our customers purchased a 
                        second system for his daughter’s home and was “looking 
                        forward to the joy of installing it for her.” Watch our

                        easy installation video to see what he means.
                        

                        Does easy set-up mean the system is flimsy or less secure?  
                        No! Quite the opposite. No wires means there’s nothing for 
                        burglars to cut.

SimpliSafe is recommended by ABC, Fox News, NBC & more!





















“No installation, no annual contracts, very smart.”






“Everything is included, and it’s portable so if you change apartments, you can just bring it with you.”






“David vs Goliath, SimpliSafe vs ADT: 
                SimpliSafe aims to upstage their larger 
                rivals by giving consumers what they really
                 want. Even without fancy marketing, word 
                 is spreading.”  see review








SimpliSafe is not for you if...


1
You have a HUGE home: If your home is larger than 20,000 
            square feet (about the size of a football field)—or if it has more 
            than 50 windows on the first floor—you would probably benefit 
            from a system that can handle a huge number of sensors. Our 
            advice would be to go to a traditional contract security company
            —and keep in mind the things we’ve warned you about.


2
You run a large commercial property such as a 
            shopping mall—you would probably benefit from a 
            system that has CCTV or security guards, in which 
            case you should probably go to one of the traditional 
            contract security companies—and keep in mind the 
            things we’ve warned you about.



However, if you’re one of the 95% of people who don’t run a large commercial property, then SimpliSafe is probably the best
            choice for you. If you’re in any doubt, contact one of our security consultants at 1-888-957-4675 for free friendly advice.

I spoke to some neighbors who have also recently got alarms with other companies, they were very upset because their system died pretty quickly and were not able to recharge it.”

About LOWE'S COMPANIES, INC.

Lowe's Companies has evolved from a regional hardware store into a nationwide chain of home improvement superstores bent on international expansion. The #2 US home improvement chain (after The Home Depot), Lowe's operates 1,820 stores in the US, along with some 300 in Canada, and 10 in Mexico, as well as an e-commerce site. Its stores sell roughly 37,000 products for DIY-ers and professionals for home improvement and repair projects, such as lumber, paint, plumbing and electrical supplies, tools, and gardening products, as well as appliances, outdoor power equipment, home fashions and furniture. Lowe's is also the second-largest US home appliance retailer after Sears.
  
Operations
No single product line dominates Lowe's' sales profile. Its biggest earners, at around 15% of sales, are lumber and building materials. Tools and hardware, appliances, fashion fixtures, rough plumbing and electrical, and lawn and garden sales each account for around 10% of revenues (or 50% of total sales combined). The rest of its revenues come from seasonal living; paint; flooring; millwork, kitchens, and outdoor power equipment sales, with each category making up around 5% of revenues. Home fashions, storage and cleaning makes up the remainder.
  

   The retailer sources its products from 7,500-plus vendors worldwide, and owns and operates 15 highly-automated regional distribution centers in the US. In addition to its namesake chain, Lowe's holds a majority stake in Orchard Supply Hardware (OSH), which operates 85 neighborhood hardware and backyard stores (primarily in California).
  
Geographic Reach

   The company serves more than 17 million customers a week from its 2,130 stores in the US, Canada, and Mexico. The US accounts for the vast majority of sales, at 95%.
  
Sales and Marketing

   Lowe's mainly serves two audiences: Pro customers, which made up 30% of sales in fiscal 2016 (January year end) and include homeowners, renters, and professional customers in construction trades and maintenance, repair & operations; and retailer customers, which count individual homeowners and renters.
  

   The retailer offers flooring, millwork, and appliance installation through independent contractors. Installed sales accounted for approximately 8% of sales in fiscal 2016. Online sales, through websites including ATGstores.com, lowes.com and lowes.ca, accounted for another 3% of total sales. The company also markets and sells its products through three contact centers (in Wilkesboro, North Carolina; Albuquerque; and Indinapolis) via direct phone sales and customer support.
  

   Lowe's has been ramping up its advertising spend in recent years. It spent $769 million in fiscal 2016, up from $819 million and $811 million in FY2015 and FY2014, respectively.
  
Financial Performance

   The company's net revenues have risen over the past five years. In fiscal 2017, net revenue increased by 10% to $65.0 billion due to an increase in comparable store sales, the contribution from the acquired RONA business, and an extra trading week. Comparable sales were up due to higher sales per customer. All product categories grew, particularly lumber & building materials, appliances, tools & hardware, and lawn & garden, primarily down to higher demand from pro customers. By geography, Lowe's witnessed growth in all regions, with the South and Northwest the brightest points.
Net income grew 21% to $3.1 billion, helping push up cash provided by operating activities 17% to $5.6 billion. 
Strategy
Lowe's is going pro. The company has tapped into a rich seam of growth in the professional customer segment and is evolving its products to meet the needs of its pro customers. It has also improved to functionality of LowesForPros.com by deepening list-making, custom catalog, and purchase history capabilities. The company's main website, Lowes.com, has also been upgraded with better search algorithms, content recommendations, and click-to-chat. Lowe's has also leveraged social media such as Pinterest and Facebook to help bring its products to life, and has channels on Apple TV, Fire TV (Amazon), and Roku, as well as YouTube and its own websites.
Lowe's drastically increased its presence in Canada in 2016 by purchasing Canadian home-improvement chain Rona. The acquisition adds some 500 stores (240 company owned, 260 dealer owned) to the 40-odd stores Lowe's already had in the country. Lowe's will partially convert the Rona store base to the Lowe's banner, but the Rona brand will remain and, if all goes well, grow in its own right.
Mergers and Acquisitions
Lowe's Companies deepened its exposure to the professional home services market with the 2017 acquisition of Maintenance Supply Headquarters, a distributor of maintenance, repair, and operations (MRO) products for the multifamily housing industry. The acquisition was valued at more than $500 million. Maintenance Supply Headquarters, based in Houston, operates about a dozen distribution centers for customers in the western, southeastern, and south central US. The deal follows the 2016 acquisition of  Central Wholesalers, a prominent MRO distributor in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. The acquisitions are to generate more than $400 million in incremental annual sales.

   In 2016 the company bought Quebec-based RONA, retailer and distributor of hardware, building materials, and home renovation products for C$3.2 billion (US$2.4 billion). This acquisition represents a key step in accelerating Lowe's growth strategy which creates largest home improvement retailers in Canada as well as expanding the company's operations in that country.

Outsmart Burglars  the Moment You Plug It In





“I built SimpliSafe to make home security simpler and smarter. It uses advanced wireless technology, there’s no annual contracts, and it saves you hundreds. I’m proud of that.”
Chad Laurans, CEO & Chief Engineer

After his friends were robbed, Chad Laurans discovered a serious problem in the home security industry. You want your home to be safe, but alarm companies charge huge fees of $45 a month and lock you in long-term contracts. The demands are just too high.
So Chad Built Something New.
Relying on his electrical engineering degree from Yale and an MBA from Harvard, he designed an advanced home security system. He called it SimpliSafe.
Now it’s the fastest growing home security company in the nation. SimpliSafe won’t lock you in a long-term contract and 24/7 professional monitoring is only $14.99 a month.
Protect your home—the smart way. 










Award-Winning Home Security
Winner of CNET Editor’s Choice Award, Angie’s List Super Service Award, and A+ Rated by the Better Business Bureau.








Dave Ramsey, Personal Finance Expert:
“Protecting your family is important, but don’t ever sign a long-term contract. Do it the right way with SimpliSafe. These are the good guys!”





Joe Balog, Police Chief:
"My force used SimpliSafe to stop a serial burglary ring. It still helps us catch other criminals in the act today."





Unlike SimpliSafe, most burglar alarms are far too expensive, here’s why...



With so many people making a profit, they need to use sneaky tactics to extract money from you

They bait you with a “$99” offer though there’s typically $1,500 of hidden fees beneath the hood.
They lock you into 2-3 year contracts that contain fine print such as auto-renewal clauses. (Click to find out why the Government is considering making them illegal).
Their alarms use old wired technology and they’re hard to use (so you need to pay a service engineer for even the most straightforward task).




At SimpliSafe, There Are No Middlemen.
SimpliSafe has sliced out shady annual contracts, intrusive installations, and costly middlemen. We designed our system from scratch to give you everything you need in a security system plus some exciting bells and whistles. We sell direct to you, online. Our system is easy to self-install, and we pass the savings onto you with excellent equipment pricing and monthly monitoring for just $14.99/month.

 describes SimpliSafe alarms as

Many alarm companies have absolutely huge sneaky hidden fees. They advertise their alarms as being “from $99”, then they get you to sign a contract for over $1,000—and you can’t leave them for at least 3 years. But SimpliSafe alarms have no hidden charges.
We’re so confident you’ll love your SimpliSafe alarm that we’ll let you try it RISK-FREE with an incredible no-risk 60-day money back guarantee. SimpliSafe alarms are reliable, easy to use, have no annual contracts and
                no hidden costs.

9 Things to Avoid When Choosing A Traditional Alarm Company
We listened to all the things you dislike about traditional burglar alarm companies... then fixed them.




Traditional Alarm Company
SimpliSafe: a Better Way






                        Old wired technology. Traditional alarm companies 
                        want to put wires in your walls, because they know 
                        that ripping their wires out is hard and expensive.
                        



                        State-of-the-art 100% wireless technology. We 
                        took micro-chip technology and 
                        developed smarter software to offer you a robust 
                        and reliable security system. With wireless, there 
                        are no holes in your walls.
                        






                        Monitoring is $42.99 a month.
                        



                        Ours is just $14.99 a month. SimpliSafe protects your home 
                        with COPS Monitoring - named BEST MONITORING in the 
                        Industry by the Central Station Alarm Association.
                        





                        The moment you let them put a system into your home, you’re 
                        typically locked into a $1,547 contract with no way out.
                        



                        No annual contracts! Our customers stay with us because of 
                        our excellent product quality and helpful customer support.
                        





                        Auto-renewal clauses grab another $1,547 from you if you don’t 
                        cancel them within 90 days of the end of your three-year term. 
                        Forget to cancel? You’re legally trapped—there’s no way out.
                        




                        No hidden charges, no 
                        commitments, no sneaky tricks.
                        





                        Many frustrated customers (just google “alarm system 
                        complaints” or “alarm contract complaints” and see 
                        for yourself).
                    



                        Growing by word of mouth. See our Facebook fan page.
                        





                        Uses a phone line to connect to the monitoring center. 
                        Burglars sometimes cut phone lines.
                        



                        Uses its built-in and independent cellular connection, which is 
                        5-10 seconds faster, and is uncuttable. No phone line required.
                        





                        Prices are kept high because there are so many 
                        middlemen and salespeople involved.
                        



                        We don’t have expensive salespeople or middlemen. That’s 
                        how we can afford to keep our prices so low.
                        





                        Installation typically costs between $99 and $500. You’ll 
                        need to take a day off of work, while the installer drills 
                        holes in your walls.
                        



                        Set-up is easier than you could ever imagine. No tools 
                        needed, just adhesive pads. The unit actually talks to you 
                        while you’re setting it up. One of our customers purchased a 
                        second system for his daughter’s home and was “looking 
                        forward to the joy of installing it for her.” Watch our

                        easy installation video to see what he means.
                        

                        Does easy set-up mean the system is flimsy or less secure?  
                        No! Quite the opposite. No wires means there’s nothing for 
                        burglars to cut.

Nearly One Million Americans TrustSimpliSafe to Protect Them. Here’s Why:



Dennis R.
Amarillo, TX



This morning at 6:45 AM, my phone rang. It was the SimpliSafe operator, telling me that my alarm was going off. I had them call the police and they were there within minutes. The glass in the back door had been broken but the system worked perfectly and the intruders ran away. We only had to replace a small pane of glass.







Greg W.
Clarksville, TN



Our home was burglarized two weeks ago. I purchased a system that night and installed it within the week. Today, the thieves returned and the alarm scared them off. The officers were at my home within minutes. Nothing was taken.  SimpliSafe works.







Lauren B.
Tacoma, WA



We installed our system and within one week, the water sensor placed at our water heater set off the alarm. Sure enough, the T/P valve had opened on our water heater. The monitoring service alerted us in under 60 seconds. No water damage whatsoever! Way to go Simplisafe! Our system paid for itself that day.







Stephanie T.
Toledo, OH



I love my system. It saved us from thousands of dollars in damage when the power went out in our house in Northern Ohio on the coldest day in February (-17°!). The monitoring center alerted us in Florida that the power was out and the temperature in the house was dropping fast. We were able to contact an electrician to repair the problem. Without the system we never would have known and would have had major freeze damage.






SimpliSafe is recommended by ABC, Fox News, NBC & more!





















“No installation, no annual contracts, very smart.”






“Everything is included, and it’s portable so if you change apartments, you can just bring it with you.”






“David vs Goliath, SimpliSafe vs ADT: 
                SimpliSafe aims to upstage their larger 
                rivals by giving consumers what they really
                 want. Even without fancy marketing, word 
                 is spreading.”  see review








SimpliSafe is not for you if...


1
You have a HUGE home: If your home is larger than 20,000 
            square feet (about the size of a football field)—or if it has more 
            than 50 windows on the first floor—you would probably benefit 
            from a system that can handle a huge number of sensors. Our 
            advice would be to go to a traditional contract security company
            —and keep in mind the things we’ve warned you about.


2
You run a large commercial property such as a 
            shopping mall—you would probably benefit from a 
            system that has CCTV or security guards, in which 
            case you should probably go to one of the traditional 
            contract security companies—and keep in mind the 
            things we’ve warned you about.



However, if you’re one of the 95% of people who don’t run a large commercial property, then SimpliSafe is probably the best
            choice for you. If you’re in any doubt, contact one of our security consultants at 1-888-957-4675 for free friendly advice.

Please note: While SimpliSafe has no annual contracts, all our monitored customers sign a Terms of Service.






Love it... Or return it for a full refund


			Test any one of our alarm system packages 
			below. If you aren't 100% delighted, call us 
			within 60 days for a FULL REFUND and let 
			us pay for return shipping.
		








100% Satisfaction Guaranteed

We at Simplisafe are committed to providing you with 
		   only the best products and services. Our goal is to 
			make your life safer and easier. If you are in any way 
			unsatisfied with your SimpliSafe product or service, 
			please contact us and we’ll do our best to make it right.








3 Year Product Warranty

Even after 60 days has passed, you still benefit from our 
		   three-year product warranty. If anything goes wrong with 
		   your system, just call us (1-888-957-4675) and we’ll do 
		   whatever it takes to sort things out usually, we’ll just send you  
		   a replacement part, completely free of charge. We can afford 
		   to offer this because our components are so reliable.







What is an “auto-renewal clause” anyway?
Most alarm companies have an automatic renewal clause in their monitoring and service contract (and use teeny tiny font). This means that your contract will be renewed for anywhere from 12 months to three years, unless you cancel by mail within 30 days before the end of your contract. Many of the nationwide and local alarm companies use this tactic. Cancelling early usually involves a penalty of 75% to 100% of the value of the contract. 

SimpliSafe offers monthly alarm monitoring. There are no contracts to sign, so there’s no fear of getting tricked by fine print and hidden fees. You can cancel your SimpliSafe alarm monitoring anytime by simply giving us a call.

"No installation, no contracts, very smart."








We have thousands of Facebook Fans. Click here to see how they're raving about us.








"SimpliSafe security system is inexpensive, transportable..."








"All the bells and whistles for a lot less money"








SimpliSafe is our idea of not getting robbed.








"Some things can keep you tethered to landline service, such as your home's security system. Not so with SimpliSafe Inc."








SimpliSafe was featured in Elle Decor's top punchlist.








"This ingenious security system uses wireless technology..."








I really like the SimpliSafe security system for its easy setup, expandability, custom setup options and ability to move with you if you relocate. I think the price for the system is really affordable when you compare it to other security systems on the market. It gets a thumbs up from me.








SimpliSafe offers wireless, plug-and-play security for urban dwellers—increasingly being used in the era of disappearing land lines.








Wireless Wonders: SimpliSafe is an affordable, but full-featured, wireless security system similar to the expensive, professionally installed ones.








"David vs Goliath, SimpliSafe  vs ADT: SimpliSafe aims to upstage their larger rivals by giving consumers what they really want. Even without fancy marketing, word is spreading."








Security Doesn't Get Any Easier. Setup took less than 15 minutes from start to finish and drastically improved my peace of mind.









Rating: Strong Recommend (the highest rating). "This is a system anyone could setup in under 30 minutes." See full review  
If you've got a car alarm, using the SimpliSafe home security system will come as naturally and easily. 
							All sensor units come prepared with removable adhesive backs (the 3M variety that adheres well, but removes easily).

History[edit]





This section needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (January 2011) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


The first Lowe's store, Lowe's North Wilkesboro Hardware, was first opened in North Wilkesboro, North Carolina in 1921 by Lucius Smith Lowe (1879 - 1940).[7][8][9] After Lowe died in 1940, the business was inherited by his daughter Ruth, who sold the company to her brother Jim that same year. Jim took on Carl Buchan as a partner in 1943.[10]
Buchan anticipated the dramatic increase in construction after World War II, and under his management, the store focused on hardware and building materials.[11] Before then, the product mix had also included notions, dry goods, horse tack, snuff, produce, and groceries. The company bought a second location in Sparta, North Carolina in 1949.
Lowe and Buchan differed on expanding the company to new areas and they split in 1952 with Buchan (himself) taking control of the hardware and building supply business and Lowe taking other joint ventures the two controlled (including a car dealership). Buchan became the sole owner of Lowe's. In 1954, Lowe started the Lowes Foods grocery store chain.
By 1955, Buchan quickly expanded the company by opening stores in the North Carolina cities of Asheville, Charlotte, and Durham. More stores opened through the 1950s.
In 1961, Buchan died of a heart attack at age 44.[12] His five-man executive team, which included Robert Strickland and Leonard Herring, took the company public in 1961.[13] By 1962, Lowe's operated 21 stores and reported annual revenues of $32 million.[14] Lowe's began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in 1979.[10]
Lowe's suffered in the 1980s due to market conditions and increasing competition from the new big-box store chain, The Home Depot. For a while, Lowe's resisted adopting the mega-store format partly because its management believed the smaller towns where Lowe's mostly operated would not even support huge stores. However, Lowe's eventually had to adopt the big-box format in order to survive. Today, most Lowe's stores are part of the big-box variety, although some classic format stores remain in smaller markets.
Lowe's has since grown nationally, as it was aided by the purchase of the Renton, Washington-based Eagle Hardware & Garden company in 1999.[15] It is now the largest home improvement store chain in North America and has begun expanding outside the United States, starting with the Southern Ontario area. The first store outside of United States was in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.
According to their website, Lowe's has operated/serviced more than 2,355 locations in the United States, Canada, and Mexico alone.[16]
Corporate affairs[edit]

Headquarters[edit]

United States

The Lowe's corporate headquarters is located in Mooresville, North Carolina. The Mooresville facility, the newest Lowe's corporate campus, is 25 miles (40 km) north of Charlotte and contains a five-story, 400,000-square-foot (37,000 m2) building along with two newer seven story buildings. The building has a central atrium and two office wings; the atrium houses a food court, a five-story spiral staircase, and meeting and reception rooms. A 7-acre (2.8 ha) lake flows underneath the headquarters building.
Lowe's former corporate office is based in Wilkesboro, North Carolina. Lowe's still operates a few corporate functions from Wilkesboro. The building was formerly the Wilkes Mall until 1997 when Lowe's bought the entire property. Since then, the entire 440,000 square-foot campus has been remodeled numerous times, and features a fully gated campus, security gates and guards, cameras, and a food court.[citation needed]. It is also a smoke-free campus.

Canada

The headquarters of subsidiary Lowe’s Companies Canada, ULC is located in Boucherville, Quebec, due to the merger with Rona. Prior to 2016, Lowe's Canada was headquartered in Toronto, Ontario.[17]
Environmental record[edit]
Lowe's won eight consecutive Energy Star awards from 2003 to 2010, including four Energy Star Partner of the Year awards for educating consumers about the benefits of energy efficiency. On March 1, 2010, Lowe's also became the first winner of the Energy Star Sustained Excellence Award in Retail, to recognize its contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by promoting energy-efficient products and educating consumers and employees on the value of the Energy Star program.[18] In 2000, Lowe's released a policy promising that all wood products sold would not be sourced from rainforests.[19] However, according to a 2006 report released by the Environmental Investigation Agency, wood used in flooring that Lowe’s was selling had been coming from the forests of Indonesia’s remote Papua Province, where some logging was estimated to be illegal.[20]
Advertising and sponsorships[edit]
In 2006, Lowe's partnered with designer Marianne Cusato to develop and offer affordable house plans for the hurricane-affected Gulf region. Lowe's is the exclusive retailer for both the plans and building materials for the Lowe's Katrina Cottage. They offer easy construction and affordability, as well as the possibility of expansion. Moreover, they meet all international building codes and exceed hurricane codes.
Lowe's has a wide variety of television and radio commercials. A significant number of different racing-inspired commercials can be seen and are often played outside of television race coverage. Before 2010, when he was replaced by Ben Yannette, Gene Hackman's voice could be heard on many commercial advertisements for Lowe's.[21]
In 2006, Lowe's began sponsoring the radio broadcast booth of the New York Yankees. Frequently during every game Yankees announcer John Sterling stated "We are coming to you live from the Lowe's Broadcast Booth. Lowe's: Let's build something together.".[citation needed] The tag line was changed in September 2011 to 'Never Stop Improving'.
Racing sponsorships[edit]




The Lowe's-sponsored team of Jimmie Johnson's pit box


Lowe's purchased naming rights of Charlotte Motor Speedway in Concord, North Carolina, in 1998, and the speedway changed names to Lowe's Motor Speedway. After the ten year naming rights expired, Lowe's extended naming rights by one year. After the one-year extension expired, Lowe's discontinued naming rights, and as of the 2010 racing season the racetrack returned to its original name. Lowe's is an associate sponsor of several Speedway Motorsports, Inc. properties such as Atlanta Motor Speedway and Bristol Motor Speedway.
The corporation is the primary sponsor for 7-time NASCAR Sprint Cup Series champion Jimmie Johnson in the No. 48 Chevrolet SS and it was a part-time sponsor of the former No. 5 Nationwide Series car; both teams are owned by Hendrick Motorsports. Prior to the current sponsorship deal with Hendrick Motorsports, Lowe's was the sponsor of the No. 31 Chevrolet for Richard Childress Racing driven by Mike Skinner and Robby Gordon from 1997 to 2001. Prior to the RCR deal, Lowe's was the primary sponsor of the No. 11 Ford driven by Brett Bodine for Junior Johnson & Associates and later his own team, Brett Bodine Racing (after Bodine bought the No. 11 from Johnson). One of the company's earliest forays into racing sponsorship was in 1979, when it sponsored the No. 2 Buick of the Rod Osterlund team in what was then known the Winston Cup Series, for the Talladega 500. The car was driven in that race by David Pearson, subbing for injured rookie Dale Earnhardt. Lowe's would continue with sporadic car sponsorship throughout the next two decades until the aforementioned Bodine sponsorship in 1995.
Lowe's also sponsors Fernandez Racing in the American Le Mans Series and previously sponsored the team in the Rolex Sports Car Series; in that series, Lowe's sponsors the No. 99 Gainsco Stallings Racing Pontiac in events where Johnson is driving.
All-American Muslim advertising[edit]
Lowe's withdrew its advertising from the TLC reality television show All-American Muslim in December 2011.[22] One organization that criticized the show was the Florida Family Association, a fundamentalist organization "on the Christian right" that says it's 'defending American values'".[23][24][25] The organization claimed the show was "propaganda that riskily hides the Islamic agenda's clear and present danger to American liberties and traditional values."[26] A spokesperson for Lowe's said that "we understand the program raised concerns, complaints, or issues from multiple sides of the viewer spectrum, which we found after doing research of news articles and blogs covering the show".[22]
Lowe's faced a backlash from several quarters, including Muslim-American and Arab-American organizations. The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee called upon members to contact Lowe's to urge it to reverse its position.[27] The Los Angeles chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations met to consider possible actions, including boycotts and protests.[28] Several celebrities also called for a boycott.[28] California State Senator Ted Lieu called Lowe's decision "naked religious bigotry" and said he would consider legislative action if Lowe's did not apologize to Muslim-Americans and reinstate the ads.[26] Abraham Foxman of the Anti-Defamation League expressed similar views.[29] Keith Ellison, the first Muslim elected to the United States Congress, criticized Lowe's decision to "uphold the beliefs of a fringe hate group and not the creed of the First Amendment".[28] Representative John Conyers of Michigan called on Lowe's to apologize. Michigan state representative Rashida Tlaib contacted the company's corporate headquarters, reporting that Lowe's declined to change its decision.[27]
Canada[edit]
Based in Toronto, Ontario, Lowe's opened its first three stores in Canada on December 10, 2007, in Hamilton, Brampton and Brantford. On February 1, 2008, they opened three more stores in Toronto, East Gwillimbury, and a second store in Brampton as well as a new location in Maple (Vaughan).[30] Currently, additional stores are under construction, with 19 now open in the province of Ontario. Lowe's also recently announced expansion into Western Canada, starting with three new stores in Calgary, Alberta. One of the three locations opened in late September 2010. The other two opened in early 2011. There are now stores in British Columbia and Saskatchewan. To date (2013) Lowe's has 33 locations in Canada. Each store represents an average investment of $20.5 million ($20.4 million USD).[31]
In February 2013, former Walmart Canada and Loblaw Companies executive Sylvain Prud'homme was hired as CEO of Lowe's Canada.[32]
On May 11, 2015, Lowe's Canada announced that it would acquire the leases of 13 former Target Canada stores, as well as an Ontario distribution centre, for $151 million.[33]
In 2012, Lowe's attempted to buy Rona, Inc., a Quebec-based hardware chain; however, the deal was met with objections from Rona shareholders (particularly the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec) and operators of its franchised locations over concerns that the company could centralize its supply operations in the United States, and was eventually called off.[32] On February 3, 2016, Rona announced that it had accepted an offer to be acquired by Lowe's for CDN$3.2 billion, pending regulatory and shareholder approval. The division will remain under the leadership of Sylvain Prud'homme, but will be operated out of Rona's headquarters in Boucherville. Lowe's plans to maintain Rona's retail banners, "key" executives, and the "vast majority of its current employees" post-acquisition.[34]
Australia[edit]
Trading as Masters Home Improvement, the first store opened in Braybrook, Victoria to tradesmen on August 31, 2011 and the general public on September 1, 2011. Masters is a joint venture of the Lowe's Companies, Inc. and Woolworths Limited to compete against the Wesfarmers'-owned Bunnings Warehouse, which operates in the large bigbox format similar to Lowe's and Home Depot.
The stores will be 1/3 owned by Lowe's Companies Inc. (USA) and 2/3 owned by Woolworths Limited (Australian Owned Public Company Listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX)).
On 18 January 2016 Woolworths announced that it intended to "either sell or wind up" all its home improvement area, including the Masters hardware chain. Chairman Gordon Cairns said that it would take years to become profitable and that the ongoing losses could not be sustained. The windup will involve Woolworths buying back a 33.3 per cent interest in the venture, held by the Lowe's subsidiary WDR Delaware Corporation. As of 28 August 2016 all stores are due to cease trading on, or before, 11 December 2016.
Lawsuits[edit]
Lowe's was involved in a small cluster of class action lawsuits that revolved around Lowe's employee payment system. The cases focused on a pay practice known as "variable rate overtime". Variable rate overtime has the effect of paying a decreasing overtime rate the more hours a person works in a week. The suits alleged that salaried managers who worked 40 to 50 hours per week were improperly compensated for that time. The variable rate overtime ended in the first quarter of 2006.
The first case was filed in October 2002 by employees of the Lowe's store in Shawnee, Kansas. In September 2005, the cases were certified as class action. Lowe's has four similar cases in New York, Indiana, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. The lawsuits for New York, Indiana, and Kansas resulted in an out-of-court settlement on September 22, 2006.[35]
The lawsuit in Pennsylvania became a class-action lawsuit in June 2004, with 550 employees.[36][37] The case in Ohio was filed by ten former Lowe’s employees, in August 2004.[38]
Lowe's faced multiple lawsuits from its Loss Prevention Managers citing that they were classified as exempt employees and therefore denied overtime pay. The managers asserted that they were forced to work a minimum of 48 hours per week which saved Lowe's and its investors millions of dollars every year. Lawsuits have been settled for $2.95 million in California and $6.2 million in Texas.[39]
In 2014, Lowe's faced a class action lawsuit from former and current Human Resource Managers. Similarly to the lawsuit regarding its Loss Prevention Managers, the lawsuit stated that the HR Managers were improperly and illegally classified as exempt employees and were therefore denied overtime even though they were required to work 48-hour weeks.[40]

History[edit]





This section needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (January 2011) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


The first Lowe's store, Lowe's North Wilkesboro Hardware, was first opened in North Wilkesboro, North Carolina in 1921 by Lucius Smith Lowe (1879 - 1940).[7][8][9] After Lowe died in 1940, the business was inherited by his daughter Ruth, who sold the company to her brother Jim that same year. Jim took on Carl Buchan as a partner in 1943.[10]
Buchan anticipated the dramatic increase in construction after World War II, and under his management, the store focused on hardware and building materials.[11] Before then, the product mix had also included notions, dry goods, horse tack, snuff, produce, and groceries. The company bought a second location in Sparta, North Carolina in 1949.
Lowe and Buchan differed on expanding the company to new areas and they split in 1952 with Buchan (himself) taking control of the hardware and building supply business and Lowe taking other joint ventures the two controlled (including a car dealership). Buchan became the sole owner of Lowe's. In 1954, Lowe started the Lowes Foods grocery store chain.
By 1955, Buchan quickly expanded the company by opening stores in the North Carolina cities of Asheville, Charlotte, and Durham. More stores opened through the 1950s.
In 1961, Buchan died of a heart attack at age 44.[12] His five-man executive team, which included Robert Strickland and Leonard Herring, took the company public in 1961.[13] By 1962, Lowe's operated 21 stores and reported annual revenues of $32 million.[14] Lowe's began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in 1979.[10]
Lowe's suffered in the 1980s due to market conditions and increasing competition from the new big-box store chain, The Home Depot. For a while, Lowe's resisted adopting the mega-store format partly because its management believed the smaller towns where Lowe's mostly operated would not even support huge stores. However, Lowe's eventually had to adopt the big-box format in order to survive. Today, most Lowe's stores are part of the big-box variety, although some classic format stores remain in smaller markets.
Lowe's has since grown nationally, as it was aided by the purchase of the Renton, Washington-based Eagle Hardware & Garden company in 1999.[15] It is now the largest home improvement store chain in North America and has begun expanding outside the United States, starting with the Southern Ontario area. The first store outside of United States was in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.
According to their website, Lowe's has operated/serviced more than 2,355 locations in the United States, Canada, and Mexico alone.[16]
Corporate affairs[edit]

Headquarters[edit]

United States

The Lowe's corporate headquarters is located in Mooresville, North Carolina. The Mooresville facility, the newest Lowe's corporate campus, is 25 miles (40 km) north of Charlotte and contains a five-story, 400,000-square-foot (37,000 m2) building along with two newer seven story buildings. The building has a central atrium and two office wings; the atrium houses a food court, a five-story spiral staircase, and meeting and reception rooms. A 7-acre (2.8 ha) lake flows underneath the headquarters building.
Lowe's former corporate office is based in Wilkesboro, North Carolina. Lowe's still operates a few corporate functions from Wilkesboro. The building was formerly the Wilkes Mall until 1997 when Lowe's bought the entire property. Since then, the entire 440,000 square-foot campus has been remodeled numerous times, and features a fully gated campus, security gates and guards, cameras, and a food court.[citation needed]. It is also a smoke-free campus.

Canada

The headquarters of subsidiary Lowe’s Companies Canada, ULC is located in Boucherville, Quebec, due to the merger with Rona. Prior to 2016, Lowe's Canada was headquartered in Toronto, Ontario.[17]
Environmental record[edit]
Lowe's won eight consecutive Energy Star awards from 2003 to 2010, including four Energy Star Partner of the Year awards for educating consumers about the benefits of energy efficiency. On March 1, 2010, Lowe's also became the first winner of the Energy Star Sustained Excellence Award in Retail, to recognize its contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by promoting energy-efficient products and educating consumers and employees on the value of the Energy Star program.[18] In 2000, Lowe's released a policy promising that all wood products sold would not be sourced from rainforests.[19] However, according to a 2006 report released by the Environmental Investigation Agency, wood used in flooring that Lowe’s was selling had been coming from the forests of Indonesia’s remote Papua Province, where some logging was estimated to be illegal.[20]
Advertising and sponsorships[edit]
In 2006, Lowe's partnered with designer Marianne Cusato to develop and offer affordable house plans for the hurricane-affected Gulf region. Lowe's is the exclusive retailer for both the plans and building materials for the Lowe's Katrina Cottage. They offer easy construction and affordability, as well as the possibility of expansion. Moreover, they meet all international building codes and exceed hurricane codes.
Lowe's has a wide variety of television and radio commercials. A significant number of different racing-inspired commercials can be seen and are often played outside of television race coverage. Before 2010, when he was replaced by Ben Yannette, Gene Hackman's voice could be heard on many commercial advertisements for Lowe's.[21]
In 2006, Lowe's began sponsoring the radio broadcast booth of the New York Yankees. Frequently during every game Yankees announcer John Sterling stated "We are coming to you live from the Lowe's Broadcast Booth. Lowe's: Let's build something together.".[citation needed] The tag line was changed in September 2011 to 'Never Stop Improving'.
Racing sponsorships[edit]




The Lowe's-sponsored team of Jimmie Johnson's pit box


Lowe's purchased naming rights of Charlotte Motor Speedway in Concord, North Carolina, in 1998, and the speedway changed names to Lowe's Motor Speedway. After the ten year naming rights expired, Lowe's extended naming rights by one year. After the one-year extension expired, Lowe's discontinued naming rights, and as of the 2010 racing season the racetrack returned to its original name. Lowe's is an associate sponsor of several Speedway Motorsports, Inc. properties such as Atlanta Motor Speedway and Bristol Motor Speedway.
The corporation is the primary sponsor for 7-time NASCAR Sprint Cup Series champion Jimmie Johnson in the No. 48 Chevrolet SS and it was a part-time sponsor of the former No. 5 Nationwide Series car; both teams are owned by Hendrick Motorsports. Prior to the current sponsorship deal with Hendrick Motorsports, Lowe's was the sponsor of the No. 31 Chevrolet for Richard Childress Racing driven by Mike Skinner and Robby Gordon from 1997 to 2001. Prior to the RCR deal, Lowe's was the primary sponsor of the No. 11 Ford driven by Brett Bodine for Junior Johnson & Associates and later his own team, Brett Bodine Racing (after Bodine bought the No. 11 from Johnson). One of the company's earliest forays into racing sponsorship was in 1979, when it sponsored the No. 2 Buick of the Rod Osterlund team in what was then known the Winston Cup Series, for the Talladega 500. The car was driven in that race by David Pearson, subbing for injured rookie Dale Earnhardt. Lowe's would continue with sporadic car sponsorship throughout the next two decades until the aforementioned Bodine sponsorship in 1995.
Lowe's also sponsors Fernandez Racing in the American Le Mans Series and previously sponsored the team in the Rolex Sports Car Series; in that series, Lowe's sponsors the No. 99 Gainsco Stallings Racing Pontiac in events where Johnson is driving.
All-American Muslim advertising[edit]
Lowe's withdrew its advertising from the TLC reality television show All-American Muslim in December 2011.[22] One organization that criticized the show was the Florida Family Association, a fundamentalist organization "on the Christian right" that says it's 'defending American values'".[23][24][25] The organization claimed the show was "propaganda that riskily hides the Islamic agenda's clear and present danger to American liberties and traditional values."[26] A spokesperson for Lowe's said that "we understand the program raised concerns, complaints, or issues from multiple sides of the viewer spectrum, which we found after doing research of news articles and blogs covering the show".[22]
Lowe's faced a backlash from several quarters, including Muslim-American and Arab-American organizations. The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee called upon members to contact Lowe's to urge it to reverse its position.[27] The Los Angeles chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations met to consider possible actions, including boycotts and protests.[28] Several celebrities also called for a boycott.[28] California State Senator Ted Lieu called Lowe's decision "naked religious bigotry" and said he would consider legislative action if Lowe's did not apologize to Muslim-Americans and reinstate the ads.[26] Abraham Foxman of the Anti-Defamation League expressed similar views.[29] Keith Ellison, the first Muslim elected to the United States Congress, criticized Lowe's decision to "uphold the beliefs of a fringe hate group and not the creed of the First Amendment".[28] Representative John Conyers of Michigan called on Lowe's to apologize. Michigan state representative Rashida Tlaib contacted the company's corporate headquarters, reporting that Lowe's declined to change its decision.[27]
Canada[edit]
Based in Toronto, Ontario, Lowe's opened its first three stores in Canada on December 10, 2007, in Hamilton, Brampton and Brantford. On February 1, 2008, they opened three more stores in Toronto, East Gwillimbury, and a second store in Brampton as well as a new location in Maple (Vaughan).[30] Currently, additional stores are under construction, with 19 now open in the province of Ontario. Lowe's also recently announced expansion into Western Canada, starting with three new stores in Calgary, Alberta. One of the three locations opened in late September 2010. The other two opened in early 2011. There are now stores in British Columbia and Saskatchewan. To date (2013) Lowe's has 33 locations in Canada. Each store represents an average investment of $20.5 million ($20.4 million USD).[31]
In February 2013, former Walmart Canada and Loblaw Companies executive Sylvain Prud'homme was hired as CEO of Lowe's Canada.[32]
On May 11, 2015, Lowe's Canada announced that it would acquire the leases of 13 former Target Canada stores, as well as an Ontario distribution centre, for $151 million.[33]
In 2012, Lowe's attempted to buy Rona, Inc., a Quebec-based hardware chain; however, the deal was met with objections from Rona shareholders (particularly the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec) and operators of its franchised locations over concerns that the company could centralize its supply operations in the United States, and was eventually called off.[32] On February 3, 2016, Rona announced that it had accepted an offer to be acquired by Lowe's for CDN$3.2 billion, pending regulatory and shareholder approval. The division will remain under the leadership of Sylvain Prud'homme, but will be operated out of Rona's headquarters in Boucherville. Lowe's plans to maintain Rona's retail banners, "key" executives, and the "vast majority of its current employees" post-acquisition.[34]
Australia[edit]
Trading as Masters Home Improvement, the first store opened in Braybrook, Victoria to tradesmen on August 31, 2011 and the general public on September 1, 2011. Masters is a joint venture of the Lowe's Companies, Inc. and Woolworths Limited to compete against the Wesfarmers'-owned Bunnings Warehouse, which operates in the large bigbox format similar to Lowe's and Home Depot.
The stores will be 1/3 owned by Lowe's Companies Inc. (USA) and 2/3 owned by Woolworths Limited (Australian Owned Public Company Listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX)).
On 18 January 2016 Woolworths announced that it intended to "either sell or wind up" all its home improvement area, including the Masters hardware chain. Chairman Gordon Cairns said that it would take years to become profitable and that the ongoing losses could not be sustained. The windup will involve Woolworths buying back a 33.3 per cent interest in the venture, held by the Lowe's subsidiary WDR Delaware Corporation. As of 28 August 2016 all stores are due to cease trading on, or before, 11 December 2016.
Lawsuits[edit]
Lowe's was involved in a small cluster of class action lawsuits that revolved around Lowe's employee payment system. The cases focused on a pay practice known as "variable rate overtime". Variable rate overtime has the effect of paying a decreasing overtime rate the more hours a person works in a week. The suits alleged that salaried managers who worked 40 to 50 hours per week were improperly compensated for that time. The variable rate overtime ended in the first quarter of 2006.
The first case was filed in October 2002 by employees of the Lowe's store in Shawnee, Kansas. In September 2005, the cases were certified as class action. Lowe's has four similar cases in New York, Indiana, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. The lawsuits for New York, Indiana, and Kansas resulted in an out-of-court settlement on September 22, 2006.[35]
The lawsuit in Pennsylvania became a class-action lawsuit in June 2004, with 550 employees.[36][37] The case in Ohio was filed by ten former Lowe’s employees, in August 2004.[38]
Lowe's faced multiple lawsuits from its Loss Prevention Managers citing that they were classified as exempt employees and therefore denied overtime pay. The managers asserted that they were forced to work a minimum of 48 hours per week which saved Lowe's and its investors millions of dollars every year. Lawsuits have been settled for $2.95 million in California and $6.2 million in Texas.[39]
In 2014, Lowe's faced a class action lawsuit from former and current Human Resource Managers. Similarly to the lawsuit regarding its Loss Prevention Managers, the lawsuit stated that the HR Managers were improperly and illegally classified as exempt employees and were therefore denied overtime even though they were required to work 48-hour weeks.[40]

History[edit]

The first Lowe's store, Lowe's North Wilkesboro Hardware, was first opened in North Wilkesboro, North Carolina in 1921 by Lucius Smith Lowe (1879 - 1940).[7][8][9] After Lowe died in 1940, the business was inherited by his daughter Ruth, who sold the company to her brother Jim that same year. Jim took on Carl Buchan as a partner in 1943.[10]
Buchan anticipated the dramatic increase in construction after World War II, and under his management, the store focused on hardware and building materials.[11] Before then, the product mix had also included notions, dry goods, horse tack, snuff, produce, and groceries. The company bought a second location in Sparta, North Carolina in 1949.
Lowe and Buchan differed on expanding the company to new areas and they split in 1952 with Buchan (himself) taking control of the hardware and building supply business and Lowe taking other joint ventures the two controlled (including a car dealership). Buchan became the sole owner of Lowe's. In 1954, Lowe started the Lowes Foods grocery store chain.
By 1955, Buchan quickly expanded the company by opening stores in the North Carolina cities of Asheville, Charlotte, and Durham. More stores opened through the 1950s.
In 1961, Buchan died of a heart attack at age 44.[12] His five-man executive team, which included Robert Strickland and Leonard Herring, took the company public in 1961.[13] By 1962, Lowe's operated 21 stores and reported annual revenues of $32 million.[14] Lowe's began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in 1979.[10]
Lowe's suffered in the 1980s due to market conditions and increasing competition from the new big-box store chain, The Home Depot. For a while, Lowe's resisted adopting the mega-store format partly because its management believed the smaller towns where Lowe's mostly operated would not even support huge stores. However, Lowe's eventually had to adopt the big-box format in order to survive. Today, most Lowe's stores are part of the big-box variety, although some classic format stores remain in smaller markets.
Lowe's has since grown nationally, as it was aided by the purchase of the Renton, Washington-based Eagle Hardware & Garden company in 1999.[15] It is now the largest home improvement store chain in North America and has begun expanding outside the United States, starting with the Southern Ontario area. The first store outside of United States was in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.
According to their website, Lowe's has operated/serviced more than 2,355 locations in the United States, Canada, and Mexico alone.[16]
Corporate affairs[edit]

Headquarters[edit]

United States

The Lowe's corporate headquarters is located in Mooresville, North Carolina. The Mooresville facility, the newest Lowe's corporate campus, is 25 miles (40 km) north of Charlotte and contains a five-story, 400,000-square-foot (37,000 m2) building along with two newer seven story buildings. The building has a central atrium and two office wings; the atrium houses a food court, a five-story spiral staircase, and meeting and reception rooms. A 7-acre (2.8 ha) lake flows underneath the headquarters building.
Lowe's former corporate office is based in Wilkesboro, North Carolina. Lowe's still operates a few corporate functions from Wilkesboro. The building was formerly the Wilkes Mall until 1997 when Lowe's bought the entire property. Since then, the entire 440,000 square-foot campus has been remodeled numerous times, and features a fully gated campus, security gates and guards, cameras, and a food court.[citation needed]. It is also a smoke-free campus.

Canada

The headquarters of subsidiary Lowe’s Companies Canada, ULC is located in Boucherville, Quebec, due to the merger with Rona. Prior to 2016, Lowe's Canada was headquartered in Toronto, Ontario.[17]
Environmental record[edit]
Lowe's won eight consecutive Energy Star awards from 2003 to 2010, including four Energy Star Partner of the Year awards for educating consumers about the benefits of energy efficiency. On March 1, 2010, Lowe's also became the first winner of the Energy Star Sustained Excellence Award in Retail, to recognize its contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by promoting energy-efficient products and educating consumers and employees on the value of the Energy Star program.[18] In 2000, Lowe's released a policy promising that all wood products sold would not be sourced from rainforests.[19] However, according to a 2006 report released by the Environmental Investigation Agency, wood used in flooring that Lowe’s was selling had been coming from the forests of Indonesia’s remote Papua Province, where some logging was estimated to be illegal.[20]
Advertising and sponsorships[edit]
In 2006, Lowe's partnered with designer Marianne Cusato to develop and offer affordable house plans for the hurricane-affected Gulf region. Lowe's is the exclusive retailer for both the plans and building materials for the Lowe's Katrina Cottage. They offer easy construction and affordability, as well as the possibility of expansion. Moreover, they meet all international building codes and exceed hurricane codes.
Lowe's has a wide variety of television and radio commercials. A significant number of different racing-inspired commercials can be seen and are often played outside of television race coverage. Before 2010, when he was replaced by Ben Yannette, Gene Hackman's voice could be heard on many commercial advertisements for Lowe's.[21]
In 2006, Lowe's began sponsoring the radio broadcast booth of the New York Yankees. Frequently during every game Yankees announcer John Sterling stated "We are coming to you live from the Lowe's Broadcast Booth. Lowe's: Let's build something together.".[citation needed] The tag line was changed in September 2011 to 'Never Stop Improving'.
Racing sponsorships[edit]




The Lowe's-sponsored team of Jimmie Johnson's pit box


Lowe's purchased naming rights of Charlotte Motor Speedway in Concord, North Carolina, in 1998, and the speedway changed names to Lowe's Motor Speedway. After the ten year naming rights expired, Lowe's extended naming rights by one year. After the one-year extension expired, Lowe's discontinued naming rights, and as of the 2010 racing season the racetrack returned to its original name. Lowe's is an associate sponsor of several Speedway Motorsports, Inc. properties such as Atlanta Motor Speedway and Bristol Motor Speedway.
The corporation is the primary sponsor for 7-time NASCAR Sprint Cup Series champion Jimmie Johnson in the No. 48 Chevrolet SS and it was a part-time sponsor of the former No. 5 Nationwide Series car; both teams are owned by Hendrick Motorsports. Prior to the current sponsorship deal with Hendrick Motorsports, Lowe's was the sponsor of the No. 31 Chevrolet for Richard Childress Racing driven by Mike Skinner and Robby Gordon from 1997 to 2001. Prior to the RCR deal, Lowe's was the primary sponsor of the No. 11 Ford driven by Brett Bodine for Junior Johnson & Associates and later his own team, Brett Bodine Racing (after Bodine bought the No. 11 from Johnson). One of the company's earliest forays into racing sponsorship was in 1979, when it sponsored the No. 2 Buick of the Rod Osterlund team in what was then known the Winston Cup Series, for the Talladega 500. The car was driven in that race by David Pearson, subbing for injured rookie Dale Earnhardt. Lowe's would continue with sporadic car sponsorship throughout the next two decades until the aforementioned Bodine sponsorship in 1995.
Lowe's also sponsors Fernandez Racing in the American Le Mans Series and previously sponsored the team in the Rolex Sports Car Series; in that series, Lowe's sponsors the No. 99 Gainsco Stallings Racing Pontiac in events where Johnson is driving.
All-American Muslim advertising[edit]
Lowe's withdrew its advertising from the TLC reality television show All-American Muslim in December 2011.[22] One organization that criticized the show was the Florida Family Association, a fundamentalist organization "on the Christian right" that says it's 'defending American values'".[23][24][25] The organization claimed the show was "propaganda that riskily hides the Islamic agenda's clear and present danger to American liberties and traditional values."[26] A spokesperson for Lowe's said that "we understand the program raised concerns, complaints, or issues from multiple sides of the viewer spectrum, which we found after doing research of news articles and blogs covering the show".[22]
Lowe's faced a backlash from several quarters, including Muslim-American and Arab-American organizations. The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee called upon members to contact Lowe's to urge it to reverse its position.[27] The Los Angeles chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations met to consider possible actions, including boycotts and protests.[28] Several celebrities also called for a boycott.[28] California State Senator Ted Lieu called Lowe's decision "naked religious bigotry" and said he would consider legislative action if Lowe's did not apologize to Muslim-Americans and reinstate the ads.[26] Abraham Foxman of the Anti-Defamation League expressed similar views.[29] Keith Ellison, the first Muslim elected to the United States Congress, criticized Lowe's decision to "uphold the beliefs of a fringe hate group and not the creed of the First Amendment".[28] Representative John Conyers of Michigan called on Lowe's to apologize. Michigan state representative Rashida Tlaib contacted the company's corporate headquarters, reporting that Lowe's declined to change its decision.[27]
Canada[edit]
Based in Toronto, Ontario, Lowe's opened its first three stores in Canada on December 10, 2007, in Hamilton, Brampton and Brantford. On February 1, 2008, they opened three more stores in Toronto, East Gwillimbury, and a second store in Brampton as well as a new location in Maple (Vaughan).[30] Currently, additional stores are under construction, with 19 now open in the province of Ontario. Lowe's also recently announced expansion into Western Canada, starting with three new stores in Calgary, Alberta. One of the three locations opened in late September 2010. The other two opened in early 2011. There are now stores in British Columbia and Saskatchewan. To date (2013) Lowe's has 33 locations in Canada. Each store represents an average investment of $20.5 million ($20.4 million USD).[31]
In February 2013, former Walmart Canada and Loblaw Companies executive Sylvain Prud'homme was hired as CEO of Lowe's Canada.[32]
On May 11, 2015, Lowe's Canada announced that it would acquire the leases of 13 former Target Canada stores, as well as an Ontario distribution centre, for $151 million.[33]
In 2012, Lowe's attempted to buy Rona, Inc., a Quebec-based hardware chain; however, the deal was met with objections from Rona shareholders (particularly the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec) and operators of its franchised locations over concerns that the company could centralize its supply operations in the United States, and was eventually called off.[32] On February 3, 2016, Rona announced that it had accepted an offer to be acquired by Lowe's for CDN$3.2 billion, pending regulatory and shareholder approval. The division will remain under the leadership of Sylvain Prud'homme, but will be operated out of Rona's headquarters in Boucherville. Lowe's plans to maintain Rona's retail banners, "key" executives, and the "vast majority of its current employees" post-acquisition.[34]
Australia[edit]
Trading as Masters Home Improvement, the first store opened in Braybrook, Victoria to tradesmen on August 31, 2011 and the general public on September 1, 2011. Masters is a joint venture of the Lowe's Companies, Inc. and Woolworths Limited to compete against the Wesfarmers'-owned Bunnings Warehouse, which operates in the large bigbox format similar to Lowe's and Home Depot.
The stores will be 1/3 owned by Lowe's Companies Inc. (USA) and 2/3 owned by Woolworths Limited (Australian Owned Public Company Listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX)).
On 18 January 2016 Woolworths announced that it intended to "either sell or wind up" all its home improvement area, including the Masters hardware chain. Chairman Gordon Cairns said that it would take years to become profitable and that the ongoing losses could not be sustained. The windup will involve Woolworths buying back a 33.3 per cent interest in the venture, held by the Lowe's subsidiary WDR Delaware Corporation. As of 28 August 2016 all stores are due to cease trading on, or before, 11 December 2016.
Lawsuits[edit]
Lowe's was involved in a small cluster of class action lawsuits that revolved around Lowe's employee payment system. The cases focused on a pay practice known as "variable rate overtime". Variable rate overtime has the effect of paying a decreasing overtime rate the more hours a person works in a week. The suits alleged that salaried managers who worked 40 to 50 hours per week were improperly compensated for that time. The variable rate overtime ended in the first quarter of 2006.
The first case was filed in October 2002 by employees of the Lowe's store in Shawnee, Kansas. In September 2005, the cases were certified as class action. Lowe's has four similar cases in New York, Indiana, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. The lawsuits for New York, Indiana, and Kansas resulted in an out-of-court settlement on September 22, 2006.[35]
The lawsuit in Pennsylvania became a class-action lawsuit in June 2004, with 550 employees.[36][37] The case in Ohio was filed by ten former Lowe’s employees, in August 2004.[38]
Lowe's faced multiple lawsuits from its Loss Prevention Managers citing that they were classified as exempt employees and therefore denied overtime pay. The managers asserted that they were forced to work a minimum of 48 hours per week which saved Lowe's and its investors millions of dollars every year. Lawsuits have been settled for $2.95 million in California and $6.2 million in Texas.[39]
In 2014, Lowe's faced a class action lawsuit from former and current Human Resource Managers. Similarly to the lawsuit regarding its Loss Prevention Managers, the lawsuit stated that the HR Managers were improperly and illegally classified as exempt employees and were therefore denied overtime even though they were required to work 48-hour weeks.[40]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
