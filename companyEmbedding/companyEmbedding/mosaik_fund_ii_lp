Guiding Principles
The  overall objective of TMRS’ Investment program is to ensure that members,  retirees, and beneficiaries are provided the benefits they have been promised by  their employers at a reasonable and predictable cost to the employers. Assets will be invested with a total  return posture, given appropriate consideration for portfolio volatility (risk)  and liquidity. Total return includes dividends, interest, and  realized and unrealized capital appreciation


General Objectives 
TMRS investments are held in trust for the exclusive benefit of members and invested under the provisions of the TMRS Act. The investment statutory guidelines for TMRS are found in the Texas Government Code, Sections 855.301 through 855.303. 

Investments are made with the degree of judgment and care,  under the circumstances, that persons of prudence, discretion, and intelligence  exercise in the management of their own affairs, considering the probable  income from the securities and probable safety of their capital and in  consideration of the purposes, terms, distribution requirements, and other  circumstances of the trust. Investment and management decisions respecting  individual assets will be evaluated not in isolation but in the context of the investment  portfolio as a whole and as a part of an overall investment strategy having  risk and return objectives reasonably suited to the trust.

2011 Investment Update
In 2011, TMRS continued implementing the following strategic target allocations which were adopted by the Board in June 2009, with implementation to occur over a multi-year period (see pie charts.)
There were several initiatives during 2011 aimed at continuing our progress toward the target allocations, including monthly commitments to U.S. and international equity index funds.  By the end of 2011, the equity target allocations were met with 40% of the fund invested in passively managed equity index funds (20% in domestic equities and 20% in international equities). TMRS began funding its real estate target allocation by committing $200 million to real estate limited partnerships and funding $97 million.  With the assistance of TMRS’ real estate consultant, ORG, TMRS will continue to seek out and fund additional real estate investments over the next few years in order to meet its 10% target.  In addition, TMRS funded its 5% target allocation to the real return asset class through investment in global inflation-linked bonds.  Assets allocated to fixed income managers totaled 54.2% and will gradually move to the 35% target allocation as fixed income funds other asset classes.  
 The Board will continue to authorize implementation to the strategic target allocations in stages. To ensure that the risk tolerance remains appropriate, the target allocations will be reviewed at least annually for reasonableness relative to significant economic and market changes or changes to the Board’s long-term goals and objectives.
2011 Returns
The overall one-year rate of return on the $18.5 billion investment portfolio was 2.41% with fixed income the best performing asset class, earning 7.99%, while the return on equities was 1.03% domestic and -13.35% international.

                About Mosaic
              

After marinating some beef tenderloin with galangal herb, chef Richard Yu finishes off the succulent cut with a sweet-and-spicy cambogee sauce. This signature dish is emblematic of the China-born cook's creative work at Mosaic, where his Asian-fusion and American meals stand out with locally grown produce, hand-cut meats, and fresh seafood. He also puts his unique stamp on other classic Eastern and Western dishes, such as his orange chicken with sun-dried mandarin-orange peels and his 8-ounce salmon stuffed with crab, shrimp, and cheese.
To complement Chef Richard's cuisine, bartenders craft a variety of hand-shaken cocktails such as Mosaic's signature Mosaic-Tini, a blend of muddled strawberries, simple syrup, and organic riesling. Many of those cocktails come spiked with house-infused vodkas, and other imported liquors also stock the bar alongside wines and domestic and imported beers.
Meals unfold on Mosaic's outdoor plaza or in its chic lounge inside the historic Four Points by Sheraton San Jose Downtown hotel, which affords stunning views and often hosts late-night entertainment. A nightclub sets up residency Thursday–Saturday nights, and jazz musicians improvise their way through tunes in the dining room each Friday and Saturday.
