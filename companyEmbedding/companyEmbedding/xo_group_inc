History[edit]
David Liu, his wife Carley Roney and their business partners, Rob Fassino, and Michael Wolfson founded The Knot Inc. in 1996.[1] They found that the internet could facilitate and reduce anxiety in the process of wedding planning between couples.[1] After the startup received seed financing from AOL, the partners launched The Knot brand as a portal on AOL.[2] In 1997, TheKnot.com launched on the internet.[3]
Next, the company launched an online gift registry in partnership with QVC and published its first book, The Knot Complete Guide to Weddings in the Real World.[4] In December 1999, the company raised $35 million in an initial public offering.[5]
On December 2, 2000, the company launched its own bridal magazine and went public. The Knot Weddings Magazine is published four times a year and is sold on newsstands.
In 2001 The Knot Inc. acquired WeddingPages, Inc., a publisher of regional bridal magazines, to expand its magazine offerings to local markets. Today, The Knot publishes regional magazines in 17 markets in the US. Online, the company hosts wedding vendor listings in its online directories.
In 2004, the company launched a television series, Real Weddings from The Knot, on the Oxygen Network,[6] and in 2005 it launched a streaming online video channel, The Knot TV, that runs on TheKnot.com. In 2009, the company launched a wedding planning show, called The Knot LIVE, which streams in real time to TheKnot.com from its New York City headquarters once a week.
In April 2005, the company became listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market with the ticker symbol "KNOT."
The Nest brand launched in 2005 with a website, and a magazine followed in 2006.[7] The brand serves cohabitating couples and newlyweds with lifestyle content about home decor, finance, cooking, entertaining and relationships. The brand also has two books in print, The Nest Newlywed Handbook and The Nest Home Decor Handbook.
In 2005, The Knot created a CD of wedding music called "The Knot Collection of Ceremony & Wedding Music." The Company also partnered with American Express to offer a co-branded rewards card for The Knot and The Nest.
In 2006 the company acquired WeddingChannel.com which included its registry platform and helped to consolidate the bridal media industry.[8]
In 2008, the company launched TheBump.com to serve expectant and new parents.[9] The Bump Pregnancy Guides feature pregnancy-related content and local pregnancy and baby resources in a pocket-sized magazine distributed through OBGYN offices across the country.
The Knot celebrated its 20-millionth member milestone in June 2010. [10]
In June 2011, the company transferred its common stock listing to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) with the symbol "XOXO".[11]
Mike Steib joined XO Group as president in July 2013 and assumed the role of CEO in March 2014.[12]
In October 2015, XO Group announced the acquisition of GigMasters, an online marketplace for event vendors, and a partnership with Jetaport, the discounted hotel room block booking service. [13]

PRESS RELEASES

XO Group Inc. Advances Its Digital Leadership with Two Appointments
Co-founder Rob Fassino Rejoins as EVP, Product Development; Liz Schimel Joins Board of Directors
NEW YORK, NY (August 8, 2012) – XO Group Inc. (NYSE: XOXO, www.xogroupinc.com), the premier media and technology company devoted to weddings, pregnancy, and everything in between, today announced two appointments that reaffirm the company’s commitment to innovation and its leadership position in digital media and services.
Rob Fassino rejoins as Executive Vice President, Product Development, following a six-year hiatus from the company he co-founded in 1996.
Liz Schimel, Executive Vice President and Chief Digital Officer of the Meredith National Media Group, a division of Meredith Corporation, joins as a new member of the Board of Directors.
“Developing new products and services for our audience and advertisers has been a hallmark for XO Group.  We look forward to continued innovation by welcoming back our co-founder Rob Fassino, who helped the company establish its leadership position, and by benefiting from Liz Schimel’s insights into the evolving digital landscape,” said David Liu, CEO, co-founder and Chairman of the Board. “Rob and Liz bring a unique set of skills and knowledge that further strengthen XO Group as we continue to leverage our brands, audience, and advertiser relationships to develop new services that transform the experiences of planning a wedding, preparing for the birth of the first baby, and everything in between.”
Fassino rejoins the XO Group management team to help lead the ongoing transformation of the company as it increases the focus on its audience and continues to build buzz-worthy, highly-engaging products and services. In 1996, Fassino joined CEO David Liu, Chief Content Officer Carley Roney and another classmate from NYU’s film school to start The Knot Inc., now known as XO Group Inc.  As a co-founder, Fassino was the consummate entrepreneur in the early start-up years of The Knot, helping launch products and services wildly popular with brides that were also significant revenue generators, such as The Knot’s original online wedding dress look book.  His roles also included serving as VP, Sales and Marketing, where he managed the national sales and sales operations teams and directed all national sales programs for online, print, and video campaigns, and VP, Business Integration, where he led integration and training of the local sales team after The Knot acquired Weddingpages in 2000.  Fassino is currently an Entrepreneur-In-Residence at NYU, where he helps students and faculty advance their venture concepts in conjunction with NYU’s $20 million Innovation Venture Fund.  Most recently, Fassino was a systems and operations consultant to the iCC division of Group Commerce, the venture-backed e-commerce platform for publishers.  Before that, Fassino was VP/General Manager of Interactive at United Media, where he maintained P&L and operational ownership for the interactive division of the global syndication and licensing company. Before co-founding The Knot in 1996, Fassino was a Broadcast Producer, Information Architect, and Co-Founder/Director of the Interactive Division at the Margeotes Fertitta + Partners advertising agency.  Fassino received a BFA in Film from NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts.
Schimel adds to the digital thought leadership on XO Group’s board, bringing a strategic understanding of mobile and tablet platforms, CRM and e-commerce capabilities, and consumer data usage, all of which are critical to maintaining XO Group’s prominence in digital media and services. At Meredith, she is responsible for deepening and expanding the media and marketing company’s consumer focus via all pathways to the consumer across both print and digital platforms. This includes developing tablet, mobile, and web-based digital strategies, as well as migrating consumer transactions online. Before joining Meredith in June 2011, Schimel served as Global Head of Music and Connected Entertainment at Nokia, where she was responsible for leading the launch and scaling of Nokia’s entertainment services initiative. Before Nokia, Schimel served as SVP, Entertainment at Comcast Interactive Media, where she led Comcast’s initiative to create and develop internet video products and services. Her deep background and experience in the digital arena also includes senior leadership roles with major technology, entertainment and wireless providers, including VP of Consumer Business Development at AT&T Wireless, VP and General Manager for BMG Online and BMG Entertainment, and SVP and Director of Global Business Development at Soundview Technology Group. Schimel holds an MBA and MA in Finance from the Wharton School, and a BA from the University of Pennsylvania, where she graduated magna cum laude, Phi Beta Kappa.

These statements are only predictions and reflect our current beliefs and expectations. Actual events or results may differ materially from those contained in the projections or forward-looking statements.

Please note the information presented is given as at the date and the time of its original release. Changes in such historical information may occur due to adjustments in accounting and reporting standards & procedures.
Non-GAAP Information
XO Group Inc also uses certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("U.S. GAAP"), including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted net income per diluted share and free cash flow. These non-GAAP measures have important limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for an analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Our use of these terms may vary from the use of similarly-titled measures by others in our industry due to the potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation and differences due to items subject to interpretation.
Management defines its non-GAAP financial measures as follows:

Adjusted EBITDA represents U.S. GAAP net income (loss) adjusted to exclude, if applicable: (1) provision (benefit) for income taxes, (2) depreciation and amortization, (3) stock-based compensation expense, (4) impairment charges and asset write-offs, (5) loss in equity interests, (6) interest and other income, net (7) net loss attributable to non-controlling interest and (8) other items impacting comparability in the period.
Adjusted net income represents U.S. GAAP net income (loss), adjusted for incremental or unusual costs incurred in the current period, which may include: (1) impairment charges and asset write-offs, (2) executive severance and other restructuring charges and (3) the impact of certain foreign taxes, interest and penalties.
Adjusted net income per diluted share represents adjusted net income (as defined above), divided by the diluted weighted-average number of shares outstanding for the period.
Free cash flow represents U.S. GAAP net cash provided by operations, less capital expenditures.

Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when viewed with our results under U.S. GAAP and the accompanying reconciliations, provide useful information about our period-over-period growth and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating our operating performance. However, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted net income per diluted share and free cash flow are not measures of financial performance under U.S. GAAP and, accordingly, should not be considered substitutes for or superior to net income (loss) and net income (loss) per diluted share and net cash provided by operating activities as indicators of operating performance. A reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP financial measures is included in the periodic reports and other documents filed from time-to-time by XO Group with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
