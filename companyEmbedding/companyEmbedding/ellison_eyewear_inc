You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.

Ellison Eyewear - Product Hunt





























Product HuntThe best new products, every dayAsk●|Log InSign up Featured 6 months agoEllison EyewearA lifetime membership for sunglasses 🕶HardwareWearablesTechget it102 ShareFeatured commentAristotle@aloumis · CEO/Founder Ellison EyewearHello all! 

My name is Aristotle, the founder of Ellison.  

I wanted to share a little story: It took us only one adventure and one pricey pair of “designer” sunglasses, now at the bottom of the Mediterranean sea, to realize it’s not healthy or practical to be enslaved by mass produced products. 

We set out to create a sunglass company that embraces the natural act of loss and will never punish our customers for what life throws at them. Instead, we welcome it. When we lose something as people, we often find something special in the process. Fear of losing your shades should never limit that process.

As a company we promise our customers a lifelong membership to get replacement access to handmade sunglasses while never having to sacrifice on style, quality or luxury.

At Ellison, we want to remove silly, but very real anxieties about losing glasses while encouraging people to get lost in order to find something great.

We are in a beautiful time where you can actually INVEST in this movement. Watch our video at https://republic.co/ellison and be a part of the Ellison community :)

#AchievingTheUnthinkable – The Final Hours: Republic.co/Ellison


As the final hour of the campaign approaches, with over $128,000 invested by over 240 investors, I can't help but take a moment and reflect on my journey, and the beautiful souls I've met along the way.
We all made this journey for a reason. While it's humbling, in my heart I know you didn't join just for me, you joined because you believe in the future of what business can be. In the face of current society that has shut you out, that's told you to settle, divided us, you believe we can be one people, reaching for what's possible, supporting each other, and building a stronger, more perfect union.
In December, with the help of our partners at Technori, we launched Ellison on Republic, an online platform where everyone can invest in innovative, mission-driven startups.
After just 9 short days after we launched, Ellison hit our goal and was named the fastest equity crowdfunding campaign in Chicago -- now, its considered one of the largest on the platform, exceeding our goal by over 256% > republic.co/ellison
This is important for more than just Ellison -- it’s a big step forward in the third wave of democratizing startup financing. The first wave began with reward-based crowdfunding portals like Indiegogo and Kickstarter, where people everywhere could help fund product development with a donation. The next wave, known as Title II crowdfunding, sparked a breakthrough change, enabling angel investors to fund startups through online fundraising platforms like AngelList.
Yet that second wave harnesses only a fraction of equity crowdfunding’s potential. Available to wealthy “accredited investors” only, it leaves out 97% of the US population, thereby limiting the opportunity for a fuller range of startups, founders and investors to engage with one another.
Republic addresses that limitation, and gives companies like Ellison a chance to succeed. On Republic, entrepreneurs can access a vast new source of capital: investments from the general public. And everyone — from Main Street to Wall Street — can share in the potential success of innovative startups they choose to back.
This is a big step and it hasn’t come easily. After years of lobbying effort, angel investing became legally accessible to main street for the first time this year thanks to the approval of Title III legislation. It will take partnership and perseverance to convert this policy shift into a market reality at scale. From Main Street to Wall Street, now everyone can participate in the journey of a new startup.
Why Ellison has taken on this challenge? As a team, we believe passionately in the power of entrepreneurship, and that today is only a glimmer of the real opportunity ahead.
It takes money to help grow a kernel of idea into an impactful business. Yet, the flow of venture capital only benefits a selected few. Our experience and research shows a startup financing system that is localized, focused on software startups, and biased against women and minority groups. Consider these facts:
Although some 50% of US small businesses (which generates nearly half of private-sector employment and a significant share of ongoing GDP) are founded by women, “female founded” startups account for only 7% of VC funding.Fewer than 3% of venture funded businesses are run by female CEOs, while the proportion of female partners in US venture firms currently hovers at around 8%.Venture investments totaled $48.3 billion in 2014, with more than 40 percent of that funding going to app startups, and 53 percent to companies based in California.Black Americans represent more than 12% of our population. Yet only 2% of VC investment professionals are black.
The saying “talent is equally distributed but opportunity is not” may be true — but that can change. Innovations are gender neutral, and good businesses exist in all parts of our country. Financing sources, too, should be equally distributed.
Opportunities await in gaps, and this gap is huge. For startups, equity crowdfunding is a gateway to a vast source of capital, but that’s not all. Investment crowdfunding also presents a tremendous marketing opportunity, through which a startup can convert casual customers and supporters into loyal brand ambassadors. Indeed, angel investing is about building a support network as much as it’s about operating capital.
Imagine if you converted your casual customers and supporters into loyal brand ambassadors.
Republic’s Vision for Investors like YOU
For main street investors, investing is a powerful way to join an entrepreneur’s journey. Starting a company is one way to create impact and the potential for high returns, but not everyone can make that leap. With Equity Crowdfunding, anyone can invest and share in the success of businesses they find compelling. Our goal is to ensure that investors understand the risks and rewards associated with angel investing, and to present them with innovative companies that meet our criteria.Starting a company like Ellison is one way to drive impact you want to see in the world. Being an investor, backing a startup you believe in is another.
Investing in startups is risky, but it’s more productive than minimal return gambles such as lotteries, which drained some $70 billion from main street America’s pockets in 2014 alone. If Americans directed a portion of the staggering $119 billion in annual gambling losses toward funding entrepreneurship and innovation, what change — and economic value — might be achieved?
Each and every time, a new generation has risen up and done what's needed to be done. Today we are called once more, and it is time for our generation to answer that call.
Let's be the generation that makes future generations proud of what we did here. This is our opportunity, and hope for the future.
With only a few hours left, I encourage you to join our movement, and invest in the future Republic.co/Ellison
Special thank you to one of my dearest friends and mentors, Atul Nakhasi for his kind note: see here.

Sincerely,Aristotle & The Ellison FamilyFounder, CEO | Ellison Eyewear, Inc

Highlights:
A lifetime client-service model for customers​A recognized brand of hand-made, top quality sunglassesA company that gives back with every sale Operational for 2 years with 125% average yearly growth​
The eyewear industry is broken​We all love sunglasses. They make us look good, protect our eyes, guard our privacy, and allow us to see better.  However, unfortunately for us, consumers, the $112 billion eyewear industry is headed by a handful of giant corporations, who currently own the rights and licenses to today’s biggest fashion brands and distribution channels. This means consumers pay higher prices for lower quality products than they deserve.​The status quo is not easy to change. But we’re set to do that.Ellison is building a brand that:
1. Strives for the highest quality. Period. 
2. Does good and has an integrated social mission.
3. Focuses on customers with a lifetime client service model.​1. The Highest Quality. Period.​We set ourselves apart from established brands by exceeding expectations and creating top-notch products at fair  and honest prices.​​Here's how we build amazing glasses:​Handmade​Every pair of Ellison’s is handcrafted in a family-owned workshop in Greece.Finest Italian materials
We’re using only the finest Italian materials and metals. Every pair is made using the highest quality Italian Mazzucchelli 1849 acetate.​56-step QA 
Ellison’s quality assurance process is 2x more rigorous than the industry standard, ensuring that every pair is the highest quality before it leaves our hands, and arrives in yours.It’s in the details:​​​German engineered 5 barrel hinges
Ellison’s come equipped with 5 barrel stainless steel hinges. This sturdy hinge provides integrity, durability, and comfort while keeping your temples straight unlike an average pair of sunglasses that may only have 3 barrels.
Real rivets
Pins in the frame and temples of our sunglasses provide structural integrity, while adding a touch of flare to our designs.​Soft gel nose pads
We only use soft gel nose pads to ensure comfort, even after long hours of use.Hinge lining detail
A galvanized metal cap detailed with our trademarked “E” is also used to line the temple-front junction. Only visible when the frame isn’t being worn, it’s a hidden pleasure for Ellison owners to enjoy!​​Carl Zeiss Vision lenses
Tested more thoroughly than any industry standard or law in the world requires, Carl Zeiss Vision Lenses deliver our customers the same superior optics found in the lenses used to film the moon landing.
Temple tip detail
We engrave our trademarked “E” on the left temple tip of every pair, showing our attention for detail and certifying your pair is authentic!Thermic
A special temperature sensitive varnish treatment makes Ellison “Thermic” line one of a kind: when exposed to temps above 78°F, thermic pairs react by changing color. ​​​​​​​​​Look Good, Do Good.​Companies must have a bigger purpose. We have been on a quest for the last 3 years, providing eyesight to those in need and building homes that create safe spaces for those who need it. 
Our mission is to make the best glasses and do good in this world. Through our close relationship with our customers, we are able to empower them to engage in social outreach and community development programs.Giving back is core to our culture
We provide a tangible way for our community to be the change they want to see in the world. 
Every year, our team sponsors multiple impact-travel excursions, with local partners, dedicated to closing the gap on social issues, and those who want to help solve them. We allow our community to truly involve themselves, first hand, in an immersive philanthropic experience alongside like-minded journeyers, while exploring some of the most beautiful corners on earth. ​​
To date, our community built 40 new homes in Nicaragua for families living in slum conditions.​​Giving a gift of sight
With every pair of sunglasses and Club Ellison membership sold, Ellison will provide sight to somebody in need in one of three ways: 
1) Spectacles for children 
the results of giving glasses to the child are miraculous – children go from failing and resenting their classes to excitedly getting straight As.. 
2) Building Vision Centers for the poor
Many rural areas don’t have access to basic eye care. Our donations help build eye care centers to provide help to people in need.
3) Training eye health personnel.
Along with the shortage of eye care access, the rural clinics that do exist lack trained staff. Our donations help train the personnel to provide basic eye care.​3. Club Ellison. Our customers are our friends.​Other brands take advantage of the nature of the game: that sunglasses get lost, broken or stolen all the time. In fact, other brands bet on it to make profits. Ellison turns the tides, and converts customers into a loyal community with Club Ellison.​​A Club Ellison membership is insurance for your Ellison frames. It targets 3 unaddressed pain points experienced by tens of millions of customers of high end frames:​​Should something happen to a Club Ellison member's glasses, they have access to our entire collection at exclusive membership pricing.  *50% off retail*​​Members also become part of a community that acknowledges and rewards living experiences, instead of punishing you for it. 
Since the launch of Club Ellison in June, in just several months we have organically acquired over 1,200 new members, with ~18% of those members already taking advantage of their membership perks and rebuying.  ​A growing movementOur story was picked up by news outlets, fashion blogs, business blogs and TV and has garnered notable features and PR across top publications and national media outlets for our noval  approach to addressing global problems.​Ellison glasses have become integrated into pop culture. We’ve had notable features on some of the most recognized faces in the entertainment industry, Mario Lopez, The Fray, Kelly Clarkson, Jennie Garth, Terri Seymour, Pia Toscano​, Marc Malkin,  Carolina Liar​, Novak Djokovic​, Kendall Jenner, with music artists like Post Malone, FKi 1st,  Lil Wayne and Waka Flocka Flame, just to name a few and are the premier sunglass brand for Fox’s breakout drama Empire., and many more. ​​​​Branding & Marketing
The crowded eyewear space is currently focused on an outdated traditional retail model versus cost suppression and customer experience CRM-based model.​​Data-Driven
Our deeply embedded CRM has allowed us one-to-one customer feedback from thousands of clients. This gives us real-time design and deployment insights that is typically not available at scale or without the use of a third party. 
This way, we are able to stay informed and current with quickly changing customer needs and trends. 
Emotional connection
Ellison’s marketing takes an aggressive approach in how we communicate with our consumer and how we differentiate from our competitors. This approach will communicate the tangible value of the brand and the deeper emotional connection that current competitor brands are not leaning into.​​Purchasing behavior comparison​​​​​​Sales channels
Through 2016, we’ve expanded into 60 brick-and-mortar stores, globally. ​Ellison makes profit with a four point sales strategy.
Wholesale and Pop-Up/Direct are our current main revenue generating channels given their higher up-front conversion rates and the branding opportunities available through additional exposure. 
On the brick and mortar front, teams will be hired on to push efforts with monthly goals outlined. This channel’s main purpose is brand development and testing to continue building the Ellison brand and image.​​​​Profit Margins​​​Action plan​​​Our 5 to 10 year business plan is centered on new efficiencies within the Ellison consumer purchase funnel. With the Wholesale and Pop-Up processes streamlined, this sales channel is ready for growth and only requires a capital investment in order to advance our scaling efforts. 
Ever improving experience
We’re focused on investing in consumer experience across digital and offline sales touch points. This investment will help us become faster and cut overall costs related to product development without lowering the quality. 
Data analysis
We are constantly integrating more data and insights into our product development and online conversion strategy. Your investment will be used to make this area of our business more sophisticated, focusing heavily on Club Ellison, which is projected to be a significant growth and profit channel for our brand.
New market
We will use your investment to start developing our prescription eyewear line. We will make this strategic leap because of the rocket-like growth of this market opportunity: the eyewear market size is projected to reach $184.03 billion by 2024 (source: grandviewresearch​)
Geographic expansion
By working with investors who have signature real estate, we can take advantage of these on-the-ground locations and foot traffic to drive instant sales while leveraging reduced retail and rent expenses.​Our Team​​Ellison was started by Aristotle Loumis, who set out to his home country of Greece to build a sunglasses company that creates the highest quality sunglasses in the market, with the best craftsmanship and unmatched materials.
We’ve brought together the people to get us where we need to be. Our team is made up of proven investors who have invested into the vision and market opportunity.​​​We partnered with a strategic group of proven investors like John Roa – an award winning entrepreneur and innovator in the technology and lifestyle space with his latest venture, AKTA being fully acquired Salesforce Inc. in September 2015.
Ravi Patel, another key investor, is the principle of BuiltByIowa Ventures and president of Hawkeye Hotel Group – one of the fastest growing, privately-owned hotel companies in the country. 
From the beginning, Ellison has had a passion for superior product and a fixation with service and making the world better place to live. These values endure today.​Why crowdfunding​Since Ellison has been built by our loyal customers, we want to further strengthen that relationship. Equity crowdfunding is more personal than selling shares in the open market, allowing investors a stronger level of buy-in with the company.
When you invest in Ellison, you are investing in a company that actively seeks to improve the quality of life for communities around the globe. 
We share this opportunity with our investors to get them involved in a social good whether it’s providing eyesight to somebody in need or building homes across Latin America. We are here to do good, while having fun in the process. 

Investment in Ellison is an investment in a growing brand, in dedication to product and service and in the strong ideals that guide our business.​We invite you to join the movement.​​While we are laser focused on growing our business, we are bigger than just outfitting sunglasses.
We have lost things ourselves and we never forget how it burns. We are turning this insight into a movement and bringing people peace of mind, allowing them to live their life of adventure without worrying about the little things.
We want you to be part of it – and invite you to join us for the ride.​​

What makes Ellison products different? 



What makes Ellison products different? 

Imagine replacing your Chanel sunglasses with plastic frames from the convenience store down the street. Not quite the same. You could just as easily drop another couple hundred dollars to replace those Chanel sunglasses, but what happens the next time you lose or break them? People don't want to be hindered by the loss of their glasses, but they also don't want to settle for something cheap or of lesser quality. Ellison Sunglasses resolves the buyer's dilemma by providing affordable, high-end sunglasses that are beautifully crafted in Greece. It started when our founder, Aristotle Loumis, lost his own sunglasses while traveling abroad and realized this was a common annoyance that wasn't being addressed by major eyewear companies. Ellison is dedicated to quality, and value, every pair of Ellison’s is handmade by our manufacturing team in the beautiful country of Greece. Our process includes several steps above industry standards to ensure that every pair is the highest quality before it leaves our hands, and arrives in yours. 




How does Ellison make money?



How does Ellison make money?

Ellison makes profit with a four point sales strategy that is built around a direct to consumer approach. 1) Wholesale 2) Pop-Up-Shop 3) Corporate 4) Online & Direct (ClubEllison) Since inception, we’ve expanded into 60 brick-and-mortar stores, globally. 
Wholesale and Pop-Up/Direct are our current main revenue generating channels given their higher up-front conversion rates and the branding opportunities available through additional exposure. 
On the brick and mortar fronts, teams will be hired on to push efforts with monthly goals outlined. This channel’s main purpose is brand development and testing to continue building the Ellison brand and image.Corporate events have become a high cash generating area -- essentially, a corporate client will purchase a set number of our Ellison products to gift their partners and/or employees. We will either ship directly to them, or host an in-person event. During a 2-3 hour corporate event we can generate ~$5k - 8k.
Establishing new retailer connections as well as re-engaging the ones previously had has been very successful, as well. Reorder rates are very strong at %95 and our retail partners are loving our branding and marketing efforts. 
Q2 16' also saw the launch of ClubEllison Membership Program - Just weeks after launch, we are thrilled to announce that we have over 1200 members sign up for the program, with ~18% of those members already taking advantage of the membership perks and reordered. We are seeking investment to continue building more sophisticated technology and back end tracking system in order for us to monitor and grow ClubEllison, as it is the most profitable and scalable avenue of growth. 




How much do we donate? 



How much do we donate? 

We donate $1 from every product sold and 50%, or $5, from every Club Ellison membership sold.

Risks








In order for the Company to compete and grow, it must attract, recruit, retain and develop the necessary personnel who have the needed experience.

Recruiting and retaining highly qualified personnel is critical to our success. These demands may require us to hire additional personnel and will require our existing management personnel to develop additional expertise. We face intense competition for personnel. The failure to attract and retain personnel or to develop such expertise could delay or halt the development and commercialization of our product candidates. If we experience difficulties in hiring and retaining personnel in key positions, we could suffer from delays in product development, loss of customers and sales and diversion of management resources, which could adversely affect operating results. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by third parties and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with third parties that may limit their availability to us.



The development and commercialization of our products is highly competitive.

We face competition in the eyewear industry with respect to any products that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future. Our competitors include major companies worldwide. One company in particular, Luxottica Group S.p.A. (_Luxottica_), holds a virtual monopoly in the industry, holding a controlling stake in major eyewear brands, such as Lenscrafters, Sunglass Hut and Target Optical, and producing sunglasses and prescription frames for major designer brands, such as Chanel and Prada. Luxottica and other of our competitors, such as JAND Inc., dba Warby Parker (_Warby Parker_), have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources than we have and superior expertise in research and development and marketing approved products and thus may be better equipped than us to develop and commercialize products. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel and acquiring technologies. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Accordingly, our competitors may commercialize products more rapidly or effectively than we are able to, which would adversely affect our competitive position, the likelihood that our products will achieve initial market acceptance and our ability to generate meaningful additional revenues from our products.



We rely on other companies to provide the raw materials and major components of our products.

We outsource production of our eyewear frames to manufacturers in Greece and Italy, and we depend on these suppliers and subcontractors to meet our contractual obligations to our customers and conduct our operations. Our ability to meet our obligations to our customers may be adversely affected if suppliers or subcontractors do not provide the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed-upon services in compliance with customer requirements and in a timely and cost-effective manner. Likewise, the quality of our products may be adversely impacted if companies to whom we delegate manufacture of raw materials or major components for our products, or from whom we acquire such items, do not provide the raw materials or major components which meet required specifications and perform to our and our customers_ expectations. Our suppliers may be less likely than us to be able to quickly recover from natural disasters and other events beyond their control and may be subject to additional risks such as financial problems that limit their ability to conduct their operations. The risk of these adverse effects may be greater in circumstances where we rely on only one or two subcontractors or suppliers for a particular component.



We depend on third-party service providers and outsource providers for a variety of services and we outsource a number of our non-core functions and operations.

In certain instances, we rely on single or limited service providers and outsourcing vendors around the world because the relationship is advantageous due to quality, price, and lack of alternative sources. If production or service were interrupted and we were not able to find alternate third-party providers, we could experience disruptions in manufacturing and operations including product shortages, higher freight costs and re-engineering costs. If outsourcing services are interrupted or not performed or the performance is poor, this could impact our ability to process, record and report transactions with our customers and other constituents. Such interruptions in the provision of supplies and/or services could result in our inability to meet customer demand, damage our reputation and customer relationships and adversely affect our business.



We depend on third party providers, suppliers and licensors to supply some of the hardware, software and operational support necessary to provide some of our services.

We obtain these materials from a limited number of vendors, some of which do not have a long operating history or which may not be able to continue to supply the equipment and services we desire. Some of our hardware, software and operational support vendors represent our sole source of supply or have, either through contract or as a result of intellectual property rights, a position of some exclusivity. If demand exceeds these vendors_ capacity or if these vendors experience operating or financial difficulties, or are otherwise unable to provide the equipment or services we need in a timely manner, at our specifications and at reasonable prices, our ability to provide some services might be materially adversely affected, or the need to procure or develop alternative sources of the affected materials or services might delay our ability to serve our customers. These events could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain and attract customers, and have a material negative impact on our operations, business, financial results and financial condition.



We are required to comply with various import laws and export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons and dealings between our employees and contractors.

In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of our products. In other circumstances, we may be required to obtain additional export licenses before exporting our products. Compliance with the various import laws that apply to our businesses can restrict our access to, and increase the cost of obtaining, certain products and at times can interrupt our supply of imported inventory.



The Company_s success depends on the experience and skill of the board of directors, its executive officers and key employees.

In particular, the Company is dependent on John Roa, Ravi Patel, and Aristotle Loumis who are, respectively, an advisor, co-founder, and co-founder and chief executive officer of the Company. The Company has or intends to enter into employment agreements with Aristotle Loumis and other key personnel, although there can be no assurance that it will do so or that such persons will continue to be employed or engaged by the Company for a particular period of time. The loss of any of John Roa, Ravi Patel, or Aristotle Loumis could harm the Company_s business, financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.



We rely on third-party suppliers for the materials used in the manufacturing of our products.

In 2014, the following suppliers provided the following percentage of the listed services, inputs or raw materials: Nea Optiki S.A.: 30% of our gross manufacturing; Carl Zeiss AG:30% of our eyewear lenses; and Mazzucchelli 1849 S.p.A.: 0.30% of acetate needed for our eyewear frames. If any of these suppliers changed its sales strategy to reduce its reliance on distribution channels, or decided to terminate its business relationship with us, sales and earnings could be adversely affected until we are able to establish relationships with suppliers of comparable products. Any delay or interruption in manufacturing operations (or failure to locate a suitable replacement for such suppliers) could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, or results of operations. Most of our agreements with suppliers are terminable by either party on short notice for any reason. Although we believe our relationships with these key suppliers are good, they could change their strategies as a result of a change in control, expansion of their direct sales force, changes in the marketplace or other factors beyond our control, including a key supplier becoming financially distressed.



We rely on various intellectual property rights, including trademarks, in order to operate our business.

Such intellectual property rights, however, may not be sufficiently broad or otherwise may not provide us a significant competitive advantage. In addition, the steps that we have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property may not prevent it from being challenged, invalidated, circumvented or designed-around, particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected. In some circumstances, enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons, or countries may require compulsory licensing of our intellectual property. Our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage, adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property, could adversely impact our competitive position and results of operations. We also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary rights. There can be no assurance that these agreements will adequately protect our trade secrets and other proprietary rights and will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or other proprietary rights.As we expand our business, protecting our intellectual property will become increasingly important. The protective steps we have taken may be inadequate to deter our competitors from using our proprietary information. In order to protect or enforce our patent rights, we may be required to initiate litigation against third parties, such as infringement lawsuits. Also, these third parties may assert claims against us with or without provocation. These lawsuits could be expensive, take significant time and could divert management_s attention from other business concerns. The law relating to the scope and validity of claims in the technology field in which we operate is still evolving and, consequently, intellectual property positions in our industry are generally uncertain. We cannot assure you that we will prevail in any of these potential suits or that the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, would be commercially valuable.



Although dependent on certain key personnel, the Company does not have any key man life insurance policies on any such people.

The Company is dependent on John Roa, Ravi Patel, and Aristotle Loumis in order to conduct its operations and execute its business plan. However, the Company has not purchased any insurance policies with respect to those individuals in the event of their death or disability. Therefore, in any of John Roa, Ravi Patel, and Aristotle Loumis die or become disabled, the Company will not receive any compensation to assist with such person_s absence. The loss of such person could negatively affect the Company and its operations.



We have not prepared any audited financial statements.

While the Company has prepared reviewed financial statements in connection with this Offering, we have not prepared any audited financial statements to date. Therefore, you have no audited financial information regarding the Company_s capitalization or assets or liabilities on which to make your investment decision. If you feel the information provided is insufficient, you should not invest in the Company.



We are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, in both the United States, and various foreign jurisdictions.

Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable: (i) there is no assurance that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our income tax provisions, expense amounts for non-income based taxes and accruals and (ii) any material differences could have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations in the period or periods for which determination is made.



We are not subject to Sarbanes-Oxley regulations and lack the financial controls and safeguards required of public companies.

We do not have the internal infrastructure necessary, and are not required, to complete an attestation about our financial controls that would be required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. There can be no assurance that there are no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the quality of our financial controls. We expect to incur additional expenses and diversion of management_s time if and when it becomes necessary to perform the system and process evaluation, testing and remediation required in order to comply with the management certification and auditor attestation requirements.



The Company has indicated that it has engaged in certain transactions with related persons.

Please see the section of this Memorandum entitled _Transactions with Related Persons and Conflicts of Interest_ for further details.



Changes in employment laws or regulation could harm our performance.

Various federal and state labor laws govern our relationship with our employees and affect operating costs. These laws include minimum wage requirements, overtime pay, healthcare reform and the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, unemployment tax rates, workers_ compensation rates, citizenship requirements, union membership and sales taxes. A number of factors could adversely affect our operating results, including additional government-imposed increases in minimum wages, overtime pay, paid leaves of absence and mandated health benefits, mandated training for employees, increased tax reporting and tax payments, changing regulations from the National Labor Relations Board and increased employee litigation including claims relating to the Fair Labor Standards Act.



Maintaining, extending and expanding our reputation and brand image are essential to our business success.

We seek to maintain, extend, and expand our brand image through marketing investments, including advertising and consumer promotions, and product innovation. Increasing attention on marketing could adversely affect our brand image. It could also lead to stricter regulations and greater scrutiny of marketing practices. Existing or increased legal or regulatory restrictions on our advertising, consumer promotions and marketing, or our response to those restrictions, could limit our efforts to maintain, extend and expand our brands. Moreover, adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us could damage our reputation and brand image, undermine our customers_ confidence and reduce long-term demand for our products, even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations.In addition, our success in maintaining, extending, and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment. We increasingly rely on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns. The growing use of social and digital media increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about us, our brands or our products on social or digital media, whether or not valid, could seriously damage our brands and reputation. If we do not establish, maintain, extend and expand our brand image, then our product sales, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.



We must correctly predict, identify, and interpret changes in consumer preferences and demand, offer new products to meet those changes, and respond to competitive innovation.

Consumer preferences our products change continually. Our success depends on our ability to predict, identify, and interpret the tastes and habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to consumer preferences. If we do not offer products that appeal to consumers, our sales and market share will decrease. We must distinguish between short-term fads, mid-term trends, and long-term changes in consumer preferences. If we do not accurately predict which shifts in consumer preferences will be long-term, or if we fail to introduce new and improved products to satisfy those preferences, our sales could decline. In addition, because of our varied customer base, we must offer an array of products that satisfy the broad spectrum of consumer preferences. If we fail to expand our product offerings successfully across product categories, or if we do not rapidly develop products in faster growing and more profitable categories, demand for our products could decrease, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and results of operations.In addition, achieving growth depends on our successful development, introduction, and marketing of innovative new products and line extensions. Successful innovation depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance, to obtain, protect and maintain necessary intellectual property rights, and to avoid infringing the intellectual property rights of others and failure to do so could compromise our competitive position and adversely impact our business.



We are vulnerable to fluctuations in the price and supply of ingredients, packaging materials, and freight.

The prices of the components of our products, packaging materials and freight are subject to fluctuations in price attributable to, among other things, changes in supply and demand of raw materials and fuel prices. The sales prices to our customers are a delivered price. Therefore, changes in our input costs could impact our gross margins. Our ability to pass along higher costs through price increases to our customers is dependent upon competitive conditions and pricing methodologies employed in the various markets in which we compete. To the extent competitors do not also increase their prices, customers and consumers may choose to purchase competing products or may shift purchases to lower-priced private label or other value offerings which may adversely affect our results of operations.We use significant quantities of raw materials, as well as packaging materials provided by third-party suppliers. We buy from a variety of producers and manufacturers, and alternate sources of supply are generally available. However, the supply and price are subject to market conditions and are influenced by other factors beyond our control. We do not have long-term contracts with many of our suppliers, and, as a result, they could increase prices or fail to deliver. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could increase our costs and disrupt our operations.



Substantial disruption to production at our manufacturing and distribution facilities could occur.

A disruption in production at our third-party manufacturing facilities could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, a disruption could occur at the facilities of our suppliers or distributors. The disruption could occur for many reasons, including fire, natural disasters, weather, water scarcity, manufacturing problems, disease, strikes, transportation or supply interruption, government regulation, cybersecurity attacks or terrorism. Alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available, may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production, each of which could negatively affect our business and results of operations.



Future product recalls could adversely impact our results of operations.

We may be required to recall certain of our products should they be mislabeled, tampered with or damaged. A product recall could have an adverse effect on our business, depending on the costs of the recall, the destruction of product inventory, competitive reaction and consumer attitudes. Even if a consumer fraud claim is unsuccessful or without merit, the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products could adversely affect our reputation and brand image. We also could be adversely affected if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the quality of our products.



Changes in raw material and manufacturing input prices could adversely affect our business and results of operations.

Because pricing for the majority of our cellulose specialty fibers customers is set annually, we typically have very limited ability to pass along fluctuations in costs to customers after pricing has been established. Raw material costs and energy are a significant operating expense. The cost of raw materials and energy can be volatile and are susceptible to rapid and substantial increases due to factors beyond our control, such as changing economic conditions, political unrest, instability in energy-producing nations, and supply and demand considerations. Price increases and general volatility could adversely affect our business and results of operations.



Any disruption in our information systems could disrupt our operations and would be adverse to our business and results of operations.

We depend on various information systems to support our customers_ requirements and to successfully manage our business, including managing orders, supplies, accounting controls and payroll. Any inability to successfully manage the procurement, development, implementation or execution of our information systems and back-up systems, including matters related to system security, reliability, performance and access, as well as any inability of these systems to fulfill their intended purpose within our business, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Such disruptions may not be covered by our business interruption insurance.



The potential impact of failing to deliver products on time could increase the cost of our products.

In most instances, we guarantee that we will deliver a product by a scheduled date. If we subsequently fail to deliver the product as scheduled, we may be held responsible for cost impacts and/or other damages resulting from any delay. To the extent that these failures to deliver occur, the total damages for which we could be liable could significantly increase the cost of the products; as such, we could experience reduced profits or, in some cases, a loss for that contract. Additionally, failure to deliver products on time could result in damage to customer relationships, the potential loss of customers, and reputational damage which could impair our ability to attract new customers.



Many of our customers do not commit to long-term production schedules, which makes it difficult for us to schedule production accurately and achieve maximum efficiency of our manufacturing capacity.

Many of our customers do not commit to firm production schedules and we continue to experience reduced lead-times in customer orders. Additionally, customers may change production quantities or delay production with little lead-time or advance notice. Therefore, we rely on and plan our production and inventory levels based on our customers_ advance orders, commitments or forecasts, as well as our internal assessments and forecasts of customer demand. The variations in volume and timing of sales make it difficult to schedule production and optimize utilization of manufacturing capacity. This uncertainty may require us to increase staffing and incur other expenses in order to meet an unexpected increase in customer demand, potentially placing a significant burden on our resources. Additionally, an inability to respond to such increases may cause customer dissatisfaction, which may negatively affect our customers_ relationships.Further, in order to secure sufficient production scale, we may make capital investments in advance of anticipated customer demand. Such investments may lead to low utilization levels if customer demand forecasts change and we are unable to utilize the additional capacity. Additionally, we order materials and components based on customer forecasts and orders and suppliers may require us to purchase materials and components in minimum quantities that exceed customer requirements, which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Such order fluctuations and deferrals may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.



Failure to execute our opportunistic buying could adversely affect our business.

We purchase the majority of our inventory opportunistically, with our buyers purchasing close to need. While opportunistic buying provides our buyers the ability to buy at desirable times and prices, in the quantities we need and into market trends, it places considerable discretion in our buyers, subjecting us to risks related to the pricing, quantity, nature and timing of inventory flowing to our stores. If we are unable to provide frequent replenishment of fresh, high quality, attractively priced merchandise in our stores, it could adversely affect traffic to our stores as well as our sales and margins. We base our purchases of inventory, in part, on our sales forecasts. If our sales forecasts do not match customer demand, we may experience higher inventory levels and need to markdown excess or slow-moving inventory, leading to decreased profit margins, or we may have insufficient inventory to meet customer demand, leading to lost sales, either of which could adversely affect our financial performance.We need to purchase inventory sufficiently below conventional retail to maintain our pricing differential to regular department and specialty store prices and to attract customers and sustain our margins, which we may not achieve at various times and which could adversely affect our results.



Our business may be adversely affected by catastrophic events and extreme or unseasonable weather conditions.

Unforeseen events, including war, terrorism and other international conflicts, public health issues and natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes or tornadoes, whether occurring in the United States or abroad, could disrupt our supply chain operations, international trade or result in political or economic instability. Any of the foregoing events could result in property losses, reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible to obtain merchandise from our suppliers.



Decreases in discretionary consumer spending may have an adverse effect on us.

Our eyewear products are products that consumers may view as discretionary items rather than necessities. As a result, our results of operations are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions that impact consumer spending, including discretionary spending. Difficult macroeconomic conditions, particularly high levels of unemployment, also impact our customers_ ability to obtain consumer credit. Other factors, including consumer confidence, employment levels, interest rates, tax rates, consumer debt levels, and fuel and energy costs could reduce consumer spending or change consumer purchasing habits. Slowdowns in the U.S. or global economy, or an uncertain economic outlook, could adversely affect consumer spending habits and our results of operations.



If we do not continue to source new products, our ability to compete will be undermined, and we may be unable to implement our business plan.

Our ability to compete in the direct marketing industry and to expand into the traditional retail environment depends to a great extent on our ability to develop or acquire new innovative products under particular brands and to complement these products with related families of products under those brands.If we do not source new products as our existing products mature through their product life cycles, or if we do not develop related families of products under our brands, we will not be able to implement our business plan, and the value of your investment may decrease.



Our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain our customer experience or provide high quality customer service.

The success of our business largely depends on our ability to provide superior customer experience and high quality customer service, which in turn depends on a variety of factors, such as our ability to continue to provide a reliable and user-friendly website interface for our customers to browse and purchase our products, reliable and timely delivery of our products, and superior after sales services. Our sales may decrease if our website services are severely interrupted or otherwise fail to meet our customer requests. Should we or our third-party delivery companies fail to provide our product delivery and return services in a convenient or reliable manner, or if our customers are not satisfied with our product quality, our reputation and customer loyalty could be negatively affected. In addition, we also depend on our call center and online customer service representatives to provide live assistance to our customers. If our call center or online customer service representatives fail to satisfy the individual needs of customers, our reputation and customer loyalty could be negatively affected and we may lose potential or existing customers and experience a decrease in sales. As a result, if we are unable to continue to maintain our customer experience and provide high quality customer service, we may not be able to retain existing customers or attract new customers, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.



We depend upon designers, vendors and other sources of merchandise, goods and services.

Our business could be affected by disruptions in, or other legal, regulatory, political or economic issues associated with, our supply network. Our relationships with established and emerging designers have been a significant contributor to our past success. Our ability to find qualified vendors and access products in a timely and efficient manner is often challenging, particularly with respect to goods sourced outside the United States. Our procurement of goods and services from outside the United States is subject to risks associated with political or financial instability, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, transport capacity and costs and other factors relating to foreign trade. In addition, our procurement of all our goods and services is subject to the effects of price increases, which we may or may not be able to pass through to our customers. All of these factors may affect our ability to access suitable merchandise on acceptable terms, are beyond our control and could negatively affect our business and results of operations.



Our advertising and marketing efforts may be costly and may not achieve desired results.

We incur substantial expense in connection with our advertising and marketing efforts. Although we target our advertising and marketing efforts on current and potential customers who we believe are likely to be in the market for the products we sell, we cannot assure you that our advertising and marketing efforts will achieve our desired results. In addition, we periodically adjust our advertising expenditures in an effort to optimize the return on such expenditures. Any decrease in the level of our advertising expenditures, which may be made to optimize such return could adversely affect our sales.



We may be required to collect sales tax on our direct marketing operations.

With respect to the direct sales, sales or other similar taxes are collected primarily in states where we have retail stores, another physical presence or personal property. However, various states or foreign countries may seek to impose sales tax collection obligations on out-of-state direct mail companies. A successful assertion by one or more states that we should have collected or should be collecting sales taxes on the direct sale of our merchandise could have an adverse effect on our business.



Government regulation is evolving and unfavorable changes could harm our business.

We are subject to general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet, e-commerce, electronic devices, and other services. Existing and future laws and regulations may impede our growth. These regulations and laws may cover taxation, privacy, data protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, mobile communications, electronic device certification, electronic waste, energy consumption, environmental regulation, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, consumer protection, web services, the provision of online payment services, information reporting requirements, unencumbered Internet access to our services, the design and operation of websites, the characteristics and quality of products and services, and the commercial operation of unmanned aircraft systems. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, libel, and personal privacy apply to the Internet, e-commerce, digital content, and web services. Jurisdictions may regulate consumer-to-consumer online businesses, including certain aspects of our seller programs. Unfavorable regulations and laws could diminish the demand for our products and services and increase our cost of doing business.



The SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity) will not be freely tradable until one year from the initial purchase date. Although the SAFE may be tradable under federal securities law, state securities regulations may apply and each Purchaser shou...

You should be aware of the long-term nature of this investment. There is not now and likely will not be a public market for the SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity). Because the SAFE has not been registered under the Securities Act or under the securities laws of any state or non-U.S. jurisdiction, the SAFE has transfer restrictions and cannot be resold in the United States except pursuant to Rule 501 of Regulation CF. It is not currently contemplated that registration under the Securities Act or other securities laws will be effected. Limitations on the transfer of the SAFE may also adversely affect the price that you might be able to obtain for the SAFE in a private sale. Purchasers should be aware of the long-term nature of their investment in the Company. Each Purchaser in this Offering will be required to represent that it is purchasing the Securities for its own account, for investment purposes and not with a view to resale or distribution thereof.



Neither the Offering nor the Securities have been registered under federal or state securities laws, leading to an absence of certain regulation applicable to the Company.  

No governmental agency has reviewed or passed upon this Offering, the Company or any Securities of the Company. The Company also has relied on exemptions from securities registration requirements under applicable state securities laws. Investors in the Company, therefore, will not receive any of the benefits that such registration would otherwise provide. Prospective investors must therefore assess the adequacy of disclosure and the fairness of the terms of this offering on their own or in conjunction with their personal advisors.  



No Guarantee of Return on Investment  

There is no assurance that a Purchaser will realize a return on its investment or that it will not lose its entire investment. For this reason, each Purchaser should read the Form C and all exhibits carefully and should consult with its own attorney and business advisor prior to making any investment decision.



A majority of the Company is owned by a small number of owners.

Prior to the Offering, the Company's current owners of 20% or more beneficially own 67.35% of the Company. Subject to any fiduciary duties owed to our other owners or Purchasers under Delaware law, these owners may be able to exercise significant influence over matters requiring owner approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant Company transactions, and will have significant control over the Company's management and policies. Some of these persons may have interests that are different from those of the Purchasers. For example, these owners may support proposals and actions that the Purchasers may disagree with. The concentration of ownership could delay or prevent a change in control of the Company or otherwise discourage a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of the Company, which in turn could reduce the price potential Purchasers are willing to pay for the Company. In addition, these owners could use their voting influence to maintain the Company's existing management, delay or prevent changes in control of the Company, or support or reject other management and board proposals that are subject to owner approval.



The Company has the right to extend the Offering deadline.

The Company may extend the Offering deadline beyond what is currently stated herein. This means that your investment may continue to be held in escrow while the Company attempts to raise the Minimum Amount even after the Offering deadline stated herein is reached. Your investment will not be accruing interest during this time and will simply be held until such time as the new Offering deadline is reached without the Company receiving the Minimum Amount, at which time it will be returned to you without interest or deduction, or the the Company receives the Minimum Amount, at which time it will be released to the Company to be used as set forth herein. Upon or shortly after release of such funds to the Company, the Securities will be issued and distributed to you.



Purchasers will not become equity holders until the company decides to convert the Securities into CF Shadow Securities or until an IPO or sale of the Company.

Purchasers will not have an ownership claim to the Company or to any of its assets or revenues for an indefinite amount of time, and depending on when and how the Securities are converted, the Purchasers may never become equity holders of the Company. Purchasers will not become equity holders of the Company unless the Company receives a future round of financing great enough to trigger a conversion and the Company elects to convert the Securities. Except for certain _Major Investors,_ Purchasers will have no say in whether their securities are converted in any Equity Financing. The Company is under no obligation to convert the Securities into CF Shadow Securities (the type of equity securities Purchasers are entitled to receive upon such conversion). In certain instances, such as a sale of the Company, an IPO or a dissolution or bankruptcy, the Purchasers may only have a right to receive cash, to the extent available, rather than equity in the Company.



Purchasers will not have voting rights, even upon conversion of the Securities into CF Shadow Securities.

Purchasers will not have the right to vote upon matters of the Company even if and when their Securities are converted into CF Shadow Securities. Upon such conversion, CF Shadow Securities will have no voting rights and even in circumstances where a statutory right to vote is provided by state law, the CF Shadow Security holders are required to vote with the majority of the security holders in the new round of equity financing upon which the Securities were converted. For example, if the Securities are converted upon a round offering Series B Preferred Shares, the Series B-CF Shadow Security holders will be required to vote the same way as a majority of the Series B Preferred Share holders vote. Thus, Purchasers will never be able to freely vote upon any director or other matters of the Company.



Purchasers will not be entitled to any inspection or information rights other than those required by Regulation CF.

Purchasers will not have the right to inspect the books and records of the Company or to receive financial or other information from the Company, other than as required by Regulation CF. Other security holders may have such rights. Regulation CF requires only the provision of an annual report on Form C-AR and no additional information. This lack of information could put Purchasers at a disadvantage in general and with respect to other security holders.



In a dissolution or bankruptcy of the Company, Purchasers will be treated the same as common equity holders.

In a dissolution or bankruptcy of the Company, Purchasers of Securities which have not been converted will be entitled to distributions as if they were common stock holders. This means that such Purchasers will be at the lowest level of priority and will only receive distributions once all creditors as well as holders of more senior securities, including any preferred stock holders, have been paid in full. If the Securities have been converted into CF Shadow Securities, the Purchasers will have the same rights and preferences (other than the ability to vote) as the holders of the securities issued in the equity financing upon which the Securities were converted.



Purchasers will be unable to declare the Security in _default_ and demand repayment.

Unlike convertible notes and some other securities, the Securities do not have any _default_ provisions upon which the Purchasers will be able to demand repayment of their investment. The Company has ultimate discretion as to whether or not to convert the Securities upon a future equity financing and Purchasers have no right to demand such conversion. Only in limited circumstances, such as a liquidity event, may the Purchasers demand payment and even then, such payments will be limited to the amount of cash available to the Company.



The Company may never elect to convert the Securities or undergo a liquidity event.

The Company may never receive a future equity financing or elect to convert the Securities upon such future financing. In addition, the Company may never undergo a liquidity event such as a sale of the Company or an IPO. If neither the conversion of the Securities nor a liquidity event occurs, the Purchasers could be left holding the Securities in perpetuity. The Securities have numerous transfer restrictions and will likely be highly illiquid, with no secondary market on which to sell them. The Securities are not equity interests, have no ownership rights, have no rights to the Company_s assets or profits and have no voting rights or ability to direct the Company or its actions.In addition to the risks listed above, businesses are often subject to risks not foreseen or fully appreciated by the management. It is not possible to foresee all risks that may affect us. Moreover, the Company cannot predict whether the Company will successfully effectuate the Company_s current business plan. Each prospective Purchaser is encouraged to carefully analyze the risks and merits of an investment in the Securities and should take into consideration when making such analysis, among other, the Risk Factors discussed above.

My name is Aristotle, the founder of Ellison.  

I wanted to share a little story: It took us only one adventure and one pricey pair of “designer” sunglasses, now at the bottom of the Mediterranean sea, to realize it’s not healthy or practical to be enslaved by mass produced products. 

We set out to create a sunglass company that embraces the natural act of loss and will never punish our customers for what life throws at them. Instead, we welcome it. When we lose something as people, we often find something special in the process. Fear of losing your shades should never limit that process.

As a company we promise our customers a lifelong membership to get replacement access to handmade sunglasses while never having to sacrifice on style, quality or luxury.

At Ellison, we want to remove silly, but very real anxieties about losing glasses while encouraging people to get lost in order to find something great.

We are in a beautiful time where you can actually INVEST in this movement. Watch our video at https://republic.co/ellison and be a part of the Ellison community :)

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
