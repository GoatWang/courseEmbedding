The Engineering of Easy: UniCam® Connectors
UniCam® Connectors






For years, the installation of cable networks' field connectors was a fairly time-consuming process. To ensure the seamless flow of data-forming light, each hair-thin strand of glass fiber had to be glued into a connector. Technicians had to tote along portable ovens to heat-cure the special epoxy.
After waiting for the connector to finish curing, the technician would clean and polish the components by hand to ensure the pristine surface required for optical transmission.
On average, it took six to eight minutes to terminate a single connector. Results varied widely, based on the skill and experience of the technician. As recently as the mid-1990s, that’s just how it was.
But as carriers everywhere began to embrace the fast transmission capabilities of optical fiber networks, Corning engineers knew they had to find a better way.

Redefining Home Connectivity
Redefining Home Connectivity



Answering the Customer’s Call
It may not seem like it now, but it wasn’t that long ago that fiber to the home (FTTH) was in its infancy. There were no mass deployments, no customized products, and no recommended or common installation procedures. While Corning had been preparing for FTTH deployments for many years, we hadn’t yet had the opportunity to work with a customer and realize the vision of taking optical fiber all the way to the end customer. That changed when the first major carrier announced its plans to deploy FTTH technology.
With this announcement, we got to work, hand-in-hand with our customer. Our goal was to merge our expertise in fiber optics with the customer’s need for a reliable, future-ready product that could be deployed rapidly to allow for large-scale FTTH deployments. The result: The FlexNAP™ system, which uses standard optical fiber cables with network access points pre-installed at customer-specified locations along the length of the cable. With this product, we were able to bring the life-enhancing benefits of optical fiber to the customer, with deployments several times faster than traditional field installations.
Together with our customer, we developed a product that revolutionized FTTH delivery and is still an essential element in many FTTH deployments today.

Corning Incorporated is an American manufacturer of glass, ceramics, and related materials, primarily for industrial and scientific applications. The company was known as Corning Glass Works until 1989, when it changed its name to Corning Incorporated.[2] In 1998, Corning divested itself of its consumer lines of CorningWare and Corelle tableware and Pyrex and Visions cookware by selling the Corning Consumer Products division (now known as World Kitchen) to Borden, but still holds an interest of about 8%. As of 2014[update], Corning had five major business sectors: Display Technologies, Environmental Technologies, Life Sciences, Optical Communications, and Specialty Materials. Corning is involved in two joint ventures: Dow Corning and Pittsburgh Corning. Quest Diagnostics and Covance were spun off from Corning in 1996.[3] Corning is one of the main suppliers to Apple Inc. since working with Steve Jobs in 2007 to develop the iPhone.[4]

History[edit]




One of the first optic headlamp lenses, the Corning Conaphore. Selective yellow "Noviol" glass version shown.


Corning Glass Works was founded in 1851 by Amory Houghton, in Somerville, Massachusetts, originally as the Bay State Glass Co. It later moved to Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York, and operated as the Brooklyn Flint Glass Works. The company moved again to its ultimate home and namesake, the city of Corning, New York, in 1868 under leadership of the founder's son, Amory Houghton, Jr.
Over 147 years later, Corning continues to maintain its world headquarters at Corning, N.Y. The firm also established one of the first industrial research labs there in 1908. It continues to expand the nearby research and development facility, as well as operations associated with catalytic converters and diesel engine filter product lines. Corning has a long history of community development and has assured community leaders that it intends to remain headquartered in its small upstate New York hometown.[5]
The California Institute of Technology's 200-inch (5.1 m) telescope mirror at Palomar Observatory was cast by Corning during 1934–1936 out of low expansion borosilicate glass.[6] In 1932, George Ellery Hale approached Corning with the challenge of fabricating the required optic for his Palomar project. A previous effort to fabricate the optic from fused quartz had failed. Corning's first attempt was a failure, the cast blank having voids. Using lessons learned, Corning was successful in the casting of the second blank. After a year of cooling, during which it was almost lost to a flood, in 1935 the blank was completed. The first blank now resides in Corning's Museum of Glass.
In 1935, Corning formed a partnership with bottle maker Owens-Illinois, which formed the company known today as Owens Corning. Owens Corning was spun off as a separate company in 1938.

The company had a history of science-based innovations following World War II and the strategy by management was research and "disruptive" and "on demand" product innovation.[7]
In 1962 Corning developed Chemcor, a new toughened automobile windshield designed to be thinner and lighter than existing windshields, which reduced danger of personal injury by shattering into small granules when smashed.[8] This toughened glass had a chemically hardened outer layer, and its manufacture incorporated an ion exchange and a "fusion process" in special furnaces that Corning built in its Blacksburg, Virginia facility.[7][9] Corning developed it as an alternative to laminated windshields with the intention of becoming an automotive industry supplier.[7] After being installed as side glass in a limited run of 1968 Plymouth Barracudas and Dodge Darts, Chemcor windshields debuted on the 1970 model year Javelins and AMXs built by American Motors Corporation (AMC).[9] As there were no mandatory safety standards for motor vehicle windshields, the larger automakers had no financial incentive to change from the cheaper existing products.[7][9] Corning terminated its windshield project in 1971, after it turned out to be one of the company's "biggest and most expensive failures."[9] However, like many Corning innovations, the unique process to manufacture this automotive glass was resurrected and is today the basis of their very profitable LCD glass business.
In the fall of 1970, the company announced that researchers Robert D. Maurer, Donald Keck, Peter C. Schultz, and Frank Zimar had demonstrated an optical fiber with a low optical attenuation of 17 dB per kilometer by doping silica glass with titanium. [10] A few years later they produced a fiber with only 4 dB/km, using germanium oxide as the core dopant. Such low attenuations made fiber optics practical for telecommunications and networking. Corning became the world's leading manufacturer of optical fiber.
In 1977, considerable attention was given to Corning's Z Glass project. Z Glass was a product used in television picture tubes. Due to a number of factors, the exact nature of which are subject to dispute, this project was considered a steep loss in profit and productivity. The following year the project made a partial recovery. This incident has been cited as a case study by the Harvard School of Business.[11]
Company profits soared in the late 1990s during the dot-com boom, and Corning expanded its fiber operations significantly with several new plants. The company also entered the photonics market, investing heavily with the intent of becoming the leading provider of complete fiber-optic systems. Failure to succeed in photonics and the collapse in 2000 of the dot-com market had a major impact on the company, and Corning stock plummeted to $1 per share. However, as of 2007[update] the company had posted five straight years of improving financial performance.

The turning point for Corning came when Apple approached it to develop a screen solution for its upcoming phone model, the iPhone. Eventually, all the major Android vendors also adopted its Gorilla glass screen.[citation needed] In 2011 Corning announced the expansion of existing facilities and the construction of a Gen 10 facility co-located with the Sharp Corporation manufacturing complex in Sakai, Osaka, Japan.[12] The LCD glass substrate is produced without heavy metals. Corning is a leading manufacturer of the glass used in liquid crystal displays[citation needed].
The company continues to produce optical fiber and cable for the communications industry at its Wilmington and Concord plants in North Carolina. It is also a major manufacturer of ceramic emission control devices for catalytic converters in cars and light trucks that use gasoline engines. The company is also investing in the production of ceramic emission control products for diesel engines as a result of tighter emission standards for those engines both in the U.S. and abroad.
In 2007 Corning introduced an optic fiber, ClearCurve, which uses nanostructure technology to facilitate the small radius bending found in FTTX installations.




Corning's Gorilla Glass is used on the Nokia N8's screen


Gorilla Glass, an outgrowth of the 1960s Chemcor project, is a high-strength alkali-aluminosilicate thin sheet glass used as a protective cover glass offering scratch resistance and durability in many handheld devices with touchscreens, went on sale in 2008.[13] According to the book "Steve Jobs" by Walter Isaacson, Gorilla Glass was used in the first iPhone released in 2007.[14]
On October 25, 2011 Corning unveiled Lotus Glass, an environmentally friendly and high-performance glass developed for OLED and LCD displays.[15][16]
Corning invests about 10% of revenue in research and development, and has allocated US$300 million towards further expansion of its Sullivan Park research facility near headquarters in Corning, New York.[17]
Corning Incorporated also manufactures a high-purity fused silica employed in microlithography systems, a low expansion glass utilized in the construction of reflective mirror blanks, windows for U.S. space shuttles, and Steuben art glass. The number of Corning facilities still employing the traditional tanks of molten glass has declined over the years, but it maintains the capacity to supply bulk or finished glass of many types.
Corning is engaged in research and development on green lasers, mercury abatement, microreactors, photovoltaics, and silicon on glass. Through its Life Sciences division, the company offers products to support life science research, including stem-cell culture products.[18]
Other activities[edit]
Corning employs roughly 34,000 people worldwide and had sales of $10.217 billion in 2014.[1] The company has been listed for many years among Fortune magazine's 500 largest companies, and was ranked #297 in 2015.
Although the company has long been publicly owned, James R. Houghton, great-great-grandson of the founder, served as chairman of the board of directors from 2001 to 2007. Over the years Houghton family ownership has declined to about 2%. Wendell P. Weeks has been with the company since 1983 and as of March 2013[update] was chairman, chief executive officer, and president.[19]
Over its 160-year history Corning invented a process for rapid and inexpensive production of light bulbs, including developing the glass for Thomas Edison's light bulb. Corning was the glass supplier for lightbulbs for General Electric after Edison General Electric merged with Thomson-Houston Electric Company in 1892.[20] It was an early major manufacturer of glass panels and funnels for television tubes, invented and produced Vycor (high temperature glass with high thermal shock resistance). Corning invented and produced Pyrex, CorningWare Pyroceram glass-ceramic cookware, and Corelle durable glass dinnerware. Corning manufactured the windows for US manned space vehicles, and supplied the glass blank for the primary mirror in the Hubble Space Telescope. Corning won the National Medal of Technology four times for its product and process innovations[21] [22] [23] .[24]
In July 2008 Corning announced the sale of Steuben Glass Works to Steuben Glass LLC, an affiliate of the private equity firm Schottenstein Stores Corporation. Steuben Glass had been unprofitable for more than a decade, losing 30 million dollars over the previous five years.[25]
In February 2011, Corning acquired MobileAccess Networks, an Israeli company that develops Distributed antenna systems, which are often used by universities, stadiums and airports to ensure seamless wireless coverage throughout a facility. MobileAccess Networks became part of Corning’s telecommunications business unit.[26]

Corning Incorporated is an American manufacturer of glass, ceramics, and related materials, primarily for industrial and scientific applications. The company was known as Corning Glass Works until 1989, when it changed its name to Corning Incorporated.[2] In 1998, Corning divested itself of its consumer lines of CorningWare and Corelle tableware and Pyrex and Visions cookware by selling the Corning Consumer Products division (now known as World Kitchen) to Borden, but still holds an interest of about 8%. As of 2014[update], Corning had five major business sectors: Display Technologies, Environmental Technologies, Life Sciences, Optical Communications, and Specialty Materials. Corning is involved in two joint ventures: Dow Corning and Pittsburgh Corning. Quest Diagnostics and Covance were spun off from Corning in 1996.[3] Corning is one of the main suppliers to Apple Inc. since working with Steve Jobs in 2007 to develop the iPhone.[4]

History[edit]




One of the first optic headlamp lenses, the Corning Conaphore. Selective yellow "Noviol" glass version shown.


Corning Glass Works was founded in 1851 by Amory Houghton, in Somerville, Massachusetts, originally as the Bay State Glass Co. It later moved to Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York, and operated as the Brooklyn Flint Glass Works. The company moved again to its ultimate home and namesake, the city of Corning, New York, in 1868 under leadership of the founder's son, Amory Houghton, Jr.
Over 147 years later, Corning continues to maintain its world headquarters at Corning, N.Y. The firm also established one of the first industrial research labs there in 1908. It continues to expand the nearby research and development facility, as well as operations associated with catalytic converters and diesel engine filter product lines. Corning has a long history of community development and has assured community leaders that it intends to remain headquartered in its small upstate New York hometown.[5]
The California Institute of Technology's 200-inch (5.1 m) telescope mirror at Palomar Observatory was cast by Corning during 1934–1936 out of low expansion borosilicate glass.[6] In 1932, George Ellery Hale approached Corning with the challenge of fabricating the required optic for his Palomar project. A previous effort to fabricate the optic from fused quartz had failed. Corning's first attempt was a failure, the cast blank having voids. Using lessons learned, Corning was successful in the casting of the second blank. After a year of cooling, during which it was almost lost to a flood, in 1935 the blank was completed. The first blank now resides in Corning's Museum of Glass.
In 1935, Corning formed a partnership with bottle maker Owens-Illinois, which formed the company known today as Owens Corning. Owens Corning was spun off as a separate company in 1938.

Corning Incorporated is an American manufacturer of glass, ceramics, and related materials, primarily for industrial and scientific applications. The company was known as Corning Glass Works until 1989, when it changed its name to Corning Incorporated.[2] In 1998, Corning divested itself of its consumer lines of CorningWare and Corelle tableware and Pyrex and Visions cookware by selling the Corning Consumer Products division (now known as World Kitchen) to Borden, but still holds an interest of about 8%. As of 2014[update], Corning had five major business sectors: Display Technologies, Environmental Technologies, Life Sciences, Optical Communications, and Specialty Materials. Corning is involved in two joint ventures: Dow Corning and Pittsburgh Corning. Quest Diagnostics and Covance were spun off from Corning in 1996.[3] Corning is one of the main suppliers to Apple Inc. since working with Steve Jobs in 2007 to develop the iPhone.[4]

History[edit]




One of the first optic headlamp lenses, the Corning Conaphore. Selective yellow "Noviol" glass version shown.


Corning Glass Works was founded in 1851 by Amory Houghton, in Somerville, Massachusetts, originally as the Bay State Glass Co. It later moved to Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York, and operated as the Brooklyn Flint Glass Works. The company moved again to its ultimate home and namesake, the city of Corning, New York, in 1868 under leadership of the founder's son, Amory Houghton, Jr.
Over 147 years later, Corning continues to maintain its world headquarters at Corning, N.Y. The firm also established one of the first industrial research labs there in 1908. It continues to expand the nearby research and development facility, as well as operations associated with catalytic converters and diesel engine filter product lines. Corning has a long history of community development and has assured community leaders that it intends to remain headquartered in its small upstate New York hometown.[5]
The California Institute of Technology's 200-inch (5.1 m) telescope mirror at Palomar Observatory was cast by Corning during 1934–1936 out of low expansion borosilicate glass.[6] In 1932, George Ellery Hale approached Corning with the challenge of fabricating the required optic for his Palomar project. A previous effort to fabricate the optic from fused quartz had failed. Corning's first attempt was a failure, the cast blank having voids. Using lessons learned, Corning was successful in the casting of the second blank. After a year of cooling, during which it was almost lost to a flood, in 1935 the blank was completed. The first blank now resides in Corning's Museum of Glass.
In 1935, Corning formed a partnership with bottle maker Owens-Illinois, which formed the company known today as Owens Corning. Owens Corning was spun off as a separate company in 1938.




1917 advertisement for the Corning Conaphore headlamp lens shown above.


The company had a history of science-based innovations following World War II and the strategy by management was research and "disruptive" and "on demand" product innovation.[7]
In 1962 Corning developed Chemcor, a new toughened automobile windshield designed to be thinner and lighter than existing windshields, which reduced danger of personal injury by shattering into small granules when smashed.[8] This toughened glass had a chemically hardened outer layer, and its manufacture incorporated an ion exchange and a "fusion process" in special furnaces that Corning built in its Blacksburg, Virginia facility.[7][9] Corning developed it as an alternative to laminated windshields with the intention of becoming an automotive industry supplier.[7] After being installed as side glass in a limited run of 1968 Plymouth Barracudas and Dodge Darts, Chemcor windshields debuted on the 1970 model year Javelins and AMXs built by American Motors Corporation (AMC).[9] As there were no mandatory safety standards for motor vehicle windshields, the larger automakers had no financial incentive to change from the cheaper existing products.[7][9] Corning terminated its windshield project in 1971, after it turned out to be one of the company's "biggest and most expensive failures."[9] However, like many Corning innovations, the unique process to manufacture this automotive glass was resurrected and is today the basis of their very profitable LCD glass business.
In the fall of 1970, the company announced that researchers Robert D. Maurer, Donald Keck, Peter C. Schultz, and Frank Zimar had demonstrated an optical fiber with a low optical attenuation of 17 dB per kilometer by doping silica glass with titanium. [10] A few years later they produced a fiber with only 4 dB/km, using germanium oxide as the core dopant. Such low attenuations made fiber optics practical for telecommunications and networking. Corning became the world's leading manufacturer of optical fiber.
In 1977, considerable attention was given to Corning's Z Glass project. Z Glass was a product used in television picture tubes. Due to a number of factors, the exact nature of which are subject to dispute, this project was considered a steep loss in profit and productivity. The following year the project made a partial recovery. This incident has been cited as a case study by the Harvard School of Business.[11]
Company profits soared in the late 1990s during the dot-com boom, and Corning expanded its fiber operations significantly with several new plants. The company also entered the photonics market, investing heavily with the intent of becoming the leading provider of complete fiber-optic systems. Failure to succeed in photonics and the collapse in 2000 of the dot-com market had a major impact on the company, and Corning stock plummeted to $1 per share. However, as of 2007[update] the company had posted five straight years of improving financial performance.
Current technologies[edit]

The turning point for Corning came when Apple approached it to develop a screen solution for its upcoming phone model, the iPhone. Eventually, all the major Android vendors also adopted its Gorilla glass screen.[citation needed] In 2011 Corning announced the expansion of existing facilities and the construction of a Gen 10 facility co-located with the Sharp Corporation manufacturing complex in Sakai, Osaka, Japan.[12] The LCD glass substrate is produced without heavy metals. Corning is a leading manufacturer of the glass used in liquid crystal displays[citation needed].
The company continues to produce optical fiber and cable for the communications industry at its Wilmington and Concord plants in North Carolina. It is also a major manufacturer of ceramic emission control devices for catalytic converters in cars and light trucks that use gasoline engines. The company is also investing in the production of ceramic emission control products for diesel engines as a result of tighter emission standards for those engines both in the U.S. and abroad.
In 2007 Corning introduced an optic fiber, ClearCurve, which uses nanostructure technology to facilitate the small radius bending found in FTTX installations.




Corning's Gorilla Glass is used on the Nokia N8's screen


Gorilla Glass, an outgrowth of the 1960s Chemcor project, is a high-strength alkali-aluminosilicate thin sheet glass used as a protective cover glass offering scratch resistance and durability in many handheld devices with touchscreens, went on sale in 2008.[13] According to the book "Steve Jobs" by Walter Isaacson, Gorilla Glass was used in the first iPhone released in 2007.[14]
On October 25, 2011 Corning unveiled Lotus Glass, an environmentally friendly and high-performance glass developed for OLED and LCD displays.[15][16]
Corning invests about 10% of revenue in research and development, and has allocated US$300 million towards further expansion of its Sullivan Park research facility near headquarters in Corning, New York.[17]
Corning Incorporated also manufactures a high-purity fused silica employed in microlithography systems, a low expansion glass utilized in the construction of reflective mirror blanks, windows for U.S. space shuttles, and Steuben art glass. The number of Corning facilities still employing the traditional tanks of molten glass has declined over the years, but it maintains the capacity to supply bulk or finished glass of many types.
Corning is engaged in research and development on green lasers, mercury abatement, microreactors, photovoltaics, and silicon on glass. Through its Life Sciences division, the company offers products to support life science research, including stem-cell culture products.[18]
Other activities[edit]
Corning employs roughly 34,000 people worldwide and had sales of $10.217 billion in 2014.[1] The company has been listed for many years among Fortune magazine's 500 largest companies, and was ranked #297 in 2015.
Although the company has long been publicly owned, James R. Houghton, great-great-grandson of the founder, served as chairman of the board of directors from 2001 to 2007. Over the years Houghton family ownership has declined to about 2%. Wendell P. Weeks has been with the company since 1983 and as of March 2013[update] was chairman, chief executive officer, and president.[19]
Over its 160-year history Corning invented a process for rapid and inexpensive production of light bulbs, including developing the glass for Thomas Edison's light bulb. Corning was the glass supplier for lightbulbs for General Electric after Edison General Electric merged with Thomson-Houston Electric Company in 1892.[20] It was an early major manufacturer of glass panels and funnels for television tubes, invented and produced Vycor (high temperature glass with high thermal shock resistance). Corning invented and produced Pyrex, CorningWare Pyroceram glass-ceramic cookware, and Corelle durable glass dinnerware. Corning manufactured the windows for US manned space vehicles, and supplied the glass blank for the primary mirror in the Hubble Space Telescope. Corning won the National Medal of Technology four times for its product and process innovations[21] [22] [23] .[24]
In July 2008 Corning announced the sale of Steuben Glass Works to Steuben Glass LLC, an affiliate of the private equity firm Schottenstein Stores Corporation. Steuben Glass had been unprofitable for more than a decade, losing 30 million dollars over the previous five years.[25]
In February 2011, Corning acquired MobileAccess Networks, an Israeli company that develops Distributed antenna systems, which are often used by universities, stadiums and airports to ensure seamless wireless coverage throughout a facility. MobileAccess Networks became part of Corning’s telecommunications business unit.[26]

Corning Incorporated is an American manufacturer of glass, ceramics, and related materials, primarily for industrial and scientific applications. The company was known as Corning Glass Works until 1989, when it changed its name to Corning Incorporated.[2] In 1998, Corning divested itself of its consumer lines of CorningWare and Corelle tableware and Pyrex and Visions cookware by selling the Corning Consumer Products division (now known as World Kitchen) to Borden, but still holds an interest of about 8%. As of 2014[update], Corning had five major business sectors: Display Technologies, Environmental Technologies, Life Sciences, Optical Communications, and Specialty Materials. Corning is involved in two joint ventures: Dow Corning and Pittsburgh Corning. Quest Diagnostics and Covance were spun off from Corning in 1996.[3] Corning is one of the main suppliers to Apple Inc. since working with Steve Jobs in 2007 to develop the iPhone.[4]

History[edit]




One of the first optic headlamp lenses, the Corning Conaphore. Selective yellow "Noviol" glass version shown.


Corning Glass Works was founded in 1851 by Amory Houghton, in Somerville, Massachusetts, originally as the Bay State Glass Co. It later moved to Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York, and operated as the Brooklyn Flint Glass Works. The company moved again to its ultimate home and namesake, the city of Corning, New York, in 1868 under leadership of the founder's son, Amory Houghton, Jr.
Over 147 years later, Corning continues to maintain its world headquarters at Corning, N.Y. The firm also established one of the first industrial research labs there in 1908. It continues to expand the nearby research and development facility, as well as operations associated with catalytic converters and diesel engine filter product lines. Corning has a long history of community development and has assured community leaders that it intends to remain headquartered in its small upstate New York hometown.[5]
The California Institute of Technology's 200-inch (5.1 m) telescope mirror at Palomar Observatory was cast by Corning during 1934–1936 out of low expansion borosilicate glass.[6] In 1932, George Ellery Hale approached Corning with the challenge of fabricating the required optic for his Palomar project. A previous effort to fabricate the optic from fused quartz had failed. Corning's first attempt was a failure, the cast blank having voids. Using lessons learned, Corning was successful in the casting of the second blank. After a year of cooling, during which it was almost lost to a flood, in 1935 the blank was completed. The first blank now resides in Corning's Museum of Glass.
In 1935, Corning formed a partnership with bottle maker Owens-Illinois, which formed the company known today as Owens Corning. Owens Corning was spun off as a separate company in 1938.




1917 advertisement for the Corning Conaphore headlamp lens shown above.


The company had a history of science-based innovations following World War II and the strategy by management was research and "disruptive" and "on demand" product innovation.[7]
In 1962 Corning developed Chemcor, a new toughened automobile windshield designed to be thinner and lighter than existing windshields, which reduced danger of personal injury by shattering into small granules when smashed.[8] This toughened glass had a chemically hardened outer layer, and its manufacture incorporated an ion exchange and a "fusion process" in special furnaces that Corning built in its Blacksburg, Virginia facility.[7][9] Corning developed it as an alternative to laminated windshields with the intention of becoming an automotive industry supplier.[7] After being installed as side glass in a limited run of 1968 Plymouth Barracudas and Dodge Darts, Chemcor windshields debuted on the 1970 model year Javelins and AMXs built by American Motors Corporation (AMC).[9] As there were no mandatory safety standards for motor vehicle windshields, the larger automakers had no financial incentive to change from the cheaper existing products.[7][9] Corning terminated its windshield project in 1971, after it turned out to be one of the company's "biggest and most expensive failures."[9] However, like many Corning innovations, the unique process to manufacture this automotive glass was resurrected and is today the basis of their very profitable LCD glass business.
In the fall of 1970, the company announced that researchers Robert D. Maurer, Donald Keck, Peter C. Schultz, and Frank Zimar had demonstrated an optical fiber with a low optical attenuation of 17 dB per kilometer by doping silica glass with titanium. [10] A few years later they produced a fiber with only 4 dB/km, using germanium oxide as the core dopant. Such low attenuations made fiber optics practical for telecommunications and networking. Corning became the world's leading manufacturer of optical fiber.
In 1977, considerable attention was given to Corning's Z Glass project. Z Glass was a product used in television picture tubes. Due to a number of factors, the exact nature of which are subject to dispute, this project was considered a steep loss in profit and productivity. The following year the project made a partial recovery. This incident has been cited as a case study by the Harvard School of Business.[11]
Company profits soared in the late 1990s during the dot-com boom, and Corning expanded its fiber operations significantly with several new plants. The company also entered the photonics market, investing heavily with the intent of becoming the leading provider of complete fiber-optic systems. Failure to succeed in photonics and the collapse in 2000 of the dot-com market had a major impact on the company, and Corning stock plummeted to $1 per share. However, as of 2007[update] the company had posted five straight years of improving financial performance.
Current technologies[edit]

The turning point for Corning came when Apple approached it to develop a screen solution for its upcoming phone model, the iPhone. Eventually, all the major Android vendors also adopted its Gorilla glass screen.[citation needed] In 2011 Corning announced the expansion of existing facilities and the construction of a Gen 10 facility co-located with the Sharp Corporation manufacturing complex in Sakai, Osaka, Japan.[12] The LCD glass substrate is produced without heavy metals. Corning is a leading manufacturer of the glass used in liquid crystal displays[citation needed].
The company continues to produce optical fiber and cable for the communications industry at its Wilmington and Concord plants in North Carolina. It is also a major manufacturer of ceramic emission control devices for catalytic converters in cars and light trucks that use gasoline engines. The company is also investing in the production of ceramic emission control products for diesel engines as a result of tighter emission standards for those engines both in the U.S. and abroad.
In 2007 Corning introduced an optic fiber, ClearCurve, which uses nanostructure technology to facilitate the small radius bending found in FTTX installations.




Corning's Gorilla Glass is used on the Nokia N8's screen


Gorilla Glass, an outgrowth of the 1960s Chemcor project, is a high-strength alkali-aluminosilicate thin sheet glass used as a protective cover glass offering scratch resistance and durability in many handheld devices with touchscreens, went on sale in 2008.[13] According to the book "Steve Jobs" by Walter Isaacson, Gorilla Glass was used in the first iPhone released in 2007.[14]
On October 25, 2011 Corning unveiled Lotus Glass, an environmentally friendly and high-performance glass developed for OLED and LCD displays.[15][16]
Corning invests about 10% of revenue in research and development, and has allocated US$300 million towards further expansion of its Sullivan Park research facility near headquarters in Corning, New York.[17]
Corning Incorporated also manufactures a high-purity fused silica employed in microlithography systems, a low expansion glass utilized in the construction of reflective mirror blanks, windows for U.S. space shuttles, and Steuben art glass. The number of Corning facilities still employing the traditional tanks of molten glass has declined over the years, but it maintains the capacity to supply bulk or finished glass of many types.
Corning is engaged in research and development on green lasers, mercury abatement, microreactors, photovoltaics, and silicon on glass. Through its Life Sciences division, the company offers products to support life science research, including stem-cell culture products.[18]
Other activities[edit]
Corning employs roughly 34,000 people worldwide and had sales of $10.217 billion in 2014.[1] The company has been listed for many years among Fortune magazine's 500 largest companies, and was ranked #297 in 2015.
Although the company has long been publicly owned, James R. Houghton, great-great-grandson of the founder, served as chairman of the board of directors from 2001 to 2007. Over the years Houghton family ownership has declined to about 2%. Wendell P. Weeks has been with the company since 1983 and as of March 2013[update] was chairman, chief executive officer, and president.[19]
Over its 160-year history Corning invented a process for rapid and inexpensive production of light bulbs, including developing the glass for Thomas Edison's light bulb. Corning was the glass supplier for lightbulbs for General Electric after Edison General Electric merged with Thomson-Houston Electric Company in 1892.[20] It was an early major manufacturer of glass panels and funnels for television tubes, invented and produced Vycor (high temperature glass with high thermal shock resistance). Corning invented and produced Pyrex, CorningWare Pyroceram glass-ceramic cookware, and Corelle durable glass dinnerware. Corning manufactured the windows for US manned space vehicles, and supplied the glass blank for the primary mirror in the Hubble Space Telescope. Corning won the National Medal of Technology four times for its product and process innovations[21] [22] [23] .[24]
In July 2008 Corning announced the sale of Steuben Glass Works to Steuben Glass LLC, an affiliate of the private equity firm Schottenstein Stores Corporation. Steuben Glass had been unprofitable for more than a decade, losing 30 million dollars over the previous five years.[25]
In February 2011, Corning acquired MobileAccess Networks, an Israeli company that develops Distributed antenna systems, which are often used by universities, stadiums and airports to ensure seamless wireless coverage throughout a facility. MobileAccess Networks became part of Corning’s telecommunications business unit.[26]

In 1962 Corning developed Chemcor, a new toughened automobile windshield designed to be thinner and lighter than existing windshields, which reduced danger of personal injury by shattering into small granules when smashed.[8] This toughened glass had a chemically hardened outer layer, and its manufacture incorporated an ion exchange and a "fusion process" in special furnaces that Corning built in its Blacksburg, Virginia facility.[7][9] Corning developed it as an alternative to laminated windshields with the intention of becoming an automotive industry supplier.[7] After being installed as side glass in a limited run of 1968 Plymouth Barracudas and Dodge Darts, Chemcor windshields debuted on the 1970 model year Javelins and AMXs built by American Motors Corporation (AMC).[9] As there were no mandatory safety standards for motor vehicle windshields, the larger automakers had no financial incentive to change from the cheaper existing products.[7][9] Corning terminated its windshield project in 1971, after it turned out to be one of the company's "biggest and most expensive failures."[9] However, like many Corning innovations, the unique process to manufacture this automotive glass was resurrected and is today the basis of their very profitable LCD glass business.
In the fall of 1970, the company announced that researchers Robert D. Maurer, Donald Keck, Peter C. Schultz, and Frank Zimar had demonstrated an optical fiber with a low optical attenuation of 17 dB per kilometer by doping silica glass with titanium. [10] A few years later they produced a fiber with only 4 dB/km, using germanium oxide as the core dopant. Such low attenuations made fiber optics practical for telecommunications and networking. Corning became the world's leading manufacturer of optical fiber.
In 1977, considerable attention was given to Corning's Z Glass project. Z Glass was a product used in television picture tubes. Due to a number of factors, the exact nature of which are subject to dispute, this project was considered a steep loss in profit and productivity. The following year the project made a partial recovery. This incident has been cited as a case study by the Harvard School of Business.[11]
Company profits soared in the late 1990s during the dot-com boom, and Corning expanded its fiber operations significantly with several new plants. The company also entered the photonics market, investing heavily with the intent of becoming the leading provider of complete fiber-optic systems. Failure to succeed in photonics and the collapse in 2000 of the dot-com market had a major impact on the company, and Corning stock plummeted to $1 per share. However, as of 2007[update] the company had posted five straight years of improving financial performance.

The turning point for Corning came when Apple approached it to develop a screen solution for its upcoming phone model, the iPhone. Eventually, all the major Android vendors also adopted its Gorilla glass screen.[citation needed] In 2011 Corning announced the expansion of existing facilities and the construction of a Gen 10 facility co-located with the Sharp Corporation manufacturing complex in Sakai, Osaka, Japan.[12] The LCD glass substrate is produced without heavy metals. Corning is a leading manufacturer of the glass used in liquid crystal displays[citation needed].
The company continues to produce optical fiber and cable for the communications industry at its Wilmington and Concord plants in North Carolina. It is also a major manufacturer of ceramic emission control devices for catalytic converters in cars and light trucks that use gasoline engines. The company is also investing in the production of ceramic emission control products for diesel engines as a result of tighter emission standards for those engines both in the U.S. and abroad.
In 2007 Corning introduced an optic fiber, ClearCurve, which uses nanostructure technology to facilitate the small radius bending found in FTTX installations.




Corning's Gorilla Glass is used on the Nokia N8's screen


Gorilla Glass, an outgrowth of the 1960s Chemcor project, is a high-strength alkali-aluminosilicate thin sheet glass used as a protective cover glass offering scratch resistance and durability in many handheld devices with touchscreens, went on sale in 2008.[13] According to the book "Steve Jobs" by Walter Isaacson, Gorilla Glass was used in the first iPhone released in 2007.[14]
On October 25, 2011 Corning unveiled Lotus Glass, an environmentally friendly and high-performance glass developed for OLED and LCD displays.[15][16]
Corning invests about 10% of revenue in research and development, and has allocated US$300 million towards further expansion of its Sullivan Park research facility near headquarters in Corning, New York.[17]
Corning Incorporated also manufactures a high-purity fused silica employed in microlithography systems, a low expansion glass utilized in the construction of reflective mirror blanks, windows for U.S. space shuttles, and Steuben art glass. The number of Corning facilities still employing the traditional tanks of molten glass has declined over the years, but it maintains the capacity to supply bulk or finished glass of many types.
Corning is engaged in research and development on green lasers, mercury abatement, microreactors, photovoltaics, and silicon on glass. Through its Life Sciences division, the company offers products to support life science research, including stem-cell culture products.[18]
Other activities[edit]
Corning employs roughly 34,000 people worldwide and had sales of $10.217 billion in 2014.[1] The company has been listed for many years among Fortune magazine's 500 largest companies, and was ranked #297 in 2015.
Although the company has long been publicly owned, James R. Houghton, great-great-grandson of the founder, served as chairman of the board of directors from 2001 to 2007. Over the years Houghton family ownership has declined to about 2%. Wendell P. Weeks has been with the company since 1983 and as of March 2013[update] was chairman, chief executive officer, and president.[19]
Over its 160-year history Corning invented a process for rapid and inexpensive production of light bulbs, including developing the glass for Thomas Edison's light bulb. Corning was the glass supplier for lightbulbs for General Electric after Edison General Electric merged with Thomson-Houston Electric Company in 1892.[20] It was an early major manufacturer of glass panels and funnels for television tubes, invented and produced Vycor (high temperature glass with high thermal shock resistance). Corning invented and produced Pyrex, CorningWare Pyroceram glass-ceramic cookware, and Corelle durable glass dinnerware. Corning manufactured the windows for US manned space vehicles, and supplied the glass blank for the primary mirror in the Hubble Space Telescope. Corning won the National Medal of Technology four times for its product and process innovations[21] [22] [23] .[24]
In July 2008 Corning announced the sale of Steuben Glass Works to Steuben Glass LLC, an affiliate of the private equity firm Schottenstein Stores Corporation. Steuben Glass had been unprofitable for more than a decade, losing 30 million dollars over the previous five years.[25]
In February 2011, Corning acquired MobileAccess Networks, an Israeli company that develops Distributed antenna systems, which are often used by universities, stadiums and airports to ensure seamless wireless coverage throughout a facility. MobileAccess Networks became part of Corning’s telecommunications business unit.[26]

ORGANIZATION OF INFORMATION


Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations ("MD&A") provides a historical and prospective narrative on the
Company's financial condition and results of operations.  This interim MD&A
should be read in conjunction with the MD&A in our 2016 Form 10-K. The various
sections of this MD&A contain a number of forward-looking statements that
involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Words such as "anticipates,"
"expects," "intends," "plans," "goals," "believes," "seeks," "estimates,"
"continues," "may," "will," "should," and variations of such words and similar
expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. In
addition, any statements that refer to projections of our future financial
performance, our anticipated growth and trends in our businesses, uncertain
events or assumptions, and other characterizations of future events or
circumstances are forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on our
current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors
described throughout this filing and particularly in "Risk Factors" in Part I,
Item 1A of our 2016 Form 10-K, and as may be updated in our Forms 10-Q. Our
actual results may differ materially, and these forward-looking statements do
not reflect the potential impact of any divestitures, mergers, acquisitions, or
other business combinations that had not been completed as of June 30, 2017.




Our MD&A includes the following sections:



 ·  Overview


 ·  Results of Operations


 ·  Core Performance Measures
 ·  Reportable Segments
 ·  Capital Resources and Liquidity
 ·  Critical Accounting Estimates


 ·  New Accounting Standards


 ·  Environment


 ·  Forward-Looking Statements




OVERVIEW



Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework




In October 2015, Corning announced a strategy and capital allocation framework
(the "Framework") that reflects the Company's financial and operational
strengths, as well as its ongoing commitment to increasing shareholder
value. The Framework outlines our leadership priorities, and articulates the
opportunities we see across our businesses. We designed the Framework to create
significant value for shareholders by focusing our portfolio and leveraging our
financial strength. Under our Framework we target generating $26 billion to $30
billion of cash through 2019, returning more than $12.5 billion to shareholders
and investing $10 billion to sustain our leadership positions and deliver
growth.



Our probability of success increases as we invest in our world-class
capabilities. Over the next two years, Corning will concentrate approximately
80% of its research, development and engineering investment and capital spending
on a cohesive set of three core technologies, four manufacturing and engineering
platforms, and five market-access platforms. This strategy will allow us to
quickly apply our talents and repurpose our assets as needed.




Summary of results for the three months and six months ending June 30, 2017




Net sales in the second quarter and first half of 2017 were $2,497 million and
$4,872 million, respectively, compared to $2,360 million and $4,407 million in
the same periods in 2016. The increase in both periods was driven by higher
sales in the Optical Communications and Specialty Materials segments. Optical
Communications segment sales increased $100 million and $309 million,
respectively, primarily due to higher sales of carrier network products in the
North American fiber-to-the-home market, combined with the absence of production
issues related to the implementation of new manufacturing software in the first
quarter of 2016. Specialty Materials segment sales increased $71 million and
$144 million, respectively, driven by higher sales of Corning Gorilla Glass and
advanced optics products.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


  Index



In the second quarter of 2017, we generated net income of $439 million or $0.42
per share, compared to net income of $2,207 million or $1.87 per share for the
same period in 2016. The decrease in net income of $1,768 million was primarily
driven by the following items (amounts presented after-tax):




 ·  The absence of a $2.7 billion non-taxable gain and $105 million positive tax
    adjustment on the strategic realignment of our ownership interest in Dow
    Corning recorded in the second quarter of 2016;
 ·  The absence of a gain of $25 million on the contribution of our equity
    interests in PCC and PCE as partial settlement of the asbestos litigation
    recorded in the second quarter of 2016;




Partially offsetting these events were the following items:
 ·  A  $896 million gain from a favorable change in the value of our translated
    earnings contracts;
 ·  A decrease of $120 million in selling, general and administrative expenses,
    driven primarily by the absence of acquisition-related costs related to the
    realignment of our equity interests in Dow Corning completed in the second
    quarter of 2016, and lower litigation, regulatory and other legal costs;
 ·  An increase of $24 million in net income in the Optical Communications segment,
    due to higher sales of carrier network products; and
 ·  An increase of $18 million in net income in the Specialty Materials segment,
    driven by an increase in Corning Gorilla Glass and advanced optics products.
The translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates,
including the impact of hedges realized in the current quarter, did not
materially impact Corning's consolidated net income in the three months ended
June 30, 2017 when compared to the same period in 2016.




In the first half of 2017, we generated net income of $525 million or $0.50 per
share, compared to net income of $1,839 million or $1.53 per share for the same
period in 2016. The decrease in net income of $1,314 million was primarily
driven by the items negatively impacting the second quarter described above,
offset partially by the following items (amounts presented after-tax):




 ·  A $1.2 billion gain from a favorable change in the value of our translated
    earnings contracts;
 ·  A decrease of $107 million in selling, general and administrative expenses,
    driven primarily by the absence of acquisition-related costs primarily related
    to the realignment of our equity interests in Dow Corning completed in the
    second quarter of 2016, and lower litigation, regulatory and other legal costs;
 ·  A decrease of approximately $50 million in restructuring, impairment and other
    charges;
 ·  An increase in net income of $89 million in the Optical Communications segment,
    due to higher sales of carrier and enterprise network products, combined with
    the absence of the production issues in the first half of 2016 related to the
    implementation of new software;
 ·  An increase in net income of $47 million in the Display Technologies segment,
    driven by an increase in volume slightly above 10% and lower selling, general
    and administrative expenses, offset somewhat by LCD glass price declines
    slightly above 10%; and
 ·  An increase in net income of $40 million in the Specialty Materials segment,
    driven by an increase in Corning Gorilla Glass and advanced optics products.
The translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates,
including the impact of hedges realized in the current quarter, did not
materially impact Corning's consolidated net income in the six months ended June
30, 2017 when compared to the same period in 2016.



2017 Corporate Outlook



In 2017, Corning will continue to advance its Framework initiatives. In the
Display Technologies segment, we expect the rate of growth in both retail market
and glass demand to be in the mid-single digit percentage. We believe the
full-year 2017 LCD glass pricing environment will be favorable and better than
last year, with expectations of price declines of approximately 10% or even
less.  In the Optical Communications segment, we anticipate sales to increase by
a low-teens percentage over 2016, with upside potential due to current timing of
customer projects; as a result, 2017 annual sales growth may reach the mid-teens
in percentage terms. In the Environmental Technologies segment, we expect sales
to be consistent to up slightly from 2016, driven by continued sales growth in
the auto market. We expect growth in the Specialty Materials segment, the amount
of which will depend on the timing and extent of customers deploying Gorilla
Glass 5 and other Corning innovations. In the Life Sciences segment, we expect
low-single digit sales growth, ahead of forecasted market growth rates.

For the three months ended June 30, 2017, net sales increased  by $137 million,
or 6%, when compared to the same period in 2016. The primary sales drivers by
segment were as follows:



 ·  A decrease of $53 million in the Display Technologies segment, driven by LCD
    glass price declines of approximately 10% and the negative impact from the
    weakening of the Japanese yen in the amount of $15 million, partially offset by
    an increase in volume in the high-single digits in percentage terms;
 ·  An increase of $100 million in the Optical Communications segment, due to
    higher sales of carrier network products in the North American
    fiber-to-the-home market;
 ·  An increase of $4 million in the Environmental Technologies segment, driven by
    an increase in automotive products;
 ·  An increase of $71 million in the Specialty Materials segment, driven by strong
    growth in sales of Corning Gorilla Glass products, combined with an increase in
    advanced optics products; and
 ·  An increase of $6 million in the Life Sciences segment, driven by higher sales
    in North America.




For the six months ended June 30, 2017, net sales increased by $465 million, or
11%, when compared to the same period in 2016. The primary sales drivers by
segment were as follows:
 ·  A decrease of $22 million in the Display Technologies segment, driven by LCD
    glass price declines slightly higher than 10%, partially offset by an increase
    in volume slightly higher than 10%;
 ·  An increase of $309 million in the Optical Communications segment, due to
    higher sales of carrier and enterprise network products, combined with the
    absence of production issues related to the implementation of new manufacturing
    software in the first half of 2016. Strong growth in the North American
    fiber-to-the-home market drove the increase in carrier network products;
 ·  An increase of $15 million in the Environmental Technologies segment, driven by
    higher sales of automotive products due to market strength in Europe, China and
 Asia. Lower sales of heavy-duty diesel products in North America partially
    offset this increase;
 ·  An increase of $144 million in the Specialty Materials segment, driven by
    strong growth in sales of Corning Gorilla Glass products, combined with an
    increase in advanced optics products; and
 ·  An increase of $12 million in the Life Sciences segment, driven by strong
    performance globally.




Movements in foreign exchange rates did not materially impact Corning's
consolidated net sales in the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 when
compared to the same periods in 2016.
Cost of Sales


The types of expenses included in the cost of sales line item are: raw materials
consumption, including direct and indirect materials; salaries, wages and
benefits; depreciation and amortization; production utilities;
production-related purchasing; warehousing (including receiving and inspection);
repairs and maintenance; inter-location inventory transfer costs; production and
warehousing facility property insurance; rent for production facilities; and
other production overhead.



Gross Margin

In the three months ended June 30, 2017, gross margin dollars increased when
compared to the same period last year, up $34 million, driven by higher sales
across the majority of our segments, but gross margin as a percent of sales
declined 1%, largely due to an increase of $19 million in asset write-offs and
other charges.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


  Index



In the six months ended June 30, 2017, gross margin dollars and gross margin as
a percent of sales increased when compared to the same period last year, up
$227 million, and 1%, respectively, driven primarily by higher sales in the
majority of our segments. Additionally, in the first half of 2017, gross margin
improved due to the absence of issues with a manufacturing software
implementation in the Optical Communications segment which limited our ability
to fulfill customer orders in the first half of 2016.




Selling, General and Administrative Expenses


When compared to the second quarter of 2016, selling, general and administrative
expenses decreased by $120 million, or 24%, in the three months ended June 30,
2017.    The significant decrease was due to the following items:




 ·  A decrease of $62 million in acquisition-related costs, due to the absence of
    costs related to the realignment of our equity interests in Dow Corning
    completed in the second quarter of 2016;
 ·  A decrease of $52 million in litigation, regulatory and other legal costs,
    driven by the absence of events which occurred in the second quarter of
    2016. In 2016, we recorded litigation and other expenses related to the
    resolution of an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice and costs for
    an environmental matter. Offsetting these amounts was the gain on the
    contribution of our equity interests in PCC and PCE as partial settlement of
    the asbestos litigation in the amount of $56 million; and
 ·  A decrease of $12 million in the mark-to-market of our defined benefit pension
    plans.




When compared to the first half of 2016, selling, general and administrative
expenses decreased by $107 million, or 13%, in the six months ended June 30,
2017.    The significant decrease was due to the following items:




 ·  A decrease of $62 million in acquisition-related costs, due to the absence of
    costs related to the realignment of our equity interests in Dow Corning
    completed in the second quarter of 2016;
 ·  A decrease of $64 million in litigation, regulatory and other legal costs,
    driven by the absence of events occurring in the second quarter of 2016. In
    this period, we recorded litigation and other expenses related to the
    resolution of an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice and an
    environmental matter. Offsetting these amounts was the gain on the contribution
    of our equity interests in PCC and PCE as partial settlement of the asbestos
    litigation in the amount of $56 million; and
 ·  A decrease of $19 million in the mark-to-market of our defined benefit pension
    plans.




The types of expenses included in the selling, general and administrative
expenses line item are: salaries, wages and benefits; stock-based compensation
expense; travel; sales commissions; professional fees; and depreciation and
amortization, utilities and rent for administrative facilities.
Research, Development and Engineering Expenses


For the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, research, development and
engineering expenses increased by $15 million, or 8%, and $25 million, or 7%,
respectively, when compared to the same periods last year, driven by higher
research and development costs for our emerging businesses, as well as an
increase in employee benefit expenses.  As a percentage of sales, these expenses
remained consistent in the second quarter, and decreased slightly in the first
half of 2017 when compared to the same period last year.

Income Before Income Taxes

In the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, the impact of fluctuations in
foreign exchange rates, including the impact of hedges realized in the current
quarter, did not materially impact Corning's consolidated income before income
taxes when compared to the same period in 2016.

 (78.4%)




For the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, the effective income tax rates
differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the following
items:
 ·  Rate differences on income (loss) of consolidated foreign companies;
 ·  The benefit of excess foreign tax credits resulting from the inclusion of
    foreign earnings in U.S. income; and
 ·  One-time tax-related adjustments.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the effective income tax rates
differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the following
items:
 ·  Rate differences on income (loss) of consolidated foreign companies;
 ·  The benefit of excess foreign tax credits resulting from the inclusion of
    foreign earnings in U.S. income;
 ·  The impact of equity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates reported in the
    financial statements, net of tax; and
 ·  The tax-free nature of the realignment of our equity interests in Dow Corning
    during the period, as well as the release of the deferred tax liability related
    to Corning's tax on Dow Corning's undistributed earnings as of the date of the
    transaction.

Comprehensive Income


For the three months ended June 30, 2017, comprehensive income decreased by
$2,211 million when compared to the same period in 2016, driven by the following
items:
 ·  The decrease in net income attributable to Corning Incorporated of
 $1,768 million;
 ·  The negative impact of the change in foreign currency translation gains and
    losses of $242 million, driven primarily by the Japanese yen; and
 ·  The negative impact of the change in the amount of unamortized gains and losses
    for postretirement benefit plans of $249 million, driven by the release in the
    second quarter of 2016 of unamortized actuarial losses as a result of the
    realignment of our equity interests in Dow Corning.

  Index



For the six months ended June 30, 2017, comprehensive income decreased by
$1,684 million, when compared to the same period in 2016, driven by the
following items:
 ·  The decrease in net income attributable to Corning Incorporated of
 $1,314 million;
 ·  The negative impact of the change in foreign currency translation gains and
    losses of $220 million driven primarily by the Japanese yen; and
 ·  The negative impact of the change in the amount of unamortized gains and losses
    for postretirement benefit plans of $248 million driven by the release in the
    second quarter of 2016 of unamortized actuarial losses as a result of the
    realignment of our equity interests in Dow Corning.




Offsetting these decreases was an increase in net unrealized gains on designated
hedges in the amount of $79 million.
Refer to Note 13 (Shareholders' Equity) to the consolidated financial statements
for additional information.




CORE PERFORMANCE MEASURES

In managing the Company and assessing our financial performance, we supplement
certain measures provided by our consolidated financial statements with measures
adjusted to exclude certain items, to arrive at core performance measures. We
believe that reporting core performance measures provides investors greater
transparency to the information used by our management team to make financial
and operational decisions. Corning has adopted the use of constant currency
reporting for the Japanese yen and South Korean won, and uses an internally
derived yen-to-dollar management rate of ¥99 and won-to-dollar management rate
of ?1,100.



Net sales, equity in earnings of affiliated companies and net income are
adjusted to exclude the impacts of changes in the Japanese yen and the South
Korean won, gains and losses on our foreign currency hedges related to
translated earnings, acquisition-related costs, discrete tax items,
restructuring and restructuring-related charges, certain litigation-related
expenses, pension mark-to-market adjustments and other items which do not
reflect on-going operating results of the Company or our equity
affiliates. Management's discussion and analysis on our reportable segments has
also been adjusted for these items, as appropriate. These measures are not
prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the
United States ("GAAP"). We believe investors should consider these non-GAAP
measures in evaluating our results as they are more indicative of our core
operating performance and how management evaluates our operational results and
trends. These measures are not, and should not be viewed as a substitute for,
GAAP reporting measures. With respect to the Company's outlooks for future
periods, it is not able to provide reconciliations for these non-GAAP measures
because the Company does not forecast the movement of the Japanese yen and South
Korean won against the U.S. dollar, or other items that do not reflect ongoing
operations, nor does it forecast items that have not yet occurred or are out of
the Company's control. As a result, the Company is unable to provide outlook
information on a GAAP basis.



See "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" for details on core performance
measures. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP performance measures to their most
directly comparable GAAP financial measure, please see "Reconciliation of
Non-GAAP Measures" below.

Core net sales increased by $150 million and $464 million in the three and six
months ended June 30, 2017, when compared to the same periods in 2016. In all
segments except Display Technologies, core net sales are consistent with GAAP
net sales. Because a significant portion of revenues in the Display Technologies
segment are denominated in Japanese yen, this segment's net sales are adjusted
to remove the impact of translating yen into dollars.



When compared to the second quarter of 2016, core net sales in the Display
Technologies segment decreased by $39 million, or 4%, in the second quarter of
2017, driven by LCD glass price declines of approximately 10%, partially offset
by an increase in volume in the high-single digits in percentage terms.    When
compared to the first six months of 2016, core net sales in the Display
Technologies segment decreased by $22 million, or 1%, in the same period in
2017, driven by LCD glass price declines of slightly higher than 10%, partially
offset by an increase in volume slightly higher than 10%.

 (2)  Results for 2016 include gross equity earnings for HSG from May 31, 2016, the
      date of the realignment of our ownership interest in Dow Corning, through
      June 30, 2016.




Core Earnings

In the three months ended June 30, 2017, we generated core earnings of
$431 million or $0.42 per share, consistent with core earnings generated in the
second quarter of 2016 of  $434 million, or $0.37 per share.  The absence of the
equity earnings from Dow Corning's silicones business due to our 2016
realignment of our ownership interest in Dow Corning was offset by higher core
earnings in the Optical Communications and Specialty Materials segments.  The
increase in earnings per share was driven by lower weighted average shares
outstanding due to repurchases of our common stock.



In the six months ended June 30, 2017, we generated core earnings of
$838 million or $0.80 per share, compared to core earnings generated in the six
months ended June 30, 2016 of $774 million, or $0.64 per share. The increase of
$64 million was driven by the following items:




 ·  An increase in net income of $89 million in the Optical Communications segment,
    due to higher sales of carrier and enterprise network products, combined with
    the absence of the production issues in the first half of 2016 related to the
    implementation of new software;
 ·  An increase in net income of $36 million in the Display Technologies segment,
    driven by an increase in volume slightly higher than 10% and lower selling,
    general and administrative expenses, offset somewhat by LCD glass price
    declines slightly above 10%; and
 ·  An increase in net income of $26 million in the Specialty Materials segment,

    driven by an increase in Corning Gorilla Glass and advanced optics products.

Offsetting these increases was the absence of the equity earnings from Dow
Corning's silicones business due to our 2016 realignment of our ownership
interest in Dow Corning.
Included in core earnings for the three months and six months ended June 30,
2017 is net periodic pension expense in the amounts of $12 million and
$25 million, respectively, and for the same periods in 2016, $13 and $25
million, respectively.  Refer to Note 9 (Employee Retirement Plans) to the

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures


We utilize certain financial measures and key performance indicators that are
not calculated in accordance with GAAP to assess our financial and operating
performance.  A non-GAAP financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of
a company's financial performance that (i) excludes amounts, or is subject to
adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the
comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the
statement of income or statement of cash flows, or (ii) includes amounts, or is
subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are
excluded from the comparable measure as calculated and presented in accordance
with GAAP in the statement of income or statement of cash flows.



Core net sales, core equity in earnings of affiliated companies and core
earnings are non-GAAP financial measures utilized by our management to analyze
financial performance without the impact of items that are driven by general
economic conditions and events that do not reflect the underlying fundamentals
and trends in the Company's operations.

Items which we exclude from GAAP measures to arrive at core performance measures
are as follows:
(1)  Constant-currency adjustments:
     Constant-yen: Because a significant portion of Display Technologies segment
     revenues and manufacturing costs are denominated in Japanese yen,
     management believes it is important to understand the impact on core
     earnings of translating yen into dollars. Presenting results on a
     constant-yen basis mitigates the translation impact of the Japanese yen,
     and allows management to evaluate performance period over period, analyze
     underlying trends in our businesses, and establish operational goals and
     forecasts. As of January 1, 2015, we used an internally derived management
     rate of ¥99, which is closely aligned to our current yen portfolio of
     foreign currency hedges, and have recast all periods presented based on
     this rate in order to effectively remove the impact of changes in the
     Japanese yen.
     Constant-won: Because a significant portion of Corning Precision Materials'
     costs are denominated in South Korean won, management believes it is
     important to understand the impact on core earnings from translating won
     into dollars. Presenting results on a constant-won basis mitigates the
     translation impact of the South Korean won, and allows management to
     evaluate performance period over period, analyze underlying trends in our
     businesses, and establish operational goals and forecasts without the
     variability caused by the fluctuations caused by changes in the rate of
     this currency. We use an internally derived management rate of ?1,100,
     which is consistent with historical prior period averages of the won.
(2)  Translated earnings contract loss: We have excluded the impact of the gains
     and losses of our foreign currency hedges related to translated earnings
     for each period presented.
(3)  Acquisition-related costs: These expenses include intangible amortization,
     inventory valuation adjustments and external acquisition-related deal
     costs.
(4)  Discrete tax items and other tax-related adjustments: This represents the
     removal of discrete adjustments attributable to changes in tax law and
     changes in judgment about the realizability of certain deferred tax assets,
     as well as other non-operational tax-related adjustments.
(5)  Litigation, regulatory and other legal matters: Includes amounts related to

     legal matters.
(6)  Restructuring, impairment and other charges: This amount includes

     restructuring, impairment and other charges, including goodwill impairment
     charges and other expenses and disposal costs not classified as
     restructuring expense.
(7)  Equity in earnings of affiliated companies: These adjustments relate to
     items which do not reflect expected on-going operating results of our
     affiliated companies, such as restructuring, impairment and other charges
     and settlements under "take-or-pay" contracts.
(8)  Impacts from the acquisition of Samsung Corning Precision Materials:  This
     amount primarily represents the fair value adjustments to the indemnity
     asset related to contingent consideration.
(9)  Pension mark-to-market adjustment: Defined benefit mark-to-market gains and
     losses, which arise from changes in actuarial assumptions and the
     difference between actual and expected returns on plan assets and discount
     rates.
(10) Gain on realignment of equity investment: Gain recorded upon the completion
     of the strategic realignment of our ownership interest in Dow Corning.
(11) Taiwan power outage: Impact of the power outage that temporarily halted
     production at our Tainan, Taiwan manufacturing location in the second
     quarter of 2016. The impact includes asset write-offs and charges for
     facility repairs, offset somewhat by partial reimbursement through our
     insurance program.

REPORTABLE SEGMENTS



Our reportable segments are as follows:
 ·  Display Technologies - manufactures glass substrates primarily for flat panel
    liquid crystal displays.
 ·  Optical Communications - manufactures carrier and enterprise network components
    for the telecommunications industry.
 ·  Environmental Technologies - manufactures ceramic substrates and filters for
    automotive and diesel emission control applications.
 ·  Specialty Materials - manufactures products that provide more than 150 material
    formulations for glass, glass ceramics and fluoride crystals to meet demand for
    unique customer needs.
 ·  Life Sciences - manufactures glass and plastic labware, equipment, media and
    reagents enabling workflow solutions for scientific applications.




All other segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate
reporting have been grouped as "All Other." This group is primarily comprised of
the results of Corning's Pharmaceutical Technologies business and new product
lines and development projects, as well as certain corporate investments such as
Eurokera and Keraglass equity affiliates.



We prepared the financial results for our reportable segments on a basis that is
consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial
information to assist in making internal operating decisions. We included the
earnings of equity affiliates that are closely associated with our reportable
segments in the respective segment's net income. We have allocated certain
common expenses among our reportable segments differently than we would for
stand-alone financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our
reportable segments include non-GAAP measures which are not prepared in
accordance with GAAP. We believe investors should consider these non-GAAP
measures in evaluating our results as they are more indicative of our core
operating performance and how management evaluates our operational results and
trends. These measures are not, and should not be viewed as a substitute for
GAAP reporting measures. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP performance measures
to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, please see
"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures" above. Segment net income may not be
consistent with measures used by other companies. The accounting policies of our
reportable segments are the same as those applied in the consolidated financial
statements.

As Reported

Net sales in the Display Technologies segment decreased by $53 million, or 7%,
in the second quarter of 2017 when compared to the second quarter of 2016. The
decrease was driven by LCD glass price declines of approximately 10% and the
negative impact from the weakening of the Japanese yen in the amount of
$15 million, partially offset by an increase in volume in the high-single digits
in percentage terms. Net income increased by $7 million, or 3%, driven by the
increase in volume, lower selling, general and administrative expenses and an
increase of $10 million in realized gains on our yen and won-denominated
currency hedges, offset slightly by the LCD price declines described above and
asset write-off expenses.



Net sales decreased by $22 million in the first half of 2017 when compared to
the same period in 2016, driven by price declines slightly higher than 10%,
offset partially by an increase in volume slightly higher than 10%. Net income
increased by $47 million, or 11%, driven by the volume increase described above
and a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses, offset partially
by price declines slightly higher than 10%.




Core Performance


When compared to the same periods in 2016, core net sales in the Display
Technologies segment decreased by $39 million, or 4%, and $22 million, or 1%, in
the second quarter and first half of 2017, respectively, driven by the price
declines described above. Core earnings increased in these periods,  up $3
million, or 1%, and $36 million, or 8%, respectively, driven by the increase in
volume and a decline in operating expenses, offset somewhat by the price
declines.



Outlook:

In the third quarter, we expect the LCD glass market and Corning's volume to
increase by a low single-digit percentage sequentially.   Sequential glass price
declines should be moderate and similar to the second-quarter sequential
decline.

As Reported

Net sales in the Optical Communications segment increased by $100 million, or
13%, in the second quarter of 2017, and $309 million, or 22%, in the first half
of 2017, when compared to the same periods in 2016. The increase was due to
higher sales of carrier network products in the North American fiber-to-the-home
market.



Net income in the second quarter and first six months of 2017 increased by
$24 million, or 31%,  and $89 million, or 95%, respectively, driven by the
increase in sales described above.  Movements in foreign exchange rates did not
materially impact net sales and net income in this segment in the three and six
months ended June 30, 2017 when compared to the same periods in 2016.




Core Performance
Core earnings increased in the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 by
$22 million, or 26%, and $89 million, or 79%, respectively, driven by the items
impacting the "As Reported" results described above.
Outlook:
In the third quarter, Corning expects Optical Communications sales to be up more
than 10% on a year-over-year basis.

As Reported

Net sales in the Environmental Technologies segment increased  $4 million, or
2%, in the second quarter of 2017 when compared to the same period in 2016,
driven by an increase in automotive products. Net sales in the first half of
2017 increased $15 million, or 3%, driven by higher sales of automotive products
due to market strength in Europe, China and Asia. Lower sales of heavy-duty
diesel products in North America partially offset this increase.  Movements in
foreign exchange rates negatively impacted net sales in this segment in the
three and six months ended June 30, 2017 by $4 million and $11 million,
respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2016.




Net income in the second quarter and first half of 2017 decreased by $5

 million, or 14%, and $8 million, or 11%, driven by expenses in support of new
product launches, and in the first half of 2017 by higher restructuring,
impairment and other charges. Movements in foreign exchange rates did not
materially impact net income in this segment in the three and six months ended
June 30, 2017 when compared to the same periods in 2016.




Core Performance


In the three and six months of 2017, core earnings decreased by $5 million, or
14%, and $5 million, or 7%, when compared to the same periods in 2016, driven by
the items impacting the "As Reported" results described above.




Outlook:


In the third quarter, the Company anticipates Environmental Technologies sales
will increase by a low single-digit percentage compared to the third quarter of
2016.

As Reported

Net sales in the Specialty Materials segment increased by $71 million, or 27%,
and $144 million, or 29%, in the second quarter and first half of 2017,
respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2016, driven by strong growth
in sales of Gorilla Glass products, combined with an increase in advanced optics
products. Net income in these periods increased by $18 million, or 47%, and $40
million, or 63%, due to the significant increase in sales and lower
restructuring charges, offset slightly by higher selling and administrative
costs. Movements in foreign exchange rates did not materially impact net sales
and net income in these periods when compared to the same periods in the prior
year.

Core Performance

Core earnings increased by $10 million, or 21%, and $26 million, or 33%, in the
three and six months ended June 30, 2017,  respectively, driven primarily by the
increase in sales of Corning Gorilla Glass and advanced optics products, offset
slightly by higher selling and administrative costs.

As Reported

Net sales in the Life Sciences segment increased by $6 million, or 3%,  and $12
million, or 3%, in the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, when compared
to the same periods in 2016, driven by higher sales in North America in the
second quarter, and strong performance globally in the first half of 2017.
Movements in foreign exchange rates negatively impacted net sales in this
segment in the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 by $3 million and $7
million, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2016.



Net income decreased by $3 million, or 18%, in the second quarter, driven by
higher restructuring, impairment and other charges and an increase in raw
material prices, and increased by $2 million, or 7%, in the six months ended
June 30, 2017, driven by an increase in volume and lower restructuring
expenses.  Movements in foreign exchange rates did not materially impact net
income in these periods when compared to the same periods in the prior year.



Core Performance

Core earnings decreased by $2 million or 10%, in the three months ended June 30,
2017 and remained consistent in the six months ended June 30, 2017.
Outlook:
For the third quarter, we expect low single-digit percentage sales growth
year-over-year.




All Other

All other segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate
reporting have been grouped as "All Other." This group is primarily comprised of
the results of Corning's Pharmaceutical Technologies business and new product
lines and development projects, as well as certain corporate investments such as
Eurokera and Keraglass equity affiliates.

Net sales of this segment increased by $9 million, or 24%, and $7 million, or
9%, in the second quarter and first half of 2017, respectively, when compared to
the same periods in 2016, driven by an increase in sales of non-LCD glass.  The
increase in the net loss in the second quarter of $3 million reflects higher
losses in our emerging innovation group and Corning's Pharmaceutical
Technologies business. The decrease of $29 million in the net loss in the first
half of 2017 reflects the absence of asset write-offs in emerging businesses
recorded in the first quarter of 2016 and higher net income in Corning Precision
Materials' non-LCD glass business.




CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY
Financing and Capital Resources
The following items impacted Corning's financing and capital structure in the
six months ended June 30, 2017:
2017
There were no significant items that impacted Corning's financing structure in
the six months ended June 30, 2017.
2016


On July 20, 2016, Corning's Board of Directors approved a $1 billion increase to
our commercial paper program, raising it to $2 billion. If needed, this program
is supported by our $2 billion revolving credit facility that expires in 2019.



Common Stock Dividends

On February 3, 2016, Corning's Board of Directors declared a 12.5% increase in
the Company's quarterly common stock dividend, which increased the quarterly
dividend from $0.12 to $0.135 per share of common stock, beginning with the
dividend paid in the first quarter of 2016.



On February 1, 2017, Corning's Board of Directors declared a 14.8% increase in
the Company's quarterly common stock dividend, which increased the quarterly
dividend from $0.135 to $0.155 per share of common stock, beginning with the
dividend paid in the first quarter of 2017.




Share Repurchase Program


In December 2016, Corning's Board of Directors approved a $4 billion share
repurchase program with no expiration (the "2016 Repurchase Program").  In the
second quarter of 2017, Corning entered into an accelerated share repurchase
agreement (the "2017 ASR agreement") under this program. Under the 2017 ASR
agreement, Corning paid $500 million for a total of 17.1 million shares.



In addition to the 2017 ASR agreement, during the three and six months ended
June 30, 2017, the Company repurchased 5.1 million and 20.4 million shares of
common stock on the open market for approximately $138.1 million and $546.4
million, respectively.




Refer to Note 13 (Shareholders' Equity) for additional information.
Capital Spending


Capital spending totaled $761 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017, an
increase of $228 million when compared to the six months ended June 30, 2016,
driven by capacity expansion projects in our Optical Communications segment. We
expect our 2017 capital expenditures to be approximately $1.5 billion, driven by
expansions related to the Gen 10.5 glass manufacturing facility in China, the
addition of capacity to support the new gas-particulate filters business in the
Environmental Technologies segment and investment to support growth in customer
demand in the Optical Communications and Specialty Materials segments.

Cash Flow

Summary of cash flow data (in millions):





                                                        Six months ended
                                                            June 30,
                                                        2017        2016
Net cash provided by operating activities             $    471$    455
Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities   $   (634)$  4,238
Net cash used in financing activities
                 $ (1,138)$ (2,135)




Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $16 million in the six
months ended June 30, 2017 when compared to the same period last year, driven
largely by an increase in dividends received from affiliated companies of
$47 million and higher net income in the Optical Communications, Display
Technologies and Specialty Materials segments, partially offset by a payment of
$70 million related to our obligation under the plan of reorganization for PCC
(refer to Note 2 (Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees) to the consolidated
financial statements for additional information).



Net cash used in investing activities increased by $4.9 billion in the six
months ended June 30, 2017, when compared to the same period last year, driven
by the absence of $4.8 billion of cash received in the second quarter of 2016 on
the realignment of Dow Corning, coupled with an increase of $228 million in
capital expenditures largely due to capacity expansion projects in our Optical
Communications segment and a decline of $92 million in liquidations of
short-term investments. A decline of $241 million in acquisition spending
partially offset these events.



Net cash used in financing activities in the six months ended June 30, 2017
decreased $997 million when compared to the same period last year, driven by
lower share repurchases, down $470 million, an increase of $225 million in
proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the absence of $294 million of
commercial paper and debt repayments made in the first half of 2016.

Management Assessment of Liquidity


We ended the second quarter of 2017 with approximately $4.2 billion of cash and
cash equivalents. Our cash and cash equivalents are held in various locations
throughout the world and generally are unrestricted. Although approximately 74%
of the consolidated amount was held outside of the United States at June 30,
2017, we have sufficient U.S. liquidity, including borrowing capacity, to fund
foreseeable U.S. cash needs without requiring the repatriation of foreign
cash. We utilize a variety of financing strategies to ensure that our worldwide
cash is available in the locations in which it is needed.



It is our policy to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates. To manage
interest rate exposure, the Company, from time to time, enters into interest
rate swap agreements. We are currently party to two interest rate swaps that are
designated as fair value hedges and economically exchange a notional amount of
$550 million of previously issued fixed rate long-term debt to floating rate
debt. Under the terms of the swap agreements, we pay the counterparty a floating
rate that is indexed to the one-month LIBOR rate.



Corning also has a $2 billion commercial paper program pursuant to which we may
issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes. Under this program, the
Company may issue the notes from time to time and will use the proceeds for
general corporate purposes. The Company's $2 billion unsecured revolving credit
facility is available to support obligations under the commercial paper program,
if needed. Corning did not have outstanding commercial paper at June 30, 2017
and December 31, 2016.



Other

We complete comprehensive reviews of our significant customers and their
creditworthiness by analyzing their financial strength at least annually or more
frequently for customers where we have identified a measure of increased
risk. We closely monitor payments and developments which may signal possible
customer credit issues. We currently have not identified any potential material
impact on our liquidity resulting from customer credit issues.



Our major source of funding for 2017 and beyond will be our operating cash flow,
our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents and proceeds from any
issuances of debt. We believe we have sufficient liquidity for the next several
years to fund operations, acquisitions, the asbestos litigation, capital
expenditures, scheduled debt repayments and dividend payments and share
repurchase programs.



Corning has access to a $2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility.  This
credit facility includes a leverage ratio financial covenant. The required
leverage ratio, which measures debt to total capital, is a maximum of 50%. At
June 30, 2017, our leverage using this measure was approximately 18% and we are
in compliance with the financial covenant.



Our debt instruments contain customary event of default provisions, which allow
the lenders the option of accelerating all obligations upon the occurrence of
certain events. In addition, some of our debt instruments contain a cross
default provision, whereby an uncured default in excess of a specified amount on
one debt obligation of the Company, also would be considered a default under the
terms of another debt instrument.    As of June 30, 2017, we were in compliance
with all such provisions.



Management is not aware of any known trends or any known demands, commitments,
events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to
result in a material decrease in our liquidity. In addition, other than items
discussed, there are no known material trends, favorable or unfavorable, in our
capital resources and no expected material changes in the mix and relative cost
of such resources.



Off Balance Sheet Arrangements


There have been no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in
our off balance sheet arrangements as disclosed in our 2016 Form 10-K under the
caption "Off Balance Sheet Arrangements."




Contractual Obligations


There have been no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in
the contractual obligations disclosed in our 2016 Form 10-K under the caption
"Contractual Obligations."



CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES



The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein. The estimates that require
management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments are described in
our 2016 Form 10-K and remain unchanged through the first six months of
2017. For certain items, additional details are provided below.




Impairment of Assets Held for Use


We are required to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived
assets when an indicator of impairment has been identified. We review our
long-lived assets in each quarter in which impairment indicators are present. We
must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred.

Manufacturing equipment includes certain components of production equipment that
are constructed of precious metals, primarily platinum and rhodium. These metals
are not depreciated because they have very low physical losses and are
repeatedly reclaimed and reused in our manufacturing process and have a very
long useful life. Precious metals are reviewed for impairment as part of our
assessment of long-lived assets. This review considers all of the Company's
precious metals that are either in place in the production process; in
reclamation, fabrication, or refinement in anticipation of re-use; or awaiting
use to support increased capacity. Precious metals are only acquired to support
our manufacturing operations and are not held for trading or other purposes.



At June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the carrying value of precious metals
was higher than the fair market value by $861 million and $890 million,
respectively. These precious metals are utilized by the Display Technologies and
Specialty Materials segments. Corning believes these precious metal assets to be
recoverable due to the significant positive cash flow in both segments. The
potential for impairment exists in the future if negative events significantly
decrease the cash flow of these segments. Such events include, but are not
limited to, a significant decrease in demand for products or a significant
decrease in profitability in our Display Technologies or Specialty Materials
segments.



NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS



Refer to Note 1 (Significant Accounting Policies) to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.




ENVIRONMENT



Corning has been named by the Environmental Protection Agency ("the Agency")
under the Superfund Act, or by state governments under similar state laws, as a
potentially responsible party for 16 active hazardous waste sites. Under the
Superfund Act, all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous
waste site, identified by the Agency, are jointly and severally liable for the
cost of cleanup unless the Agency agrees otherwise. It is Corning's policy to
accrue for its estimated liability related to Superfund sites and other
environmental liabilities related to property owned by Corning based on expert
analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants. At
June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, Corning had accrued approximately
$40 million (undiscounted) and $43 million (undiscounted), respectively, for the
estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation. Based upon
the information developed to date, management believes that the accrued reserve
is a reasonable estimate of the Company's liability and that the risk of an
additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote.

8-K, and related comments by management that are not historical facts or
information and contain words such as "will," "believe," "anticipate," "expect,"

forecasts, general economic conditions, its knowledge of its business, and key
performance indicators that impact the company, actual results could differ

forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to:

 -  availability and costs of critical components and materials;


 -  new product development and commercialization;

    cyber-attack, armed conflict, political or financial instability, natural
    disasters, or major health concerns;

    manufacturing expansions and pay their receivables when due;


 -  loss of significant customers;


 -  changes in tax laws and regulations;


 -  the potential impact of legislation, government regulations, and other
    government action and investigations; and


 -  other risks detailed in Corning's SEC filings.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  ORGANIZATION OF INFORMATION  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") provides a historical and prospective narrative on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. This interim MD&A should be read in conjunction with the MD&A in our 2016 Form 10-K. The various sections of this MD&A contain a number of forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Words such as "anticipates," "expects," "intends," "plans," "goals," "believes," "seeks," "estimates," "continues," "may," "will," "should," and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. In addition, any statements that refer to projections of our future financial performance, our anticipated growth and trends in our businesses, uncertain events or assumptions, and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this filing and particularly in "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of our 2016 Form 10-K, and as may be updated in our Forms 10-Q. Our actual results may differ materially, and these forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any divestitures, mergers, acquisitions, or other business combinations that had not been completed as of June 30, 2017.  Our MD&A includes the following sections:  � Overview  � Results of Operations  � Core Performance Measures  � Reportable Segments  � Capital Resources and Liquidity  � Critical Accounting Estimates  � New Accounting Standards  � Environment  � Forward-Looking Statements  OVERVIEW  Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework  In October 2015, Corning announced a strategy and capital allocation framework (the "Framework") that reflects the Company's financial and operational strengths, as well as its ongoing commitment to increasing shareholder value. The Framework outlines our leadership priorities, and articulates the opportunities we see across our businesses. We designed the Framework to create significant value for shareholders by focusing our portfolio and leveraging our financial strength. Under our Framework we target generating $26 billion to $30 billion of cash through 2019, returning more than $12.5 billion to shareholders and investing $10 billion to sustain our leadership positions and deliver growth.  Our probability of success increases as we invest in our world-class capabilities. Over the next two years, Corning will concentrate approximately 80% of its research, development and engineering investment and capital spending on a cohesive set of three core technologies, four manufacturing and engineering platforms, and five market-access platforms. This strategy will allow us to quickly apply our talents and repurpose our assets as needed.  Summary of results for the three months and six months ending June 30, 2017  Net sales in the second quarter and first half of 2017 were $2,497 million and $4,872 million, respectively, compared to $2,360 million and $4,407 million in the same periods in 2016. The increase in both periods was driven by higher sales in the Optical Communications and Specialty Materials segments. Optical Communications segment sales increased $100 million and $309 million, respectively, primarily due to higher sales of carrier network products in the North American fiber-to-the-home market, combined with the absence of production issues related to the implementation of new manufacturing software in the first quarter of 2016. Specialty Materials segment sales increased $71 million and $144 million, respectively, driven by higher sales of Corning Gorilla Glass and advanced optics products.  � 2017 Corning Incorporated. All Rights Reserved.  Index  In the second quarter of 2017, we generated net income of $439 million or $0.42 per share, compared to net income of $2,207 million or $1.87 per share for the same period in 2016. The decrease in net income of $1,768 million was primarily driven by the following items (amounts presented after-tax):  � The absence of a $2.7 billion non-taxable gain and $105 million positive tax adjustment on the strategic realignment of our ownership interest in Dow Corning recorded in the second quarter of 2016;  � The absence of a gain of $25 million on the contribution of our equity interests in PCC and PCE as partial settlement of the asbestos litigation recorded in the second quarter of 2016;  Partially offsetting these events were the following items:  � A $896 million gain from a favorable change in the value of our translated earnings contracts;  � A decrease of $120 million in selling, general and administrative expenses, driven primarily by the absence of acquisition-related costs related to the realignment of our equity interests in Dow Corning completed in the second quarter of 2016, and lower litigation, regulatory and other legal costs;  � An increase of $24 million in net income in the Optical Communications segment, due to higher sales of carrier network products; and  � An increase of $18 million in net income in the Specialty Materials segment, driven by an increase in Corning Gorilla Glass and advanced optics products.  The translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including the impact of hedges realized in the current quarter, did not materially impact Corning's consolidated net income in the three months ended June 30, 2017 when compared to the same period in 2016.  In the first half of 2017, we generated net income of $525 million or $0.50 per share, compared to net income of $1,839 million or $1.53 per share for the same period in 2016. The decrease in net income of $1,314 million was primarily driven by the items negatively impacting the second quarter described above, offset partially by the following items (amounts presented after-tax):  � A $1.2 billion gain from a favorable change in the value of our translated earnings contracts;  � A decrease of $107 million in selling, general and administrative expenses, driven primarily by the absence of acquisition-related costs primarily related to the realignment of our equity interests in Dow Corning completed in the second quarter of 2016, and lower litigation, regulatory and other legal costs;  � A decrease of approximately $50 million in restructuring, impairment and other charges;  � An increase in net income of $89 million in the Optical Communications segment, due to higher sales of carrier and enterprise network products, combined with the absence of the production issues in the first half of 2016 related to the implementation of new software;  � An increase in net income of $47 million in the Display Technologies segment, driven by an increase in volume slightly above 10% and lower selling, general and administrative expenses, offset somewhat by LCD glass price declines slightly above 10%; and  � An increase in net income of $40 million in the Specialty Materials segment, driven by an increase in Corning Gorilla Glass and advanced optics products.  The translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including the impact of hedges realized in the current quarter, did not materially impact Corning's consolidated net income in the six months ended June 30, 2017 when compared to the same period in 2016.  2017 Corporate Outlook  In 2017, Corning will continue to advance its Framework initiatives. In the Display Technologies segment, we expect the rate of growth in both retail market and glass demand to be in the mid-single digit percentage. We believe the full-year 2017 LCD glass pricing environment will be favorable and better than last year, with expectations of price declines of approximately 10% or even less. In the Optical Communications segment, we anticipate sales to increase by a low-teens percentage over 2016, with upside potential due to current timing of customer projects; as a result, 2017 annual sales growth may reach the mid-teens in percentage terms. In the Environmental Technologies segment, we expect sales to be consistent to up slightly from 2016, driven by continued sales growth in the auto market. We expect growth in the Specialty Materials segment, the amount of which will depend on the timing and extent of customers deploying Gorilla Glass 5 and other Corning innovations. In the Life Sciences segment, we expect low-single digit sales growth, ahead of forecasted market growth rates.  � 2017 Corning Incorporated. All Rights Reserved.

All Rights Reserved.  Index  Net Sales The following table presents net sales by reportable segment (in millions): Three months ended % Six months ended % June 30, change June 30, change 2017 2016 17 vs. 16 2017 2016 17 vs. 16 Display Technologies $ 748 $ 801 (7%) $ 1,484 $ 1,506 (1%) Optical Communications 882 782 13% 1,700 1,391 22% Environmental Technologies 263 259 2% 538 523 3% Specialty Materials 337 266 27% 637 493 29% Life Sciences 221 215 3% 431 419 3% All Other 46 37 24% 82 75 9% Total net sales $ 2,497 $ 2,360 6% $ 4,872 $ 4,407 11%  For the three months ended June 30, 2017, net sales increased by $137 million, or 6%, when compared to the same period in 2016. The primary sales drivers by segment were as follows:  � A decrease of $53 million in the Display Technologies segment, driven by LCD glass price declines of approximately 10% and the negative impact from the weakening of the Japanese yen in the amount of $15 million, partially offset by an increase in volume in the high-single digits in percentage terms;  � An increase of $100 million in the Optical Communications segment, due to higher sales of carrier network products in the North American fiber-to-the-home market;  � An increase of $4 million in the Environmental Technologies segment, driven by an increase in automotive products;  � An increase of $71 million in the Specialty Materials segment, driven by strong growth in sales of Corning Gorilla Glass products, combined with an increase in advanced optics products; and  � An increase of $6 million in the Life Sciences segment, driven by higher sales in North America.  For the six months ended June 30, 2017, net sales increased by $465 million, or 11%, when compared to the same period in 2016. The primary sales drivers by segment were as follows:  � A decrease of $22 million in the Display Technologies segment, driven by LCD glass price declines slightly higher than 10%, partially offset by an increase in volume slightly higher than 10%;  � An increase of $309 million in the Optical Communications segment, due to higher sales of carrier and enterprise network products, combined with the absence of production issues related to the implementation of new manufacturing software in the first half of 2016. Strong growth in the North American fiber-to-the-home market drove the increase in carrier network products;  � An increase of $15 million in the Environmental Technologies segment, driven by higher sales of automotive products due to market strength in Europe, China and Asia. Lower sales of heavy-duty diesel products in North America partially offset this increase;  � An increase of $144 million in the Specialty Materials segment, driven by strong growth in sales of Corning Gorilla Glass products, combined with an increase in advanced optics products; and  � An increase of $12 million in the Life Sciences segment, driven by strong performance globally.  Movements in foreign exchange rates did not materially impact Corning's consolidated net sales in the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 when compared to the same periods in 2016.  Cost of Sales  The types of expenses included in the cost of sales line item are: raw materials consumption, including direct and indirect materials; salaries, wages and benefits; depreciation and amortization; production utilities; production-related purchasing; warehousing (including receiving and inspection); repairs and maintenance; inter-location inventory transfer costs; production and warehousing facility property insurance; rent for production facilities; and other production overhead.  Gross Margin  In the three months ended June 30, 2017, gross margin dollars increased when compared to the same period last year, up $34 million, driven by higher sales across the majority of our segments, but gross margin as a percent of sales declined 1%, largely due to an increase of $19 million in asset write-offs and other charges.  � 2017 Corning Incorporated. All Rights Reserved.  Index  In the six months ended June 30, 2017, gross margin dollars and gross margin as a percent of sales increased when compared to the same period last year, up $227 million, and 1%, respectively, driven primarily by higher sales in the majority of our segments. Additionally, in the first half of 2017, gross margin improved due to the absence of issues with a manufacturing software implementation in the Optical Communications segment which limited our ability to fulfill customer orders in the first half of 2016.  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  When compared to the second quarter of 2016, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $120 million, or 24%, in the three months ended June 30, 2017. The significant decrease was due to the following items:  � A decrease of $62 million in acquisition-related costs, due to the absence of costs related to the realignment of our equity interests in Dow Corning completed in the second quarter of 2016;  � A decrease of $52 million in litigation, regulatory and other legal costs, driven by the absence of events which occurred in the second quarter of 2016. In 2016, we recorded litigation and other expenses related to the resolution of an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice and costs for an environmental matter. Offsetting these amounts was the gain on the contribution of our equity interests in PCC and PCE as partial settlement of the asbestos litigation in the amount of $56 million; and  � A decrease of $12 million in the mark-to-market of our defined benefit pension plans.  When compared to the first half of 2016, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $107 million, or 13%, in the six months ended June 30, 2017. The significant decrease was due to the following items:  � A decrease of $62 million in acquisition-related costs, due to the absence of costs related to the realignment of our equity interests in Dow Corning completed in the second quarter of 2016;  � A decrease of $64 million in litigation, regulatory and other legal costs, driven by the absence of events occurring in the second quarter of 2016. In this period, we recorded litigation and other expenses related to the resolution of an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice and an environmental matter. Offsetting these amounts was the gain on the contribution of our equity interests in PCC and PCE as partial settlement of the asbestos litigation in the amount of $56 million; and  � A decrease of $19 million in the mark-to-market of our defined benefit pension plans.  The types of expenses included in the selling, general and administrative expenses line item are: salaries, wages and benefits; stock-based compensation expense; travel; sales commissions; professional fees; and depreciation and amortization, utilities and rent for administrative facilities.  Research, Development and Engineering Expenses  For the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, research, development and engineering expenses increased by $15 million, or 8%, and $25 million, or 7%, respectively, when compared to the same periods last year, driven by higher research and development costs for our emerging businesses, as well as an increase in employee benefit expenses. As a percentage of sales, these expenses remained consistent in the second quarter, and decreased slightly in the first half of 2017 when compared to the same period last year.  Equity in Earnings of Affiliated Companies The following provides a summary of equity in earnings of affiliated companies (in millions): Three months ended Six months ended June 30, June 30, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Dow Corning Corporation (1) $ 26 $ $ 82 Hemlock Semiconductor Group (2) $ 31 22 110 22 All other 6 (7) 7 (4) Total equity earnings $ 37 $ 41 $ 117 $ 100  (1) Results include equity earnings of the silicones business and Hemlock Semiconductor business of Dow Corning.

Refer to Note 7 (Investments) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.  � 2017 Corning Incorporated. All Rights Reserved.  Index  Translated earnings contract gain (loss), net  Included in the line item Translated earnings contract gain (loss), net, is the impact of foreign currency hedges which hedge our translation exposure arising from movements in the Japanese yen, South Korean won, euro, New Taiwan dollar and Chinese yuan against the U.S. dollar and its impact on our net earnings. The following table provides detailed information on the impact of our translated earnings contract gains and losses:   Three Months Ended Three Months Ended Change June 30, 2017 June 30, 2016 2017 vs. 2016 Income Income Income before before before income Net income Net income Net (in millions) taxes income taxes income taxes income Hedges related to translated earnings: Realized gains, net $ 69 $ 44 $ 52 $ 33 $ 17 $ 11 Unrealized gains (losses), net 150 94 (1,253) (791) 1,403 885 Total translated earnings contract gains (losses), net $ 219 $ 138 $ (1,201) $ (758) $ 1,420 $ 896   Six Months Ended Six Months Ended Change June 30, 2017 June 30, 2016 2017 vs. 2016 Income Income Income before before before income Net income Net income Net (in millions) taxes income taxes income taxes income Hedges related to translated earnings: Realized gains, net $ 149 $ 94 $ 145 $ 92 $ 4 $ 2 Unrealized losses, net (368) (232) (2,203) (1,390) 1,835 1,158 Total translated earnings contract losses, net $ (219) $ (138) $ (2,058) $ (1,298) $ 1,839 $ 1,160  The gross notional value outstanding on our translated earnings contracts at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were as follows (in billions):   June 30, December 31, 2017 2016 Japanese yen-denominated hedges $ 13.1 $ 14.9 South Korean won-denominated hedges 0.5 1.2 Euro-denominated hedges 0.5 0.3 Chinese yuan-denominated hedges 0.2 0.3 Total gross notional value outstanding $ 14.3 $ 16.7  Income Before Income Taxes  In the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, including the impact of hedges realized in the current quarter, did not materially impact Corning's consolidated income before income taxes when compared to the same period in 2016.  � 2017 Corning Incorporated. All Rights Reserved.  Index  (Provision) benefit for Income Taxes  Our (provision) benefit for income taxes and the related effective income tax rates were as follows (in millions):   Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, June 30, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (Provision) benefit for income taxes $ (153) $ 504 $ (87) $ 808 Effective income tax rate (benefit) 25.8% (29.6%) 14.2% (78.4%)  For the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, the effective income tax rates differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the following items:  � Rate differences on income (loss) of consolidated foreign companies;  � The benefit of excess foreign tax credits resulting from the inclusion of foreign earnings in U.S. income; and  � One-time tax-related adjustments.  For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the effective income tax rates differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the following items:  � Rate differences on income (loss) of consolidated foreign companies;  � The benefit of excess foreign tax credits resulting from the inclusion of foreign earnings in U.S. income;  � The impact of equity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates reported in the financial statements, net of tax; and  � The tax-free nature of the realignment of our equity interests in Dow Corning during the period, as well as the release of the deferred tax liability related to Corning's tax on Dow Corning's undistributed earnings as of the date of the transaction.  Refer to Note 4 (Income Taxes) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.  Net Income Attributable to Corning Incorporated As a result of the items discussed above, our net income and per share data is as follows (in millions, except per share amounts): Three months ended Six months ended June 30, June 30, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net income attributable to Corning Incorporated $ 439 $ 2,207 $ 525 $ 1,839 Net income attributable to Corning Incorporated used in basic earnings per common share calculation (1) $ 415 $ 2,183 $ 476 $ 1,790 Net income attributable to Corning Incorporated used in diluted earnings per common share calculation (1) $ 439 $ 2,207 $ 525 $ 1,839 Basic earnings per common share $ 0.46 $ 2.06 $ 0.52 $ 1.66 Diluted earnings per common share $ 0.42 $ 1.87 $ 0.50 $ 1.53 . . .

The company was known as Corning Glass Works until 1989, when it changed its name to Corning Incorporated.[2] In 1998, Corning divested itself of its consumer lines of CorningWare and Corelle tableware and Pyrex and Visions cookware by selling the Corning Consumer Products division (now known as World Kitchen) to Borden, but still holds an interest of about 8%. As of 2014[update], Corning had five major business sectors: Display Technologies, Environmental Technologies, Life Sciences, Optical Communications, and Specialty Materials. Corning is involved in two joint ventures: Dow Corning and Pittsburgh Corning. Quest Diagnostics and Covance were spun off from Corning in 1996.[3] Corning is one of the main suppliers to Apple Inc. since working with Steve Jobs in 2007 to develop the iPhone.[4]

History[edit]




One of the first optic headlamp lenses, the Corning Conaphore. Selective yellow "Noviol" glass version shown.


Corning Glass Works was founded in 1851 by Amory Houghton, in Somerville, Massachusetts, originally as the Bay State Glass Co. It later moved to Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York, and operated as the Brooklyn Flint Glass Works. The company moved again to its ultimate home and namesake, the city of Corning, New York, in 1868 under leadership of the founder's son, Amory Houghton, Jr.
Over 147 years later, Corning continues to maintain its world headquarters at Corning, N.Y. The firm also established one of the first industrial research labs there in 1908. It continues to expand the nearby research and development facility, as well as operations associated with catalytic converters and diesel engine filter product lines. Corning has a long history of community development and has assured community leaders that it intends to remain headquartered in its small upstate New York hometown.[5]
The California Institute of Technology's 200-inch (5.1 m) telescope mirror at Palomar Observatory was cast by Corning during 1934–1936 out of low expansion borosilicate glass.[6] In 1932, George Ellery Hale approached Corning with the challenge of fabricating the required optic for his Palomar project. A previous effort to fabricate the optic from fused quartz had failed. Corning's first attempt was a failure, the cast blank having voids. Using lessons learned, Corning was successful in the casting of the second blank. After a year of cooling, during which it was almost lost to a flood, in 1935 the blank was completed. The first blank now resides in Corning's Museum of Glass.
In 1935, Corning formed a partnership with bottle maker Owens-Illinois, which formed the company known today as Owens Corning. Owens Corning was spun off as a separate company in 1938.




1917 advertisement for the Corning Conaphore headlamp lens shown above.


The company had a history of science-based innovations following World War II and the strategy by management was research and "disruptive" and "on demand" product innovation.[7]
In 1962 Corning developed Chemcor, a new toughened automobile windshield designed to be thinner and lighter than existing windshields, which reduced danger of personal injury by shattering into small granules when smashed.[8] This toughened glass had a chemically hardened outer layer, and its manufacture incorporated an ion exchange and a "fusion process" in special furnaces that Corning built in its Blacksburg, Virginia facility.[7][9] Corning developed it as an alternative to laminated windshields with the intention of becoming an automotive industry supplier.[7] After being installed as side glass in a limited run of 1968 Plymouth Barracudas and Dodge Darts, Chemcor windshields debuted on the 1970 model year Javelins and AMXs built by American Motors Corporation (AMC).[9] As there were no mandatory safety standards for motor vehicle windshields, the larger automakers had no financial incentive to change from the cheaper existing products.[7][9] Corning terminated its windshield project in 1971, after it turned out to be one of the company's "biggest and most expensive failures."[9] However, like many Corning innovations, the unique process to manufacture this automotive glass was resurrected and is today the basis of their very profitable LCD glass business.
In the fall of 1970, the company announced that researchers Robert D. Maurer, Donald Keck, Peter C. Schultz, and Frank Zimar had demonstrated an optical fiber with a low optical attenuation of 17 dB per kilometer by doping silica glass with titanium. [10] A few years later they produced a fiber with only 4 dB/km, using germanium oxide as the core dopant. Such low attenuations made fiber optics practical for telecommunications and networking. Corning became the world's leading manufacturer of optical fiber.
In 1977, considerable attention was given to Corning's Z Glass project. Z Glass was a product used in television picture tubes. Due to a number of factors, the exact nature of which are subject to dispute, this project was considered a steep loss in profit and productivity. The following year the project made a partial recovery. This incident has been cited as a case study by the Harvard School of Business.[11]
Company profits soared in the late 1990s during the dot-com boom, and Corning expanded its fiber operations significantly with several new plants. The company also entered the photonics market, investing heavily with the intent of becoming the leading provider of complete fiber-optic systems. Failure to succeed in photonics and the collapse in 2000 of the dot-com market had a major impact on the company, and Corning stock plummeted to $1 per share. However, as of 2007[update] the company had posted five straight years of improving financial performance.
Current technologies[edit]

The turning point for Corning came when Apple approached it to develop a screen solution for its upcoming phone model, the iPhone. Eventually, all the major Android vendors also adopted its Gorilla glass screen.[citation needed] In 2011 Corning announced the expansion of existing facilities and the construction of a Gen 10 facility co-located with the Sharp Corporation manufacturing complex in Sakai, Osaka, Japan.[12] The LCD glass substrate is produced without heavy metals. Corning is a leading manufacturer of the glass used in liquid crystal displays[citation needed].
The company continues to produce optical fiber and cable for the communications industry at its Wilmington and Concord plants in North Carolina. It is also a major manufacturer of ceramic emission control devices for catalytic converters in cars and light trucks that use gasoline engines. The company is also investing in the production of ceramic emission control products for diesel engines as a result of tighter emission standards for those engines both in the U.S. and abroad.
In 2007 Corning introduced an optic fiber, ClearCurve, which uses nanostructure technology to facilitate the small radius bending found in FTTX installations.




Corning's Gorilla Glass is used on the Nokia N8's screen


Gorilla Glass, an outgrowth of the 1960s Chemcor project, is a high-strength alkali-aluminosilicate thin sheet glass used as a protective cover glass offering scratch resistance and durability in many handheld devices with touchscreens, went on sale in 2008.[13] According to the book "Steve Jobs" by Walter Isaacson, Gorilla Glass was used in the first iPhone released in 2007.[14]
On October 25, 2011 Corning unveiled Lotus Glass, an environmentally friendly and high-performance glass developed for OLED and LCD displays.[15][16]
Corning invests about 10% of revenue in research and development, and has allocated US$300 million towards further expansion of its Sullivan Park research facility near headquarters in Corning, New York.[17]
Corning Incorporated also manufactures a high-purity fused silica employed in microlithography systems, a low expansion glass utilized in the construction of reflective mirror blanks, windows for U.S. space shuttles, and Steuben art glass. The number of Corning facilities still employing the traditional tanks of molten glass has declined over the years, but it maintains the capacity to supply bulk or finished glass of many types.
Corning is engaged in research and development on green lasers, mercury abatement, microreactors, photovoltaics, and silicon on glass. Through its Life Sciences division, the company offers products to support life science research, including stem-cell culture products.[18]
Other activities[edit]
Corning employs roughly 34,000 people worldwide and had sales of $10.217 billion in 2014.[1] The company has been listed for many years among Fortune magazine's 500 largest companies, and was ranked #297 in 2015.
Although the company has long been publicly owned, James R. Houghton, great-great-grandson of the founder, served as chairman of the board of directors from 2001 to 2007. Over the years Houghton family ownership has declined to about 2%. Wendell P. Weeks has been with the company since 1983 and as of March 2013[update] was chairman, chief executive officer, and president.[19]
Over its 160-year history Corning invented a process for rapid and inexpensive production of light bulbs, including developing the glass for Thomas Edison's light bulb. Corning was the glass supplier for lightbulbs for General Electric after Edison General Electric merged with Thomson-Houston Electric Company in 1892.[20] It was an early major manufacturer of glass panels and funnels for television tubes, invented and produced Vycor (high temperature glass with high thermal shock resistance). Corning invented and produced Pyrex, CorningWare Pyroceram glass-ceramic cookware, and Corelle durable glass dinnerware. Corning manufactured the windows for US manned space vehicles, and supplied the glass blank for the primary mirror in the Hubble Space Telescope. Corning won the National Medal of Technology four times for its product and process innovations[21] [22] [23] .[24]
In July 2008 Corning announced the sale of Steuben Glass Works to Steuben Glass LLC, an affiliate of the private equity firm Schottenstein Stores Corporation. Steuben Glass had been unprofitable for more than a decade, losing 30 million dollars over the previous five years.[25]
In February 2011, Corning acquired MobileAccess Networks, an Israeli company that develops Distributed antenna systems, which are often used by universities, stadiums and airports to ensure seamless wireless coverage throughout a facility. MobileAccess Networks became part of Corning’s telecommunications business unit.[26]

Corning Incorporated is an American manufacturer of glass, ceramics, and related materials, primarily for industrial and scientific applications. The company was known as Corning Glass Works until 1989, when it changed its name to Corning Incorporated.[2] In 1998, Corning divested itself of its consumer lines of CorningWare and Corelle tableware and Pyrex and Visions cookware by selling the Corning Consumer Products division (now known as World Kitchen) to Borden, but still holds an interest of about 8%. As of 2014[update], Corning had five major business sectors: Display Technologies, Environmental Technologies, Life Sciences, Optical Communications, and Specialty Materials. Corning is involved in two joint ventures: Dow Corning and Pittsburgh Corning. Quest Diagnostics and Covance were spun off from Corning in 1996.[3] Corning is one of the main suppliers to Apple Inc. since working with Steve Jobs in 2007 to develop the iPhone.[4]

History[edit]




One of the first optic headlamp lenses, the Corning Conaphore. Selective yellow "Noviol" glass version shown.


Corning Glass Works was founded in 1851 by Amory Houghton, in Somerville, Massachusetts, originally as the Bay State Glass Co. It later moved to Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York, and operated as the Brooklyn Flint Glass Works. The company moved again to its ultimate home and namesake, the city of Corning, New York, in 1868 under leadership of the founder's son, Amory Houghton, Jr.
Over 147 years later, Corning continues to maintain its world headquarters at Corning, N.Y. The firm also established one of the first industrial research labs there in 1908. It continues to expand the nearby research and development facility, as well as operations associated with catalytic converters and diesel engine filter product lines. Corning has a long history of community development and has assured community leaders that it intends to remain headquartered in its small upstate New York hometown.[5]
The California Institute of Technology's 200-inch (5.1 m) telescope mirror at Palomar Observatory was cast by Corning during 1934–1936 out of low expansion borosilicate glass.[6] In 1932, George Ellery Hale approached Corning with the challenge of fabricating the required optic for his Palomar project. A previous effort to fabricate the optic from fused quartz had failed. Corning's first attempt was a failure, the cast blank having voids. Using lessons learned, Corning was successful in the casting of the second blank. After a year of cooling, during which it was almost lost to a flood, in 1935 the blank was completed. The first blank now resides in Corning's Museum of Glass.
In 1935, Corning formed a partnership with bottle maker Owens-Illinois, which formed the company known today as Owens Corning. Owens Corning was spun off as a separate company in 1938.

The company had a history of science-based innovations following World War II and the strategy by management was research and "disruptive" and "on demand" product innovation.[7]
In 1962 Corning developed Chemcor, a new toughened automobile windshield designed to be thinner and lighter than existing windshields, which reduced danger of personal injury by shattering into small granules when smashed.[8] This toughened glass had a chemically hardened outer layer, and its manufacture incorporated an ion exchange and a "fusion process" in special furnaces that Corning built in its Blacksburg, Virginia facility.[7][9] Corning developed it as an alternative to laminated windshields with the intention of becoming an automotive industry supplier.[7] After being installed as side glass in a limited run of 1968 Plymouth Barracudas and Dodge Darts, Chemcor windshields debuted on the 1970 model year Javelins and AMXs built by American Motors Corporation (AMC).[9] As there were no mandatory safety standards for motor vehicle windshields, the larger automakers had no financial incentive to change from the cheaper existing products.[7][9] Corning terminated its windshield project in 1971, after it turned out to be one of the company's "biggest and most expensive failures."[9] However, like many Corning innovations, the unique process to manufacture this automotive glass was resurrected and is today the basis of their very profitable LCD glass business.
In the fall of 1970, the company announced that researchers Robert D. Maurer, Donald Keck, Peter C. Schultz, and Frank Zimar had demonstrated an optical fiber with a low optical attenuation of 17 dB per kilometer by doping silica glass with titanium. [10] A few years later they produced a fiber with only 4 dB/km, using germanium oxide as the core dopant. Such low attenuations made fiber optics practical for telecommunications and networking. Corning became the world's leading manufacturer of optical fiber.
In 1977, considerable attention was given to Corning's Z Glass project. Z Glass was a product used in television picture tubes. Due to a number of factors, the exact nature of which are subject to dispute, this project was considered a steep loss in profit and productivity. The following year the project made a partial recovery. This incident has been cited as a case study by the Harvard School of Business.[11]
Company profits soared in the late 1990s during the dot-com boom, and Corning expanded its fiber operations significantly with several new plants. The company also entered the photonics market, investing heavily with the intent of becoming the leading provider of complete fiber-optic systems. Failure to succeed in photonics and the collapse in 2000 of the dot-com market had a major impact on the company, and Corning stock plummeted to $1 per share. However, as of 2007[update] the company had posted five straight years of improving financial performance.

The turning point for Corning came when Apple approached it to develop a screen solution for its upcoming phone model, the iPhone. Eventually, all the major Android vendors also adopted its Gorilla glass screen.[citation needed] In 2011 Corning announced the expansion of existing facilities and the construction of a Gen 10 facility co-located with the Sharp Corporation manufacturing complex in Sakai, Osaka, Japan.[12] The LCD glass substrate is produced without heavy metals. Corning is a leading manufacturer of the glass used in liquid crystal displays[citation needed].
The company continues to produce optical fiber and cable for the communications industry at its Wilmington and Concord plants in North Carolina. It is also a major manufacturer of ceramic emission control devices for catalytic converters in cars and light trucks that use gasoline engines. The company is also investing in the production of ceramic emission control products for diesel engines as a result of tighter emission standards for those engines both in the U.S. and abroad.
In 2007 Corning introduced an optic fiber, ClearCurve, which uses nanostructure technology to facilitate the small radius bending found in FTTX installations.




Corning's Gorilla Glass is used on the Nokia N8's screen


Gorilla Glass, an outgrowth of the 1960s Chemcor project, is a high-strength alkali-aluminosilicate thin sheet glass used as a protective cover glass offering scratch resistance and durability in many handheld devices with touchscreens, went on sale in 2008.[13] According to the book "Steve Jobs" by Walter Isaacson, Gorilla Glass was used in the first iPhone released in 2007.[14]
On October 25, 2011 Corning unveiled Lotus Glass, an environmentally friendly and high-performance glass developed for OLED and LCD displays.[15][16]
Corning invests about 10% of revenue in research and development, and has allocated US$300 million towards further expansion of its Sullivan Park research facility near headquarters in Corning, New York.[17]
Corning Incorporated also manufactures a high-purity fused silica employed in microlithography systems, a low expansion glass utilized in the construction of reflective mirror blanks, windows for U.S. space shuttles, and Steuben art glass. The number of Corning facilities still employing the traditional tanks of molten glass has declined over the years, but it maintains the capacity to supply bulk or finished glass of many types.
Corning is engaged in research and development on green lasers, mercury abatement, microreactors, photovoltaics, and silicon on glass. Through its Life Sciences division, the company offers products to support life science research, including stem-cell culture products.[18]
Other activities[edit]
Corning employs roughly 34,000 people worldwide and had sales of $10.217 billion in 2014.[1] The company has been listed for many years among Fortune magazine's 500 largest companies, and was ranked #297 in 2015.
Although the company has long been publicly owned, James R. Houghton, great-great-grandson of the founder, served as chairman of the board of directors from 2001 to 2007. Over the years Houghton family ownership has declined to about 2%. Wendell P. Weeks has been with the company since 1983 and as of March 2013[update] was chairman, chief executive officer, and president.[19]
Over its 160-year history Corning invented a process for rapid and inexpensive production of light bulbs, including developing the glass for Thomas Edison's light bulb. Corning was the glass supplier for lightbulbs for General Electric after Edison General Electric merged with Thomson-Houston Electric Company in 1892.[20] It was an early major manufacturer of glass panels and funnels for television tubes, invented and produced Vycor (high temperature glass with high thermal shock resistance). Corning invented and produced Pyrex, CorningWare Pyroceram glass-ceramic cookware, and Corelle durable glass dinnerware. Corning manufactured the windows for US manned space vehicles, and supplied the glass blank for the primary mirror in the Hubble Space Telescope. Corning won the National Medal of Technology four times for its product and process innovations[21] [22] [23] .[24]
In July 2008 Corning announced the sale of Steuben Glass Works to Steuben Glass LLC, an affiliate of the private equity firm Schottenstein Stores Corporation. Steuben Glass had been unprofitable for more than a decade, losing 30 million dollars over the previous five years.[25]
In February 2011, Corning acquired MobileAccess Networks, an Israeli company that develops Distributed antenna systems, which are often used by universities, stadiums and airports to ensure seamless wireless coverage throughout a facility. MobileAccess Networks became part of Corning’s telecommunications business unit.[26]

Corning Incorporated is an American manufacturer of glass, ceramics, and related materials, primarily for industrial and scientific applications. The company was known as Corning Glass Works until 1989, when it changed its name to Corning Incorporated.[2] In 1998, Corning divested itself of its consumer lines of CorningWare and Corelle tableware and Pyrex and Visions cookware by selling the Corning Consumer Products division (now known as World Kitchen) to Borden, but still holds an interest of about 8%. As of 2014[update], Corning had five major business sectors: Display Technologies, Environmental Technologies, Life Sciences, Optical Communications, and Specialty Materials. Corning is involved in two joint ventures: Dow Corning and Pittsburgh Corning. Quest Diagnostics and Covance were spun off from Corning in 1996.[3] Corning is one of the main suppliers to Apple Inc. since working with Steve Jobs in 2007 to develop the iPhone.[4]

History[edit]




One of the first optic headlamp lenses, the Corning Conaphore. Selective yellow "Noviol" glass version shown.


Corning Glass Works was founded in 1851 by Amory Houghton, in Somerville, Massachusetts, originally as the Bay State Glass Co. It later moved to Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York, and operated as the Brooklyn Flint Glass Works. The company moved again to its ultimate home and namesake, the city of Corning, New York, in 1868 under leadership of the founder's son, Amory Houghton, Jr.
Over 147 years later, Corning continues to maintain its world headquarters at Corning, N.Y. The firm also established one of the first industrial research labs there in 1908. It continues to expand the nearby research and development facility, as well as operations associated with catalytic converters and diesel engine filter product lines. Corning has a long history of community development and has assured community leaders that it intends to remain headquartered in its small upstate New York hometown.[5]
The California Institute of Technology's 200-inch (5.1 m) telescope mirror at Palomar Observatory was cast by Corning during 1934–1936 out of low expansion borosilicate glass.[6] In 1932, George Ellery Hale approached Corning with the challenge of fabricating the required optic for his Palomar project. A previous effort to fabricate the optic from fused quartz had failed. Corning's first attempt was a failure, the cast blank having voids. Using lessons learned, Corning was successful in the casting of the second blank. After a year of cooling, during which it was almost lost to a flood, in 1935 the blank was completed. The first blank now resides in Corning's Museum of Glass.
In 1935, Corning formed a partnership with bottle maker Owens-Illinois, which formed the company known today as Owens Corning. Owens Corning was spun off as a separate company in 1938.




1917 advertisement for the Corning Conaphore headlamp lens shown above.


The company had a history of science-based innovations following World War II and the strategy by management was research and "disruptive" and "on demand" product innovation.[7]
In 1962 Corning developed Chemcor, a new toughened automobile windshield designed to be thinner and lighter than existing windshields, which reduced danger of personal injury by shattering into small granules when smashed.[8] This toughened glass had a chemically hardened outer layer, and its manufacture incorporated an ion exchange and a "fusion process" in special furnaces that Corning built in its Blacksburg, Virginia facility.[7][9] Corning developed it as an alternative to laminated windshields with the intention of becoming an automotive industry supplier.[7] After being installed as side glass in a limited run of 1968 Plymouth Barracudas and Dodge Darts, Chemcor windshields debuted on the 1970 model year Javelins and AMXs built by American Motors Corporation (AMC).[9] As there were no mandatory safety standards for motor vehicle windshields, the larger automakers had no financial incentive to change from the cheaper existing products.[7][9] Corning terminated its windshield project in 1971, after it turned out to be one of the company's "biggest and most expensive failures."[9] However, like many Corning innovations, the unique process to manufacture this automotive glass was resurrected and is today the basis of their very profitable LCD glass business.
In the fall of 1970, the company announced that researchers Robert D. Maurer, Donald Keck, Peter C. Schultz, and Frank Zimar had demonstrated an optical fiber with a low optical attenuation of 17 dB per kilometer by doping silica glass with titanium. [10] A few years later they produced a fiber with only 4 dB/km, using germanium oxide as the core dopant. Such low attenuations made fiber optics practical for telecommunications and networking. Corning became the world's leading manufacturer of optical fiber.
In 1977, considerable attention was given to Corning's Z Glass project. Z Glass was a product used in television picture tubes. Due to a number of factors, the exact nature of which are subject to dispute, this project was considered a steep loss in profit and productivity. The following year the project made a partial recovery. This incident has been cited as a case study by the Harvard School of Business.[11]
Company profits soared in the late 1990s during the dot-com boom, and Corning expanded its fiber operations significantly with several new plants. The company also entered the photonics market, investing heavily with the intent of becoming the leading provider of complete fiber-optic systems. Failure to succeed in photonics and the collapse in 2000 of the dot-com market had a major impact on the company, and Corning stock plummeted to $1 per share. However, as of 2007[update] the company had posted five straight years of improving financial performance.
Current technologies[edit]

The turning point for Corning came when Apple approached it to develop a screen solution for its upcoming phone model, the iPhone. Eventually, all the major Android vendors also adopted its Gorilla glass screen.[citation needed] In 2011 Corning announced the expansion of existing facilities and the construction of a Gen 10 facility co-located with the Sharp Corporation manufacturing complex in Sakai, Osaka, Japan.[12] The LCD glass substrate is produced without heavy metals. Corning is a leading manufacturer of the glass used in liquid crystal displays[citation needed].
The company continues to produce optical fiber and cable for the communications industry at its Wilmington and Concord plants in North Carolina. It is also a major manufacturer of ceramic emission control devices for catalytic converters in cars and light trucks that use gasoline engines. The company is also investing in the production of ceramic emission control products for diesel engines as a result of tighter emission standards for those engines both in the U.S. and abroad.
In 2007 Corning introduced an optic fiber, ClearCurve, which uses nanostructure technology to facilitate the small radius bending found in FTTX installations.




Corning's Gorilla Glass is used on the Nokia N8's screen


Gorilla Glass, an outgrowth of the 1960s Chemcor project, is a high-strength alkali-aluminosilicate thin sheet glass used as a protective cover glass offering scratch resistance and durability in many handheld devices with touchscreens, went on sale in 2008.[13] According to the book "Steve Jobs" by Walter Isaacson, Gorilla Glass was used in the first iPhone released in 2007.[14]
On October 25, 2011 Corning unveiled Lotus Glass, an environmentally friendly and high-performance glass developed for OLED and LCD displays.[15][16]
Corning invests about 10% of revenue in research and development, and has allocated US$300 million towards further expansion of its Sullivan Park research facility near headquarters in Corning, New York.[17]
Corning Incorporated also manufactures a high-purity fused silica employed in microlithography systems, a low expansion glass utilized in the construction of reflective mirror blanks, windows for U.S. space shuttles, and Steuben art glass. The number of Corning facilities still employing the traditional tanks of molten glass has declined over the years, but it maintains the capacity to supply bulk or finished glass of many types.
Corning is engaged in research and development on green lasers, mercury abatement, microreactors, photovoltaics, and silicon on glass. Through its Life Sciences division, the company offers products to support life science research, including stem-cell culture products.[18]
Other activities[edit]
Corning employs roughly 34,000 people worldwide and had sales of $10.217 billion in 2014.[1] The company has been listed for many years among Fortune magazine's 500 largest companies, and was ranked #297 in 2015.
Although the company has long been publicly owned, James R. Houghton, great-great-grandson of the founder, served as chairman of the board of directors from 2001 to 2007. Over the years Houghton family ownership has declined to about 2%. Wendell P. Weeks has been with the company since 1983 and as of March 2013[update] was chairman, chief executive officer, and president.[19]
Over its 160-year history Corning invented a process for rapid and inexpensive production of light bulbs, including developing the glass for Thomas Edison's light bulb. Corning was the glass supplier for lightbulbs for General Electric after Edison General Electric merged with Thomson-Houston Electric Company in 1892.[20] It was an early major manufacturer of glass panels and funnels for television tubes, invented and produced Vycor (high temperature glass with high thermal shock resistance). Corning invented and produced Pyrex, CorningWare Pyroceram glass-ceramic cookware, and Corelle durable glass dinnerware. Corning manufactured the windows for US manned space vehicles, and supplied the glass blank for the primary mirror in the Hubble Space Telescope. Corning won the National Medal of Technology four times for its product and process innovations[21] [22] [23] .[24]
In July 2008 Corning announced the sale of Steuben Glass Works to Steuben Glass LLC, an affiliate of the private equity firm Schottenstein Stores Corporation. Steuben Glass had been unprofitable for more than a decade, losing 30 million dollars over the previous five years.[25]
In February 2011, Corning acquired MobileAccess Networks, an Israeli company that develops Distributed antenna systems, which are often used by universities, stadiums and airports to ensure seamless wireless coverage throughout a facility. MobileAccess Networks became part of Corning’s telecommunications business unit.[26]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
