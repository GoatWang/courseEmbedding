Calgon Carbon Appoints Chad Whalen as New General Counsel and 
      Secretary






December 07, 2015 08:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



PITTSBURGH--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Calgon Carbon Corporation (CCC) announced that it has hired Chad Whalen 
      as Senior Vice President, General Counsel, and Secretary effective 
      December 1, 2015. Whalen comes to Calgon Carbon from RTI International 
      Metals, a NYSE-listed global supplier of advanced titanium and specialty 
      metals products and services, acquired by Alcoa Inc. earlier this year, 
      where he held the position of General Counsel & Senior Vice President of 
      Government Relations.
    


      “We are pleased to welcome Chad to Calgon Carbon. In addition to his 
      robust SEC experience, Chad’s M&A background will serve the company well 
      as we continue to grow,” said Randy Dearth, Chairman, President and CEO.
    

      Prior to RTI, Whalen was a practicing attorney in the Pittsburgh, PA 
      office of Buchanan, Ingersoll and Rooney PC, where he represented public 
      companies in the areas of corporate finance and corporate governance. He 
      was also a member of the steering committee of the firm’s SEC Practice 
      Group and a member of its Mergers and Acquisitions Practice Group. While 
      employed at the firm, Whalen provided counsel in the matters of 
      corporate governance, securities law compliance, and mergers and 
      acquisitions.
    

      Whalen has a Bachelor’s Degree from Grove City College, and his Juris 
      Doctor from Penn State Dickinson School of Law. He is a member of the 
      American Bar Association’s Federal Regulation of Securities and 
      Negotiated Acquisitions subcommittees, the Society of Corporate 
      Secretaries and Governance Professionals, and the Pennsylvania and 
      Allegheny County Bar Associations.
