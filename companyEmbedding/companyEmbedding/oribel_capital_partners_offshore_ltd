We look forward to continuing this heritage and growing the Golden Circle business." "We are acutely aware of Golden Circle's origins and the importance of Golden Circle to the farming community. Our desire is to maintain contracts between growers and Golden Circle, which would benefit from potential increases in volume over time as the combined sales and marketing strength of a combined Golden Circle and Heinz is realised." "Golden Circle's workforce also forms an integral part of Golden Circle's success and will benefit from opportunities that will become available as part of the Heinz group," he said.

A Competing Proposal is any proposal or possible transaction or arrangement (whether by way of takeover, share acquisition, Scheme of Arrangement, capital reconstruction, acquisition of main undertaking or otherwise) pursuant to which, if ultimately completed, a person whether alone or together with its associates (other than Heinz or a Related Body Corporate of Heinz) would: 

directly or indirectly, acquire an interest in, a relevant interest in or become the holder of: 
more than 20% of the shares in Golden Circle; or 
the whole or a substantial part or a material part of the business or property of Golden Circle or the Golden Circle Group; 
acquire control of Golden Circle, within the meaning of section 50AA of the Corporations Act; or 
otherwise acquire or merge with Golden Circle (including by a reverse takeover bid, reverse Scheme of Arrangement or dual listed company structure).  
End Date 
The End Date means 

11.59pm on 31 January 2009; or 
11.59pm on 27 February 2009 if prior to 7.00pm Brisbane time on 30 January 2009 Heinz gives written notice to Golden Circle extending the End Date to 11.59pm on 27 February 2009; or 
such other date and time agreed in writing between Heinz and Golden Circle.  
Superior Proposal 
A Superior Proposal is a bona fide Competing Proposal which: 

in the determination of the Golden Circle Board acting in good faith is reasonably capable of being financed and completed within a reasonable time, taking into account the nature of the Competing Proposal and the person or persons making it; and 
in the determination of the Golden Circle Board acting in good faith and in order to satisfy what the Golden Circle Board reasonably considers to be its fiduciary or statutory duties, would, if completed substantially in accordance with its terms, be likely to result in a transaction more favourable to the Golden Circle Shareholders than the Scheme or any Heinz counterproposal (as applicable).
