            Strategy, Benefits, Results
        



            Strategy
        
The fund aims to improve portfolio diversification via active management of investments across a variety of hedged global macro strategies in a multi-manager fund structure.
Our robust manager selection process involves five independent teams, each with the right to veto a manager.
The fund’s carefully selected managers are*:





EMSO Asset Management Limited
Graham Capital Management L.P.




Aspect Capital Limited







* Manager roster includes managers that have been appointed as sub-advisors or managers of investment funds. K2 may determine in its sole discretion to not allocate to one or more of the managers and or to add new managers. Accordingly, the manager roster is presented for illustrative purposes only, and should not be viewed as predictive of the ongoing composition of the fund’s portfolio, which may change at any time.


            Benefits
        
Adaptable Portfolio Diversifier. The fund invests across alternative strategies with highly flexible mandates, targeting unique opportunities from global trends and themes in equity, fixed income, currency, and commodity markets.
Strategic Approach to Market Stress. The fund’s management team pursues more consistent portfolio returns over time by seeking to limit the impact of negative market events that can occur in periods of market stress.
Access to Hedge Strategies. K2’s robust manager research process seeks to provide access to a talented group of hedge strategy managers.
Disciplined Capabilities Steeped in Experience. Built with 20 years of experience, K2 focuses on manager research, strategy allocation and portfolio construction within a culture deeply focused on managing risk.
Risk Management. The investment team applies extensive risk processes, systems and data to help ensure risks can be continually measured, monitored, and managed.

            Investing In The Fund
        


All investments involve risks, including possible loss of principal.
The Fund is actively managed and could experience losses if the investment manager’s or sub-advisors’ judgment about particular investments made for the Fund prove to be incorrect.
Investments in derivatives involve costs and create economic leverage, which may result in significant volatility and cause the Fund to participate in losses (as well as gains) that significantly exceed the Fund’s initial investment.
The market values of securities owned by the Fund will go up or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably.
Liquidity risk may exist when securities have become more difficult to sell, or are unable to be sold, at the price at which they have been valued.
The sub-advisors may not be successful in maintaining effective and operational trading models used to implement systematic strategies.
An issuer of debt securities may fail to make interest payments or repay principal when due.
Lower-rated or high yield debt securities involve greater credit risk, including the possibility of default or bankruptcy.
When interest rates rise, debt security prices tend to fall.
Foreign investments are subject to greater investment risk such as political, economic, credit, information and currency fluctuation risks.
Investments in emerging markets are subject to the risks of foreign investing and have additional heightened risks.
Commodity and commodity-linked investments present unique risks, are speculative and can be extremely volatile.
Please see the prospectus and summary prospectus for information on these as well as other risk considerations.

Total Returns include change in share price, assume reinvestment of all distributions, and reflect the deduction of fund expenses and applicable fees. Total Returns With Sales Charge: returns reflect the deduction of the stated sales charge. Total returns, distribution rate, and yields reflect any applicable expense reductions, without which the results for those impacted funds would have been lower.
For more information on any of our funds, contact your financial advisor or download a free prospectus. Investors should carefully consider a fund's investment goals, risks, sales charges and expenses before investing. The prospectus contains this and other information.  Please read the prospectus carefully before investing or sending money.
Most Franklin Templeton funds offer multiple share classes. Share classes are subject to different fees and expenses, which will affect their performance. In general, Class A shares have a maximum initial sales charge; Class C shares have a 1% contingent deferred sales charge; Class Z, Advisor Class and Class R6 shares have no sales charges nor Rule 12b-1 fees; Class R shares have no sales charges, but do have a Rule 12b-1 fee.
All investments involve risks, including possible loss of principal. The Fund is actively managed and could experience losses if the investment manager's or sub-advisors' judgment about particular investments made for the Fund prove to be incorrect.

Performance data represents past performance, which does not guarantee future results. Current performance may differ from figures shown. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate with market conditions, and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.

Footnotes

A statistical measurement of a fund's historical risk-adjusted performance. It is calculated by taking a fund's excess return over that of the three-month Treasury bill divided by its standard deviation. Higher values generally indicate better historical risk-adjusted performance. Based on the 3 years ended as of the date of the calculation.
The annualized percentage difference between a fund's actual returns and its expected performance given its level of market risk, as measured by beta.  Based on the 3-year period ended as of the date of the calculation.
The Gross Expense Ratio does not include an expense reduction contractually guaranteed through 9/30/17.  Fund investment results reflect any expense reduction and fee waiver, as applicable.  Without these reductions, the results would have been lower. Please see the prospectus for additional information.
Public Offering Price — Purchase price for each share of the fund on a given day. It includes the maximum initial sales charge, if any.
Net Asset Value — The amount per share you would receive if you sold shares that day.
Standard deviation is a statistical measurement of the dispersion of historical returns. A higher standard deviation means greater volatility. Calculated by annualizing the standard deviation of the fund's daily returns over the 1-year period ended as of the date of the calculation.
The investment manager has contractually agreed to waive or assume certain expenses so that the total annual fund operating expenses (excluding 12b-1 fees; acquired fund fees and expenses; expenses related to securities sold short; and certain non-routine expenses) for each class of the fund do not exceed (and could be less than) 1.95% until September 30, 2017. This rate differs from the fund's "Net Expense Ratio," which reflects the full costs associated with an investment in the fund minus the contractual waivers/reductions, and is the figure that is used to calculate a fund's total returns.
Indices are unmanaged and one cannot invest directly in them. Index returns do not reflect any fees, expenses or sales charges.
For performance reporting purposes, the inception date for Classes A, R, R6, Z, and Advisor Class shares of all Franklin Templeton Funds is the date of effectiveness of the fund's registration statement or the first day the fund commenced operations. For Class C shares, generally the inception date is the first day the fund commenced offering such shares. Exceptions: Templeton Global Balanced Fund Classes A and C use the inception date of the old Class A and C shares, renamed Class A1 and Class C1. For Franklin Mutual Series Funds, Franklin International Small Cap Growth Fund and Franklin Pelagos Commodities Strategy Fund, the inception date for Classes A, C, R and R6 shares is the funds' oldest class', Z or Advisor, inception date. Franklin U.S. Government Money Fund Class R6 inception date is the first day it commenced offering such shares. For Franklin California Ultra-Short Tax-Free Income Fund Classes A1 and Advisor Class use the inception date of its predecessor, Franklin California Tax-Exempt Money Fund.

 Fact SheetJun 30, 2017







The Fund
This top-down macro-focused fund offers exposure to emerging and frontier markets countries as well as off-index countries. The Fund seeks to provide investors with income and capital appreciation through attractive risk-adjusted returns. Managed by Eato n Vance’s Global Income Group, a leader in political and macroeconomic analysis of countries.



The Approach
Utilizing a top-down, country-allocation investment approach, the research process focuses on forecasting changes in macroeconomic and policy environments combined with fundamental valuation analysis. Allocations are focused on broad-based, country-level  equity exposures, rather than individual stocks.



The Features
The Fund provides access to a management team with over 50 years of combined experience. Rather than be guided by benchmark weightings, allocations to countries are implemented based on the investment team’s proprietary research, which may provide  broader diversification and lower volatility.







 

 OverviewBroad equity markets within countries that have experienced an increase in economic freedom have outperformed those with decreasing economic freedom both over time and during down markets.2

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance is for the stated time period only; due to market vola tility, the Fund's current performance may be lower or higher than quoted. Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage change in net asset value (NAV) with all distributions reinvested. Returns for other classes of shares offe red by the Fund are different. Performance less than or equal to one year is cumulative. Total return prior to the commencement of the class reflects returns of the Global Macro Capital Opportunities Portfolio, the separate registered investment company  in which the Fund invests. Prior returns are adjusted to reflect any applicable sales charge (but were not adjusted for other expenses). If adjusted for other expenses, returns would be lower. The share class has no sales charge.

Portfolio profile subject to change due to active management. Percentages may not total 100% due to rounding. Fund primarily invests in an affiliated investment company (Portfolio) with the same objective(s) and policies as the Fund and may also invest d irectly. References to investments are to the aggregate holdings of the Fund and the Portfolio.


About Risk: 
Fund performance is sensitive to stock market volatility. When interest rates rise, the value of preferred stocks and other hybrid securities will generally decline. Investments in foreign instruments or currencies can involve greater risk and volatility  than U.S. investments because of adverse market, economic, political, regulatory, geopolitical or other conditions. In emerging or frontier countries, these risks may be more significant. An imbalance in supply and demand in the income market may result  in valuation uncertainties and greater volatility, less liquidity, widening credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in the market. Derivative instruments can be used to take both long and short positions, be highly volatile, result in economic l everage (which can increase both the risk and return potential of the Fund), and involve risks in addition to the risks of the underlying instrument on which the derivative is based, such as counterparty, correlation and liquidity risk. If a counterparty  is unable to honor its commitments, the value of Fund shares may decline and/or the Fund could experience delays in the return of collateral or other assets held by the counterparty. Because the Fund may invest significantly in a particular geographic r egion or country, value of Fund shares may fluctuate more than a fund with less exposure to such areas. A nondiversified fund may be subject to greater risk by investing in a smaller number of investments than a diversified fund. No fund is a complete in vestment program and you may lose money investing in a fund. The Fund may engage in other investment practices that may involve additional risks and you should review the Fund prospectus for a complete description.



1. Prior to 5/2/17, Fund was called Eaton Vance Global Macro Capital Opportunities Fund.
2. Source: Fraser Institute, MSCI, Bloomberg, Eaton Vance. The Economic Freedom analysis by the Fraser Institute, and resultant scores, are available every five years beginning in 1970 through 2000. Thereafter, scores are available annually. Thus, longer-te rm analysis was conducted using 5-year periods and ends in 2010 in order to maintain consistent time periods for measurement. Down years since 2000 were calculated utilizing annual analysis. During each period countries were grouped according to whether  their Fraser Institute quantitative score for economic freedom increased or decreased. The MSCI country-level returns were then aggregated into two lists - increasing economic freedom and decreasing economic freedom - and the performance data averaged, r espectively.

Portfolio profile subject to change due to active management. Percentages may not total 100% due to rounding. Fund primarily invests in an affiliated investment company (Portfolio) with the same objective(s) and policies as the Fund and may also invest d irectly. References to investments are to the aggregate holdings of the Fund and the Portfolio.


About Risk: 
Fund performance is sensitive to stock market volatility. When interest rates rise, the value of preferred stocks and other hybrid securities will generally decline. Investments in foreign instruments or currencies can involve greater risk and volatility  than U.S. investments because of adverse market, economic, political, regulatory, geopolitical or other conditions. In emerging or frontier countries, these risks may be more significant. An imbalance in supply and demand in the income market may result  in valuation uncertainties and greater volatility, less liquidity, widening credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in the market. Derivative instruments can be used to take both long and short positions, be highly volatile, result in economic l everage (which can increase both the risk and return potential of the Fund), and involve risks in addition to the risks of the underlying instrument on which the derivative is based, such as counterparty, correlation and liquidity risk. If a counterparty  is unable to honor its commitments, the value of Fund shares may decline and/or the Fund could experience delays in the return of collateral or other assets held by the counterparty. Because the Fund may invest significantly in a particular geographic r egion or country, value of Fund shares may fluctuate more than a fund with less exposure to such areas. A nondiversified fund may be subject to greater risk by investing in a smaller number of investments than a diversified fund. No fund is a complete in vestment program and you may lose money investing in a fund. The Fund may engage in other investment practices that may involve additional risks and you should review the Fund prospectus for a complete description.
