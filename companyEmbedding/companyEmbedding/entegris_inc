                Entegris, Inc. develops, manufactures and supplies materials and solutions for advanced manufacturing processes in the semiconductor and other high-technology industries. The company's products include both unit driven and capital expense driven products. Its unit-driven and consumable product class includes membrane-based liquid filters and housings, metal-based gas filters, resin-based gas purifiers, wafer shippers, disk-shipping containers and test assembly and packaging products and consumable graphite and silicon carbide components used in plasma etch, ion implant and chemical vapor deposition processes in semiconductor manufacturing. Its capital expense-driven products include components, systems and subsystems that use electro-mechanical, pressure differential and related technologies, to permit semiconductor and other electronics manufacturers to monitor and control the flow and condition of process liquids used in these manufacturing processes, and process carriers that protect the integrity of in-process wafers. The company operates through the following business segments: critical materials handling and electronic materials. The critical materials handling segment offers products that purify, monitor and deliver critical liquids and gases to the semiconductor manufacturing process and similar manufacturing processes as well as microenvironments products to preserve the integrity of wafers, reticles and electronic components at various stages of transport, processing and storage and materials, components and services to a wide range of customers in the semiconductor industry and in adjacent and unrelated industries. The electronic materials segment offers materials and materials delivery systems to support the advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes. Entegris was founded in March 2005 and is headquartered in Billerica, MA.

Entegris employs people in ten manufacturing plants, 14 sales plants, and six service centers worldwide.

The organization has previously acquired a number of companies, including Jetalon Solutions, Inc and ATMI, Inc.

2013 and Earlier:
Entegris, Inc.'s IT department is responsible for the global support of the research and manufacturing systems, and applications utilized the organization. The US IT department is divided between the corporate headquarters in Billerica, MA, and a manufacturing location in Chaska, MN. Supply and distribution are critical components in the worldwide production process, thereby the company places a very high emphasis on the operation of its SAP supply-chain, and billing systems. 

 The company operates data storage locations across the US, Malaysia, Taiwan and Japan. Billerica, MA serves as the main data center locale, with the servers in Chaska, MN acting as the data recovery/backup servers. A team of technical administrators handle the VMware/Windows server farms which support Windows/UNIX operating environments.

IT Intelligence Snippets:
 2013
 Entegris, Inc. is planning to increase security spending in encryption, identity and access management, policy compliance, enforcement of mobile security, fraud, and SIEM (security information and event management). The company is currently deploying solutions to secure and/or manage privileged/admin accounts. It uses HP as its storage security solution. 

 Entegris, Inc. has the following security safeguards in place: regular policy reviews, inventory of personal employee and customer data, inventory of locations where data is stored, encryption of mobile devices, malware and virus protection software on all devices, has a documented incident response process, a regular compliance review process, a continuous compliance model in place, and operates under ISO 15408 compliance regimes.  The company uses an MSSP (NTT) to monitor treats across its networks, security devices, and data. The company is currently evaluating cloud solutions for a possible implementation.  

 Senior sources report data ownership and protection are the company's biggest cloud related security concerns. Entegris, Inc. is presently engaged in a bring your own device (BYOD) pilot program. It currently uses Good Technologies as its mobile device management (MDM) solution.

Mobile device security, encryption and DLP are the top security priorities. Over the next 12 month, the company is to expand services within its cloud environment to a SaaS based cloud. For all future cloud projects the company will pay close attention to a solution's ability to address ERP, Content Management solutions, and email concerns.

The company is both deploying and expanding mobile applications. The company's top mobility priorities over the next year are security, governance and MDM. The company's Imaging /Video conference and VOIP solutions cause the most strain on its network environment.

Entegris Inc.


            
            Entegris, Inc. develops, manufactures and supplies materials and solutions for advanced manufacturing processes in the semiconductor and other high-technology industries. The company's products include both unit driven and capital expense driven products. Its unit-driven and consumable product class includes membrane-based liquid filters and housings, metal-based gas filters, resin-based gas purifiers, wafer shippers, disk-shipping containers and test assembly and packaging products and consumable graphite and silicon carbide components used in plasma etch, ion implant and chemical vapor deposition processes in semiconductor manufacturing. Its capital expense-driven products include components, systems and subsystems that use electro-mechanical, pressure differential and related technologies, to permit semiconductor and other electronics manufacturers to monitor and control the flow and condition of process liquids used in these manufacturing processes, and process carriers that protect the integrity of in-process wafers. The company operates through the following business segments: critical materials handling and electronic materials. The critical materials handling segment offers products that purify, monitor and deliver critical liquids and gases to the semiconductor manufacturing process and similar manufacturing processes as well as microenvironments products to preserve the integrity of wafers, reticles and electronic components at various stages of transport, processing and storage and materials, components and services to a wide range of customers in the semiconductor industry and in adjacent and unrelated industries. The electronic materials segment offers materials and materials delivery systems to support the advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV
License: CC-BY

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
