ALTAIR RESOURCES INC. ("AVX")BULLETIN TYPE:  Property-Asset or Share Purchase AgreementBULLETIN DATE:  July 18, 2017TSX Venture Tier 2 Company 
TSX Venture Exchange Inc. (the "Exchange") has accepted for filing an assignment and assumption agreement dated May 17, 2017 (the "Agreement") between Altair Resources Inc. ("Altair") and International Silver, Inc. ("ISI") under which Altair has acquired a lease and option to purchase (the "Lease/Option") over the Prince zinc-lead-silver-manganese Mine (the "Prince Mine") located in Nevada. The Lease/Option was originally held by ISI, a private Arizona corporation pursuant to a lease and option to purchase agreement dated November 6, 2010 between ISI and Prince Mine LLC, a private Nevada corporation ("Prince"). Under the original agreement, ISI leased the project at a cost of US$50,000 per year with an option to purchase the mine for US$2,750,000 (with previous lease payments being applied to the purchase price).
Under the terms of the Agreement the Lease/Option will be assigned to Altair in consideration of Altair:

paying Prince US$200,000 representing unpaid lease payments for 2013-2016, by November 2017; and
completing reclamation of drill sites cleared in 2012 (cost estimated at less than US$20,000).

The Lease/Option will be extended to November 1, 2022. Once assigned, the Lease/Option will continue in effect with annual lease payments of US$50,000 with an option to purchase the Prince Mine at any time in consideration of US$2,750,000 (less previous lease payments). 
For further information, see Altair's news release dated May 25, 2017 which is available under Altair's profile on SEDAR.

AMARC RESOURCES LTD. ("AHR")BULLETIN TYPE:  Property-Asset or Share Disposition AgreementBULLETIN DATE:  July 18, 2017TSX Venture Tier 1 Company
The TSX Venture Exchange Inc. (the "Exchange") has accepted documentation in connection with a Mineral Property Farm-In Agreement (the "Agreement") with Hudbay Minerals Inc. ("Hudbay") (TSX: HBM; NYSE: HBM). Under the terms of the Agreement, Hudbay may acquire, through a staged investment process, up to a 60% ownership interest in Amarc's 100%-owned IKE copper porphyry district (the "IKE Project" or the "Project"), located near Gold Bridge, British Columbia.
Under the terms of the Agreement, Hudbay can earn an initial 49% ownership interest in the IKE Project under a Stage 1 Farm-in Right by funding $25 million of expenditures before December 31, 2020, of which $3.3 million is committed for 2017. Provided its Stage 1 Farm-in Right is exercised, Hudbay can, pursuant to a Stage 2 Farm-in Right, elect to earn an additional 1% interest in the Project (for a total 50% interest), by funding $15 million of expenditures (for a total of $40 million), also before December 31, 2020. Stage 1 and Stage 2 Farm-in expenditures can be accelerated by Hudbay at its discretion. Amarc will be the operator during the Stage 1 and Stage 2 periods. A Joint Venture ("JV") will be formed when Hudbay has acquired a 49% interest in the Project. Provided that Hudbay has exercised its Stage 2 Farm-in Right and acquired a 50% interest in the IKE Project, it can then elect to go forward via one of two paths.
First, Hudbay can replace Amarc as operator of the JV after it funds all project expenditures and completes a Feasibility Study for the IKE Project by December 31, 2025. Having gained operatorship, Hudbay can then choose to either go forward with Amarc in a 50/50 participating JV, or can instead elect to continue with its Farm-in (the "Stage 3 Farm-in Right") to acquire an additional 10% interest in the IKE Project (for a total 60% interest). To exercise its Stage 3 Farm-in Right, Hudbay must fund all expenditures required to submit a British Columbia Environment Assessment ("EA") application for the IKE Project and, if applicable, a Canadian EA application, with the application(s) being accepted for review by December 31, 2026. In addition, Hudbay must also continue to fund all project expenditures until the necessary EA Certificate(s) are received. Following receipt of the EA Certificate(s), all IKE Project expenditures going forward will be shared by Hudbay and Amarc on a pro rata basis (Hudbay 60%/Amarc 40%) under the JV. 
As a second alternative path Hudbay can elect, after exercising its Stage 2 Farm-in Right, to proceed directly to the Stage 3 Farm-in Right, so immediately becoming the operator, and acquire a further 10% interest (for a total 60% interest) by, as above, submitting and having accepted for review a British Columbia EA application and, if applicable, a Canadian EA application, by December 31, 2026. Again in this instance, Hudbay must also fund all project expenditures until receipt of the necessary EA Certificate(s). As with the first path, following receipt of the EA Certificate(s), all IKE Project expenditures going forward will be shared by Hudbay and Amarc on a pro rata basis (Hudbay 60%/Amarc 40%) under the JV. 
If Hudbay does not submit the EA application(s) by December 31, 2026, then Amarc will become operator again. 
Hudbay has the right to defer either of its 2019 or 2020 expenditures, for a one-year period, subject to certain conditions. If this deferral occurs, Amarc will have a "co-expenditure right", whereby it can incur and fund approved additional expenditures on the IKE Project up to the amount of the deferred expenditures. Hudbay may elect to reimburse Amarc for these additional expenditures, thereby retaining its interest in the Project.
For further information see Amarc's news release dated July 5, 2017 which is available under Amarc's profile on SEDAR.

Hudbay Minerals Kicked Its Debt Repayment Further Down The Road - But Is It Far Enough? - Hudbay Minerals Inc Ordinary Sh (NYSE:HBM) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Hudbay Minerals Kicked Its Debt Repayment Further Down The Road - But Is It Far Enough?Jun.26.17 | About: Hudbay Minerals (HBM) The Investment Doctor Long/short equity, value, debt, base metalsMarketplaceEuropean Small-Cap IdeasSummaryHudBay's management team made a good decision by increasing and extending the maturity of its debt.The adjusted free cash flow in Q1 was still very low once you isolate the non-recurring benefits.The production cost at Constancia will decrease sharply from next year on.Introduction I haven’t been very impressed with the performance of HudBay Minerals (HBM) in the past few years and when the copper price dropped to just $2 per pound, the company’s chances to survive were very low as its balance sheet contained too much debt. Fortunately the copper price and the zinc price started to increase, boosting HudBay’s cash flows. 

HBM data by YCharts Source: Ycharts The higher copper price in Q1 provides more room to breathe HudBay’s two production hubs are in Peru (copper-focused) and Manitoba (zinc-focused) and on a consolidated basis, HudBay sold a total of 26,400 tonnes of copper, just over 25,000 ounces of gold, almost 700,000 ounces of silver and almost 27,000 tonnes of zinc in the first quarter of this year. As you can see on the next image, the copper and gold price were definitely cooperating during the quarter. 

 Source: stockcharts.com Whilst the gold price was higher compared to the end of 2016, it was slightly lower compared to the first quarter of last year but fortunately the higher copper and zinc prices made up for the difference. 


 Source: quarterly report The company’s total revenue in the first quarter remained stable at US$253M (the higher copper price compensated for the lower copper production volumes), resulting in a gross profit of just over $49M which is almost twice as high as the gross profit in Q1 2016. That’s a good result, but we shouldn’t forget the majority of this improvement is related to a lower depreciation charge on the assets. The operating income also increased to $42M (thanks to a one-time benefit related to an insurance claim on the Constancia copper mine where the company received compensation for an incident during the commissioning phase of the plant). Despite this benefit, HudBay still reported a net loss of $2.3M as its finance expenses remain very high. The $50M net debt reduction was caused by one-time benefits As you know, you can’t repay debt with a paper profit, and the ‘real’ cash flows are what really matter for HudBay Minerals. HudBay was proud to announce it generated 50M in free cash flow which reduced its net debt, but unfortunately the adjusted free cash flows are much weaker than what you’d expect. So let’s start with analyzing the operating cash flows. According to HudBay, the total operating cash flow was $110M. Okay, but almost $30M was caused by working capital changes and this is per definition non-recurring. Secondly, it looks like the operating cash flow also included the insurance payment, which also is a non-recurring item. This already reduces the adjusted operating cash flow to $75M. 

 Source: financial statements That would still be a strong result, but there’s one important final part of the puzzle: the interest expenses. Based on the new situation (7.48% on a $1B bond, and 5%+ on a $130M loan), the average quarterly interest expenses will be approximately $21M (with Q2 and Q4 being the interest-heavy quarters). After taking this into consideration the fully adjusted operating cash flow in Q1 was just $54M. Still sufficient to cover the $40M in capital expenditures, but with an adjusted free cash flow of just $14M in Q1, the company’s net debt of in excess of $1B remains relatively high.
 Is the situation hopeless? No, but HudBay will have to be careful – and buying time was an excellent move A first important improvement of its financial situation will be the Lalor expansion. The new plant will process ore at a capacity of 4,500 tonnes per day which is 50% higher than the current milling rate of 3,000 tonnes per day. According to the company’s CEO in the conference call, this will improve the efficiencies and reduce the sustaining capex, which is positive on both fronts. Another positive note is HudBay’s progress at Rosemont. It took the company much longer than expected, but the Rosemont copper project in Arizona is now finally moving ahead. However, Rosemont won’t be the holy grail. The Internal Rate of Return at $3 copper is just over 15%, and I doubt financiers will be falling over themselves to fund the construction of the project. Never say never though, as I heard Chinese smelters and end-users have been kicking the tires of some North American projects in an attempt to secure a stable supply. However, I wouldn’t count on Rosemont in the near future. A third positive achievement will be the inclusion of the higher grade Pampacancha zone in the Constancia mine plan. HudBay confirmed in its conference call 2017 will be the‘peak year for cash cost and the sustaining cash cost, before significantly declining in 2018 to 2021’. This means the (adjusted) operating and free cash flow should increase, accelerating the net debt reduction. 

 Source: company presentation The company’s new management did one thing which will very likely have saved the company’s shareholders from additional dilution. In December 2016, when the copper price was increasing, it refinanced the existing 9.5% debt with two new bonds, raising $1B with an average cost of debt of 7.48%. This reduced the annual interest expenses by $20M per year, and kicked the can three years further down the road. Instead of having to repay $920M in 2020, it now has to repay $400M in 2023 and $600M in 2025. A golden move, as the company borrowed more cash at a 20% lower cost and that’s a job well done!
 Investment thesis HudBay’s turnaround has started, and the company’s free cash flow in Q1 will help to reduce the net debt. Although marginal ($14M), the free cash flow is expected to increase in the next few years as the sustaining capex will decrease whilst a new zone with higher returns will be mined at Constancia resulting in a substantially lower all-in sustaining cost per produced pound of copper.

5 Top Weekly TSX Stocks: Nighthawk Gold Surges on Drill Results
Last week's other top-gaining TSX stocks were Katanga Mining, Hudbay Minerals, Red Eagle Mining and Ivanhoe Mines.

The S&P/TSX Composite index (INDEXTSI:OSPTX) was slightly up last week at 15,172.38 points, a modest gain of 0.96 percent.
Gold miners led the climb on Friday (July 14), supported by a stronger gold price, according to Reuters. Gold was on track for its biggest weekly gain since mid-May that day, pushed up by weaker-than-expected US economic data.
“Gold is the net beneficiary of this data as investors factor in the impact of the rate hiking cycle,” said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets. A weaker dollar also supported gains for precious metals, as a softer greenback makes commodities priced in dollars cheaper for buyers using weaker currencies. 
Against that backdrop, a number of TSX-listed stocks in the mining sector saw share price increases, including:

Nighthawk Gold (TSX:NHK)
Katanga Mining (TSX:KAT)
Hudbay Minerals (TSX:HBM,NYSE:HBM) 
Red Eagle Mining (TSX:R) 
Ivanhoe Mines (TSX:IVN)

Without further ado, here’s a look at those companies and what moved their share prices last week.

Nighthawk Gold
Nighthawk Gold is an exploration company focused on acquiring and developing gold properties in the Northwest Territories. The company’s flagship Colomac gold project lies within its Indin Lake property. Brent Cook and Joe Mazumdar of Exploration Insights identified Nighthawk Gold as one of their stock picks earlier this year. 
On July 13, the company announced additional drill results from Colomac. The news sent Nighthawk’s share price up 28.99 percent to close the five-day period at $0.89.
Katanga Mining
Katanga Mining operates a large-scale copper–cobalt mine complex in the Democratic Republic of Congo through two joint ventures called Kamoto Copper Company and DRC Copper and Cobalt Project. The company has released no recent news, but last week its share price rose 15.49 percent to reach $0.82. As of last week, Katanga was up nearly 500 percent year-to-date.
Ivanhoe Mines
Middle of the pack on the list is Ivanhoe Mines. The company is advancing three projects in Sub-Saharan Africa: the Platreef platinum–palladium-gold-nickel-copper discovery in South Africa’s Bushveld Complex; the Kamoa-Kakula copper project in the Central African Copperbelt in the DRC; and the Kipushi zinc-copper-silver-germanium mine, also in the Copperbelt.

The company’s most recent news came on June 29, when it filed an updated mineral resource estimate for the Kakula discovery at the Kamoa-Kakula project. Last week, Ivanhoe Mines’ share price spiked 15.13 percent to close the five-day period at $4.76.
Hudbay Minerals
Hudbay Minerals is an integrated mining company that produces copper concentrate and zinc metal at operations across the Americas. The company’s most recent news is from June 7, when it received the final US Forest Service record of decision for its copper-molybdenum-silver Rosemont project.
Last week, Hudbay’s share price jumped 12.77 percent to close the five-day period at $8.21. It did not release any news that would explain the uptick. 
Red Eagle Mining
Last but not least is Red Eagle Mining, a gold producer focused on discovering, developing and operating gold projects in Colombia. Red Eagle Mining owns 100 percent of the Santa Rosa gold project, where the San Ramon gold mine started commercial production in March.
On July 10, the company announced results from an ongoing drill program at Santa Rose. The news sent Red Eagle’s share price 5.36 percent last week to end at $0.29.

5 Top Weekly TSX Stocks: Dundee Gains on Option Agreement for Quebec Gold Project
By Charlotte McLeod, July 10, 2017
The S&P/TSX Composite Index (INDEXTSI:OSPTX) sank to a seven-and-a-half month low last Friday (July 6). 
According to Reuters, US and Canadian jobs data released that day stoked concerns that both countries will hike interest rates in the near future. Canada added 45,300 jobs in June, well above the 10,000 forecast, while US nonfarm payrolls jumped by 222,000 jobs compared to the 179,000 expected.
Despite the index’s poor performance, some TSX-listed mining stocks were able to record small share price increases last week. The five top gainers are as follows:

Trilogy Metals (TSX:TMQ,NYSEMKT:TMQ)
Minco Silver (TSX:MSV)
Dundee Precious Metals (TSX:DPM)
Seabridge Gold (TSX:SEA,NYSE:SA)
Eastmain Resources (TSX:ER)

Without further ado, here’s a brief look at those companies and the factors that moved their share prices last week.

Trilogy Metals
Trilogy Metals was the top gainer last week, rising 9.88 percent to end at $0.89. Formerly known as NovaCaopper, the company main assets are the Upper Kobuk mineral projects in Alaska’s Ambler Mining District.
The company did not release any news last week, but it was busy in June. It engaged consultants for a prefeasibility study for its Arctic deposit at the beginning of the month, and later released its latest financial results and began exploration at its Bornite project.
Minco Silver
Like Trilogy, Minco Silver did not release any news last week. Even so, its share price rose 4.31 percent to end the week at $1.13. Most recently, the company released the results of its annual general meeting, noting that Jennifer Trevitt has been appointed vice president corporate affairs.
Minco is focused on its China-based Fuwan silver project, though it is interested in diversifying its portfolio. Few western companies are mining or exploring for silver in China; Silvercorp Metals (TSX:SVM,NYSEMKT:SVM) is one other example.
Dundee Precious Metals
International mining company Dundee Precious Metals currently operates mines in Namibia and Bulgaria, and has exploration assets in Armenia, Bulgaria and Serbia.
Last week, the company’s share price gained 4.29 percent to end at $2.41. Dundee announced last Tuesday (July 4) that it has entered into an option agreement under which it can earn up to a 71-percent stake in Khalkos Exploration’s Quebec-based Malartic gold project. “We are very pleased to be partnering with Khalkos to advance the very exciting Malartic property in Quebec,” said Dundee President and CEO Rick Howes.

Seabridge Gold
Seabridge Gold’s share price increased by 3.8 percent last week to close at $14.02. The company did not put out any news during the period; its most recent release came on June 27, when the Canadian government issued a key authorization for the tailings management facility for the company’s BC-based KSM gold project.
Eastmain Resources
Eastmain Resources is focused on its Clearwater and Eastmain projects, both of which are high-grade gold assets in Quebec’s James Bay region. In total, it holds approximately 1,377 square kilometers in the area, which it says is a new and fertile Canadian mining district.
The company did not release any news last week, but its share price nevertheless rose 3.28 percent to end the period at $0.32.

5 Top Weekly TSX Stocks: Base Metals Stocks Surge on Weaker Dollar
By Priscila Barrera, July 2, 2017
The S&P/TSX Composite Index (INDEXTSI:OSPTX) ended Friday (June 23) down 15,182.19 points, a loss of 0.21 percent. The index has now closed lower for the second month in a row, says Reuters.
Hawkish comments earlier last week from the world’s leading central banks have raised expectations of global monetary tightening. Gold and silver were hurt as investors turned away from non-interest bearing assets, but a weaker dollar supported base metals prices. 
Base metals stocks also did well. The five top-gaining TSX-listed mining stocks last week were:

Katanga Mining (TSX:KAT)
Arizona Mining (TSX:AZ)
Hudbay Minerals (TSX:HBM,NYSE:HBM) 
Copper Mountain Mining (TSX:CMMC) 
General Moly (TSX:GMO,NYSEMKT:GMO)

Without further ado, here’s a look at those companies and what moved their share prices last week.

Katanga Mining
Katanga Mining operates a large-scale copper-cobalt mine complex in the Democratic Republic of Congo through two joint ventures called Kamoto Copper Company and DRC Copper and Cobalt Project. The company has not released any news recently, but last week its share price rose 27.27 percent to reach $0.63.
Arizona Mining

Hudbay Minerals
Middle of the pack last week was Hudbay Minerals, an integrated mining company that produces copper concentrate and zinc metal at operations across the Americas. The company’s most recent news came on June 7, when it received the final US Forest Service record of decision for its copper-molybdenum-silver Rosemont project. Last week, Hudbay’s share price jumped 7.91 percent to close the five-day period at $7.50.
Copper Mountain Mining
Copper Mountain Mining’s flagship asset is the Copper Mountain mine in Southern BC near the town of Princeton. The company also has a strategic alliance with Mitsubishi Materials (TSE:5711), which owns 25 percent of the mine. Copper Mountain’s share price rose 10.53 percent last week to reach $0.84, but it has released no recent news that would explain that gain.
General Moly
Last but not least is General Moly, a company engaged in the exploration, development and mining of molybdenum. General Moly owns an 80-percent interest in the Mount Hope project and 100 percent of the Liberty project, both located in Nevada. Over the five-day period, General Moly saw a share price rise of 6.67 percent to close at $0.48.

Flow Job 
County officials worried Rosemont Mine pushing to weaken water regulations

            By Hank Stephenson

The Pima County Board of Supervisors put state environmental regulators and Hudbay Minerals on notice that they will be watching as the state, at the mining company's request, reviews the protected status of nearly two dozen important Arizona waters.
By a 3-2 vote, the board on July 11 approved a resolution stating the county will oppose any effort to delist the waters as "Outstanding Arizona Waters," a designation that has been given to 22 rare and ecologically significant waterways, and which offers the areas the highest level of protection available under the law.  
The status of one such Outstanding Water is of particular concern to both the mining company and the Tucson area. Davidson Canyon is a desert stream within the Santa Cruz watershed southeast of Tucson that supports a host of rare plants and animals.
The protected stream has been a thorn in the side of Hudbay, the company behind Rosemont Mine. The Army Corps of Engineers has denied the company permits needed to open Rosemont based, in part, on the possibility that the mine will degrade the water quality at Davidson Canyon.
Pima County Administrator Chuck Huckelberry described the resolution as a message that the county is going to pay "very close attention" during the state's upcoming review of water regulations, and will push back against any attempt by Hudbay to try to water down protections for Davidson Canyon and other Arizona Outstanding Waters.
County officials say the review, which will be conducted amid a larger triennial review of broader water regulations, could endanger not just Davidson Canyon, which supplies roughly 20 percent of Tucson's water, but all 22 of Arizona's Outstanding Waters.
But Pima County Supervisor Steve Christy, who voted against the resolution, accused Huckleberry and the board's majority of stoking "anti-Hudbay" sentiments.
"It was merely an attempt by Mr. Huckleberry to prevent Hudbay from seeking any clarification on the (Outstanding Waters) regulations," he said of the resolution.
Huckelberry said his concerns are threefold. First, the next triennial review isn't due until 2019, and the department is starting the process early and with "little notice." More importantly, he said, it's fishy that he only learned from a public records request that Hudbay had emailed the Department of Environmental Quality requesting that a full review of all of Arizona's Outstanding Waters be included in the triennial review, and that the state had ceded to that request.
"We're very concerned that Hudbay, the mining company, has requested this action... It's a pretty unusual move. We haven't seen that before," he said.  
Arizona Department of Environmental Quality spokesperson Caroline Oppleman said the triennial review is not starting early, and that just like any other stakeholder, Hudbay has a right to request a review of Arizona's Outstanding Waters designations.
But Huckelberry said his biggest concern is that Hudbay's request is clearly a self-serving attempt to weaken protections on a body of water that has stood in the way of opening the Rosemont Mine.
In an email to Arizona Department of Environmental Quality protesting the decision to review the status of the 22 protected waters, two of which are in Pima County, Huckelberry said state officials should recognize Hudbay's "thinly-veiled" request for what it really is: "a self-serving gesture to facilitate pollution of Arizona surface waters."
Kathy Arnold, director of environment for Hudbay, said in an email that the company asked for the review because it is concerned that its own tests, along with tests from the Department of Environmental Quality, show "exceedances of metals in the background in stormwater samples"  that extend into Davidson Canyon.
She said the company is concerned that they would be held responsible for degradation to Davidson Canyon caused by the polluted stormwater.
"Because (Outstanding Waters) must have high water quality, we requested that ADEQ determine how they would treat the stormwater component.  The only way to do that is to evaluate the listing and the underlying water quality," she wrote.
Christy, who, along with fellow Republican Supervisor Ally Miller voted against the resolution, said Hudbay has every right to petition regulators to review the status of protected waters that are a hurdle to the mine, but he doesn't think that's why the company requested the review.  
"I read it as a preemptive measure by Hudbay to protect their flanks—to see what the pre-existing contaminants might or might not be in the Davidson Canyon creek," he said. "I don't read into it any nefarious dealing behind the scenes with ADEQ by Hudbay to try to get any kind of advantage."

Throughout our history, Hudbay has been in the business of discovering, producing and marketing base metals including copper, zinc and precious metals such as gold and silver. We are proud of the fact that the minerals we mine play a fundamental role in the everyday lives of billions of people around the world. Here are a few facts and figures about them:
Copper
It’s hard to imagine our world without copper. Copper’s high conductivity makes it the ideal material in a wide variety of electrical applications and the core of modern communications systems. Copper tubing is widely used for building applications including natural gas piping, plumbing and fire sprinklers. Copper also has well-known medicinal properties and is used to purify drinking water. Admired for its pliability and lustre, the metal is also used extensively in architectural design. Learn more about copper at www.copper.org.
The average North American home contains 400 pounds of copper (used for electrical wiring, pipes and appliances)
The average car contains 50 pounds of copper
The average 747 jetliner contains 9,000 pounds of copper
The average person will use 1,500 pounds of copper just to enjoy today's standard of living (in computers, telephones, automobiles, etc.)
Zinc
The applications of zinc are extensive. The metal is used to protect steel from corrosion and produce brass and bronze. Used widely in roofing and drainpipe materials, zinc helps keep our homes and workplaces dry. Zinc’s phosphorescent properties also make it a key ingredient in products including X-ray screens, fluorescent lights and firecrackers. It is also known to increase crop yields and promote human health. Learn more about zinc at www.zinc.org.

55% of zinc is used for galvanizing to protect steel from corrosion
The average car contains about 39 pounds of zinc – 17 pounds is used for rust protection, 20 pounds for die-cast parts, and half a pound per tire for rubber curing
Zinc is called the “great protector” because it’s used to protect metals (galvanizing) as well as humans, in products such as sunscreen (zinc oxide), zinc lozenges, and vitamins

Gold
As well as its obvious associations with aesthetics and wealth, gold has a vast range of technological uses. Known for its high conductivity, corrosion resistance and malleability, gold is all but indispensable in modern electronics. These same properties mean that gold is an important component in medical and scientific applications including space exploration, nanoparticle technology and smartphones. Learn more about gold at www.gold.org.

About 78% of newly mined or recycled gold is used in jewellery
According to the World Gold Council, gold jewellery demand was worth US$100 billion in 2014 and accounted for over half of global demand for gold 
A standard touchtone telephone typically contains 33 gold-plated contacts
An Olympic gold medal is covered with at least six grams of gold
Close to 41 kilograms of gold were used in the US Columbia space shuttle

Silver
Like gold, silver is admired for its beauty and richness. It also has properties that make it vital to modern life. The distribution of electric power depends on silver contacts in switches and circuit breakers. Silver is also incorporated into batteries, water-purification systems and many of the electronic devices we use today, including cell phones, plasma televisions and computers. Silver is also used as the coating material of choice for electrically heated automobile windshields and optical data-storage media, including DVDs. Learn more about silver at www.silverinstitute.org.

90% of all crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells (the most common cell used for generating solar energy) use silver paste
Over 250 million square feet of silver-coated glass is used in homes in the US each year
Sterling silver contains 92.5% silver

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

HudBay Minerals Inc. Offices



Client
HudBay Minerals, Inc., 


Year
                            2011                        

Location
Toronto, 
Canada, 


Industry
Consulting / Business Services,  

HudBay Minerals is a Canadian mining company focused on the discovery, production and marketing of base and precious metals. With the economy in the dump and gold and other minerals at record levels, I wish I were them.  Also, this is our first multi-national mineral company office submission.
In their new LEED Silver headquarters, HudBay Minerals decided to integrate some of their trade into the office by mounting pure zinc ingots, stamped with the company logo on the wall adjacent the elevator. As with many of the design companies we’ve seen, showing clients and potential customers something your company has produced can be a wonderful asset in the office.
The design was inspired by images from the company’s extensive photo library, ranging from the mining of the raw materials to the smelting processes and the finished products. Over the years, these processes have been carefully documented, producing an archive of stunning photographs that evoke the work of Ed Burtynsky and Jesse Bolles.
The ceiling is composed of panels of recycled spun aluminum, whose open cells allow light from above to filter through. This also evokes the netting that wraps the ceilings of the mines.
Stepping into the reception area, a dramatic view of the skyline of Toronto is framed on one side by three freestanding stone walls that define a large meeting room, and on the other by a commissioned installation by Toronto artist Dennis Lin. The walls are comprised of rough split face stone, inspired by a HudBay photo of vertical cliffs that have been hewn from the rock, while the art piece of copper and walnut evokes both the strata of the earth and the sinuous line of copper as it is poured into moulds in the company’s foundries. Suspended above the seating area, a custom sized “Mercury” light fixture from Artemide by Ross Lovegrove evokes droplets of molten metal.
A rich burned orange colour is used for both fabrics and back painted glass at coffee stations. This was inspired by the colour of molten copper. In place of a more traditional corporate art programme, Taylor Smyth collaborated with Darren Alexander, an art curator, to select actual photos from the HudBay archives, which have been blown up and line the walls of the building’s core.
The concrete structure of the base building has been left exposed, broken up by expanses of acoustic wood ceiling. Offices and workstations are fabricated of teak panels and glass.
Design: Taylor Smyth Architects
Photography: Ben Rahn/A-Frame

HudBay is a Canadian mining corporation. Founded as Hudson Bay Mining & Smelting Co., Limited (HBM&S), it has been exploring and mining in Manitoba for over 80 years. Much of its history has centered on Flin Flon, Manitoba. HudBay now has operations in Manitoba, Peru, and Yukon.[2]

History[edit]
Hudson Bay Mining & Smelting[edit]
The Flin Flon orebody was discovered by David Collins, a local trapper, and shown to Tom Creighton, a prospector, in 1914.[3] The first claim was registered in 1915. It took more than a dozen years to bring the mine into production because the ore body was huge, of high grade, required large amounts of hydro energy, was isolated, and needed a smelter.
In 1927, the Whitney family of New York created HBM&S, which took over controlling interest in the Flin Flon property.[3] By 1930, the mine, smelter, hydroelectric dam and railroad were in full operation.
On December 21, 2004, Hudbay Minerals (HudBay) acquired Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting (HBMS) for C$316 million from Anglo American plc. The purchase was financed by a public offering of C$143.8 million of equity and the issue of US$175 million of debt.[4]
The corporate head office was in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada but moved to Toronto in 2008.[5]
HudBay Minerals[edit]
Founded as Pan American Resources Inc., the company first went public on the Montreal Exchange under the symbol PAN in the 3rd quarter of 1996.[6]
Pan American acquired all of Ontzinc Corporation on March 12, 2002. Subsequently the company renamed itself OntZinc Corporation on August 15, 2002.[7] Upon acquisition of Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting Co., Limited, the company renamed itself Hudbay Minerals Inc. on December 24, 2004.[8]
On August 26, 2008, Hudbay Minerals Inc. announced the completion of a business combination with Skye Resources Inc.[9] Skye Resources was renamed HMI Nickel, and was a subsidiary of Hudbay Minerals until Hudbay divested of the project through the sale of its interest in CGN to the Solway Group in September 2011.[10]
In November, Hudbay Minerals Inc. and Lundin Mining Corporation announced an agreement to combine their resources and create a new major Canadian leader in global mining, however in February 2009, after a ruling by Ontario Securities Commission that Hudbay must allow its shareholders to vote on the plan, the companies announced that the deal had been terminated.[11][12]
On January 9, 2009, Hudbay Minerals announced suspended operations (and continue on care and maintenance) at Chisel North Mine in Snow Lake, Manitoba. The mine stopped producing in late February 2009, due to falling zinc metal prices and increased costs, and restarted operations in 2010.[13]
Operations[edit]
Hudbay now operates three underground mines in the province of Manitoba. The 777 Mine is located in Flin Flon, the Reed Lake Mine is located just off the highway past Cranberry Portage towards Snow Lake and Thompson, and the Lalor Mine is located near Snow Lake. The 777 mine in Flin Flon produces zinc and copper along with lesser amounts of gold and silver.
Today the original 1930 Island Falls hydroelectric facility is owned and operated by SaskPower.
In Q1 2017 Hudbay produced 34,731 tonnes of copper, 20,723 ounces of gold and 30,570 tonnes of zinc. The Company reported a quarterly loss per share of $0.01, impacted by lower sales volumes. [14]
Controversy surrounding HudBay Minerals' former Guatemalan operations[edit]
The Fenix ferro-nickel project in Guatemala is owned by Compañía Guatemalteca de Niquel (CGN), which was 98.2% owned by HudBay Minerals from August 2008 to September 2011. The Fenix Project in eastern Guatemala is a substantial brownfield nickel laterite mine and process plant that has been on care and maintenance since 1980.[15]
HudBay Minerals and two of its subsidiaries are subject to an ongoing $12 million lawsuit in Canada over the killing of a prominent Mayan community leader at the Fenix Mining Project.[16][17] The lawsuit alleges that on September 27, 2009, security personnel employed at the Fenix mine surrounded, beat and hacked at Adolfo Ich Chamán with machetes before shooting him in the head at close range in an unprovoked attack.[18] An arrest warrant was issued for the Head of Security at the Fenix mine, Mynor Ronaldo Padilla Gonzáles.[19] A non-governmental organization has referred to the murder as the “targeted killing of a well-known community leader.” [16] Amnesty International has stated with respect to the murder allegation “[t]he allegations are very serious, and Amnesty International calls for a swift, full and impartial investigation into the death of Adolfo Ich Chamán and other incidents of violence, to make the results public and to bring those responsible to justice”.[20]
HudBay states that it and CGN have cooperated fully with all investigations conducted by Guatemalan authorities in connection with the incidents which occurred on September 27, 2009, in El Estor. CGN carried out an internal investigation and determined that none of its employees or security personnel were involved in the death of Chamán.[21][22]
In June 2013, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice ruled that the Canadian company could be held legally responsible for crimes committed in Guatemala, including the alleged murder of Adolfo Ich Chamán and the alleged sexual assault of 11 women from Lote Ocho. A jury notice was filed in December 2013.[23]
The Fenix mining project is also subject to ongoing land claims by local Mayan communities. In 2006, the International Labour Organization, an agency of the United Nations, ruled that Guatemala had breached international law by granting the Fenix mining concession without first consulting with local Mayan people. The ILO released a report discussing the violation in 2007.[24]
In late 2006 and early 2007, Skye Resources (acquired by HudBay Minerals in 2008, renamed HMI Nickel and subsequently sold by HudBay in 2011) sought forced evictions of Mayan communities located on contested mine land. Homes were burned to the ground during these evictions.[25][26]

HudBay is a Canadian mining corporation. Founded as Hudson Bay Mining & Smelting Co., Limited (HBM&S), it has been exploring and mining in Manitoba for over 80 years. Much of its history has centered on Flin Flon, Manitoba. HudBay now has operations in Manitoba, Peru, and Yukon.[2]

History[edit]
Hudson Bay Mining & Smelting[edit]
The Flin Flon orebody was discovered by David Collins, a local trapper, and shown to Tom Creighton, a prospector, in 1914.[3] The first claim was registered in 1915. It took more than a dozen years to bring the mine into production because the ore body was huge, of high grade, required large amounts of hydro energy, was isolated, and needed a smelter.
In 1927, the Whitney family of New York created HBM&S, which took over controlling interest in the Flin Flon property.[3] By 1930, the mine, smelter, hydroelectric dam and railroad were in full operation.
On December 21, 2004, Hudbay Minerals (HudBay) acquired Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting (HBMS) for C$316 million from Anglo American plc. The purchase was financed by a public offering of C$143.8 million of equity and the issue of US$175 million of debt.[4]
The corporate head office was in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada but moved to Toronto in 2008.[5]
HudBay Minerals[edit]
Founded as Pan American Resources Inc., the company first went public on the Montreal Exchange under the symbol PAN in the 3rd quarter of 1996.[6]
Pan American acquired all of Ontzinc Corporation on March 12, 2002. Subsequently the company renamed itself OntZinc Corporation on August 15, 2002.[7] Upon acquisition of Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting Co., Limited, the company renamed itself Hudbay Minerals Inc. on December 24, 2004.[8]
On August 26, 2008, Hudbay Minerals Inc. announced the completion of a business combination with Skye Resources Inc.[9] Skye Resources was renamed HMI Nickel, and was a subsidiary of Hudbay Minerals until Hudbay divested of the project through the sale of its interest in CGN to the Solway Group in September 2011.[10]
In November, Hudbay Minerals Inc. and Lundin Mining Corporation announced an agreement to combine their resources and create a new major Canadian leader in global mining, however in February 2009, after a ruling by Ontario Securities Commission that Hudbay must allow its shareholders to vote on the plan, the companies announced that the deal had been terminated.[11][12]
On January 9, 2009, Hudbay Minerals announced suspended operations (and continue on care and maintenance) at Chisel North Mine in Snow Lake, Manitoba. The mine stopped producing in late February 2009, due to falling zinc metal prices and increased costs, and restarted operations in 2010.[13]
Operations[edit]
Hudbay now operates three underground mines in the province of Manitoba. The 777 Mine is located in Flin Flon, the Reed Lake Mine is located just off the highway past Cranberry Portage towards Snow Lake and Thompson, and the Lalor Mine is located near Snow Lake. The 777 mine in Flin Flon produces zinc and copper along with lesser amounts of gold and silver.
Today the original 1930 Island Falls hydroelectric facility is owned and operated by SaskPower.
In Q1 2017 Hudbay produced 34,731 tonnes of copper, 20,723 ounces of gold and 30,570 tonnes of zinc. The Company reported a quarterly loss per share of $0.01, impacted by lower sales volumes. [14]
Controversy surrounding HudBay Minerals' former Guatemalan operations[edit]
The Fenix ferro-nickel project in Guatemala is owned by Compañía Guatemalteca de Niquel (CGN), which was 98.2% owned by HudBay Minerals from August 2008 to September 2011. The Fenix Project in eastern Guatemala is a substantial brownfield nickel laterite mine and process plant that has been on care and maintenance since 1980.[15]
HudBay Minerals and two of its subsidiaries are subject to an ongoing $12 million lawsuit in Canada over the killing of a prominent Mayan community leader at the Fenix Mining Project.[16][17] The lawsuit alleges that on September 27, 2009, security personnel employed at the Fenix mine surrounded, beat and hacked at Adolfo Ich Chamán with machetes before shooting him in the head at close range in an unprovoked attack.[18] An arrest warrant was issued for the Head of Security at the Fenix mine, Mynor Ronaldo Padilla Gonzáles.[19] A non-governmental organization has referred to the murder as the “targeted killing of a well-known community leader.” [16] Amnesty International has stated with respect to the murder allegation “[t]he allegations are very serious, and Amnesty International calls for a swift, full and impartial investigation into the death of Adolfo Ich Chamán and other incidents of violence, to make the results public and to bring those responsible to justice”.[20]
HudBay states that it and CGN have cooperated fully with all investigations conducted by Guatemalan authorities in connection with the incidents which occurred on September 27, 2009, in El Estor. CGN carried out an internal investigation and determined that none of its employees or security personnel were involved in the death of Chamán.[21][22]
In June 2013, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice ruled that the Canadian company could be held legally responsible for crimes committed in Guatemala, including the alleged murder of Adolfo Ich Chamán and the alleged sexual assault of 11 women from Lote Ocho. A jury notice was filed in December 2013.[23]
The Fenix mining project is also subject to ongoing land claims by local Mayan communities. In 2006, the International Labour Organization, an agency of the United Nations, ruled that Guatemala had breached international law by granting the Fenix mining concession without first consulting with local Mayan people. The ILO released a report discussing the violation in 2007.[24]
In late 2006 and early 2007, Skye Resources (acquired by HudBay Minerals in 2008, renamed HMI Nickel and subsequently sold by HudBay in 2011) sought forced evictions of Mayan communities located on contested mine land. Homes were burned to the ground during these evictions.[25][26]

In November, Hudbay Minerals Inc. and Lundin Mining Corporation announced an agreement to combine their resources and create a new major Canadian leader in global mining, however in February 2009, after a ruling by Ontario Securities Commission that Hudbay must allow its shareholders to vote on the plan, the companies announced that the deal had been terminated.[11][12]
On January 9, 2009, Hudbay Minerals announced suspended operations (and continue on care and maintenance) at Chisel North Mine in Snow Lake, Manitoba. The mine stopped producing in late February 2009, due to falling zinc metal prices and increased costs, and restarted operations in 2010.[13]
Operations[edit]
Hudbay now operates three underground mines in the province of Manitoba. The 777 Mine is located in Flin Flon, the Reed Lake Mine is located just off the highway past Cranberry Portage towards Snow Lake and Thompson, and the Lalor Mine is located near Snow Lake. The 777 mine in Flin Flon produces zinc and copper along with lesser amounts of gold and silver.
Today the original 1930 Island Falls hydroelectric facility is owned and operated by SaskPower.
In Q1 2017 Hudbay produced 34,731 tonnes of copper, 20,723 ounces of gold and 30,570 tonnes of zinc. The Company reported a quarterly loss per share of $0.01, impacted by lower sales volumes. [14]
Controversy surrounding HudBay Minerals' former Guatemalan operations[edit]
The Fenix ferro-nickel project in Guatemala is owned by Compañía Guatemalteca de Niquel (CGN), which was 98.2% owned by HudBay Minerals from August 2008 to September 2011. The Fenix Project in eastern Guatemala is a substantial brownfield nickel laterite mine and process plant that has been on care and maintenance since 1980.[15]
HudBay Minerals and two of its subsidiaries are subject to an ongoing $12 million lawsuit in Canada over the killing of a prominent Mayan community leader at the Fenix Mining Project.[16][17] The lawsuit alleges that on September 27, 2009, security personnel employed at the Fenix mine surrounded, beat and hacked at Adolfo Ich Chamán with machetes before shooting him in the head at close range in an unprovoked attack.[18] An arrest warrant was issued for the Head of Security at the Fenix mine, Mynor Ronaldo Padilla Gonzáles.[19] A non-governmental organization has referred to the murder as the “targeted killing of a well-known community leader.” [16] Amnesty International has stated with respect to the murder allegation “[t]he allegations are very serious, and Amnesty International calls for a swift, full and impartial investigation into the death of Adolfo Ich Chamán and other incidents of violence, to make the results public and to bring those responsible to justice”.[20]
HudBay states that it and CGN have cooperated fully with all investigations conducted by Guatemalan authorities in connection with the incidents which occurred on September 27, 2009, in El Estor. CGN carried out an internal investigation and determined that none of its employees or security personnel were involved in the death of Chamán.[21][22]
In June 2013, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice ruled that the Canadian company could be held legally responsible for crimes committed in Guatemala, including the alleged murder of Adolfo Ich Chamán and the alleged sexual assault of 11 women from Lote Ocho. A jury notice was filed in December 2013.[23]
The Fenix mining project is also subject to ongoing land claims by local Mayan communities. In 2006, the International Labour Organization, an agency of the United Nations, ruled that Guatemala had breached international law by granting the Fenix mining concession without first consulting with local Mayan people. The ILO released a report discussing the violation in 2007.[24]
In late 2006 and early 2007, Skye Resources (acquired by HudBay Minerals in 2008, renamed HMI Nickel and subsequently sold by HudBay in 2011) sought forced evictions of Mayan communities located on contested mine land. Homes were burned to the ground during these evictions.[25][26]
