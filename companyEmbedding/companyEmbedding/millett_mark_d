			Mark D. Millett, a co-founder of our Company and a director since inception, was appointed our President and Chief Executive Officer effective January 1, 2012. Prior to that, from April 2011, Mr. Millett served as our President and Chief Operating Officer and, from June 2008 to April 2011, our Executive Vice President of Metals Recycling and Ferrous Resources and President and Chief Operating Officer of OmniSource Corporation. In that role, he was responsible for the Company's metallic resources platform, including all ferrous and nonferrous metals recycling operations, as well as the Company's ironmaking initiatives. In 2007 and 2008, Mr. Millett managed the Company's flat roll operations, including the Butler Flat Roll Division, Jeffersonville coating facilities and The Techs. From 1998 to 2007, Mr. Millett managed the Company's Flat Roll Division at Butler, Indiana, including the hot mill, cold mill, and coating facilities. Between 1993 and 1996, Mr. Millett was responsible for the design, construction and start-up operation of the Company's Butler, Indiana flat roll, melting and casting operations. A metallurgist by training, Mr. Millett, prior to his co-founding of Steel Dynamics, served from 1981 to 1985 as chief metallurgist for Nucor Corporation's Darlington, South Carolina, division, charged with developing the world's first commercially viable thin-slab-casting process as the manager of that project at Nucor's Hazelett facility. In 1987, Mr. Millett was given the responsibility by Nucor for the design, construction, staffing, and operation of the melting and casting facility at Nucor's world's-first thin-slab casting facility at Crawfordsville, Indiana. Mr. Millett holds a bachelor's degree in metallurgy from the University of Surrey in England (1981). Mr. Millett was named Steelmaker of the Year in 2014 by the Association of Iron and Steel Technology. Mr. Millett brings to the Board both a wealth of training and experience in steel metallurgy and in casting and coating technology and, by reason of his leadership of the Company's iron initiative projects, a comprehensive knowledge of iron making technology as well as, by reason of his leadership of OmniSource Corporation, a strategic and operational understanding of scrap metal recycling as both a resource for a steel manufacturing business and as an independent business platform.

This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.
