                    My favorite places to take family and friends, and I encourage my clients also is to take in, the Alamo, walk around it, read about it, and then go across the street, down some steps to the San Antonio River.   I love this area, good food, good music, some pretty good jazz,  good shopping and lots of flavor of San Antonio.  If you want to take a day trip around the historical missions,  rent a bike and take a ride.   So much history of this area surrounds these missions and they are fun to visit and a great day trip on the bike, or an afternoon in a car. Of course the Majestic Theater and the new Tobin Center of Performing Arts should be at the top of your list to visit.

                    Buying the right home can be very challenging these days.  How's it working for you?  In my past experience, what I've found is that most agents just don't have a plan to help their buyers.  
My technique may be a little different, but my buyers ALWAYS find exactly what they've been dreaming about.  How?  I take the time and sit down with you and your family and really get to know you during a consultation.  I will only show you properties that matches what you want.  I will negotiate aggressively on your behalf.  I will help make the process as stress free as possible.  Hire me and you'll recognize that I do so much more than the average agent!

                    San Antonio is a great town with a diverse population. There is something here for everyone. If you are a foodie, you should check out the hot new restaurants in Southtown. Love craft beer and live music, check out the Alamo Beer Company. Love local fare, you have to head out to the Pearl Market at the Pearl Brewery. Want to immerse yourself in the culture, set your sights on Market Square. Lastly, San Antonio has the River Walk once described as the American Venice! On the River Walk one can take a river boat tour, grab a margarita at one of the many restaurants that line the river, ghost hunt at the historic Menger, visit the Alamo where Davy Crockett and the Texian Army took their last stand against Santa Anna and so much more. Once you get here you'll never want to leave, trust me, I'm a transplant!
