CIC Changes Name to iSIGN
New Name and “ISGN” Trading Symbol Reflect Company Focus on Electronic Signature and Digital Transaction Management Solutions



















December 14, 2015 10:16 ET

 | Source: iSign Solutions Inc.






REDWOOD SHORES, Calif., Dec.  14, 2015  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Communication Intelligence Corporation (“CIC”), a leading supplier of electronic signature and other software solutions enabling secure and cost-effective management of document-based digital transactions, today announced that it changed its corporate name to iSign Solutions Inc. (“iSIGN”) and changed the trading symbol of its common stock to “ISGN” (OTCQB:ISGN). In addition, the company introduced its new corporate logo at www.isignnow.com. A new website is under development. “iSIGN, a trademark we have owned and used for over a decade, better reflects our company’s current focus, future strategy and near term product roadmap,” said Philip Sassower, co-chairman and chief executive officer for iSIGN. “A signature, whether to approve the terms of a contract or to authorize a payment transaction, is at the core of what we do and of the processes supported by our end-to-end electronic signature, biometric authentication and simple-to-complex workflow management solutions. We are making this change now in conjunction with a more aggressive push into digital transaction management solutions in the U.S. and in international markets, including in the European Union as a function of our relationship with France-based Cegedim S.A.” The new name and trading symbol are currently in effect. The CUSIP number for the company’s capital stock also has changed. The company’s board, management and employees remain unchanged. These changes have no effect on our agreements, including those with clients, partners and vendors. ABOUT iSIGN iSIGN (formerly know as Communication Intelligence Corporation or CIC) is a leading provider of digital transaction management (DTM) software enabling fully digital (paperless) business processes. iSIGN’s solutions encompass a wide array of functionality and services, including electronic signatures, simple-to-complex workflow management and various options for biometric authentication. These solutions are available across virtually all enterprise, desktop and mobile environments as a seamlessly integrated software platform for both ad-hoc and fully automated transactions. iSIGN’s software platform can be deployed both on-premise and as a cloud-based service, with the ability to easily transition between deployment models. iSIGN is headquartered in Silicon Valley. For more information, please visit our website at www.isignnow.com. iSIGN’s logo is a trademark of iSIGN.

Home/Products

 






iSign®

 
iSign® Console™
leverages SignatureOne® Ceremony™ Server’s core signature engine and is ideal for organizations looking for a standalone electronic signature solution. Through its intuitive graphical interface, iSign® Console™ allows users to upload documents for signature, select signers and signature methods, and manage and enforce document workflow for routing, reviewing, signing and notifications. iSign® Console™ offers a secure and intuitive solution that requires no integration and is available on-premise or in the cloud.
 

iSign® Mobile
is an option that can be implemented in conjunction with iSIGN’s electronic signature solutions and enables the capture of esignatures on tablets (Android, iOS, Win8) and smartphones (Android, iOS).  This solution integrates face-to-face signature ceremonies with more prevalent remote location ceremonies and can provide a richer and “high-touch” user experience.
 

iSign® Forms
is an option that can be implemented in conjunction with iSIGN’s electronic signature solutions and enables signers to complete documents prior to signing.  This functionality reduces our client’s transaction processing time and ensures that signer-filled data is captured, confirmed, locked-down and available in the document’s audit trail and final XML.
 

iSign® Live
is a patent-pending solution that, through its simultaneous co-browsing functionality, allows our clients to demystify electronic signatures and other electronic document processes for their customers that require a greater level of support. This solution can significantly shorten the cost and time required for certain electronic transactions, maximizing the benefits available to our clients. All co-browsing ceremony events are added to the transaction audit trail.
 

iSign® Offline
leverages the advanced capabilities of SignatureOne® Ceremony™ Server and certain iSign® products and services for clients with disconnected mode and delayed synchronization requirements.
 

iSign® Secure
is a server solution that leverages iSIGN’s patented biometric signature verification technology and integrates a suite of complementary functionality for authentication, verification and identity management.
