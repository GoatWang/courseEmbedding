Product Description▼▲
Yearning for a fresh start, Ewan McKay travels with his aunt and uncle from northern Scotland to West Virginia, promising to trade his skills in the clay business for financial assistance from his uncle Hugh. Hugh purchases a brickmaking operation from a Civil War widow and her daughter, but it's Ewan who gets the business up and running again. Ewan seeks help from Laura, the former owner's daughter, and he feels a connection with her, but she's being courted by another man--a lawyer with far more social clout and money than Ewan. Besides, Ewan has resolved he'll focus on making the brickmaking operation enough of a success that he can become a partner in the businessand be able to afford to bring his sisters over from Scotland.

Publisher's Description▼▲
In the clay-rich hills of the newly founded state of West Virginia, two families tentatively come together to rebuild a war-torn brickmaking business.Ewan McKay has immigrated to West Virginia with his aunt and uncle, promising to trade his skills in the clay business for financial help. Uncle Hugh purchases a brickmaking operation from a Civil War widow and her daughter, and it's Ewan's job to get the company up and running again. Ewan seeks help from Laura, the former owner's daughter, and he quickly feels a connection with her, but she's being courted by another man--a lawyer with far more social clout and money than Ewan. Resolving that he'll make the brickworks enough of a success that he can become a partner in the business and be able to afford to bring his sisters over from Ireland, Ewan pours all his energy into the new job. But when Hugh signs a bad business deal, all Ewan's hard work is put in jeopardy. As his hopes for the future crumble, Laura reveals something surprising. Can she help him save the brickworks, and will Ewan finally get a shot at winning her heart?

Nice brickmaking details, but the writing had some problems

            "The Brickmaker's Bride" is a historical novel set in 1868. The author described many details about how bricks were made, and she worked in historical details like how the recent Civil War affected the number of skilled laborers that were available for Ewan to hire.


I found the main characters interesting, but I felt like the story started in one direction and then headed in another. It seemed like a story about Ewan not having the high-class social skills need to get contracts for the brickyard and feeling not worthy of the Laura. Meanwhile, Laura thinks he won't want to marry her if he knew her secret. Ewan's situation didn't really change. But the story's focus changed to the troubles that Ewan has at the brickyard.


I was exasperated that Ewan was so self-righteous about his not pursuing Laura while someone else was courting her and then he's suddenly kissing her in the open at a work site. And then kisses her again before they start courting. And again before she agrees to marry him. But he's not very understanding toward a relative who is tempted by a handsome man.


Ewan also started out with a strong faith in God, yet he ended up more anxious about things than his unbelieving uncle. Finally, I was disappointed that the author often skipped scenes that she'd built up to. For example, Ewan is worried how his uncle will take some news and Laura promises to support him during the confrontation and...we skip that whole confrontation.


There was no sex or bad language. Overall, I'd recommend this book to fans of historical novels.

            A great story that shows how faith can get you through anything. I have enjoyed Judith's books in the past and this can be added to my list of books that I really liked. Judith does a wonderful job of pulling you into the story, maybe wanting to slap someone really hard, many times even, oh yes, you have to read to see how cruel one person can be.

            The Brickmakers Bride by Judith Miller is an excellent story of post Civil War days in West Virginia.  Judith Miller shares how difficult it was to run a brickmaking operation when most of the men had been killed in the war or no longer able to do manual labor. You will feel Ewan McKays desperation to make the operation a success and to bring his younger sisters from Ireland.


Judith Miller has done an great job of making you feel the  frustrations and pain as well as love and joy felt by the characters in this book. The story was easy to follow.   I was given this book by Bethany House and thoroughly enjoyed it.

            I really wanted to like this book but sadly it was not my favorite. However, the historical content was interesting as was learning about the brickmaking business. The main character, Laura, and her mother sell their brickmaking business to Ewan and his uncle who have a tenuous relationship. They don't agree on how to run the business which creates conflict. Ewan wants to run the company in the best and wisest way possible so Laura agrees to help as she grew up in the business and is very knowledgeable. There are other characters in the book but they cause a lot of conflict and drama I found that annoyed me which is one of the reasons I did not like this book. 


I give this book 3 out of 5 stars as it was well written but not an enjoyable read as I would have liked.


I received a free copy of this book from Bethany House in exchange for an honest review.

Product Description▼▲
Yearning for a fresh start, Ewan McKay travels with his aunt and uncle from northern Scotland to West Virginia, promising to trade his skills in the clay business for financial assistance from his uncle Hugh. Hugh purchases a brickmaking operation from a Civil War widow and her daughter, but it's Ewan who gets the business up and running again. Ewan seeks help from Laura, the former owner's daughter, and he feels a connection with her, but she's being courted by another man--a lawyer with far more social clout and money than Ewan. Besides, Ewan has resolved he'll focus on making the brickmaking operation enough of a success that he can become a partner in the businessand be able to afford to bring his sisters over from Scotland.

Publisher's Description▼▲
In the clay-rich hills of the newly founded state of West Virginia, two families tentatively come together to rebuild a war-torn brickmaking business.Ewan McKay has immigrated to West Virginia with his aunt and uncle, promising to trade his skills in the clay business for financial help. Uncle Hugh purchases a brickmaking operation from a Civil War widow and her daughter, and it's Ewan's job to get the company up and running again. Ewan seeks help from Laura, the former owner's daughter, and he quickly feels a connection with her, but she's being courted by another man--a lawyer with far more social clout and money than Ewan. Resolving that he'll make the brickworks enough of a success that he can become a partner in the business and be able to afford to bring his sisters over from Ireland, Ewan pours all his energy into the new job. But when Hugh signs a bad business deal, all Ewan's hard work is put in jeopardy. As his hopes for the future crumble, Laura reveals something surprising. Can she help him save the brickworks, and will Ewan finally get a shot at winning her heart?

                This review was written for The Brickmaker's Bride, Refined by Love Series #1.
            
 
            "The Brickmaker's Bride" is a historical novel set in 1868. The author described many details about how bricks were made, and she worked in historical details like how the recent Civil War affected the number of skilled laborers that were available for Ewan to hire.


I found the main characters interesting, but I felt like the story started in one direction and then headed in another. It seemed like a story about Ewan not having the high-class social skills need to get contracts for the brickyard and feeling not worthy of the Laura. Meanwhile, Laura thinks he won't want to marry her if he knew her secret. Ewan's situation didn't really change. But the story's focus changed to the troubles that Ewan has at the brickyard.


I was exasperated that Ewan was so self-righteous about his not pursuing Laura while someone else was courting her and then he's suddenly kissing her in the open at a work site. And then kisses her again before they start courting. And again before she agrees to marry him. But he's not very understanding toward a relative who is tempted by a handsome man.


Ewan also started out with a strong faith in God, yet he ended up more anxious about things than his unbelieving uncle. Finally, I was disappointed that the author often skipped scenes that she'd built up to. For example, Ewan is worried how his uncle will take some news and Laura promises to support him during the confrontation and...we skip that whole confrontation.


There was no sex or bad language. Overall, I'd recommend this book to fans of historical novels.

            A great story that shows how faith can get you through anything. I have enjoyed Judith's books in the past and this can be added to my list of books that I really liked. Judith does a wonderful job of pulling you into the story, maybe wanting to slap someone really hard, many times even, oh yes, you have to read to see how cruel one person can be.

                This review was written for The Brickmaker's Bride, Refined by Love Series #1.
            
 
            The Brickmakers Bride by Judith Miller is an excellent story of post Civil War days in West Virginia.  Judith Miller shares how difficult it was to run a brickmaking operation when most of the men had been killed in the war or no longer able to do manual labor. You will feel Ewan McKays desperation to make the operation a success and to bring his younger sisters from Ireland.


Judith Miller has done an great job of making you feel the  frustrations and pain as well as love and joy felt by the characters in this book. The story was easy to follow.   I was given this book by Bethany House and thoroughly enjoyed it.

                This review was written for The Brickmaker's Bride, Refined by Love Series #1.
            
 
            I really wanted to like this book but sadly it was not my favorite. However, the historical content was interesting as was learning about the brickmaking business. The main character, Laura, and her mother sell their brickmaking business to Ewan and his uncle who have a tenuous relationship. They don't agree on how to run the business which creates conflict. Ewan wants to run the company in the best and wisest way possible so Laura agrees to help as she grew up in the business and is very knowledgeable. There are other characters in the book but they cause a lot of conflict and drama I found that annoyed me which is one of the reasons I did not like this book. 


I give this book 3 out of 5 stars as it was well written but not an enjoyable read as I would have liked.


I received a free copy of this book from Bethany House in exchange for an honest review.

        Understated elegance
This Judith Ripka bracelet is truly an everyday piece. The bracelet feels substantial on your wrist. I love that there is a hidden clasp on it. It's one of the most understated but elegant bracelets I own. I too ordered the 8" bracelet after reading that the bracelet ran small. It fits perfectly. The hearts are beautiful but they also remind me of paw prints so you can think of it that way as well.

        Elegance made just right
I've been a collector of Judith's jewelry for decades, and sometimes I'm not in the mood for her larger pieces -- but I still love her design aesthetic. I was attracted to this piece because it contains many of her design trademarks: the panther with berge carving, her diamonique-kissed hearts and the solid clasp.

For a smaller, more everyday look, this bracelet still has a decent amount of heft and subtle sparkle ... an elegant look on a more diminutive scale. A winner!

        Well -- I love this bracelet
I am very pleased with this bracelet. It is more appropriate for every day wear than some of my more ornate JR bracelets. It is flat so it doesn't catch on things. The clasp is sturdy and I think it has a nice weight to it. I'm very pleased with this item. I wear more of a 7 1/2 inch bracelet and find the 7 and 3/4 length better for the workday. The DQ hearts are a nice touch and the lower setting is again better for practical wearing.

        Nothing Special
I love Judith Ripka and have a ton of her items which I love. However, I was unimpressed with this bracelet. I purchased as a wear-everyday-with-everythng bracelet similar to a tennis bracelet but was disappointed that it barely shows up on the wrist. It is small and very lightweight and the hearts have no bling and just "aren't there!" In fact, I could not feel it on my wrist and was so afraid i'd lose it without knowing. I would like this style better without the hearts with the same design links only broader and heavier. The fastener was difficult for me as well. I ordered the 8" which fit more like a 7 1/4." which made it difficult to open and close. I believe this bracelet is more for someone with a very small wrist. Though my wrist is average 7 1/4" it is not for me. Sorry, Judith, I love most of your items. This one just isn't for me.

        WORST PURCHASE FROM JR
The host was raving on and on about how this was the best bracelet Judith has ever done. I am shocked because this was my absolute worst purchase from Judith Ripka's line. The bracelet is so light weight it is unbelievable! The links kink and are difficult to straighten. It looks like a bracelet that I would purchase for my 10 year old niece. I own a LOT of Judith's pieces and love her line, but lately everything I've received from her is horrible and I've had to pay to return it. Bring us the quality pieces that we were all use to, not all this cheap dime store quality jewelry.

        I keep trying....
To like Judith....this bracelet seemed a lot nicer on line and tv....bought at a reduced price and can't imagine it at the regular price. ..not even worth the sale price. It looks cheap. I bought the colored version and didn't realize it's almost striped looking, and the heart is thin and key tiny.

        Love, love, love these
I love this bracelet so much more than I expected to. I thought it would be like the smaller verona bracelet and therefore waaay overpriced. Instead, I found this bracelet has large chunky links with great texture. These links have deeper grooves, which I love, and for me the colors are fantastic. I bought the rose, the sterling and then the yellow. I got them all "as is" and am thrilled with each one.
I love the look of the frosty silver color. The yellow is a little tight on me because I had to get the 7 1/4" because there was no 8" in yellow "as is." The yellow one is particularly gorgeous because of its rich buttery color.
I think I missed out on the black, but hopefully it'll show up "as is" in the 8" or the 7 1/4." My wrist measures 7 1/4", so I can use either size. I prefer the larger size, but either will do, if you have the same size wrist as me.
I'd love to have a necklace in this link, but I'm sure it would cost a fortune. Thanks for "as is" QVC, no way could I have these without it. I really appreciate the low prices and sometimes even EP on "as is" items.

        Love My Heart Bracelet
I love my Chocolate Heart Bracelet! Yes, it is difficult to clasp, and yes, it could use a few more links for a drapier fit, but it is gorgeous! The Diamonique heart and key are so sparkly and sweet. I love the chocolate brown color and the shimmer of the links. I wear my bracelet often! Love those Judith Ripka hearts!

        Beautiful But Not Long Enough
Loved it but because it is so chunky, needs to be longer in length to work for my wrist. Always a problem with me. Perhaps Judith you could devise a textured link to extend like they do on the watches. I tried my trustee magnets but due to the thickness of the links, which are beautiful, it doesn't work. I'll keep trying as when it does work it's a keeper.

        Beautiful But........
I love the design of this bracelet. The heart and key and the overall design. I ordered the sterling silver version and ultimately decided to keep the bracelet but I am taking it to a jeweler to have extra links added. I ordered the 8 inch version and it is extremely difficult to clasp without assistance from another person. This is why the low review. It is not an inexpensive bracelet so I would think it should actually be longer than 8 inches so that it would fit like an 8 inch bracelet.

        Nice bracelet too hard to put on
I have to return this item. I ordered the cheapie $89 JR bracelet and had to return that, no clasp end, you were just supposed to clasp to a link! Now this bracelet actually has a clasp end it's just too darn small and the bracelet too tight to clasp properly. I have a 7" wrist and this 8" bracelet just did not have enough chain for me to clasp it. Unless you want a bracelet that is hard to put on-- don't bother. Tired of returning JR items.

        Beautiful but not well made
I was absolutely thrilled to receive the bracelet. It was gorgeous, and it immediately attracted a number of compliments. However, after wearing it daily for 1 week, the charms suddenly just disconnected and fell to the ground while I was simply walking in my apartment....definitely not up to Judith Ripka's usual standards. So, I am returning the bracelet (sadly).

Home  Info  Animal Welfare  For the love of Judith 















						For the love of Judith





For the love of Judith . . . and all others like her

The following story was inspired by data documented on an animal rescue website.

They should have called her Angel, but instead she was given a name more reflective of her masters’ despicable character, abusive behaviour and unconscionable betrayal. I don’t possess any information about Judith’s life before she mistakenly arrived at this house of horrors, but I know indisputably that her story holds true for innumerable dogs at this very moment. I never met Judith, but her tragic beginning implores me to give her a voice, while her heart wrenching image propels me to continue advocating on behalf of innocent animals awaiting justice.

  Try if you can to imagine where you were ten years ago. Remember your surroundings, daily activities, ongoing interactions and aspirations. Consider how many days and hours you have passed in this decade filled with countless experiences and unforgettable memories. Now envision yourself restrained by a cold, steel chain bound to your neck condemning you to an uninhabitable wooden dog house for ten torturous years. This was the life of Judith . . . and for many others like her.

  I internalize the mixed feelings of anxiety and excitement of a vulnerable animal going to a new home, ready to start a lifelong commitment of providing fierce loyalty, unconditional love and everlasting companionship to a worthy family. Without any background knowledge, I can presume that these were the emotions experienced by Judith as she arrived at her new home. Maybe this was not the case. Perhaps she was violently taken and shown cruelty from the moment they set their sinful eyes on her. Like all dogs, her only desire was to feel loved in return for her consistent devotion. What she received was the most vicious torment one could ever endure. For one hundred twenty months, Judith suffered in silence. Her cries were noticed, but perpetually ignored. Instead of preparing for the joy of a new pet, her owners contemplated the many ways in which they could inflict punishment.

  With the name “JUDAS” crudely spray-painted on her makeshift dog house, Judith began her life of agony. All the while she would wonder what she had done to cause such hatred. This ill-fated dog spent ten years waiting for freedom, but until that day would arrive, the rest of the world existed around her as she politely stared at the same surroundings to the point of madness.

  The same chains, dog house, dirt and fear would envelope her unspeakable life. To further her sentence, Judith was never given any toys with which to play and occupy the excruciating monotony of every passing minute. While people went about their busy lives, Judith waited.

  As the seasons changed from hellish heat to unbearable cold, Judith suffered the oppressive sun without anyone to care about her intense thirst and exhaustion. When the acute deep freeze sustained the long winter months, nobody brought her inside or offered her a blanket.

  Overtime, her coat became thick and matted; her legs deformed and crippled from exposure; her health deteriorated from malnutrition, and eventually her vibrant brown fur turned a deeper shade of grey. But still she waited. Judith waited for someone to cut her chains which left her sitting in her own bodily waste and that of her masters.

  In addition to denying Judith any proper food, water and cleanliness, her owners committed a revolting act of indecency in order to strip away any shred of remaining dignity. Bordered by her excrement and with nowhere to run, she awaited further maltreatment. Judith’s “human” owners never came outside to lovingly feed or play fetch, but rather to stand over and defile her. Neighbours witnessed this atrocity, but could do little to help since bylaw enforcers permitted Judith’s “family” to disgrace her with indignant acts of violence.

  How this magnificent beauty managed to stay alive is a testament to her undying spirit. Through the grace of God, the day finally materialized when Judith’s wait was over. Human heroes had come to rescue her. She even barked with her innate duty to protect her family from intruders – a family who forced her to sleep on frozen ground, covered in snow. Rescue workers took photographs of her horrid living conditions, physical malformations and other devastating effects of neglect. Judith was given a hair cut to remove the infested matting and received healthy nourishment to fill her empty stomach. Judith experienced a lifetime of love in the seconds it took rescuers to bond with her. After her rehabilitation, Judith found her way into a home she deserved from the onset. This family loved her tremendously and spent their time expressing their fond adoration.

  With all the questions I would like to pose about the reasons for which Judith had to wait ten years to be rescued, I can currently answer one with certainty.  I truly believe Judith was an angel sent to incarnate a visual representation of societal indifference.

  Although she was given a name indicative of brutality, she was not the beast. Through all her unequivocal suffering, Judith never lost her trusting disposition and ability to adapt to a new environment. Her previous life makes me wonder how we can refer to ourselves as a society when such ruthlessness inflicted upon animals is permissible by way of apathy. When did we become so complacent in our ability to stand up for the rights and freedoms of animals? How can individual communities knowingly allow animals to be chained outside for a decade, under the worst conceivable conditions without consideration for their welfare?

  Sadly, Judith’s life in her new home wasn’t eternal. After a year of peace, the rainbow gate opened its arms to welcome her home after her mission on earth had been completed. She had been sent down to show the world that animals are beloved creatures to be respected and admired. Judith’s life touched so many hearts in a manner that will hopefully lead society to question its own beliefs, while encouraging the public to seek legislative change to animal welfare bylaws. By ignoring her pleas and those of other animals, we become just as guilty as Judith’s heinous keepers who demonstrated such disregard for her life.

  Let us use our conscience to form moral decisions in favour of unchaining animals by having the strength in our conviction that as a society, we cannot in good faith consent to this form of callousness.

Judith McNaught quotes   
(showing 1-30 of 420)





      “There will be a few times in your life when all your instincts will tell you to do something, something that defies logic, upsets your plans, and may seem crazy to others. When that happens, you do it. Listen to your instincts and ignore everything else. Ignore logic, ignore the odds, ignore the complications, and just go for it.”

      “If you would take one step forward, darling, you could cry in my arms. And while you do, I'll tell you how sorry I am for everything I've done -" Unable to wait, Ian caught her, pulling her tightly against him. "And when I'm finished," he whispered hoarsely as she wrapped her arms around him and wept brokenly, "you can help me find a way to forgive myself."Tortured by her tears, he clasped her tighter and rubbed his jaw against her temple, his voice a ravaged whisper: "I'm sorry," he told her. He cupped her face between his palms, tipping it up and gazing into her eyes, his thumbs moving over her wet cheeks. "I'm sorry." Slowly, he bent his head, covering her mouth with his. "I'm so damned sorry.”

      “Listen carefully to me, darling, because I'm giving you fair warning that I won't let you do this to us. You gave me your love, and I will not let you take it away. The harder you try, the harder I'll fight you. I'll haunt your dreams at night, exactly the way you have haunted mine every night I was away from you. You'll lie awake in bed at night, wanting me, and you'll know I'm lying awake wanting you. And when you can't stand it anymore you'll come back to me and I'll be there waiting for you. I'll cry in your arms, and I'll tell you I'm sorry for everything I have done and you'll help me find a way to forgive myself.”

      “If you'll kiss me back," he whispered huskily, brushing his lips along the curve of her jaw, "I'll make it sixmillion. If you'll go to bed with me tonight," he continued, losing himself in the scent of her perfume and the softness of her skin, "I'll give you the world. But if you'll move in with me," he continued, dragging his mouth across her cheek to the corner of her lips, "I'll do much better than that."Unable to turn her face farther because his arm was in the way, and unable to turn her body because his body was in the way, Meredith tried to infuse disdain in her voice and simultaneously ignore the arousing touch of his tongue against her ear. "Six million dollars and the whole world!" she said in a slightly shaky voice. "What else could you possibly give me if I move in with you?" "Paradise." Lifting his head, Matt took her chin between his thumb and forefinger and forced her to meethis gaze. In an aching, solemn voice he said, "I'll give you paradise on a gold platter. Anything you want— everything you want. I come with it, of course. It's a package deal." Meredith wallowed audibly, mesmerized by the melting look in his silver eyes and the rich timbre of his deep voice. "We'll be a family," he continued, describing the paradise he was offering while he bent his head to her again. "We'll have children ... I'd like six," he teased, his lips against her temple. "But I'll settle for one. You don't have to decide now." She drew in a ragged breath and Matt decided he'd pushed matters as far as he dared for one night. Straightening abruptly, he chucked her under her chin. "Think about it," he suggested with a grin.”

      “I've hurt you terribly my love, and I'll hunt you again during the next fifty years. And you are going to hurt me, Ian-never I hope as much as you are hurting me now. But if that's the way it has to be, then I'll endure it, because the only alternative is to live without you, and that is no life at all. And the difference is that I know it, and you don't... not yet...”

      “Because,” he said quietly as she stood up, “until you walked into it, this was an ordinary garden.”Puzzled, Elizabeth tipped her head. “What is it now?” “Heaven.”

      “Ian saw the tears shimmering in her magnificent eyes and one of them traced unheeded down her smooth cheek.With a raw ache in his voice he said, "If you would take one step forward, darling, you could cry in my arms. And while you do, I'll tell you how sorry I am for everything I've done - " Unable to wait, Ian caught her, pulling her tightly against him. "And when I'm finished," he whispered hoarsely as she wrapped her arms around him and wept brokenly, "you can help me find a way to forgive myself."Tortured by her tears, he clasped her tighter and rubbed his jaw against her temple, his voice a ravaged whisper: "I'm sorry," he told her. He cupped her face between his palms, tipping it up and gazing into her eyes, his thumbs moving over her wet cheeks. "I'm sorry." Slowly, he bent his head, covering her mouth with his. "I'm so damned sorry.”

      “What are you looking at?" Jordan demanded finally, watching her. "A dragon." When he looked bewildered she lifted her arm and pointed to the sky in the southeast. "Right there—that cloud—what do you see when you look at it?" "A fat cloud." Alexandra rolled her eyes at him. "What else do you see?" He was quiet for a moment studying the sky. "Five more fat clouds and three thin ones.”

      “With his current mood, Elizabeth realized, she was going to have to make her own opening. Lifting her eyes to his enigmatic golden ones, she said quietly, “Ian, have you ever wanted something very badly-something that was within your grasp-and yet you were afraid to reach out for it?” Surprised by her grave question and her use of his name, Ian tried to ignore the jealousy that had been eating at him all night. “No,” he said, scrupulously keeping the curtness from his voice as he gazed down at her alluring face. “Why do you ask? Is there something you want?” Her gaze fell from his, and she nodded at his frilled white shirtfront. “What is it you want?” “You.”

      “Clayton," she said softly, her voice threaded with tears, "when Vanessa asked about my accomplishments tonight, I forgot to mention that I do have one. And it's--it's so splendid that it compensates for my lack of all the others."Stephen and Clayton grinned at each other, neither of them hearing the emotion that clogged her voice. "What splendid accomplishments is that, little one?" Clayton asked.Her shoulders hunched forward and began to shake. "I made you love me," she whispered brokenly. "Somehow, some way, I actually made you love me.”
