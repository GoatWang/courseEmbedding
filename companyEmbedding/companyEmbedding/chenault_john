Main navigationTestimonials

Our excellent standing with the Better Business Bureau speaks for our commitment to outstanding products and service, but we take great joy in hearing from our satisfied clients. Here are a few letters we’ve received recently about work we have done.
Dear John,
Remember me – you recently installed solar screens on the windows at our condo in Plano and we love them. Yesterday your guys installed new windows at the home of our daughter and son-in-law, Jessica and Austin Jones, in Carrollton and they look fabulous! Our children bought that house about two years ago. It was built in 1989, and very little has been updated since then. Little by little, the kids added new paint and granite countertops which made the house look much better. I had no idea what a change new windows would make – inside and out. Now the house looks brand new – 21st century – absolutely amazing!!! Your guys did a careful job.
– Elizabeth
John, the replacement of all our windows and front door is complete! Jeanne (wife) and I wanted you to know something. We can’t speak highly enough about the professionalism, courtesy, cleanliness, meticulous attention to detail, respect, and friendliness shown by Zach and the entire installation crew! And my wife’s hard to please when it comes to cleanliness. You make sure to tell all the guys how much we truly appreciate them and the fantastic work they did to make our final home in our lifetime a beautiful and more energy efficient place to spend out our days. They treated this home like it was theirs. And treated us with the utmost of respect. And we truly, truly appreciate it. And if we have any problems, Zach has said not to hesitate to call. And we appreciate that, too. So never give up on your high standards. Somehow we think you won’t.
– Larry
Prices were well below competitors, and quality well above. Open communication, with reliable and efficient on-site interactions. Installers were professional and courteous, and follow-up by ownership with very minor remaining issue handled immediately and to complete satisfaction. Love doing business with “local” company, and John Chenault is doing everything right.
– Darren
Working with you and Doug has been a pleasure, Doug is clearly a tremendous asset and his easy going personality and quality/attention to detail in his work made all the difference for me and Lydia. If you ever need a reference for future work with new customers, feel free to use our name.
– Mike
“If you have an employee of the month, I nominate our crew. Your installers are top notch!”
– William Seideman
“Your installers were so nice and courteous. You are lucky to have them represent you.”
-Joanne Lee
” Dear John, thank you and your team for the great job installing our windows. They are beautiful and we’ve received many compliments from neighbors. The installers were really nice, polite, and neat.”
– Bill and Phyllis Carroll
“Dear John, thanks for the good service. It was a pleasure working with your company”
– Jack & Ruth Occhigrosso
“I just wanted to thank you for your speed and courtesy in replacing the glass in our french door. And I must say your workmen were the most prompt, polite and even cleaned up the mess and the windows! We have used a lot of contractors over the last few years and I’ve never seen anything like it. I will recommend your company to others and wish you all the best in the new year.”
– Cindy K. Boss
“Our home looks terrific!…The work is great and I can’t believe how cool and tranquil it is inside our home.”
– Karleen James
“Thank you very much for the professional repair of our family room window. We appreciated your quick response and the quality of your work. Dealing with you and your staff was a pleasure. We will certainly use Chenault’s Window Services again if we need to.”
– John and Karen Ahlquist
“The windows look good and we are proud of them. It is good to find a company this day and time who provides good services and good work. You and your men did both.”
– Bob Ratcliff
“I would like to thank you for the service and product you provided. The tabletop glass was beautiful and fit perfectly. The person you sent to install everything was super. He was neat, helpful, and went way beyond the norm to provide customer service. I will recommend your company to all my friends and you have my future business.”
-Ronda Smith, EDS
“Your crew did an outstanding job and did not even damage any of the window frames when they removed the old windows and installed the new ones. What a delight to know that I did not have to clean up after them. When they left the job site, my windows were shining clean and all debris had been removed to my satisfaction. They even replaced and repainted some rotted wood frames on a couple of my windows. I would highly recommend your firm to all our clients based on the quality of the work performed on my house.”

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'

When Kenneth Chenault first came to American Express more than 30 years ago as a young executive just off a two-and-a-half year consulting stint at Bain & Company, he looked around and saw an opportunity in the corporation’s struggling merchandising group. The person overseeing that group and the rest of Travel Related Services at the time was Louis V. Gerstner, Jr., who later went on to become CEO of RJR Nabisco and then IBM.
Gerstner advised Chenault against getting involved with the offshoot business selling jewelry, stereo equipment and other odds and ends by direct mail to American Express customers. In fact, said Gerstner, he was ready to shut the whole enterprise down.
“‘Do not take this job,’ Lou told me over and over,” Chenault, now the chairman and CEO of American Express, said during a recent Wharton Leadership Lecture. “But I said, ‘Lou, I want to take on a challenge.’ I never shied away from taking a risk, and I felt this was the way I should go.”







“My view is often to take on the assignments that no one else wants, particularly early on in a career.” –Kenneth Chenault
As Chenault started work, he looked around for what he called “the best and the brightest” available to him at American Express. He realized that because the division was a neglected part of the corporation, he would get experience in all aspects of that business, “something they would never have let some 33-year-old just out of the consulting business do otherwise. My view is often to take on the assignments that no one else wants, particularly early on in a career. Everyone wants to be in the glamorous part of a business. I wanted to learn.”
In the two years that Chenault ran merchant services, it went from an albatross to a profit center, its revenues more than tripling from $150 million to $500 million. Gerstner finally insisted Chenault join the credit card side of the corporation, and a leadership star was born. “Leadership takes many forms, but one thing that is most important is to realize that change is inevitable, especially in the age we live in now, and that you always have to be adaptable to change,” noted Chenault.
He emphasized that American Express itself was hardly a glamorous company when it started in 1850. It was the original company Henry Wells, William G. Fargo and John Butterfield founded to move freight. “Moving freight [was] not a business with a lot of glamour,” he said. “But they instituted core values that we still hold 163 years later in our day-to-day operations — integrity and customer commitment…. It is pretty extraordinary that a freight company founded in 1850 established a brand that remains relevant in 2013 in the digital age.”
Chenault took over as CEO in 2001 after a series of jobs that he held for 20 years at the company. It was unusual for an African American to reach the top of an American corporation, but Chenault has never felt his race either qualified him for a position or prevented him from getting it. He said he just had confidence in himself as a leader and went about his work methodically, never back-biting and always seeking advice even from executives who might have been competitors.


Knowledge@Wharton High School






“I really did not focus on becoming a CEO until around 10 years before it happened, but I worked with people who could be viewed as competition and worked well with them,” he stated. “I had straightforward conversations with them and said, ‘Let us focus on what is best for the company.’ I thought by doing that, everything would work out for the best.” When he became CEO, the top 10 executives in the 70,000-employee company all stayed on although over time, some left for other positions.
Identifying Good Leaders
Chenault described his leadership style as both simple and complex. The simple part, he said, is that he feels he has kept his integrity, that he has never tried to fool anyone and that he has been consistent in his goals: to serve that traditional triumvirate of customers, employees and shareholders.
He is constantly looking for good leaders in his company. He does not evaluate whether someone is a leader until he sees who that person’s followers are. “Who is listening to them? How many people respect him?” said Chenault, referring to the questions he asks of young leaders in particular. Mostly, he added, that is demonstrated when someone is both decisive and compassionate.
Chenault oversaw a restructuring of American Express’s business in 1995 as vice chairman. When it became clear he would have to eliminate nearly 16,000 jobs, he said decided to tell people up to 18 months before their actual departure date so that they would have time to adjust to the layoffs. “You do what you can to be compassionate, even when the news is bad,” Chenault said, which leads to another of his leadership principles — that the leader himself has to be a team player. “The point is not to just be a nice person, but be effective, too. Sometimes being a team player is using what I call constructive confrontation. Be courteous, but push forward on what needs to be done.”
Although Chenault said he does not devalue intellect — after all, he went to Bowdoin College, one of the nation’s best liberal arts schools, and Harvard Law School — what he values more than IQ is EQ — Executional Quotient. “A good leader wants to get it done,” he said. “EQ is the most important thing — to have the focus to get whatever the job at hand is completed.”
He believes leadership can, indeed, be taught, and while American Express does not have formal leadership training, Chenault hopes to teach by his own example. For instance, he likes to not only get consultations from his higher executives, but values feedback from every part of the company. “I reach down to all levels. Any employee who sends me a question, I respond. It may not be 100 lines, but something, and if people know you can be approached, they will come to you. That creates a positive attitude about the company.” Several times a year, he will go to different parts of the country and world and hold brown bag lunches with about 25 employees, none of them senior executives. “The physical presence of a leader is important. It shows the organization, no matter how large, cares about its [employees].
“I ask them only one thing, that when they leave the meeting, tell 20 people about it,” he said. “I don’t care if they say, ‘Ken is a jerk,’ because at least it brings a connection. It is impossible to maintain a relationship with 70,000 people, but I don’t believe in the imperial CEO. The best organizations create thousands of leaders.”
Two Role Models
Chenault admires a number of leaders, but pointed to two favorites: Nelson Mandela and Warren Buffett.
The most important thing he has learned from Mandela is that even when you are in a crisis, you have to think about the future. “Here was someone in prison who came out a stronger person,” noted Chenault. “It was not just about survival. He thought about the vision of what he wanted the country to become. It is hard to see anyone in modern history who came out from prison” such a hero.
“Sometimes being a team player is using what I call constructive confrontation.” –Kenneth Chenault
He said he doesn’t admire Buffett just because he owns 14% of American Express through Berkshire Hathaway. “He is someone who has an intellectual curiosity and is also incredibly genuine as a person,” said Chenault. “He admits that he loves business, but he also engages with people. He can walk down the street in Omaha or New York and will talk to people, tell a joke, sign a dollar bill for them. He has humanity and a steel trap mind. He has a nice swift way to say, ‘No’ — not in a harsh way, but [in a way that] does not waste people’s time.”
Chenault’s favorite quote about leadership is one he attributes to Napoleon: “The role of a leader is to define reality and give hope.” It is really difficult, he said, to find out the facts of a situation and to understand the ultimate implications. “You have to be open and honest to find reality, to get the right answers to your questions. But then you have to tell the people you lead what the reasons are to be hopeful, to tell them why you should inspire them.
“This is all easy in good times, but it is a deal-breaker during challenging times, and that is when you find out who the leader is,” he noted. “The reputations of individual leaders are truly made or lost in times of crisis. You must gain loyalty by being decisive and compassionate. Otherwise, your reputation will vanish.”

Is American Express still a member of ALEC?  If so,this belies much of what Mr. Chenault  claims AE is doing.




 

Ryan Hunter
Intriguing retrospective on a remarkable career.
Warren has always spoken fondly of Kenneth during shareholder meetings.  He refers to him as an “excellent manager” noting his execution and long-term total returns – in a similar manner as Warren refers to Tony Nicely of GEICO.
I’m particularly fond of Kenneth’s approach to spreading employee-to-employee connections across an organization: 
“I ask them only one thing, that when they leave the meeting, tell 20 people about it.”
I’d personally like to hear Kenneth describe a time in his career when he was at conflict with his own EQ (desire for execution).  A time when his hands were tied, either due to circumstances inside or outside of his control.  How did he break the cycle and move forward?  Inevitably this will occur for many of us in the course of our careers.  The inspiration would be invaluable.
Warm Regards

Sir:
     I am a very disgruntled customer, but not for very long ! As I get older, the words sorry and apologize are a part of just about every conversation, especially on the telephone or while chatting on the web. I call it the cowards plan book. No matter what happens, those two words can solve anything.
     I called “american” express, customer service. First I was in Mexico City, then, after requesting an American, then I was in
India ! 26 minutes on the telephone.  I was informed by ashima, badge # 73220, that an investigation was being done pertaining to
my request. Today, technology is at warp speed but the employees
are still working on the wheel !! Thank You Sir and good day.




 

William Smith
As a footnote to Mr. Chennault’s leadership skills with American Express, I would like to add a comment about the remarkable margin that unauthorized purchases made on cardholder’s behalf for $40 appointment calendars, $20 cookbooks – available elsewhere for $.99 et al shows rare business acumen and unscrupulous daring required in 21st century business leadership.
If I were bold enough to choose my clients’ purchases, make those purchases without their permission, and charge usurious rates on the purchase price I personally chose, perhaps I too could breathe the rarefied air of those with a fleet of Gulfstream’s at my disposal.
