Paylocity is a provider of cloud-based payroll and human capital management software solutions for medium-sized organizations.
History[edit]
The company was founded as Ameripay Payroll Ltd. by Steve Sarowitz in 1997.[1] It was renamed Paylocity in December 2005.[1][2] As the company grew, it relocated from Franklin Park, Illinois to Elk Grove Village, and to its current location in Arlington Heights. The company has leased 309,000 square feet of office space in the current headquarters of Zurich Insurance North America in Schaumburg,Illinois. The move will be complete in 2019.[3]
It was one of the 5,000 fastest growing private companies according to Inc. Magazine in 2003, 2004, and from 2007 to 2014.[4] The company was also included in the Deloitte Fast 500 as one of the fastest growing technology companies in 2013,[5] 2014,[6] and 2015.[7]
Paylocity successfully executed an initial public offering (IPO) in March 2014, raising over $82 million.

Buying a payroll product with a 20 or 40 year engine is like buying a 'new' car with a 20 or 40 year old engine. Not a good idea

Ask what's under the hood when shopping for payroll services. Question #1-how old is the processing engine? Would you buy a 20+ yr old car?

v.

STEVEN I. SAROWITZ, MARK H. MISHLER, STEVEN R. BEAUCHAMP, RONALD V. WATERS III, ANDRES D. REINER, JEFFREY T. DIEHL, and PAYLOCITY HOLDING CORPORATION, Defendants.

C.A. No. 12299-CB

Court of Chancery of Delaware

December 27, 2016
          Date Submitted: September 27, 2016
          Peter B. Andrews, Craig J. Springer, and David M. Sborz of ANDREWS & SPRINGER LLC, Wilmington, Delaware; Attorneys for Plaintiff.
          John L. Reed, Ethan H. Townsend, and Harrison S. Carpenter of DLA PIPER LLP (US), Wilmington, Delaware; Attorneys for Defendants.
          OPINION
          BOUCHARD, C.
         In 2015, Section 115 was added to the Delaware General Corporation Law ("DGCL") codifying this Court's decision in Boilermakers Local 154 Retirement Fund v. Chevron Corp.1 that Delaware corporations may adopt bylaws requiring that internal corporate claims be filed exclusively in Delaware. Section 109(b) of the DGCL was amended simultaneously to provide that the bylaws of Delaware corporations "may not contain any provision that would impose liability on a stockholder for the attorneys' fees or expenses of the corporation or any other party in connection with an internal corporate claim."
         About six months later, the board of Paylocity Holding Corporation adopted two new bylaws. The first is an exclusive forum bylaw that, absent the company's consent, requires internal corporate claims to be filed in a state or federal court located in Delaware. The second bylaw is the point of controversy in this action. It purports to shift to a stockholder who files an internal corporate claim outside of Delaware without the company's consent the attorneys' fees and other expenses that the company incurs in connection with such a claim if the stockholder does not obtain a judgment on the merits that substantially achieves the full remedy sought (the "Fee-Shifting Bylaw"). In other words, to trigger the Fee-Shifting Bylaw, a stockholder must first violate the company's exclusive forum bylaw.
         In this action, a stockholder of Paylocity seeks a declaration that the Fee-Shifting Bylaw is invalid under Sections 109(b) and 102(b)(6) of the DGCL, and asserts that the members of Paylocity's board should be liable for breaching their fiduciary duties by adopting the Fee-Shifting Bylaw and by failing to disclose certain information when the company publicly disclosed its adoption. Defendants have moved to dismiss the complaint as unripe because no stockholder has filed or stated an intention to file an internal corporate claim outside of Delaware, and for failure to state a claim for relief.
         For the reasons that follow, I conclude that plaintiff's claims are ripe for review because the validity of the Fee-Shifting Bylaw otherwise may never be subject to judicial review given its deterrent effect. I further conclude that plaintiff's challenge under Section 109(b) states a claim for relief because that statute plainly prohibits "any" bylaw that purports to shift a corporation's litigation expenses to a stockholder in connection with the pursuit of an internal corporate claim without regard to where such a claim is filed. Plaintiff's remaining two claims will be dismissed because plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that the Fee-Shifting Bylaw necessarily violates Section 102(b)(6), which concerns when personal liability for the corporation's "debts" may be imposed on stockholders, and because he has failed to plead facts sufficient to warrant a reasonable inference that Paylocity's directors acted in bad faith.
         I.
BACKGROUND
         The facts in this opinion are drawn from the Verified Class Action Complaint (the "Complaint") and documents incorporated therein.2
         A.
The Parties
         Defendant Paylocity Holding Corporation, a Delaware corporation, is headquartered in Arlington Heights, Illinois. Paylocity is a cloud-based provider of payroll and human capital management software solutions for medium-sized organizations with between 20 and 1, 000 employees. Its stock is publicly traded on NASDAQ.
         Individual defendants Steven J. Sarowitz, Steven R. Beauchamp, Jeffrey T. Diehl, Mark H. Mischler, Andres D. Reiner, and Ronald V. Waters III were the six members of Paylocity's board of directors when the Fee-Shifting Bylaw was adopted. Sarowitz is the Chairman and founder of Paylocity. Plaintiff John Solak alleges he has been a Paylocity stockholder at all times relevant to the allegations in the Complaint.
         B. The Legislative Response to the ATP Decision
         In May 2014, the Delaware Supreme Court held in ATP Tour, Inc. v. Deutscher Tennis Bund that "the board of a Delaware non-stock corporation may lawfully adopt a bylaw that shifts all litigation expenses to a plaintiff in intra-corporate litigation who does not obtain a judgment on the merits that substantially achieves, in substance and amount, the full remedy sought."3 Concern that this ruling would lead to the adoption of fee-shifting bylaws in stock corporations prompted a quick legislative response.
         Within one year of the ATP decision, the Corporation Law Council of the Delaware State Bar Association proposed legislation to "limit ATP to its facts" and prevent the boards of Delaware stock corporations from adopting fee-shifting bylaws.4 In an explanatory memo, the Council expressed concern that such bylaws would deter stockholders from enforcing otherwise meritorious claims.5 The Council further commented that "[p]ermitting fee shifting as a limitation on stockholder litigation would be functionally equivalent to permitting corporate charter or bylaw provisions limiting or eliminating the fiduciary duties of officers and directors, " which the Council had "steadfastly declined to permit, " and that Delaware courts "already have sufficient tools to deter litigation of limited merit" without the need for fee shifting bylaws.[6]
         The legislation the Council proposed was signed into law on June 24, 2015, and became effective on August 1, 2015.7 It amended the DGCL in two ways pertinent to this case. First, it added Section 115 codifying this Court's decision in Boilermakers to provide that the certificate of incorporation or the bylaws of a Delaware corporation "may require, consistent with applicable jurisdictional requirements, that any or all internal corporate claims shall be brought solely and exclusively in any or all of the courts in this State."[8] Section 115 defines "internal corporate claims" to mean "claims, including claims in the right of the corporation, (i) that are based upon a violation of a duty by a current or former director or officer or stockholder in such capacity, or (ii) as to which this title confers jurisdiction upon the Court of Chancery."[9] Second, in response to ATP, the legislation amended Section 109(b) to provide that "bylaws may not contain any provision that would impose liability on a stockholder for the attorneys' fees or expenses of the corporation or any other party in connection with an internal corporate claim, as defined in § 115 of this title."[10]
         C.
Paylocity Adopts the Fee-Shifting Bylaw
         On February 2, 2016, about six months after the amendments to the DGCL enacted in the wake of ATP became effective, the Paylocity board amended its bylaws to add a new Article VIII.11 It contains two provisions.
         Section 8.1 is an exclusive-forum provision. It provides that, unless the company otherwise consents, courts located in Delaware shall be "the sole and exclusive forum for" certain specified disputes: Unless the corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the corporation, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer or other employee of the corporation to the corporation or the corporation's stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine (each an "Action") shall be a state or federal court located within the state of Delaware (a "Chosen Court"), in all cases subject to the court's having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants.12

         Section 8.2 is a fee-shifting provision. In general terms, it shifts the company's litigation expenses (including attorneys' fees) to any stockholder who brings, substantially assists, or has a direct financial interest in any "Action" in a forum not located in Delaware, unless the stockholder obtains a judgment on the merits that substantially achieves the full remedy sought: 8.2 Extra-Forum Claims. To the fullest extent permitted by law, in the...

Paylocity's Steve Sarowitz Spent $1 Million Building Flawed Software.


His dilemma: fix it, or start over?






By Michael Fitzgerald

COMPANY PROFILE
Company: Paylocity
2014 Inc. 5000 Rank: 2785
Headquarters: Arlington Heights, IL Year Founded: 1996 2013 Revenue: $77.3 million
3-Year Growth: 133%
Website: Paylocity.com 








You make a big, bold bet. You bet wrong. You mess up. Now what? Figuring out when it's time to cut your losses is never easy. When it involves pushing aside your handpicked team, the decision is all the harder. That's exactly the bind Steve Sarowitz, the CEO of Paylocity, was dealing with.
Sarowitz's story began one chilly spring morning in 2003. This was to be the day that saw the transformation of his company from a mere supplier of payroll services to one that sells its own proprietary software. When he left his office in suburban Chicago the night before, he was confident that his new software would be up and running for one of his company's biggest customers, a company with more than 1,000 employees.
What Sarowitz woke to instead was disaster. The data had never fully loaded overnight. As a result, his customer's employees couldn't see their pay stubs when they logged on. "I was spontaneously combusting," says Sarowitz. Soon, he was huddling with his project development chief, Roey Ben-Yoseph. "Roey, what's going on?" he asked. "I've got a thousand people who won't be able to see their paychecks like I promised." Ben-Yoseph, both men recall, quickly replied, "Steve, we only tested it for a maximum of 100 people."
Sarowitz couldn't believe his ears. OK, he hadn't specified the scale he wanted. But wasn't it obvious that Paylocity's new software program would need to handle more than 100 employees? The company already had several customers with more than 1,000 employees. Why on earth would his development chief have created software that could handle only 100?
When Sarowitz set out to create his online payroll software in 2002, he was sure that he and his team could provide a cutting-edge, money-saving new service for his customers. The idea was to nibble away at the giants in the industry, notably ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) and Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX), which were pulling in billions of dollars in revenue but hadn't yet succeeded in offering a strong Web-based product.
Sarowitz, then 37, had taught himself how to customize software he was reselling for another company called MPAY and figured he had the tech know-how to spearhead his own software project. Plus, he could tap the expertise of Ben-Yoseph, a friend since college days at the University of Illinois whose programming skills had helped Paylocity build a Web service that worked with MPAY's system.
As 2003 progressed, however, it became clear that Sarowitz was asking his development team to produce a product far more ambitious than it had anticipated. Sarowitz found himself butting heads with the programmers over nearly every detail. "One of the developers wanted to give direct deposit accounts friendly little names, like My Checking Account, and I said that's going to complicate the program," says Sarowitz. " 'Well, I like my idea better,' " Sarowitz recalls the developer's saying. Sarowitz shot back, "You're a developer! You know nothing about this industry!" Ben-Yoseph, looking back on the experience, says Sarowitz had unrealistic expectations and frequently demanded more than the team could deliver. Says Ben-Yoseph: "Steve kept changing directions."
About the only thing Sarowitz felt he could control was his morning running routine, which he used to clear his head and confide in his running partner, Tim Hendershot, a trust officer at a Chicago bank. "If I asked for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for lunch, they'd say they couldn't do it," Sarowitz complained to Hendershot at one point. Says Hendershot: "He vents, and I just run along."
As summer turned into fall, Sarowitz began to face the facts: He had made some bad calls by betting that programmers with limited Web experience could create an advanced Web-based program. He knew, too, that he had been wrong to assume he was skilled enough to oversee a full-scale software development project while running the rest of the business.
Sarowitz knew he needed to make some big changes in staffing and strategy. He deeply wanted his Web strategy to succeed, but his gut was telling him the project was off course. He had just spent 18 months and more than $1 million on the project. He didn't want to see all that effort and money go down the drain. Could he replace his team with new software developers to patch up the problems? Or was it time to cut his losses and pull the plug?
The Decision As it turned out, Ben-Yoseph, too, wanted to make changes. In early October, he came to Sarowitz to tell him he wanted out of the project. The two agreed that Ben-Yoseph would help find his replacement, then step down to a programming job to help with the transition.This time, Sarowitz wasn't going to make another hiring mistake. He retained two recruiting firms and put ads on technology job sites like Dice.com. He spent three weeks interviewing dozens of candidates. He ended up choosing the second person he interviewed: Chuck Cooper, who had 17 years of experience running major software projects at software vendors and at large companies like Washington Mutual. Cooper came on board in December 2003.
"I messed up," Sarowitz told Cooper on his first day on the job. "And I want you to fix it." Cooper soon discovered the six-person development team was split down the middle over how to get the program back on track. "Both camps were wrong," he says. Just as troublesome was the lack of any real process. Feature lists were often written down on whiteboards or on napkins, only to be erased or lost before anyone had a chance to implement them.
Everywhere Cooper looked, he saw problems. The system often crashed, and the design left no possibility for creating the simplest of new features, like buttons that allow users to choose from a list of options. His conclusion: Junk it all, and start over again. Sarowitz was relieved. Deep down, he knew it was the right decision. "It was exciting to realize we could have a fresh start," Sarowitz says.
That fresh start included replacing most of the software development team, including Ben-Yoseph, who departed on friendly terms and now works as a software architect for a Chicago technology firm. The five new hires, each with plentiful Web programming experience, soon paid off: Code development went reasonably smoothly this time. Cooper's team, without being asked by Sarowitz, designed the new system to work for companies with as many as 10,000 employees, far larger than Paylocity's biggest customer. It took another year and nearly another $1 million to develop the new program. Profits from Paylocity's existing payroll processing service continued to foot the bill.
In late 2004, Paylocity started rolling out the new software. The first version, later named WebPay, had the usual kinks, but Cooper's team was able to fix them. Even for its 1,000-employee customers, data transfers took about two to three minutes, a whole lot better than the eight hours they took on that dreadful night in 2003.
Sarowitz says about 75 percent of Paylocity's customers now use its WebPay systems; the rest have stayed with MPAY's product, which Sarowitz continues to resell and support. Sales, growing at 35 percent a year, are now about $20 million a year. (One of Paylocity's 3,700 customers is Mansueto Ventures, parent of Inc. magazine.) Of course, that's still tiny compared with ADP and Paychex. The recession, moreover, could quickly cast a shadow over Paylocity's future.Still, the company's success has recently attracted $10 million in expansion capital from VC firm Adams Street Partners. If Paylocity had not developed its own technology, the firm wouldn't have been interested, says Adams Street partner Jeff Diehl. "It tells you a lot about someone when they can admit a mistake, recognize a sunk cost, and restart."

The Experts Weigh In
Watch for red flags
People often fall victim to what I call the sin of arrogance. They don't take the necessary steps to make their software project go well, and in particular, they don't look at whether the people they have are capable of doing a good job. You can't just assume they will grow into it. There are clear red flags. One such flag is failing to set up metrics so you can measure progress. A great way to break this pattern is to establish steppingstones, smaller pieces of the project that can be done rapidly to force communication about the project.
Jim Johnson
Chairman

Boston
Letting go is never easy
The decision to kill a project is very difficult. Psychologists tell us about "escalation of commitment." People think something is fixable, and that makes it hard for them to kill a project. It's easier to rationalize continuing something than killing something. You think about the sunk costs not only in terms of money but in terms of time -- success is right around the corner, and companies throw good money after bad money. So to pull the plug on it, even though it was a costly decision, speaks a lot of Steve Sarowitz as an entrepreneur.
Julio De Castro
Management Professor
Babson College
Wellesley, Massachusetts
Hire slowly, fire fast
When you are building software, it's harder than other kinds of goods, because it all builds on the same foundation. If your base isn't good, you have blown it. You not only have to redo the product, but you have to figure out how to migrate customers to your rewrite. It's excruciating. The biggest lesson you could learn from this is that all the good intentions, all the "I can do it, boss" energy -- all that doesn't matter if you don't have quality people. You have to hire slowly and fire fast. Sarowitz learned that the hard way.

Steve Sarowitz



	As Founder and Chairman, Mr. Sarowitz started Paylocity in 1997 with a small investment and a tremendous vision. His goal was to fill a gap in the marketplace by providing a solution with in-house like technology supported by the service and liability protection of an outsourcing solution. Steve's vision combined with his passion for software development led to the first release of Paylocity's award winning SAAS platform in 2002.

	Prior to founding Paylocity, Steve worked at Robert F. White, which was then the nation's leading independent payroll service. He later managed two privately-held payroll companies. His 20 years of experience working in the industry with both large and small providers helped him mold Paylocity into a best in breed provider.

	A Sierra member since college, he takes environmental issues seriously. Aside from helping to develop a paperless payroll solution (Web Pay), Steve instituted a "Green Team" within the company. Additionally, prior to moving to our current corporate headquarters, he worked with the architects making sure every possible environmentally safe effort was taken.

	Passionate about giving back to the community, Paylocity participates in many local events; Steve's probable favorite being the annual JPMorgan Chase Corporate Challenge. An avid runner, Steve is a 3 time winner of the MSE (Most Senior Executive) category!

	Steve formerly served as President to the Independent Payroll Providers Association (IPPA) and holds a Bachelor's degree in Economics from the University of Illinois at Urbana.
