Managing Partner, PricewaterhouseCoopers
Barry Nearhos is the market managing Partner for PricewaterhouseCoopers’ Northeast region. He is responsible for directing the strategy and operations of PricewaterhouseCoopers’ Boston, Hartford, Conn., and Albany, N.Y., offices. Prior to this role, Nearhos served as the leader of PwC’s Northeast Assurance practice, a position he held from 2005-2008.




 


Nearhos joined the firm in 1979 and was admitted to the partnership in 1989. He lives with his wife and two daughters in the Boston area and is an active member of the community, both personally and professionally.
Favorite quote: “Perfection is not attainable, but if we chase perfection we can catch excellence.” — Vince Lombardi





Proudest accomplishment: Family has always been, and continues to be my top priority. PwC is a close second, but the first place finish will always go to my wife of 24 years and our two daughters.
What Boston needs most is: Collective efforts on behalf of business, government and others to instill a continued sense of pride in living and working in the state of Massachusetts, and also giving back to the community in meaningful ways. The local market has so much to offer and PwC is committed to doing our part.
