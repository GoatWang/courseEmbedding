"I look forward to working with the Holdings board, sponsors EIG and Tailwater, and the company management team in my new role," said Williamson.

Explanation of Responses:


(1)  On March 17, 2016, Holdings (as defined below) and the Issuer entered into an equity cure contribution agreement (the "Equity Cure Agreement") related to that certain Third Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement, dated as of August 4, 2014, among the Issuer, as borrower, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. as administrative agent, UBS Securities LLC and Barclays Bank PLC, as co-syndication agents, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as documentation agent, and the lenders party thereto (as amended, the "Revolving Credit Agreement"). Under the terms of the Revolving Credit Agreement, the Issuer has the right to cure any default with respect to a financial covenant in the Revolving Credit Agreement by having Holdings purchase equity interests in or make capital contributions to the Issuer that result in proceeds that would satisfy the requirements of such financial covenant.


(2)  Pursuant to the Equity Cure Agreement, on May 13, 2016 (the "Contribution Date"), Borrower contributed from cash on hand $532,000 (the "Contribution Amount") to the Issuer to fund an equity cure in connection with a default with respect to a financial covenant in the Revolving Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Equity Cure Agreement, in exchange for the Contribution Amount, Borrower was entitled to receive a number of Common Units based on the volume weighted daily average price of a Common Unit, as reported on the New York Stock Exchange, for the 15 consecutive trading days ending on the second trading day prior to the Contribution Date ("VWAP"), provided that the VWAP was not less than $0.89 per Common Unit and not greater than $1.48 per Common Unit ("VWAP Ceiling"). The VWAP exceeded the VWAP Ceiling and Borrower (as defined below) received 359,459 Common Units from Issuer at $1.48 per Common Unit.

PRESS RELEASE
DALLAS–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Southcross Energy Partners, L.P. (NYSE:SXE) (“Southcross”) and Southcross Holdings LP (“Holdings”) today announced a new $175 million equity commitment and provided additional detail into distribution coverage and future drop-down plans.
Significant Sponsor Commitment
Charlesbank Capital Partners, EIG Global Energy Partners and Tailwater Capital (collectively, the “Sponsors”) provided a new $175 million equity commitment to enhance liquidity and support anticipated growth initiatives for Southcross and Holdings.
Of the total, $50 million is committed to Southcross and will be funded as needed to pursue significant growth opportunities that currently exist in the Eagle Ford, including both accretive organic capital projects and strategic acquisitions. The new capital is also available for potential future covenant cures and asset drop-downs from Holdings. The capital is expected to be structured to minimize any potential dilution of existing common unit holders.
The remaining $125 million will be directed to Holdings and utilized to enhance the inventory of drop-down assets available to Southcross. Holdings owns 100% of Southcross Energy Partners GP, LLC, the general partner of Southcross, limited partner interests in Southcross and several key Eagle Ford midstream assets. The capital that is committed to Holdings is also available for direct investment in Southcross for future growth projects. 





“This recent capital commitment by the Sponsors reflects our continued belief in the significant growth opportunities at Southcross and our support of the management team,” said Jon Biotti of Charlesbank Capital Partners. While the new commitment is expected to be sufficient to meet forecasted growth capital needs through 2016, the Sponsors have stated a willingness and a desire to provide incremental capital as needed to fund additional growth projects. “The Sponsors are committed to pursuing development projects and acquisitions structured in a way that is accretive to the Southcross unitholders,” stated Wallace Henderson, Managing Director of EIG Global Energy Partners. Jason Downie of Tailwater Capital added, “We will continue to work closely with the Southcross management team to drive growth through the current commodity price environment.”
Path to Sustained Distribution Coverage
Southcross expects to achieve a coverage ratio of greater than 1.0x on current outstanding common units in the fourth quarter of 2015 and throughout fiscal year 2016, assuming the current quarterly distribution of $0.40 per common unit. Southcross does not believe that growth in processed gas volumes is required to generate quarterly adjusted EBITDA sufficient to exceed 1.0x coverage, even without the benefit of potential additional drop-downs. The sustainability of coverage is supported by gross margins that are nearly 90% driven by fixed-fee and fixed-spread agreements and do not have direct commodity exposure. 





Further, Southcross expects to exceed 1.0x coverage including outstanding subordinated units (but excluding outstanding Class B PIK units) by the end of 2016. Southcross believes there is a clear path to grow processed gas volumes in the current commodity price environment and in turn deliver distributable cash flow growth and reduce financial leverage. This outlook is grounded on management’s ongoing discussions with current and prospective customers and is further reinforced by Southcross’ fully integrated system of assets and the competitive advantages of its end-market positioning in the Corpus Christi area.
“The strength of the Southcross Advantage and our focus on customer service and relationships drives our ability to add gas to our system from both new and existing customers,” said John Bonn, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southcross’ general partner.
Dedicated Growth Inventory
Holdings maintains a robust inventory of assets that are well-suited to be dropped down to Southcross. These include the Robstown Fractionator, the Lancaster gathering system, a 100 MMcf/d treating facility, and two strategically placed NGL pipelines. The assets are well-situated geographically in the Eagle Ford shale and are interconnected with the existing Southcross system. Several projects are currently underway to further enhance the value of these assets. Train A of the Robstown Fractionator is expected to be operational in September 2015 and will increase the facility’s capacity to 63,000 Bbls/d. Expansion of the Lancaster treating facility, which will double its capacity, is anticipated to be completed in the third quarter of 2016. Based on the treating and fractionation capacity for these assets, the estimated annual adjusted EBITDA potential is in excess of $100 million. 





Southcross is targeting to complete a drop-down every four to six months, subject to market conditions and the anticipated ramp in volumes for the Holdings assets. Southcross expects that the drop-down of these assets could be completed as early as mid-2017.
