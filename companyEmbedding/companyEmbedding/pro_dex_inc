Uses: A "Must have" for metal buildings and pole barns. Under concrete, radiant floors, walls, roofs, attics, crawlspaces, basements, ceilings and more.      
















Insulation + Radiant Barrier + Vapor Barrier + Air Barrier
ALL IN ONE PRODUCT: Prodex Total Insulation

Prodex Total Works Great in Hot and Cold Climates!

 
Prodex Total 5M Insulation - R 16.  One solution to Heat, Cold and Condensation -  No other insulation protects you from these three conditions like Prodex Total. 5mm (0.2") closed cell polyethylene      foam    covered on both sides with .0012 inch (0.03mm) aluminum foil       facing. 
 

 
New Prodex Total White ESW5 Insulation - R 12. 5mm (0.2") closed cell polyethylene foam with reinforced aluminum on one side and plastic white finish film on the other side. 

 
 
New Prodex        Total 10M - R22. Twice as thick as regular Prodex Total.  10mm (0.4") closed cell polyethylene      foam    covered on both sides with .0012 inch (0.03mm) aluminum foil       facing. 

Any metal building  or pole barn that uses fiberglass insulation rather than Prodex Total will have moisture issues (typically hidden behind facing), Loss of R-value (consequence of the moisture) and heat gain.
