9-11 and Alvin Krongard - Israel's Agent at the CIA





				9-11 and Alvin Krongard - Israel's Agent at the CIA
				March 27, 2012

				To the embarrassment of investigators, it has also emerged that 
				the firm used to buy many of the "put" options [related to 9-11] 
				- where a trader, in effect, bets on a share price fall - on 
				United Airlines stock was headed until 1998 by "Buzzy" Krongard, 
				now executive director of the CIA. Until 1997, Mr Krongard was 
				chairman of Alex Brown Inc, America's oldest investment banking 
				firm. Alex Brown was acquired by Bankers Trust, which in turn 
				was bought by Deutsche Bank. His last post before resigning to 
				take his senior role in the CIA was to head Bankers Trust - Alex 
				Brown's private client business, dealing with the accounts and 
				investments of wealthy customers around the world.
				- Chris Blackhurst, “Mystery of Terror 'Insider Dealers'”, The 
				Independent (UK), October 14, 2001

				A single U.S.-based institutional investor with no conceivable 
				ties to al Qaeda purchased 95 percent of the UAL puts on 
				September 6 [2001] as part of a strategy that also included 
				buying 115,000 shares of American on September 10. Similarly, 
				much of the seemingly suspicious trading on September 10 was 
				traced to a specific U.S.-based options trading newsletter…which 
				recommended these trades.
				- 9/11 Commission Report, W.W. Norton, 2004, footnote on p. 499

				Alvin Bernard "Buzzy" Krongard was Executive Director of the 
				C.I.A. from March 2001 until November 2004. Previously he had 
				served as a consultant to C.I.A. Directors George J. Tenet 
				(1997-2004) and Robert James Woolsey, Jr. (1993-1995). 

				The informed insider trading of stock options carried out by 
				people with prior knowledge of the terror attacks of 9-11 is 
				once again in the news. Max Keiser of the Keiser Report recently 
				interviewed Lars Schall, a German journalist who has written 
				extensively on the "terror traders" of 9-11. In the center of 
				the discussion of the informed trading done by people who 
				evidently knew the attacks were coming stands one very 
				conspicuous individual, A.B. "Buzzy" Krongard, then Executive 
				Director of the C.I.A.. Krongard would be considered a "person 
				of interest" in any proper criminal investigation of 9-11 or the 
				insider trading that preceded it.

				Krongard has been suspected of being connected to the suspicious 
				trading since October 2001. In one of my first articles about 
				9-11, "The Profiteers of 9-11", I wrote the following:

				Investigations into the unusually high number of "put" options, 
				betting that the price of United Airlines (UAL) and American 
				Airlines shares would fall, have revealed that Alex Brown Inc., 
				an investment banking firm, purchased many of these option 
				contracts. Alex Brown Inc. was, until 1998, managed by the man 
				who is now the executive director of the Central Intelligence 
				Agency, A.B. "Buzzy" Krongard. Krongard, 64, former head of 
				Baltimore-based Alex Brown, America's oldest investment bank, 
				joined the CIA three years ago as a counselor to Director of 
				Central Intelligence George Tenet. Krongard switched careers 
				shortly after helping engineer the $2.5 billion merger of Alex 
				Brown and Bankers Trust New York Corp., gaining $71 million in 
				Bankers Trust stock in the process.

				President Bush appointed Krongard executive director of the 
				Central Intelligence Agency on March 26. From February 1998 
				until March 2001, Krongard served as counselor to the director 
				of central intelligence. Until 1997 Krongard was chairman of the 
				investment bank A.B. Brown, having previously worked in various 
				capacities at Alex Brown. Krongard was quoted on the 
				relationship between Wall Street and the CIA in a Washington 
				Post article. If you go back to the CIA's origins during World 
				War II in the Office of Strategic Services, Krongard told the 
				Post, "the whole OSS was really nothing but Wall Street bankers 
				and lawyers."

				WHO IS BUZZY KRONGARD?

				The hypothesis of my book Solving 9-11: The Deception that 
				Changed the World is that the terror attacks were a false-flag 
				operation planned and carried out by Israeli military 
				intelligence with the assistance and support of Zionist agents 
				in high positions in the U.S. government. These Zionist agents 
				would include people like Dov Zakheim at the Pentagon and 
				Michael Chertoff, then Assistant Attorney General, who was 
				responsible for the federal investigation and prosecution of the 
				crimes of 9-11. In this position Chertoff managed the federal 
				"non-investigation" of 9-11 in which the crucial evidence was 
				confiscated and destroyed without being properly examined.

				My hypothesis is not that 9-11 was an "inside" job, but that it 
				was an Israeli-planned false-flag operation. The Israeli 
				operation was facilitated by highly-placed Zionist agents within 
				the U.S. government, military, and intelligence spheres. If 
				Buzzy Krongard is a suspect in the crimes of 9-11, the question 
				that needs to be answered is: Was Krongard acting as an agent 
				for Israeli military intelligence at Alex Brown and the C.I.A.? 
				The evidence indicates that he served as an agent for Israel in 
				both positions. 

				Alvin Bernard Krongard, born 1936, is the son of Raphael Harris 
				Krongard and Rita Keyser Krongard. Both his mother and father 
				were born in Baltimore to Jewish immigrant families from 
				Poland/Russia. His first wife, Patricia Lion, was also Jewish. 
				While Krongard's Jewish roots are never mentioned in the various 
				articles about him, his Jewish ethnicity clearly plays the key 
				role in his efforts to support Israeli enterprises in the United 
				States. When a high-level person like Krongard conceals his 
				Jewish roots while actively serving the state of Israel it 
				indicates that he is seeking to hide his true identity and 
				loyalty to a foreign state. For such a person to be the 
				administrative chief of the Central Intelligence Agency says a 
				great deal about the degree of Israeli penetration of the U.S. 
				intelligence community. 


				Alvin Bernard Krongard at Princeton, 1957

				Krongard's paternal grandparents immigrated from Lowicz, Poland, 
				to the United States in 1904. The family name and first names 
				were changed. Krongaard is a Scandinavian name that his 
				grandfather took after they arrived in the United States. 
				Krongaard means land or property of the "crown". The immigration 
				records indicate that his grandfather Morris Krongard did not 
				enter the U.S. under that name. 

				Krongard's mother, Rita (Rebecca) Keyser, was born in Baltimore 
				to Abraham and Ethel Keyser, Russian Jewish immigrants who had 
				also arrived in the U.S. in 1904. She was raised in Washington, 
				where she attended high school and graduated from Strayer 
				Business College. She worked as a legal secretary for a 
				Washington maritime lawyer before her marriage to Raphael Harris 
				Krongard in 1931. The Krongard's lived in Ashburton, Maryland, 
				and had three children: Alvin, Howard Joel, and a daughter, 
				Marilyn, who died in 1946.

				Alvin Krongard graduated from Princeton and went on to serve on 
				"active duty" in the U.S. Marine Corps in the Mediterranean from 
				1958-1961. Although the details are not given it seems likely 
				that he served in Lebanon where the U.S. Marines were sent in 
				1958. He returned to the United States and married Patricia 
				Lion. He worked at her family business, Lion Brothers, from 
				1961-1969. After a two year stint at Bache/Stern Brothers Boyce 
				he joined the Baltimore investment bank of Alex Brown in 1971. 
				After twenty years, Buzzy Krongard became C.E.O. of Alex Brown 
				in July 1991. 

				ALEX BROWN AND ISRAEL

				As C.E.O. of America's oldest investment bank, Krongard was well 
				placed to assist companies spawned by Israeli military 
				intelligence. Under Krongard, Alex Brown became a leading U.S. 
				partner for these Israeli companies. In May 1996 Krongard and 
				Mayo A. Shattuck went to Israel on a three-day trip during which 
				they met with then prime minister Shimon Peres. As the Baltimore 
				Sun reported shortly before their trip to Israel:

				A. B. Krongard, Alex. Brown's chairman and chief executive, and 
				Mayo A. Shattuck III, president and chief operating officer, are 
				to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres and Dov Lautman, 
				the prime minister's special emissary for economic 
				development...

				"Obviously, this is a trip of some significance," Mr. Shattuck 
				said. "We want to be perceived as the premiere underwriter and 
				adviser for high-tech and health care companies in Israel. The 
				time has come to build stronger affiliations at the senior 
				management level."

				The meeting with Mr. Peres was arranged through Giza Group, one 
				of Israel's leading private investment banking firms, Mr. 
				Shattuck said.

				When Alex. Brown officials meet with Mr. Peres, they expect to 
				talk about how the company can link Israeli firms to U.S. 
				capital markets, Mr. Shattuck said.

				Alex. Brown, which had $809 million in revenues in 1995, is 
				known worldwide for its expertise in taking high-tech and health 
				care companies public. Last year, it managed 64 initial public 
				offerings, tops in the United States.

				R. William Burgess Jr., head of Alex. Brown's technology 
				investment banking group, compared Israel to Silicon Valley in 
				California and Route 128 in Boston, which have spawned some of 
				the world's largest high-tech companies.

				"My hope would be to do several initial public offerings a year 
				for Israeli companies and several mergers and acquisitions," 
				said Mr. Burgess, who will also make the trip.

				Alex. Brown has been doing business with companies in Israel for 
				at least five years.

				In 1996, Alex Brown was serving as the financial advisor for 
				Scitex, an Israeli company connected to military intelligence. 
				Yair Shamir, the son of Yitzhak Shamir, the Zionist terrorist 
				who killed Folke Bernadotte before becoming prime minister, was 
				general manager of Scitex. Krongard's three-day visit to Israel 
				and meeting with the prime minister was arranged by the Giza 
				Group, a Tel Aviv-based investment banking firm. 

				At the time of Krongard's visit, Aviv Boim was a vice president 
				of Giza Ltd. Boim remained at Giza for two more months, until 
				August 1996, and then joined Krongard's company as an associate 
				of Alex Brown from August 1996 to February 1998. Aviv Boim 
				worked with Alex Brown's technology group in London, where he 
				managed initial public offerings, mergers, and acquisitions 
				concerning Israeli companies. 

				On October 2, 1996, the Baltimore Sun reported that Krongard was 
				"still bullish on Israel." Krongard had addressed the 
				Maryland/Israel Development Center the previous day. "There is 
				great market demand for Israel's products," Krongard said. 
				"Israel has the brain power. Its human capital is exceptional."

				The Maryland/Israel Development Center was started in 1992 as a 
				nonprofit group to form business partnerships between Maryland 
				and Israeli companies. The article noted that just the week 
				prior to his speech at the Maryland/Israel Development Center, 
				Krongard and Alex Brown had taken the Israeli company Orckit 
				Communications Ltd. public. "Tel Aviv-based Orckit makes systems 
				that enable telephone companies to provide high-speed voice and 
				digital transmission," the Sun reported. Yair Shamir was a 
				director of Orckit.

				ORCKIT AND UNIT 8200 OF ISRAELI MILITARY INTELLIGENCE 

				Orckit is a company that was created by the former commander of 
				Unit 8200, the signal intelligence branch of the Israeli 
				military, as Efi Landau reported in Globes (Israel).

				Even Orckit’s win in the large tender of the US telephone 
				company GTE, one of the eight largest telephone companies in the 
				world, did not persuade company president Yitzhak Tamir to grant 
				an open, on the record, press interview. However, cracks can be 
				seen in the shrouds hiding the company from the media, 
				contributing perhaps to the recognition that the company’s most 
				precious asset is its workers, and it cannot hurt if more is 
				known about them.

				Orckit was established in 1990 by Military Intelligence 
				electronic unit 8200 graduates Eric Paneth and Yitzhak Tamir. 
				The unit has provided Israeli high-tech a significant proportion 
				of its engineers and managers. Paneth was commander of the unit, 
				replacing Zohar Zisappel, chairman of the RAD-Bynet group.

				Orckit (and Tikcro) are not your usual companies. These are 
				typical Israeli military "dual-use" companies. They have hidden 
				military and intelligence functions but are presented as normal 
				commercial enterprises. With companies like Orckit, Buzzy 
				Krongard and his team at Alex Beam certainly must have been 
				aware that they were investing in companies closely tied to the 
				Israeli military.

				In February 1998 Buzzy Krongard joined the C.I.A. as a 
				consultant to director George Tenet. In a bizarre move, Krongard 
				left his $4 million a year job as head of Bankers Trust (BT). He 
				had just completed the BT merger with Alex Brown in the fall of 
				1997 and suddenly he was leaving. Aviv Boim also left BT Alex 
				Brown in February and joined Orckit as Chief Financial Officer. 
				The merger between Bankers Trust and Alex Brown, the first 
				between a bank and a securities brokerage since the Depression, 
				however, went sour shortly after Krongard left the company. The 
				newly merged company reported a record loss in 1998 and was soon 
				taken over by Deutsche Bank. Mayo Shattuck stayed on at Alex 
				Brown but resigned suddenly the day after 9-11.

				While it is clear that Krongard jumped ship because he knew that 
				the BT Alex Brown merger would soon fail, why did he go to work 
				for the C.I.A.? What we do know is that Krongard had worked 
				closely with computer companies spawned by Israeli military 
				intelligence. After he joined the C.I.A. as counselor to the 
				director, Krongard soon became engaged in setting up the C.I.A. 
				venture capital firm called In-Q-It (In-Q-Tel) that was supposed 
				to keep the agency abreast of computer technology. How much 
				Israeli software do you think found its way onto the C.I.A. 
				computer network under Buzzy Krongard's reign? 

				In October 1999, the Washington Post reported on the genesis of 
				In-Q-Tel:

				A lot of people wondered what CIA Director George J. Tenet had 
				in mind a year and a half ago when he brought in Wall Street 
				heavyweight A.B. "Buzzy" Krongard to serve as his "counselor." 
				Now they know-- part of the story.

				The man who helped underwrite Microsoft and AOL as head of Alex 
				Brown & Co. has done it again, helping Tenet & Co. start up a 
				CIA venture capital firm called In-Q-It that's supposed to keep 
				the agency abreast of computer technology.

				But Krongard's influence at Langley extends well beyond this 
				foray into Silicon Valley. "George will say, 'Make this happen,' 
				" said Krongard, 61, explaining in a telephone interview exactly 
				what it is he does for the director of central intelligence.

				"The idea is for In-Q-It to fund promising technologies..."
				

				"The idea for the venture-capital fund was hatched in 
				conversations between the new CIA director, George Tenet, and a 
				former investment banker named A. B. "Buzzy" Krongard, who 
				joined the agency in February 1998 as counselor to the director.

				The director of the C.I.A. is often little more than a mannequin 
				who gives a name and a face to the agency while the day-to-day 
				operations are managed by the executive director like Krongard. 
				George Tenet is similar to Leon Panetta. Both are sons of 
				immigrants who owned diners, one in Little Neck, New York, the 
				other in Monterey, California. What is it about Tenet and 
				Panetta that made them suitable to be directors of the C.I.A.? 
				They are clearly not leaders of men or strong thinkers. Could it 
				be that they were men who were known to be weak and amenable, 
				and who could easily be controlled by people like Krongard?
				

				Krongard became the Executive Director of the C.I.A. in March 
				2001 and remained at that position for more than three years, 
				until November 2004. He was responsible for getting C.I.A. 
				security contracts for Blackwater in Afghanistan and Iraq. 
				Later, his brother Howard (a.k.a. "Cookie"), as Inspector 
				General of the State Department, denied knowing that Buzzy sat 
				on the board of Blackwater during Congressional hearings into 
				his obstruction of the investigation of contract fraud and 
				crimes carried out by Blackwater. The Congressional 
				investigation did not result in any criminal charges being laid 
				against either of the Krongard brothers.

				"Krongard exhibited the requisite secretiveness when asked to 
				explain his interest in intelligence and how he came to land a 
				job in [George J. Tenet]'s inner circle," the Washington Post 
				reported on March 17, 2001, the day after he was named Executive 
				Director of the C.I.A. "If you go back to the CIA's origins 
				during World War II in the Office of Strategic Services, he 
				explained, "the whole OSS was really nothing but Wall Street 
				bankers and lawyers."

				Krongard was the chief operating officer, the day-to-day 
				administrative leader of the C.I.A. from March 2001 until 
				November 2004. In this position he was certainly aware of the 
				plane-into-building drill planned for September 11, 2001 at the 
				National Reconnaissance Office, a sub-agency of the C.I.A. 
				Although Krongard is probably not an architectural level planner 
				of the terrorism of 9-11, the evidence indicates that he served 
				as a highly-placed manager who served as an important conduit 
				linking Israeli military intelligence with the C.I.A.


				Alvin Krongard, his second wife Cheryl, and Jim Kimsey. Cheryl 
				Gruetzmacher was raised in Iowa and married Edward S. Gordon in 
				May 1992.


				The Krongard house sits on a 80 acre wooded estate off 1400 W 
				Seminary Avenue in Lutherville, just north of Baltimore, 
				Maryland.


				Howard Joel Krongard, Alvin's brother, as Inspector General at 
				the State Department, blocked investigations of massive fraud by 
				military contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan. At Congressional 
				hearings, Howard feigned ignorance that his brother was a 
				director of Blackwater, one of the key contracts being examined. 
				Buzzy had awarded the C.I.A. contract to Blackwater.

Alvin Bernard "Buzzy" Krongard (born October 25, 1936) was the Executive Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.[1] He was appointed by George Tenet on March 16, 2001.
The Executive Director is the third ranking position within the CIA and the incumbent functions essentially as the Chief Operating Officer of the Agency. For three years prior, Krongard had served as Counselor to the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI).
A longtime consultant to DCIs, Krongard joined the Agency full-time in February 1998, following a 29-year business career. During his private sector career, he served as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Alex. Brown & Sons, the nation’s oldest investment banking firm, and Vice Chairman of the Board of Bankers Trust.
Krongard received an A.B. degree (1958) with honors from Princeton University and a Juris Doctor degree with honors from the University of Maryland School of Law. While at Princeton, Krongard played lacrosse. In 1980, he was inducted as a member of the National Lacrosse Hall of Fame.[2] Krongard played for the storied amateur Mount Washington Lacrosse Club.[3] He served three years of active duty as an infantry officer in the United States Marine Corps.
Krongard resigned from the CIA shortly after the arrival of DCI Porter Goss in September 2004. While at the CIA, he was the connection between Erik Prince of Blackwater Security Consulting and the CIA. Through his influence, Blackwater was able to receive its first black contract.[citation needed]
On March 18, 2005, Krongard was appointed as an outside US director to the Global Board of Directors organized to oversee and coordinate the worldwide operations of DLA Piper, one of the world’s largest law firms.

Family[edit]
Krongard is the brother of State Department Inspector General Howard Krongard.[4]
Krongard is a native of Baltimore, Maryland, and resides in Baltimore, Maryland and McLean, Virginia. He was married to the late Patricia A. Lion and has three adult sons including Alexander Lion Krongard (US Navy), Randall Harris Krongard (film maker).
Patrica Lion's sister, Margo Lion is a Broadway theatre producer.
On 31 July 2004 Krongard married Cheryl Gordon (née Cheryl Gruetzmacher), at that time a senior executive for Apollo Management.[5] She has since become a director of Legg Mason and US Airways.
Controversies[edit]
9/11[edit]
Krongard's name was brought up in conjunction with investigations into suspected 9/11-related insider trading because of timely Wall Street trades made through the investment bank he used to head, Alex. Brown.[6][dead link]
The 9/11 Commission Report stated:

"A single U.S.-based institutional investor with no conceivable ties to al Qaeda purchased 95 percent of the UAL puts on September 6 (2001) as part of a strategy that also included buying 115,000 shares of American on September 10. Similarly, much of the seemingly suspicious trading on September 10 was traced to a specific U.S.-based options trading newsletter…which recommended these trades."[7]

Blackwater[edit]
At a November 14, 2007 House oversight committee hearing about Blackwater, investigating allegations of improper interference by Krongard's brother, Howard, in Justice Department investigations of Blackwater and other State Department contractors, Chairman Henry Waxman stated that A. B. Krongard was on "Blackwater's advisory board".[8] Howard Krongard at first denied that his brother had any connection with Blackwater, saying:

I can tell you, very frankly, I am not aware of any financial interest or position he has with respect to Blackwater. When these ugly rumors started recently, I specifically asked him. I do not believe it is true that he is a member of the advisory board that you stated. And that's something I think I need to say.[9]

However, when confronted with a July 26 letter from Blackwater founder and CEO Erik Prince to Buzzy Krongard asking him to join Blackwater's advisory board, followed by a September 5 letter welcoming Krongard to the board and a report from Rep. Elijah Cummings stating that Buzz Krongard had been expected to attend a Blackwater board meeting earlier that week,[9] Krongard said he had called his brother during the ensuing break in the hearings and learned of this conflict of interest for the first time, saying "I'm not my brother's keeper, and we don't discuss our business with each other".[10] He then recused himself from the investigation.[9][10][11] Committee chairman Henry Waxman issued a memorandum [12] summarizing the discrepancies between the two brothers' recollections of what Buzzy told Howard.

Baltimore businessman Buzzy Krongard arrested at BWI for loaded handgun.




A.B. "Buzzy"Krongard, a former top CIA official and longtime Baltimore business leader, was arrested at BWI Thurgood Marshall Airport on Thursday for allegedly attempting to bring a loaded handgun onto an airplane.Krongard, 78, was found with a 9 mm handgun loaded with five rounds as he was passing through an airport checkpoint with a ticket to fly to Long Island-MacArthur Airport in New York, according to a statement released by Maryland Transportation Authority Police.The gun was spotted in Krongard's carry-on bag by a Transportation Security Administration officer staffing a checkpoint X-ray machine.Krongard, who lives in Lutherville, could not be reached for comment.

The TSA contacted MdTA Police, who responded to the checkpoint, confiscated the gun and arrested Krongard on weapons charges. There was no impact on airport operations.Krongard, the former chairman and CEO of the one-time Baltimore investment bank Alex. Brown & Sons, served as the executive director of the Central Intelligence Agency, the third-highest-ranking position, under President George W. Bush from 2001 to 2004.












Here's a look at some of the potentially lethal items discovered at BWI.



He has served on the board of directors for Under Armour since July 2005 and has been the board's lead director for the past nine years, according to his biography listed on Under Armour's website.Krongard is not the only prominent Baltimore businessman who has been caught with a loaded handgun in a carry-on bag at BWI. In February 2011, Edwin F. Hale Sr., the founder of 1st Mariner Bank and owner of the Baltimore Blast indoor soccer team, was issued a summons for bringing a loaded .38-caliber revolver into BWI.

Hale said at the time he had forgotten that the gun, for which he had a permit, was in his briefcase when it was spotted at a security checkpoint.

Edwin F. Hale Sr. says that despite his high local profile as former CEO of First Mariner Bancorp and current owner of the Baltimore Blast indoor soccer team, "nobody really knows me." 

So Hale, 67, decided to tell his life story in a book, titled "Hale Storm," that will be released Saturday by...

Hale accepted probation before judgment in the case. Anne Arundel County District Court in Glen Burnie fined him $342.50.Separately, TSA officers at Hagerstown Regional Airport stopped a Virginia man Thursday from bringing a loaded semiautomatic gun onto a plane, the TSA said.The TSA seized 14 guns at BWI checkpoints in 2014 and 13 in 2013.Firearms, firearm parts and ammunition are not permitted in carry-on bags but can be transported in checked bags if they are properly packed and declared to the airline. Firearms must be unloaded, packed in a hard-side case, locked and packed separately from ammunition.Travelers who bring firearms to an airport checkpoint are subject to possible criminal charges from law enforcement and civil penalties from TSA of up to $11,000.Krongard could face up to 90 days in jail and a fine of up to $500 on the weapons charge.ddonovan@baltsun.com

        Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._B._KrongardUpdated: 2017-06-23T16:53Z
      
This biography of a living person needs additional citations for verification. Please help by adding reliable sources. Contentious material about living persons that is unsourced or poorly sourced must be removed immediately, especially if potentially libelous or harmful. (January 2009) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)Alvin Bernard "Buzzy" Krongard (born October 25, 1936) was the Executive Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.[1] He was appointed by George Tenet on March 16, 2001.The Executive Director is the third ranking position within the CIA and the incumbent functions essentially as the Chief Operating Officer of the Agency. For three years prior, Krongard had served as Counselor to the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI).A longtime consultant to DCIs, Krongard joined the Agency full-time in February 1998, following a 29-year business career. During his private sector career, he served as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Alex. Brown & Sons, the nation’s oldest investment banking firm, and Vice Chairman of the Board of Bankers Trust.Krongard received an A.B. degree (1958) with honors from Princeton University and a Juris Doctor degree with honors from the University of Maryland School of Law. While at Princeton, Krongard played lacrosse. In 1980, he was inducted as a member of the National Lacrosse Hall of Fame.[2] Krongard played for the storied amateur Mount Washington Lacrosse Club.[3] He served three years of active duty as an infantry officer in the United States Marine Corps.Krongard resigned from the CIA shortly after the arrival of DCI Porter Goss in September 2004. While at the CIA, he was the connection between Erik Prince of Blackwater Security Consulting and the CIA. Through his influence, Blackwater was able to receive its first black contract.[citation needed]On March 18, 2005, Krongard was appointed as an outside US director to the Global Board of Directors organized to oversee and coordinate the worldwide operations of DLA Piper, one of the world’s largest law firms.Contents1 Family2 Controversies2.1 9/112.2 Blackwater3 ReferencesFamilyKrongard is the brother of State Department Inspector General Howard Krongard.[4]Krongard is a native of Baltimore, Maryland, and resides in Baltimore, Maryland and McLean, Virginia. He was married to the late Patricia A. Lion and has three adult sons including Alexander Lion Krongard (US Navy), Randall Harris Krongard (film maker).Patrica Lion's sister, Margo Lion is a Broadway theatre producer.On 31 July 2004 Krongard married Cheryl Gordon (née Cheryl Gruetzmacher), at that time a senior executive for Apollo Management.[5] She has since become a director of Legg Mason and US Airways.Controversies9/11Krongard's name was brought up in conjunction with investigations into suspected 9/11-related insider trading because of timely Wall Street trades made through the investment bank he used to head, Alex. Brown.[6]The 9/11 Commission Report stated:"A single U.S.-based institutional investor with no conceivable ties to al Qaeda purchased 95 percent of the UAL puts on September 6 (2001) as part of a strategy that also included buying 115,000 shares of American on September 10. Similarly, much of the seemingly suspicious trading on September 10 was traced to a specific U.S.-based options trading newsletter…which recommended these trades."[7]BlackwaterAt a November 14, 2007 House oversight committee hearing about Blackwater, investigating allegations of improper interference by Krongard's brother, Howard, in Justice Department investigations of Blackwater and other State Department contractors, Chairman Henry Waxman stated that A. B. Krongard was on "Blackwater's advisory board".[8] Howard Krongard at first denied that his brother had any connection with Blackwater, saying:I can tell you, very frankly, I am not aware of any financial interest or position he has with respect to Blackwater. When these ugly rumors started recently, I specifically asked him. I do not believe it is true that he is a member of the advisory board that you stated. And that's something I think I need to say.[9]However, when confronted with a July 26 letter from Blackwater founder and CEO Erik Prince to Buzzy Krongard asking him to join Blackwater's advisory board, followed by a September 5 letter welcoming Krongard to the board and a report from Rep. Elijah Cummings stating that Buzz Krongard had been expected to attend a Blackwater board meeting earlier that week,[9] Krongard said he had called his brother during the ensuing break in the hearings and learned of this conflict of interest for the first time, saying "I'm not my brother's keeper, and we don't discuss our business with each other".[10] He then recused himself from the investigation.[9][10][11] Committee chairman Henry Waxman issued a memorandum [12] summarizing the discrepancies between the two brothers' recollections of what Buzzy told Howard.References^ Atkinson, Bill; Schneider, Greg (February 1, 1998).

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/23/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Inside the control tower at John F. Kennedy International Airport, air traffic controllers can track planes traveling hundreds of miles away. But when it's time for a controller to hand off responsibility for watching a flight, the technology becomes decidedly last century: details are printed on a slip of paper and passed to a co-worker.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.

Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.

The Executive Director is the third ranking position within the CIA and the incumbent functions essentially as the Chief Operating Officer of the Agency. For three years prior, Krongard had served as Counselor to the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI).
A longtime consultant to DCIs, Krongard joined the Agency full-time in February 1998, following a 29-year business career. During his private sector career, he served as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Alex. Brown & Sons, the nation’s oldest investment banking firm, and Vice Chairman of the Board of Bankers Trust.
Krongard received an A.B. degree (1958) with honors from Princeton University and a Juris Doctor degree with honors from the University of Maryland School of Law. While at Princeton, Krongard played lacrosse. In 1980, he was inducted as a member of the National Lacrosse Hall of Fame.[2] Krongard played for the storied amateur Mount Washington Lacrosse Club.[3] He served three years of active duty as an infantry officer in the United States Marine Corps.
Krongard resigned from the CIA shortly after the arrival of DCI Porter Goss in September 2004. While at the CIA, he was the connection between Erik Prince of Blackwater Security Consulting and the CIA. Through his influence, Blackwater was able to receive its first black contract.[citation needed]
On March 18, 2005, Krongard was appointed as an outside US director to the Global Board of Directors organized to oversee and coordinate the worldwide operations of DLA Piper, one of the world’s largest law firms.

Family[edit]
Krongard is the brother of State Department Inspector General Howard Krongard.[4]
Krongard is a native of Baltimore, Maryland, and resides in Baltimore, Maryland and McLean, Virginia. He was married to the late Patricia A. Lion and has three adult sons including Alexander Lion Krongard (US Navy), Randall Harris Krongard (film maker).
Patrica Lion's sister, Margo Lion is a Broadway theatre producer.
On 31 July 2004 Krongard married Cheryl Gordon (née Cheryl Gruetzmacher), at that time a senior executive for Apollo Management.[5] She has since become a director of Legg Mason and US Airways.
Controversies[edit]
9/11[edit]
Krongard's name was brought up in conjunction with investigations into suspected 9/11-related insider trading because of timely Wall Street trades made through the investment bank he used to head, Alex. Brown.[6][dead link]
The 9/11 Commission Report stated:

"A single U.S.-based institutional investor with no conceivable ties to al Qaeda purchased 95 percent of the UAL puts on September 6 (2001) as part of a strategy that also included buying 115,000 shares of American on September 10. Similarly, much of the seemingly suspicious trading on September 10 was traced to a specific U.S.-based options trading newsletter…which recommended these trades."[7]

Blackwater[edit]
At a November 14, 2007 House oversight committee hearing about Blackwater, investigating allegations of improper interference by Krongard's brother, Howard, in Justice Department investigations of Blackwater and other State Department contractors, Chairman Henry Waxman stated that A. B. Krongard was on "Blackwater's advisory board".[8] Howard Krongard at first denied that his brother had any connection with Blackwater, saying:

I can tell you, very frankly, I am not aware of any financial interest or position he has with respect to Blackwater. When these ugly rumors started recently, I specifically asked him. I do not believe it is true that he is a member of the advisory board that you stated. And that's something I think I need to say.[9]

However, when confronted with a July 26 letter from Blackwater founder and CEO Erik Prince to Buzzy Krongard asking him to join Blackwater's advisory board, followed by a September 5 letter welcoming Krongard to the board and a report from Rep. Elijah Cummings stating that Buzz Krongard had been expected to attend a Blackwater board meeting earlier that week,[9] Krongard said he had called his brother during the ensuing break in the hearings and learned of this conflict of interest for the first time, saying "I'm not my brother's keeper, and we don't discuss our business with each other".[10] He then recused himself from the investigation.[9][10][11] Committee chairman Henry Waxman issued a memorandum [12] summarizing the discrepancies between the two brothers' recollections of what Buzzy told Howard.

On March 18, 2005, Krongard was appointed as an outside US director to the Global Board of Directors organized to oversee and coordinate the worldwide operations of DLA Piper, one of the world’s largest law firms.

Family[edit]
Krongard is the brother of State Department Inspector General Howard Krongard.[4]
Krongard is a native of Baltimore, Maryland, and resides in Baltimore, Maryland and McLean, Virginia. He was married to the late Patricia A. Lion and has three adult sons including Alexander Lion Krongard (US Navy), Randall Harris Krongard (film maker).
Patrica Lion's sister, Margo Lion is a Broadway theatre producer.
On 31 July 2004 Krongard married Cheryl Gordon (née Cheryl Gruetzmacher), at that time a senior executive for Apollo Management.[5] She has since become a director of Legg Mason and US Airways.
Controversies[edit]
9/11[edit]
Krongard's name was brought up in conjunction with investigations into suspected 9/11-related insider trading because of timely Wall Street trades made through the investment bank he used to head, Alex. Brown.[6][dead link]
The 9/11 Commission Report stated:

"A single U.S.-based institutional investor with no conceivable ties to al Qaeda purchased 95 percent of the UAL puts on September 6 (2001) as part of a strategy that also included buying 115,000 shares of American on September 10. Similarly, much of the seemingly suspicious trading on September 10 was traced to a specific U.S.-based options trading newsletter…which recommended these trades."[7]

Blackwater[edit]
At a November 14, 2007 House oversight committee hearing about Blackwater, investigating allegations of improper interference by Krongard's brother, Howard, in Justice Department investigations of Blackwater and other State Department contractors, Chairman Henry Waxman stated that A. B. Krongard was on "Blackwater's advisory board".[8] Howard Krongard at first denied that his brother had any connection with Blackwater, saying:

I can tell you, very frankly, I am not aware of any financial interest or position he has with respect to Blackwater. When these ugly rumors started recently, I specifically asked him. I do not believe it is true that he is a member of the advisory board that you stated. And that's something I think I need to say.[9]

However, when confronted with a July 26 letter from Blackwater founder and CEO Erik Prince to Buzzy Krongard asking him to join Blackwater's advisory board, followed by a September 5 letter welcoming Krongard to the board and a report from Rep. Elijah Cummings stating that Buzz Krongard had been expected to attend a Blackwater board meeting earlier that week,[9] Krongard said he had called his brother during the ensuing break in the hearings and learned of this conflict of interest for the first time, saying "I'm not my brother's keeper, and we don't discuss our business with each other".[10] He then recused himself from the investigation.[9][10][11] Committee chairman Henry Waxman issued a memorandum [12] summarizing the discrepancies between the two brothers' recollections of what Buzzy told Howard.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
