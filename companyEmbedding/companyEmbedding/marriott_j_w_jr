				J.W. Marriott, Jr.
			
















Bill Marriott









J.W. Marriott, Jr. is Executive Chairman and Chairman of the Board of Marriott International, Inc., one of the world's largest lodging companies. He was Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board for 40 years, before stepping down on March 31, 2012. His leadership spans nearly 60 years, and he has taken Marriott from a family restaurant business to a global lodging company with more than 4,200 properties in 80 countries and territories.
[Read his blog: www.marriottonthemove.com]
Known throughout the industry for his hands-on management style, Mr. Marriott has built a highly regarded culture that emphasizes the importance of Marriott’s people and recognizes the value they bring to the organization. Today, there are approximately 365,000 employees at the company’s headquarters and other offices, and at managed and franchised property locations.




Transforming the family business
At an early age, Mr. Marriott developed a passion for the business and worked in a variety of positions in the Hot Shoppes restaurant chain during his high school and college years. He joined the company full-time in 1956 and soon afterward, took over management of Marriott’s first hotel. Mr. Marriott became executive vice president of the company, then its president, in 1964. He was elected chief executive officer in 1972, and chairman of the board in 1985. 
Regarded as a lodging innovator, Mr. Marriott began shifting the company’s business model in the late 1970s from hotel ownership to property management and franchising. His strategic decision allowed the company to accelerate its growth and broaden its leadership position. That transformation culminated in the company’s split in 1993 into Marriott International, a hotel management and franchising company, headed by Mr. Marriott, and Host Marriott International, a hotel ownership company chaired by his brother, Richard Marriott. 
Mr. Marriott has also worked to compile the greatest portfolio of lodging brands, ranging from limited service to luxury hotels and resorts. Today, Marriott International operates and franchises hotels under the Marriott, JW Marriott, The Ritz-Carlton, EDITION, Autograph Collection, Renaissance, AC Hotels by Marriott, Residence Inn, Courtyard, TownePlace Suites, Fairfield Inn & Suites, SpringHill Suites and Bulgari brand names; develops and operates vacation ownership resorts under the Marriott Vacation Club, The Ritz-Carlton Destination Club, and Grand Residences by Marriott brands; licenses and manages whole-ownership residential brands, including The Ritz-Carlton Residences, JW Marriott Residences and Marriott Residences; operates Marriott Executive Apartments; provides furnished corporate housing through its Marriott ExecuStay division; and operates conference centers.




Demonstrating a "Spirit to Serve"
Mr. Marriott serves on the board of The J. Willard & Alice S. Marriott Foundation. He is a member of the National Business Council and the Executive Committee of the World Travel & Tourism Council. Mr. Marriott served on the Board of Trustees of the National Geographic Society, as director of the United States Naval Academy Foundation, chairman of the President’s Export Council (PEC) and a member of the Secure Borders Open Doors Advisory Committee (SBODAC) and the U.S. Travel and Tourism Advisory Board (TTAB). He also recently served as chairman of the Mayo Clinic Capital Campaign. 
Mr. Marriott attended St. Albans School in Washington, D.C., earned a B.S. degree in banking and finance from the University of Utah and served as an officer in the United States Navy. He is an active member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints. He is married to the former Donna Garff. They have four children, 15 grandchildren and 13 great grandchildren.

J.W. Marriott Jr.







J.W. Marriott, Jr. is Executive Chairman and Chairman of the Board of Marriott International, Inc., the largest lodging company in the world. Mr. Marriott’s leadership spans more than 60 years, as he guided what was once a family-run root beer stand and restaurant to a global hospitality company. In September 2016, Marriott finalized its largest acquisition ever, acquiring Starwood Hotels and Resorts and bolstering the company to nearly 6,000 properties across 30 brands in 120 countries and territories. Mr. Marriott served 40 years as Marriott’s Chief Executive Officer, before stepping down on March 31, 2012.





Download




Mr. Marriott’s passion for the hospitality industry began at an early age. He spent his high school and college years working in a variety of positions in the family’s Hot Shoppes restaurant chain. He became a full-time associate in 1956, and soon afterward began managing the first Marriott hotel. He became President of the company in 1964 and Chief Executive Officer in 1972. He was elected Chairman of the Board in 1985.
Throughout his career, Mr. Marriott has been known industry-wide for his hands-on management style, which is built on his parents’ chief core value of putting people first. The Marriott corporate culture emphasizes the value that associates bring to the organization. Today, there are more than 500,000 associates at Marriott headquarters, corporate offices and at managed and franchised hotels.
Mr. Marriott is also known as a lodging innovator – shifting the company’s business model in the late 1970s from hotel ownership to property management and franchising. His strategic decision allowed the company to accelerate its growth and broaden its leadership position. That transformation culminated in the company’s split in 1993 into Marriott International – a hotel management and franchising company headed by Mr. Marriott – and Host Marriott International, a hotel ownership company chaired by his brother, Richard Marriott.
In January 2007, Marriott on the Move, one of the first regular corporate CEO blogs was launched. Mr. Marriott’s award-winning blog, with more than 137,000 followers, extends further his global reach and influence that complements his well-known visits to hundreds of hotels annually.
Mr. Marriott serves on the board of trustees of The J. Willard & Alice S. Marriott Foundation. He is a former member of the Executive Committee of the World Travel & Tourism Council, and has served on the Board of Trustees of the National Geographic Society and as a director of the U.S. Naval Academy Foundation. Previously, Mr. Marriott was chairman of the President’s Export Council, and served on the board of General Motors and the Mayo Clinic.
Mr. Marriott grew up in the Washington, D.C. area, where he attended St. Albans School.  At the University of Utah he earned a bachelor’s degree in banking and finance, and went on to serve as an officer in the United States Navy. Mr. Marriott is an active member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He is married to the former Donna Graff. They are the parents of four children, and have 15 grandchildren and 18 great grandchildren.

Life and career[edit]
Marriott was born in Washington, D.C., the son of Alice and J. Willard Marriott, the founder of Marriott International. He attended St. Albans School in Washington, DC, and earned a Bachelor of Science degree in finance from the University of Utah, where he became a member of the Sigma Chi Fraternity. He served on an aircraft carrier as an officer in the United States Navy Supply Corps.[1] He is also an Eagle Scout and recipient of the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award.[2]
Marriott has described how he learned a lifelong management lesson from an offhand remark made by President Dwight D. Eisenhower when he and his wife, Mamie, were guests at the house of Marriott's father in 1954. When Eisenhower was given the option to either go outside and shoot quail in the cold or stand by the fire, he turned to 22-year-old Bill Marriott and simply asked, "What do you think we should do?" Says Marriott, "So I tried to adopt that style of management as I progressed in life by asking my people, 'What do you think?'...The four most important words in the English language are, 'What do you think?' "[1]
Marriott joined the Marriott Corporation in 1956, was elected Executive Vice President and member of the Board of Directors in January 1964 and president of the company in November 1964, Chief Executive Officer in 1972, and Chairman of the Board in 1985. During his tenure at Marriott, Bill introduced the practice of Revenue Management to the hotel industry.[3]
Marriott is actively involved in various boards and councils including, the U.S. Travel and Tourism Promotional Advisory Board, the executive committee of the World Travel and Tourism Council, the National Business Council, the board of trustees of the National Urban League, a director of the National Geographic Society, and a director of the Naval Academy Endowment Trust. He serves as chairman of the President's Export Council, a group that advises the President on matters relating to export trade, and serves as chairman of the Leadership Council of the Laura Bush Foundation for America's Libraries.
He is an active member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). In an episode of 60 Minutes aired on April 7, 1996, Marriott was interviewed regarding his faith by Mike Wallace. The episode also included interviews with football star Steve Young and church leader Gordon B. Hinckley.[4] In 1997 Marriott was called by the church to be an Area Authority Seventy and member of the Fifth Quorum of Seventy.[5] This was split in 2004 and Marriott joined the newly created Sixth Quorum of the Seventy, serving until his release on October 1, 2011.[6][7][8]
On May 4, 2006, Marriott received an honorary doctorate of humanities from Weber State University during the university's 127th commencement. He also delivered the commencement address during those proceedings.
Marriott's book The Spirit To Serve (1997),[9] ghost written by Kathi Ann Brown and with a foreword by James C. Collins, is a personal view of the rise of the Marriott Company and outlines principles of business success.
Marriott received the Foreign Language Advocacy Award in 2010 from the Northeast Conference on the Teaching of Foreign Languages in recognition of programs that provided language instruction to both non-English speaking and English speaking employees of Marriott Corporation and of training opportunities provided to young people entering the hospitality industry around the globe.[10]
On December 13, 2011, Marriott announced that he would assume the role of Executive Chairman of the company and relinquish the role of Chief Executive Officer, effective March 31, 2012, to Arne Sorenson.[11]

Life and career[edit]
Marriott was born in Washington, D.C., the son of Alice and J. Willard Marriott, the founder of Marriott International. He attended St. Albans School in Washington, DC, and earned a Bachelor of Science degree in finance from the University of Utah, where he became a member of the Sigma Chi Fraternity. He served on an aircraft carrier as an officer in the United States Navy Supply Corps.[1] He is also an Eagle Scout and recipient of the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award.[2]
Marriott has described how he learned a lifelong management lesson from an offhand remark made by President Dwight D. Eisenhower when he and his wife, Mamie, were guests at the house of Marriott's father in 1954. When Eisenhower was given the option to either go outside and shoot quail in the cold or stand by the fire, he turned to 22-year-old Bill Marriott and simply asked, "What do you think we should do?" Says Marriott, "So I tried to adopt that style of management as I progressed in life by asking my people, 'What do you think?'...The four most important words in the English language are, 'What do you think?' "[1]
Marriott joined the Marriott Corporation in 1956, was elected Executive Vice President and member of the Board of Directors in January 1964 and president of the company in November 1964, Chief Executive Officer in 1972, and Chairman of the Board in 1985. During his tenure at Marriott, Bill introduced the practice of Revenue Management to the hotel industry.[3]
Marriott is actively involved in various boards and councils including, the U.S. Travel and Tourism Promotional Advisory Board, the executive committee of the World Travel and Tourism Council, the National Business Council, the board of trustees of the National Urban League, a director of the National Geographic Society, and a director of the Naval Academy Endowment Trust. He serves as chairman of the President's Export Council, a group that advises the President on matters relating to export trade, and serves as chairman of the Leadership Council of the Laura Bush Foundation for America's Libraries.
He is an active member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). In an episode of 60 Minutes aired on April 7, 1996, Marriott was interviewed regarding his faith by Mike Wallace. The episode also included interviews with football star Steve Young and church leader Gordon B. Hinckley.[4] In 1997 Marriott was called by the church to be an Area Authority Seventy and member of the Fifth Quorum of Seventy.[5] This was split in 2004 and Marriott joined the newly created Sixth Quorum of the Seventy, serving until his release on October 1, 2011.[6][7][8]
On May 4, 2006, Marriott received an honorary doctorate of humanities from Weber State University during the university's 127th commencement. He also delivered the commencement address during those proceedings.
Marriott's book The Spirit To Serve (1997),[9] ghost written by Kathi Ann Brown and with a foreword by James C. Collins, is a personal view of the rise of the Marriott Company and outlines principles of business success.
Marriott received the Foreign Language Advocacy Award in 2010 from the Northeast Conference on the Teaching of Foreign Languages in recognition of programs that provided language instruction to both non-English speaking and English speaking employees of Marriott Corporation and of training opportunities provided to young people entering the hospitality industry around the globe.[10]
On December 13, 2011, Marriott announced that he would assume the role of Executive Chairman of the company and relinquish the role of Chief Executive Officer, effective March 31, 2012, to Arne Sorenson.[11]

J.W. Marriott, Jr. Addresses Detroit Economic Club

Industry Update




Press Release 2 October 2000J.W. Marriott, Jr. Addresses Detroit Economic Club

DETROIT, Oct. -- Marriott International, Inc. MAR today outlined the company's five-point strategy to attract and retain employees. As one of the largest lodging hospitality companies in the world, Marriott maintains a workforce of approximately 150,000 associates in 59 countries. The company expects to open at least 400 additional hotels over the next two to three years, creating more than 20,000 new jobs.

In a speech delivered to several hundred executives at the Detroit Economic Club, J.W. Marriott, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of Marriott International, said, "With employment rates holding at record-high levels, recruiting and retaining employees is the greatest challenge facing American business today."

Mr. Marriott added that while the company has one of the lowest turnover rates in the hospitality industry, the company's competitive strength depends upon recruiting, developing and retaining high-quality associates. "We invest $100 million per year on training alone. It is a key part of our employment package, which is designed to attract and retain the best people. How we invest in and manage our human capital today will dictate our success tomorrow," Mr. Marriott said.
"An employee searching for a job has just as many choices as a consumer shopping for a product or service. Just as our customers know that value transcends price, we must offer our employees value beyond just compensation."
Mr. Marriott said the company's "human capital strategy" focuses on five principles to generate even greater value for employees and the company. They include:
1) Get it right the first time. Hire the right person for the right job. "Good managers identify, hire and wisely place top talent," Mr. Marriott said.
2) Money isn't the only thing. "Money is just one component of value, and managers must offer the whole package: competitive compensation and a great workplace. Our research shows that while pay is a top concern in decisions to stay or leave, other factors combine to outweigh money – such as work-life balance, leadership quality, career development opportunities and work environment. The longer an employee is with us, the more important the non- monetary issues become," Mr. Marriott said.
3) Create a caring workplace. "Pay may keep people on the job, but it won't motivate them to produce more value for the company or go the extra mile. In our industry, a genuinely warm, caring, empathetic workplace is a clear driver of the quality of our product."
4) Promote from within: "We give every associate the opportunity to advance as far as their abilities will take them. Not only does this help us build long-term leadership, it also enables us to perpetuate our culture, which provides our company with a sustainable competitive advantage." Mr. Marriott noted that more than 50 percent of the company's current managers have been promoted from within, adding, "Employees specifically cite the opportunity for advancement as a key factor in their decisions to stay with Marriott."
5) Build Your Brand: "Consumer branding enables us to make a sale to customers who have unlimited choices. Employment branding enables us to attract potential employees, who also have a wide range of choices," said Mr. Marriott. "Today more than ever, employees seek out brands with strong reputations and high standards."
Marriott International, Inc. MAR is a leading worldwide hospitality company with over 2,000 operating units in the United States and 58 other countries and territories. Marriott operates and franchises hotels under the Marriott, Renaissance, Residence Inn, Courtyard, TownePlace Suites, Fairfield Inn, SpringHill Suites and Ramada International brand names; operates Ritz-Carlton brand hotels through The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company LLC; develops and operates vacation ownership resorts under the Marriott, Ritz-Carlton Club and Horizons brands; operates executive apartments and conference centers; and provides furnished corporate housing through its ExecuStay by Marriott division. Other Marriott businesses include senior living communities and services, wholesale food distribution, and procurement services. Marriott is headquartered in Washington, D.C., and has approximately 151,000 employees. In fiscal year 1999, Marriott International reported systemwide sales of $17.7 billion.

The forward-looking statements in this press release are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including the effects of economic conditions, supply and demand changes for hotel rooms, competitive conditions in the lodging industry, relationships with clients and property owners, the impact of government regulations, and the availability of capital to finance growth, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the statements herein.

            Marriott, Jr., J.W.
        

           Aug 19, 2013
        

       J.W. Marriott, Jr. Nominated by Convention Industry Council (CIC)  Inducted in 1990  Shaping the Industry J.W. Marriott Jr. is widely recognized in the hospitality industry for his visionary expansion of the eponymous company's lodging division for more than 50 years, during which time Marriott was consistently ranked as one of the hospitality industry's most admired companies and one of the best places to work.  Bill was born into, raised by, and worked his way up through the ranks of the Marriott family business. Eager to manage his own piece of the family enterprise, he asked his father to place him in charge of the small hotel division. Immediately faced with the challenges and hurdles of running a new business, he applied the lessons he learned earlier from his father—mainly to understand every facet of the business by using a hands-on approach to management.    Single Most Important Contribution Known throughout the industry for his hands-on management style, Bill built a highly regarded corporate culture that emphasized the importance of its people and recognized the value they bring to the organization. Marriott International is also well known as a great place to work and for its commitment to diversity, social responsibility and community engagement. His dedication to excellence has set the standards for convention service and facilities worldwide.

       J.W. Marriott, Jr. Nominated by Convention Industry Council (CIC)  Inducted in 1990  Shaping the Industry J.W. Marriott Jr. is widely recognized in the hospitality industry for his visionary expansion of the eponymous company's lodging division for more than 50 years, during which time Marriott was consistently ranked as one of the hospitality industry's most admired companies and one of the best places to work.  Bill was born into, raised by, and worked his way up through the ranks of the Marriott family business. Eager to manage his own piece of the family enterprise, he asked his father to place him in charge of the small hotel division. Immediately faced with the challenges and hurdles of running a new business, he applied the lessons he learned earlier from his father—mainly to understand every facet of the business by using a hands-on approach to management.    Single Most Important Contribution Known throughout the industry for his hands-on management style, Bill built a highly regarded corporate culture that emphasized the importance of its people and recognized the value they bring to the organization. Marriott International is also well known as a great place to work and for its commitment to diversity, social responsibility and community engagement. His dedication to excellence has set the standards for convention service and facilities worldwide.
