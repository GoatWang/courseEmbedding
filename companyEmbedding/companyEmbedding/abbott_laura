Item Description: Arcola Creek Press, United States, 2016. Paperback. Book Condition: New. Language: English . Brand New Book ***** Print on Demand *****. At just a few months old, Kalli arrived in her forever home-determined to train her new owners, Laura and Marc Abbott, to be perfect humans. Brilliant, fearless, and displaying little patience for the antics of other dogs, she was always a spaniel with a mind of her own. Even in the face of obedience classes, the calculating canine was constantly plotting her next move, working the system in any way she possibly could. But it wasn t just Laura and Marc s lives that Kalli changed forever. As a certified therapy dog, she helped teenage girls with substance abuse problems-and even assisted a young man as he learned to speak again in the wake of a stroke. In Kalli: A Spaniel s Life, you ll discover the extraordinary story of this very special companion-from her adventures as a young puppy to her therapy work and the many people she touched throughout her life. Featuring passages with Kalli s personal thoughts and insights, this hilarious and heartfelt memoir also delves into the process of animal communication and how a beloved pet s guidance continued to impact her owners even after the end of her earthly life.

ICYMI: Governor Abbott On The Laura Ingraham Show


April 23, 2015 | Austin, Texas | Press Release 
Governor Greg Abbott today joined The Laura Ingraham Show to discuss the ongoing lawsuit against the Obama Administration‚Äôs executive amnesty order and the importance of securing the border, among other issues.
Excerpts from the interview:
‚ÄúCurrently there are still more than 10,000 people coming across the border each and every month unauthorized. And again, we are seeing an explosion of people coming here from countries other than Mexico and an increase in the number of people coming from what are called ‚Äòcountries of interest‚Äô‚Äîthese are countries that have ties to terrorism.
‚ÄúAnd we have very serious problems on the border ‚Äì which is why I am working on a package where Texas is going to step up and do what the federal government has failed to do ‚Äì we‚Äôre going to increase our border security, we‚Äôre going to add close to a billion dollars in funding from state dollars so that we will secure our border.
‚ÄúRemember this one last fact, Laura, and that is ‚Äì these people don‚Äôt just mysteriously show up, they show up because they are paying a heavy price to the drug cartels who are bringing them here.
‚ÄúOur goal is to put the drug cartels out of business, make them lose money in trying to bring people here and their smuggling and trafficking operations, and make them take their business elsewhere.
‚ÄúI am trying to get all the presidential candidates to come to Texas ‚Äì I‚Äôll even give a tour to Hillary Clinton. I want every single one of them to know and see firsthand what is going on.
‚ÄúWe take them up in the air, we take them on the ground, we take them on the river ‚Äì we show before their very eyes these people who are coming across the border unauthorized. We see how their own laws and their own sovereignty are being violated, and so our goal is to help all these candidates understand what is really taking place on the ground and my demand as the Governor of Texas is that they step up and fix this problem.
‚ÄúI am going to be working as strongly as I can to oppose anybody who is not going to first secure our border and I am going to strongly advocate the necessity that whoever is elected president step up and do the fundamental job of the federal government ‚Äì which is to protect our sovereignty.‚Äù

Big Pharma & Medical Device ManufacturersAbbVie and AbbottAbbVieSpun off from Abbott Laboratories in January 2013, drug maker AbbVie now ranks 143 on Forbes‚Äô list of the largest companies worldwide, pulling in at 71st in market value and 83 in sales, in spite of legal issues that have threatened some of its largest selling products.Jump To TopicBillion Dollar Making DrugsLawsuits & Challenges to Patent RightsLawsuits Over DrugsMedical MarijuanaCorporate HistoryJump To TopicSelect TopicBillion Dollar Making DrugsLawsuits & Challenges to Patent RightsLawsuits Over DrugsMedical MarijuanaCorporate HistoryEstablished: 2013 (History dates back to 1888)
Headquarters: Chicago, IL
Founder: Wallace C. Abbott
Size: 29,000 employees in 75 countries
Popular Products: Humira, Imbruvica, Viekira, Lupron, AndroGel, Marinol
2016 Revenue: $25.6 billion
AbbVie, the fledgling, research-based biopharmaceutical company, netted $18.8 billion in sales in its first year, growing to $25.6 billion in 2016, largely on the strength of Humira, its blockbuster arthritis drug. Now, the company, with 29,000 employees in 75 countries, markets more than 30 products and has more than 50 drugs in development.

The company focuses on four therapeutic areas where it says it has proven expertise. Those areas are:

Immunology
Oncology
Neuroscience
Virology


According to its website, AbbVie ‚Äútakes on the toughest health challenges. But we do more than treat diseases ‚Äî we aim to make a remarkable impact on people‚Äôs lives.‚Äù
Although the company has faced some legal issues, with lawsuits accusing it of fraudulent marketing of a testosterone-enhancing drug, for example, it has maintained a stellar reputation in the industry.
The Boston-based Reputation Institute announced in May 2017 that AbbVie had the best reputation among pharma companies. The ranking was based on more than 16,500 reputation rankings in eight markets, Brazil, France, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States.
In seven measured areas of reputation, AbbVie led in three of them: workplace, governance and citizenship.
‚ÄúSince the company‚Äôs inception less than five years ago, we have worked to raise a better understanding of AbbVie among our key stakeholders,‚Äù said Laura Schumacher, executive vice president of external affairs at AbbVie. ‚ÄúWe are pleased that these efforts have resonated with our global audience and driven greater understanding of who we are and what we stand for as a company.‚Äù
According to the reputation institute, higher reputation ratings translate in increases in the likelihood that people will recommend a company. ‚ÄúIn a world where word of mouth is becoming more and more critical, reputation is proving to be a key driver of business success, and that‚Äôs why the leading companies are actively measuring and managing it,‚Äù said Kaspar Ulf Nielsen, an official at the Reputation Institute.
AbbVie‚Äôs Drugs Make Billions

Fact
Abbvie‚Äôs arthritis drug Humira is the world‚Äôs top-selling drug, bringing in $16 billion in 2016.

By far, AbbVie‚Äôs biggest sales generator ‚Äî also the world‚Äôs top-selling drug ‚Äî is the arthritis drug Humira, which brought in a jaw-dropping $16 billion in 2016. Forbes has called Humira one of the biggest selling products of all time.
To put that in some perspective, that‚Äôs more than the national government budgets of more than 100 countries, including Panama ($12.4 billion), Jordan ($11.2 billion), and Iceland ($7.9 billion).
All that revenue comes at a steep cost to patients, insurance companies and taxpayers, who can pay $50,000 a year or more per patient for the drug. AbbVie spends heavily marketing its crown jewel. In 2015, the company spent $357 million marketing Humira.
Also used to treat psoriasis and Crohn‚Äôs disease, Humira accounts for more than 62 percent of AbbVie‚Äôs total annual sales. Perhaps, not surprisingly, other pharmaceutical companies are looking for a piece of that action.

Humira works by blocking proteins called tumor necrosis factor (TNF) which are naturally produced by the immune system
Part of the reason for the high-level of revenue is that AbbVie doubled the price of the drug over a three-year period. The price actually went up about 3 percent every three months, according to one analyst.
Humira works by blocking certain proteins called tumor necrosis factor (TNF) which is naturally produced by the immune symptom. An overproduction of the proteins has been linked to Crohn‚Äôs disease and other inflammation conditions.

Humira is the focus of patent fights, as rivals seek to make generic versions known as biosimilars, and AbbVie tries to stave them off by filing new patents to keep the generics off the market. AbbVie has filed more than 70 new patents on Humira covering such things as formulations, manufacturing methods and uses. In May 2017, AbbVie lost a round to the company Coherus on a case in which it challenged one of AbbVie‚Äôs patents. However, according to Fortune, other patents should protect Abbvie‚Äôs sales through 2022.
‚ÄúAny company seeking to market a biosimilar version of Humira will have to contend with this extensive patent estate, which AbbVie intends to enforce vigorously,‚Äù said AbbVie Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Richard A. Gonzalez, according to The New York Times.





‚ÄúAny company seeking to market a biosimilar version of Humira will have to contend with this extensive patent estate, which AbbVie intends to enforce vigorously.‚Äù- Richard A. Gonzalez, AbbVie Chairman and Chief Executive Officer





But AbbVie isn‚Äôt relying solely on Humira in the arthritis market. It‚Äôs positioning a new drug, Upadacitinib, which in June 2017 succeeded in a late-stage study on patients who hadn‚Äôt responded well to other treatments. If the new drug gets the go-ahead from the FDA, it could ease the company‚Äôs reliance on Humira.
Patients Allege Drug Injuries
Humira has also been the subject of some litigation by people who say they were injured after taking the drug.
Abbott was ordered by a jury in 2013 to pay a North Dakota family $2.24 million in the case of Delores Tietz, who took the drug for almost seven months in 2009 until suffering from a fungal infection caused by the drug. She spent 13 months in the hospital and had to undergo physical and speech therapy.

Close up of histoplasmosis, an invasive fungal infection
The FDA in 2008 required the makers of TNF blocking drugs like Humira to strengthen existing warnings on the risk of developing fungal infections after some patients with the infections died. Although the risk of serious infections had been included in the prescribing information since the drugs were approved, the FDA said health care professionals weren‚Äôt always recognizing cases of histoplasmosis and other invasive fungal infections, leading to some delays in treatment.
In 2009, the FDA required makers of TNF blockers, including Humira, to update the boxed warning to alert healthcare professionals of an increased risk of lymphoma and other malignancies in children and adolescents treated with the drugs.
Other Top Performers
Although their revenue isn‚Äôt anywhere near Humira‚Äôs, other AbbVie top performers include Imbruvica (cancer drug), with $1.8 billion in 2016 world sales; Viekira (hepatitis C) at $1.5 billion, and Lupron (synthetic hormone), coming in at $821 million. Then there‚Äôs, Synthroid (thyroid) at $763 million and Synagis (prevents severe respiratory disease in infants) and Creon (replaces pancreatic enzymes) each at $730 million. Troubled testosterone booster AndroGel generated $675 million in sales in 2016, a tumble from 2013 when sales were at $1.4 billion. Sales of the drug dropped precipitously in 2015 after the Food and Drug Administration required a warning that testosterone supplements could increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes.
AbbVie has sought FDA approval to market Imbruvica for additional conditions, including chronic graft-versus-host disease.
Lawsuits Over Some of AbbVie‚Äôs Drugs
The company faces thousands of lawsuits from men who say they suffered heart attacks and other injuries after taking AndroGel. The plaintiffs accuse the company and others of fabricating a condition called ‚ÄúLow T‚Äù in order to explode the market for a product that had been received FDA approval for a specific disease. The company is also accused of failing to disclose known risks associated with taking the drug.

AndroGel was marketed as a solution to the natural symptoms of aging
AbbVie and other companies are defendants in more than 4,000 lawsuits in federal court in multidistrict litigation Chicago, as well as hundreds of cases in various state courts. The lawsuits allege AbbVie aggressively marketed AndroGel as the solution to the natural symptoms of aging, such as fatigue and grumpiness. The plaintiffs say they were injured when they took the drug, which had risks that were known as far back as the 1970s but were never disclosed to patients.
AbbVie says the FDA approval process and regulations were followed, and that its marketing practices were covered by the First Amendment. It is also challenging whether AndroGel caused the specific injuries suffered. In a statement emailed to Bloomberg, AbbVie spokeswoman Toni Haubert said, ‚ÄúWe believe our disease education and marketing of AndroGel have adhered strictly to FDA-approved uses and are in full compliance with applicable standards.‚Äù
AbbVie also sells the anti-seizure drug Depakote, but it is not one of the company‚Äôs top sellers. In 2012, Abbott agreed to pay $1.6 billion for illegal marketing of the drug, which is the focus of lawsuits over birth defects suffered by children of mothers who took it during pregnancy. In February 2017, a federal jury in Cleveland ruled in favor of Abbott and AbbVie in the case of a woman who had sued the companies claiming they were responsible for her son‚Äôs birth defects after she took Depakote while pregnant.
Medical Marijuana
Another of Abbvie‚Äôs drugs, Marinol, has caused some analysts to classify Abbvie as a medical marijuana maker. That‚Äôs because Marinol‚Äôs active ingredients is a synthetic cannabinoid ‚Äî man-made delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol or THC.

Marinol was the first FDA-approved cannabis drug
Marinol received FDA approval in 1985 for chemotherapy-related nausea and vomiting and in 1992 to treat anorexia associated with weight loss in patients with AIDS. It was the first FDA-approved cannabis drug.
Marinol was developed by Solvay Pharmaceuticals; In 2010 Abbott bought Solvay‚Äôs pharmaceutical division, including Marinol. Abbvie doesn‚Äôt release its sales numbers, but analysts think they may be suffering because of the availability of generic versions of the drug. According to one report, Solvay said in 2007 that the drug had generated more than $100 million, but those numbers sank to less than half of that when generics came on the market the following year.
AbbVie‚Äôs Corporate History
Although AbbVie is relatively new, it builds on the 125-year history of Abbott Laboratories, founded in 1888 by Dr. Wallace C. Abbott started making tiny ‚Äúdosimetric granules,‚Äù tiny pills made from medicinal plants, which he sold in his drugstore in Chicago.
Abbott announced the planned split in 2011, maintaining the parts of the business that concentrated on medical devices such as heart stents, and allowing AbbVie to focus on research-based pharmaceuticals. The company says its name represents its connection to the past and future.
Analysts said the spinoff allowed investors to choose levels of risk and possible reward, with the pharmaceuticals having higher levels of both potential risk and possible payoff. AbbVie was led from the outset by Gonzalez, a veteran Abbott executive.
Since it split from Abbott, AbbVie has increased its annual research and development investment from $2.8 billion in 2013 to $4.15 billion in 2016. And it says its revenue and earnings have grown every year since it became a stand-alone entity.

Big Pharma & Medical Device ManufacturersBig Pharma and Medical Device ManufacturersBig Pharma is the nickname given to the world's vast and influential pharmaceutical industry and its trade group, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America or PhRMA. Big Pharma and medical device companies make billions of dollars every year selling drugs and devices ‚Äî including those that were recalled or involved in fraud or product liability lawsuits.Jump To TopicAbout Big PharmaBig Pharma‚Äôs InfluenceBig Pharma Sways OpinionsInfluencing Doctors & ResearchersFraud SettlementsManufacturer DirectoryJump To TopicSelect TopicAbout Big PharmaBig Pharma‚Äôs InfluenceBig Pharma Sways OpinionsInfluencing Doctors & ResearchersFraud SettlementsManufacturer DirectoryThe pharmaceutical industry ‚Äî nicknamed Big Pharma ‚Äî is one of the most powerful industries in the world. The global revenue for pharmaceuticals was over $1 trillion in 2014. But nowhere else in the world do the drug and medical device industries have as much power and make as much money as in the U.S.
In fact, Americans spent an all-time high of $457 billion on prescription drugs in 2015. By 2020, it will be $610 billion. Medical devices are also lucrative. The U.S. makes up about half of the world‚Äôs share of the market at about $148 billion, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.

US based big pharma companies
Meanwhile, drug prices continue to rise. Consulting firm Segal Consulting expects drug prices for Americans under age 65 to rise 11.6 percent in 2017. In contrast, wages are only expected to rise 2.5 percent, leaving many American unable to afford their medications.
Big Pharma even contributes heavily to the annual budget of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) through application fees (user fees) for its new products. Experts say the industry contributes about two thirds of the FDA‚Äôs budget.
Five of the top 10 pharma and medical device companies for 2016 are headquartered in the U.S.: Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, Merck, Gilead and AbbVie.
The underside of the industry reveals a history of fraud, bribery, product liability lawsuits and scandals that led to billions in settlements ‚Äî a known cost of doing business for these companies who are ‚Äútoo big to jail.‚Äù Despite criminal charges and fines, the companies continue to do business.
Who is Big Pharma?
The majority of drugs and medical devices have ties to a small group of parent companies. Prescription drugs and devices manufactured by these companies bring in billions in profits. The biggest drug makers may also have subsidiaries that manufacture medical devices.
Pharmaceutical companies are typically larger and make more money than companies that focus on medical devices.


The most powerful drug and device companies are members of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) ‚Äî the industry‚Äôs U.S. lobbying organization.

With the help of staggering profits and an army of 1,378 paid lobbyists, the industry spreads its influence on Capitol Hill. From 1998 to 2016, Big Pharma spent nearly $3.5 billion on lobbying expenses ‚Äî more than any other industry. In 2016 alone, it spent about $246 million ‚Äî more than the defense industries and corporate business lobbyists combined.

Fact
Only 28 percent of Americans have a good opinion of Big Pharma.

Only 28 percent of Americans have a good opinion of Big Pharma. In fact, they are the second most hated industry in the U.S. They are also the biggest defrauder of the Federal Government under the False Claims Act, according to consumer watchdog group Public Citizen.
The Reputation Institute evaluated public perception of 17 pharmaceutical companies for products and services, innovation, workplace, governance, citizenship and financial performance. The Institute based its results on 16,800 ratings from the U.S., U.K., Canada and other countries.
Of all the countries, the U.S. had the lowest opinion of pharmaceutical companies. Older people had the most favorable view of the industry.

Medical Device Manufacturers
Medical devices can be anything from hospital diagnostic equipment to hip and knee implants. Several companies only produce medical devices, but some drug manufacturers, such as Johnson & Johnson, also manufacture devices.

Fact
Part of the total pharmaceutical industry lobbying price tag comes from the Medical Device Manufacturers Association (MDMA).

Like Big Pharma, medical device manufacturers also have a lobbying group to pursue their interests in Washington.Part of the total pharmaceutical industry lobbying price tag comes from the Medical Device Manufacturers Association (MDMA).
In 2016, it contributed $1.2 million in lobbying funds. Its efforts concentrate on medical device friendly bills in Congress mostly related to how companies pay taxes.
Five of the top medical devices companies have their headquarters in the U.S.: Johnson & Johnson, Baxter International, Abbott Laboratories, Stryker and Boston Scientific.

Big Pharma‚Äôs Influence
Critics contend that Big Pharma uses manipulative tactics and expensive advertising to sway lawmakers, the FDA and the public to increase sales.
The public is exposed to Pharma‚Äôs misleading promotions and advertising. For example, critics say AbbVie and other companies who make testosterone replacement drugs such as AndroGel marketed their drugs as the fountain of youth to older men. They created a marketing campaign around the condition ‚ÄúLow T‚Äù that featured a quiz for men to self-diagnose Low T symptoms.

Androgel, above, was marketed as the ‚Äúfountain of youth‚Äù with few studies to back it up
The testosterone market soared into the billions as a result. But few studies back up drug-company claims that the drug significantly enhances mood, vitality and sexual performance. Studies also link these drugs to heart problems. The FDA added a warning on the label after millions of men were already exposed to the risk.
The American public is not the only sector of society influenced by Big Pharma‚Äôs techniques. Doctors, scientists and research organizations, medical journals, teaching hospitals and university medical schools all exhibit disturbing conflicts of interest between their publicly stated missions and their financial and ideological subjection to Big Pharma.
Doctors conduct research with funds from Big Pharma. Private charities and foundations account for a mere 5 percent of the estimated $100 billion spent on biomedical research in the U.S. each year. Pharmaceutical and medical device companies contribute approximately 60 percent.
Big Pharma has a track record of hiring former government workers with valuable connections to gain political clout.

 The trade group PhRMA has many current or former staff members who once served in the political arena, including:

36 who worked for a member of Congress
13 who worked for a federal agency
12 who worked for a congressional committee
Two who worked for the White House
One who worked in the court system


Using these connections to pursue industry goals, Big Pharma has a significant competitive advantage over the public interest.
Marketing, Research and Development (R&D) and Drug Cost
Americans pay more than any other country in the world for pharmaceuticals ‚Äî in some cases, thousands of dollars more per prescription. Big Pharma says this occurs because of the astronomical costs of developing a new drug.

Cost Facts
While companies claim each new drug costs them $1.2 billion, the true cost is more like 60 million.

The truth is that U.S. law allows drug companies to set the prices for drugs and protects them from free-market competition. Other countries set a limit on what companies can charge based on the benefit of the drug. The true cost of developing a drug is shrouded in mystery, with many unverifiable figures reported by Big Pharma.
Donald Light, a professor and expert on the pharma business model, said that while companies claim each new drug costs them $1.2 billion, the true cost is more like 60 million.
The industry also avoids talking about how much it spends on marketing, which is almost double what it spends on research.
Big Pharma Sways Opinions
The large amount of cash Big Pharma bestows on government representatives and regulatory bodies is small when compared with the billions it spends each year on direct-to-consumer advertising. The U.S. is one of only two countries in the world whose governments allow prescription drugs to be advertised on TV (the other is New Zealand).


In 2015, Big Pharma spent $5.4 billion on direct-to-consumer ads and fired off about 80 ads an hour, according to Nielsen.

Big Pharma also employs doctors, researchers and institutions.
The industry persuades doctors to allow ghostwriting, paying physicians to attach their names to positive articles about a particular drug with the goal of seeing it published in a reputable medical journal.

Paid copywriters were used in advertising Paxil,
above
Often the commentary is little more than an advertisement penned by a company paid copywriter showcasing a new product. Big Pharma used ghostwriting to promote numerous drugs, including the antidepressant Paxil, the recalled weight loss drug Fen-Phen, the anti-epilepsy drug Neurontin, the antidepressant Zoloft and painkiller Vioxx, to name a few.
In addition, even when a medical reviewer writes a comprehensive assessment of a new drug for a medical journal, it is common practice for those supposedly unbiased professionals to be on Big Pharma‚Äôs payroll.
These slanted studies appear in medical journals that are widely hailed as collections of unbiased scientific evaluation and separated from the long financial arm of pharmaceutical industry influence. Yet Richard Smith, former editor of the British Medical Journal, says, ‚ÄúAll journals are bought ‚Äî or at least cleverly used ‚Äî by the pharmaceutical industry.‚Äù

Big Pharma tends to weaken the objectivity of even the most honest health professionals while encouraging them to overprescribe medications. Consider the numbers:

Advertising instead of research: For every $1 spent on ‚Äúbasic research,‚Äù Big Pharma spends $19 on promotions and advertising.
Distribution of free drug samples: The U.S. has one pharmaceutical sales representative for every five office-based physicians.
Sponsorship of symposiums and medical conventions: Drug and medical device makers spend lavishly on doctors, including covering meals, travel, seminars and conventions that sometimes look more like vacations.


Many medical journals, including the esteemed Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), actively vie for the attention of Big Pharma advertising dollars, billing themselves as the best way for drug companies to reach their professional readership.
How Big Pharma Influences Doctors and Researchers
Part of Big Pharma‚Äôs formula for creating blockbuster drugs is promoting to physicians and providing kickbacks and incentives to prescribe their expensive, brand name drugs.

Fact
In 2012, Big Pharma spent $24 billion on physician advertising, according to Pew Charitable Trusts.

Drug companies also buy doctors meals and pay them for ‚Äúspeaking engagements‚Äù in exchange for brand loyalty. One 2016 study in JAMA Internal Medicine found that when drug reps bought doctors just one meal costing less than $20 they were more likely to prescribe a promoted brand name drug.
According to ProPublica‚Äôs Dollars for Docs investigation, 1,866 companies paid $6.25 billion to doctors and hospitals from August 2013 to December 2015.

Drug and Device Company Payments to Doctors from Select Companies, August 2013 to December 2015:



Company
PAYMENTS




DePuy (Johnson & Johnson)
$167 million


Stryker Corporation
$153 million


AstraZeneca
$145 million


Pfizer
$128 million


Janssen Pharmaceuticals
$106 million


GlaxoSmithKline
$86.3 million


Boston Scientific
$77 million




Big Pharma and Researchers
Then there are medical researchers, who are hardly immune to Big Pharma‚Äôs financial power. Because drug companies sponsor clinical trials that researchers are paid to administer, too often the academics and scientists are hired hands who supply human subjects and collect data according to the instructions of their corporate employers.
Sponsors keep the data, analyze it, write the papers and decide whether and when and where to submit them for publication. Drug companies also stage-manage trials to produce predetermined outcomes that will put their products in the best light.
Medical Schools and Big Pharma
Big Pharma has also infiltrated medical schools. Teachers, department chairs and deans often sit on drug companies‚Äô boards of directors. This influences educational content. Money from Big Pharma supports programs within many medical schools and teaching hospitals, and company reps are given access to young doctors to promote their company‚Äôs drugs.


The result is that doctors not only receive biased information but also learn a drug-intensive style of medicine.

Sales reps may influence these doctors to believe that newer, more expensive drugs are always better than old ones.
In most states, doctors must also take accredited education courses, called continuing medical education (CME). The pharmaceutical industry provides a substantial proportion of the billions spent on CME annually and continues to use that support as a marketing tool.
In addition, academic centers are able to receive royalties from Big Pharma on any drug or technology they help to create and patent as a result of research ‚Äî sometimes underwritten with government funds.
Columbia University, for example, received nearly $790 million from licensing agreements with biotech and pharmaceutical companies during the 17-year life of its medical school‚Äôs patent on a method for synthesizing certain biological products.
Columbia University received nearly $790 million from licensing agreements with biotech and pharmaceutical companiesBig Pharma Fraud Settlements
In a 24-year period, Big Pharma companies paid 373 settlements totaling $35.7 billion for marketing fraud, according to Public Citizen‚Äôs 2013 report Pharmaceutical Industry Settlements: 1991 through 2015.

Fact
In a 24-year period, Big Pharma companies paid 373 settlements totaling $35.7 billion for marketing fraud.

The most common charge involved drug-pricing scams against state Medicaid programs. This meant state taxpayers ended up footing the bill while Big Pharma made billions.
Unlawful promotion of drugs yielded the biggest settlements. But these investigations take many years to complete. By then, drug companies have made hundreds of millions or even several billion, while the U.S. Department of Justice fine is typically only a few million.
This makes it too profitable to stop breaking the law for many companies, according to Michael Bobelian of Forbes Magazine.
Manufacturer Directory
Several of the biggest drug and medical device companies sell the majority of their products in the U.S. Many of these products are involved in product liability litigation. Some of the companies‚Äô best-selling drugs brought in over a billion in 2016, according to company annual reports.
AbbVie

Quick Facts:

Business: Sells and markets more than 40 drugs in the U.S.
Products Involved in Current or Past Litigation Include: AndroGel (testosterone replacement), Depakote (antiepileptic), Humira (arthritis, Crohn‚Äôs disease)
Top Selling Drugs 2016: Humira, Imbruvica (cancer)
