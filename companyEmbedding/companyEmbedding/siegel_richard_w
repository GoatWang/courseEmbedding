Siegel is the past               chairman of the International Committee on Nanostructured Materials               and served on the U.S. National Materials Advisory Board Committee               on Materials with Submicron-Sized Microstructures. He also was the               co-chairman of the Study Panel on Clusters and Cluster-Assembled               Materials for the U.S. Department of Energy.  Siegel was on the faculty of the State University               of New York at Stony Brook from 1966 to 1976 and at Argonne National               Laboratory from 1974 to 1995. He joined Rensselaer in 1995, and               served as department head of Materials Science and Engineering until               2000. He has authored more than 200 publications and several patents               (seven have been issued, nine are pending) in the areas of defects               in metals; diffusion; and most recently on the synthesis and processing,               characterization, properties, and applications of nanophase materials,               including ceramics, metals, composites, and biomaterials. Siegel               also has presented more than 400 invited lectures around the world               and edited ten books on these subjects. Science Watch listed               him as the fourth most highly cited author in materials science               from 1990 through 1994.  Siegel is a member of the editorial boards of               Materials Letters, Journal of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology,               and Journal of Metastable and Nanocrystalline Materials,               and was a founding principal editor of Nanostructured Materials.               He is a founder and director of Nanophase Technologies Corporation,               and was recognized for this effort by a 1991 U.S. Federal Laboratory               Consortium Award for Excellence in Technology Transfer. He is an               honorary member of the Materials Research Societies of India and               Japan, a 1994 recipient of an Alexander von Humboldt Foundation               Senior Research Award in Germany, and presented the 1996 MacDonald               Lecture in Canada. In 2001, he was named a RIKEN Eminent Scientist               in Japan and received a 2003 Deutsche Bank Prize: "Pioneer               of Nanotechnology - Nanomaterials." Research Areas: Siegel's research focuses on the synthesis               and processing, characterization, properties, and applications of               nanostructured materials, including ceramics, metals, composites,               and biomaterials. His research is involved with the creation of               nanoscale building blocks, especially inorganic nanoparticles, and               their directed assembly into useful materials and devices. His activities               include a wide range of studies of polymer-based and ceramic-based               nanocomposites, as well as hierarchical material systems based on               these components. Using such nanostructured materials, both hard               and soft material systems for biomedical tissue engineering are               being actively investigated, along with related fundamental scientific               issues.

                              fields, but the scope of this particular work is unique. This report reviews the status of research and development in nanoparticles,
                              nanostructured materials, and nanodevices worldwide, with particular focus on comparisons between the United States and other
                              leading industrialised countries. Topics covered include particle synthesis and assembly, dispersions and coatings of nanoparticles,
                              high surface area materials, functional nanoscale devices, bulk behaviour of nanostructured materials, and biological methods
                              and application. The final chapter examines related government funding programmes around the world. Site reports of visits
                              conducted by the WTEC panel to leading laboratories in Japan and Europe are also given. Audience: This volume will be of interest
                              to researchers from a wide range of disciplines whose work involves materials science, condensed matter physics, chemistry,
                              biological sciences, engineering, and computer and information sciences. It can also be recommended as a text for a graduate
                              course in materials science or solid state physics

                              This report reviews the status of research and development in nanoparticles, nanostructured materials, and nanodevices worldwide,
                                 with particular focus on comparisons between the United States and other leading industrialized countries. Topics covered
                                 include particle synthesis and assembly, dispersions and coatings of nanoparticles, high surface area materials, functional
                                 nanoscale devices, bulk behavior of nanostructured materials, and biological methods and applications. The final chapter is
                                 a review of related government funding programs around the world. The report also includes site reports for visits conducted
                                 by the panel to leading research laboratories in Japan and Europe. The panel held workshops in the United States, Germany,
                                 Sweden, and Russia to gather additional information for this report on activities in those countries. The proceedings of the
                                 U.S. and Russia workshops are being published separately by WTEC. The panel's conclusions include the following: (1) In the
                                 synthesis and assembly area (Chapter 2), the U.S. appears to be ahead with Europe following and then Japan; (2) In the area
                                 of biological approaches and applications (Chapter 7), the U.S. and Europe appear to be rather on a par with Japan following;
                                 (3) In nanoscale dispersions and coatings (Chapter 3), the U.S. and Europe are again similar with Japan following; (4) For
                                 high surface area materials (Chapter 4), the U.S. is clearly ahead of Europe and then Japan; (5) In the nanodevices area (Chapter
                                 5), Japan seems to be leading quite strongly with Europe and the U.S. following; In the area of consolidated materials (Chapter
                                 6), Japan is a clear leader with the U.S. and Europe following. These and other conclusions are reviewed in detail in the
                                 panel's executive summary

                              Timely information on scientific and engineering developments occurring in laboratories around the world provides critical
                                 input to maintaining the economic and technological strength of the United States. Moreover, sharing this information quickly
                                 with other countries can greatly enhance the productivity of scientists and engineers. These are some of the reasons why the
                                 National Science Foundation (NSF) has been involved in funding science and technology assessments comparing the United States
                                 and foreign countries since the early 1980s. A substantial number of these studies have been conducted by the World Technology
                                 Evaluation Center (WTEC) managed by Loyola College through a cooperative agreement with NSF. The National Science and Technology
                                 Council (NSTC), Committee on Technology's Interagency Working Group on NanoScience, Engineering and Technology (CT/IWGN) worked
                                 with WTEC to develop the scope of this Nanostucture Science and Technology report in an effort to develop a baseline of understanding
                                 for how to strategically make Federal nanoscale R & D investments in the coming years. The purpose of the NSTC/WTEC activity
                                 is to assess R & D efforts in other countries in specific areas of technology, to compare these efforts and their results
                                 to U.S. research in the same areas, and to identify opportunities for international collaboration in precompetitive research.
                                 Many U.S. organizations support substantial data gathering and analysis efforts focusing on nations such as Japan. But often
                                 the results of these studies are not widely available. At the same time, government and privately sponsored studies that are
                                 in the public domain tend to be "input" studies

Richard W. Siegel
Robert W. Hunt Professor of Materials Engineering

Richard W. Siegel has been the Robert W. Hunt Professor of Materials Science and Engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute since June 1995, and was Department Head from 1995 to 2000. In April 2001, Dr. Siegel became the founding Director of the Rensselaer Nanotechnology Center at the Institute and, since September 2001, also founding Director of the US National Science Foundation Nanoscale Science and Engineering Center for Directed Assembly of Nanostructures. He was graduated from Williams College in 1958 with an AB degree in physics and received an MS degree in physics in 1960 and a PhD degree in metallurgy in 1965 from the University of Illinois in Urbana. After two years of postdoctoral materials research at Cornell University, Siegel served on the faculty of the State University of New York at Stony Brook (1966-1976) in the Department of Materials Science. He was a research scientist in the Materials Science Division at Argonne National Laboratory from 1974 to 1995, serving most of that time as group leader and research program manager in the areas of metal physics or defects in metals. Dr. Siegel has been a visiting professor in Germany, Israel, India, Switzerland and Japan, and has been active in local, national, and international professional organizations. He was a member (2003-09) of the Nanotechnology Technical Advisory Group of the US President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. He chaired the World Technology Evaluation Center worldwide study of nanostructure science and technology (1996-98) for the US government that led in 2001 to the US National Nanotechnology Initiative, was chairman of the Long Range Planning Committee and a Councillor of the Materials Research Society, and is a past chairman (1992-96) of the International Committee on Nanostructured Materials. Siegel earlier served on the US National Materials Advisory Board Committee on Materials With Sub-Micron Sized Microstructures and was co-chairman of the Study Panel on Clusters and Cluster-Assembled Materials for the US Department of Energy. He has been active in community service as well. From 1983 to 1991 he served on the Governing and Executive Boards of the two-county wide DuPage/West Cook Regional Special Education Association in Illinois and also as an elected member of the Hinsdale Township High School District 86 Board of Education, serving from 1987 to 1991 as the President of the Board. Active in materials research for over 50 years, Siegel has studied the properties of defects in metals, atomic diffusion, and the synthesis, processing, characterization, properties, and applications of nanostructured ceramics, metals, composites, and biomaterials. Dr. Siegel’s research activities have garnered over $60 million in funding from federal, state, industry, and private sponsors. He has authored or coauthored more than 300 articles and patents (21 issued with 6 others pending), edited ten books, presented more than 500 invited lectures around the world on these subjects, and was an Executive Producer of the Molecularium® Project’s Riding Snowflakes (2005), Molecules to the MAX! (2009) and NanoSpace® (2012). Siegel’s work is highly cited with over 10,000 citations to date; he was listed by Science Watch as the fourth- most highly cited author worldwide in materials science during 1990-94 and among the top 100 (0.02%) during 2000-10. He was a founding Editor of Nanostructured Materials, an associate editor of Materials Letters for 25 years, and is presently a member of the Editorial Boards of the Journal of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology and the Journal of Metastable and Nanocrystalline Materials. Siegel is a founder and Director of Nanophase Technologies Corporation, a publicly held manufacturing company started in 1989; his early work with them was recognized by a 1991 US Federal Laboratory Consortium Award for Excellence in Technology Transfer. In 1992 he was made an Honorary Member of the Materials Research Society of India "in recognition of his outstanding contributions to the field of Materials Science and Engineering" and in 1993 he was made an Honorary Member of the Materials Research Society of Japan. Dr. Siegel is a 1994 recipient of an Alexander von Humboldt Foundation Senior Research Award in recognition of his research and teaching accomplishments. He presented the 1996 D.K.C. MacDonald Lecture in Canada. In 2001, Dr. Siegel was named a RIKEN Eminent Scientist in Japan, and in 2003 in Germany he received a Deutsche Bank Prize “Pioneer of Nanotechnology – Nanomaterials”. In 2010, Dr. Siegel was named a Fellow of the Materials Research Society.

Research Overview
 The goal of the Immunoregulation Group is to understand how alterations in regulatory signaling pathways in immune cells lead to abnormal immune responses, chronic inflammation, and autoimmune diseases. The TNF family of cytokines is the main focus of present work, as these cytokines are critical in the pathogenesis and treatment of a number of different autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. We are particularly interested in how membrane-proximal events in receptor signal transduction can be influenced by environmental or other signals to alter cellular responses, since understanding these principles may aid in designing more effective therapeutic strategies to modulate the effects of TNF-receptor family signaling in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.   The general strategy of the lab is to better understand basic mechanisms of transmembrane signal transduction by selected TNF family receptors using the both cell and molecular biology approaches. We are also interested in studying the role of particular TNF family ligand-receptor systems in immune cells through mouse models. Recently, the lab has focused on three members of the TNF-receptor superfamily 

Fas and Fas Ligand: The Fas receptor has been shown to be important in immunoreceptor-mediated apoptosis of activated T and B lymphocytes. Both humans and mice with germ line mutations in the death receptor Fas accumulate abnormal lymphocytes and develop systemic autoimmunity. While most patients with non-familial autoimmune disease do not carry germ line Fas mutations, there is evidence that Fas-mediated apoptosis may be impaired in the milieu of chronic inflammation. We have been investigating what signals regulate Fas-mediated apoptosis in T cells, with the eventual aim of harnessing these discoveries to modulate Fas-induced apoptosis for therapeutic goals in human disease. We have recently identified the Rac family of small GTPases as critical regulators of Fas-induced apoptosis. We are also studying the regulation of FasL trafficking and function and are studying the role of the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein (WASp) in this process
TNF Receptor 1 (TNFR1). This receptor is critical for triggering inflammatory responses in myeloid cells of the immune system and other organ systems, and has been successfully targeted by biologic therapeutics in rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases. We are working with the Genetics and Genomics Branch in NIAMS to understand the pathophysiology of inflammation in patients with the TNF Receptor Associated Periodic Syndrome (TRAPS) a genetic autoinflammatory disease associated with dominant mutations in TNFR1. We have recently discovered that TNFR1 mutant molecules associated with TRAPS are misfolded and accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum. We are characterizing the mechanisms by which these mutant receptors lead to hyperactivity of the innate immune system. 
 DR3: The function of this TNF-family receptor, highly related to TNFR1 but expressed mainly on lymphocytes has not been well characterized. We are investigating novel contributions of this receptor and its ligand, TL1A, to the pathophysiology of autoimmune diseases.
