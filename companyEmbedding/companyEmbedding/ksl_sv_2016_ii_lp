Event Details

Details


THERE’S NO ALGORITHM FOR THIS
 
Between Halloween, competing events, quarterly reporting, quiet periods, road shows, a general malaise in the mortgage industry and a public exhausted by election season, participation in this year’s event will be much more intimate than in previous years, all of which makes the efforts of every one of you to be here that much more special. At the same time, it provides an opportunity to get to know those who are here that much better. While our numbers are down, the caliber of this year’s content and speakers is exceptional. I hope that you will learn some things that you didn’t already know, get inspired by new ideas, and perhaps change the way that you think about the industry in a way that contributes to your greater success.
 
This is the 14th year of the original EUROCATALYST and today’s AMERICATALYST event. Our theme this year is, FAST FORWARD: What Happens Next. One of the most difficult things about creating the program for this event each year is the ubiquitous nature of the housing ecosystem. It is literally affected by everything, and everything is affected by it. By looking at it in the context of globalization, which constantly changes everything faster than anyone can keep up with, each year I begin writing the program from a blank slate. Where we are today is much different than where we were yesterday, or last year. Excluding GSE reform, but hopefully you get my point.
In the course of putting together this year’s topics and sessions, I spent months researching “the future”: the future of central banking; the future of banking; the future of government; the future of regulation; the future of capitalism and economic ideologies; the future of employment; the future of technology, future demographics, and the future of climate change among other issues. I hate to spoil the plot, but the future is pretty daunting to say the least. At least two sessions this year have the word “crisis” in their subtitles, and perhaps my snarkiest title ever - which I was dared to do - says it all: “One Trick Pony: A Bucking Fed Throws Off the Housing Market.” 
For me personally, it is particularly sad to feature the session “Pandora’s Box: Brexit, the Future of Europe and the World Economy.” Of my 30 years in this industry, 14 of them were spent living and working across all EU and non-EU countries. It was there that I was able to implement my greatest career ideas and achievements, and it was truly the experience of a lifetime. The session is also quite poignant and hearkens to the prescience of the very first EUROCATALYST event in Madrid in 2002. My theme that year– much to the dismay of the European Commission and European Mortgage Federation–was, “Will European Markets Survive Globalization?” As this year’s session will discuss, we now know the answer to that question. The unraveling is just a matter of time, and will have a phenomenal impact on the U.S. and the rest of the world.
As most of you know, the factor that differentiates this event from all others is the context in which we look at the most important issues facing our industry, and where it is headed next. Up to this year, that context has been globalization. While there are very intense academic, political and social debates about what globalization is, when it began, and the ideology behind it, for the purposes of this event I am not referring to globalization as one dimensional change but a set of changes, or forces, driven primarily by technology and electronic communication. These forces are social, cultural and political – and not just economic. They widen, deepen and intensify the acceleration of global interconnectedness in all aspects of our lives, and have driven us into a universally shared economic and political arena. It is a convergence (hence our theme in 2011: Convergence) and state of interconnectedness that I refer to as “The Entanglement”, which was the theme of this event in 2012. While today’s interdependent world demands cooperation, compromise and collaboration in order to survive the future, the rise of political extremists and movements around the world show anything but. 
The forces of globalization have altered the structure of states, the nature of economies, our basic institutions, our ideals, the way that we live, and the way that we finance how we live. It encompasses such fundamental and radical changes to our existence that it shifts our knowledge of the world to what we don’t know, rather than what we do know. In short, globalization renders the words “unprecedented” and “unintended consequences” redundant.
This year, I see something new replacing globalization, which Kevin Kelly, the founder of Wired Magazine, refers to as “The Technium”. The Technium is the convergence of technology, culture and economics. At the center of every significant change in our lives now is some kind of new technology. As the accelerant of humanity, technology dictates that we all will live in a permanent state of beta testing from here on out. On the other hand, looking back at history we see that every idea, and every ideology put into action is one grand social experiment in which we don’t really know the outcome. Think about that as you listen to the dialogue of this year’s event. The future is never pre-determined unless apathy triumphs action. There is no algorithm for the future.

 4:15pm - 5:30pm | 1.6 [DEBATE] PUTTING THE UP-SIDE DOWN: The Emergence of Equity Sharing 2.0 
 
Forms of equity sharing known as shared appreciation mortgages or fractional equity ownership, whereby investors purchase fractional interest in homes based on house price appreciation in the future, are nothing new. Affordable housing agencies often provide income-eligible families down payment assistance with structured shared-appreciation mortgages as second-lien loans that mature when the home is sold or the first mortgage refinanced. Immediately after the debacle of 2006/2007, new firms were established to provide a win/win for homeowners to leverage their equity and provide a handsome return to investors seeking to invest in the housing market with minimal downside risk./em>
Today, equity sharing is making a comeback with a variety of differentiated strategies to establish institutionalized platforms, processes and products. Buoyed by the Federal Reserve’s September 16th report stating that American homeowners have $12.7 trillion in equity in their homes (amounting to double the equity as of 2011); a more creative solution to overcome restrictive lending standards; strong support from private equity firms investing in new startups, and investors seeking greater yields (or any yields for that matter), Equity Sharing 2.0 has arrived. This session features two of the leading players in this rapidly growing sector: the very visible Point Digital Finance, backed by Silicon Valley titans including Andreesen Horowitz; Greylock Partners; Ribbit Capital; as well as Brad Greiwe, the co-founder of Invitation Homes; Laurence Tosi, the CFO of Airbnb and Vikram Pandit, formerly of Citigroup, among others; and the seasoned stealth player RevEx, the brainchild of Weiss Analytics founder Allan Weiss. Both models have enormous positive implications for institutional investors, lenders, homeowners, potential homeowners, and Single-Family Rental investors.

This year’s debate is focused on the viability of the product and sector, delves into the details of all players in the sector and how each firm is differentiated, and enables participants to provide robust feedback on how they might tailor the model and its prospects and implications for the future.

 11:30am - 1:00pm | 1.3 BREAKING BAD: Scoring the Housing Finance Market 
 
The U.S. homeownership rate has dropped from a high of 69% in 2004 to its current rate of 63%--the lowest rate since 1965. While banks have almost doubled their core capital since 2007/2008, the mortgage system outside of the banks is largely nationalized, insufficiently capitalized and barely profitable. Worth slightly more than the stock market, the $26 trillion U.S. housing stock is perhaps the largest asset class in the world. In combination with the $11 trillion of debt in the U.S. housing finance system, this makes the American housing market one of the largest concentrations of financial risk anywhere. It remains inextricably linked to the global financial system, with $1 trillion of mortgage debt owned abroad. Despite this increasing global systemic risk, in the ten years since the most severe recession since the Great Depression, the U.S. housing finance market continues unreformed, fundamentally flawed, and ultimately unsustainable in its current condition.

This session continues our 14-year narrative about the impact of globalization on the housing ecosystem by picking up from where we left off with last year’s theme, “RUBICON: No Turning Back.” RUBICON stressed the unprecedented nature of the world today, and emphasized the need to focus on the future as opposed to expectations of or comparisons to a return to the past. This collaborative and interactive opening session establishes the foundation for this year’s event by bringing together six of the best minds in housing to create a comprehensive S.C.O.R.E. (Strengths, Challenges, Options, Responses, and Effectiveness) analysis and strategy assessment of the entire U.S. housing finance system. Our focus is not only on what should change, but how it can transform into a more vibrant, equitable and sustainable system moving forward into the future.

 2:00pm - 3:00pm | 1.4 LANDSLIDE: The Silent Housing Liquidity Crisis 
 
Since 2008, policy response to the “financial crisis” has resulted in a paradox: unprecedented monetary intervention has created a massive overhang of liquidity, which has recently been linked with severe market illiquidity. With interest rates at or below zero in most advanced economies, the monetary base in the U.S. has quadrupled. These actions have reduced the volatility of bond markets, and have caused asset prices (including equities, real estate, and fixed-income private- and public-sector bonds) to soar. Yet sudden shocks and extreme volatility are occurring more frequently throughout the global financial system, fueling fears that even very deep and liquid markets such as US stocks and government bonds are not liquid enough.
Today, the Federal Reserve’s creation of macro liquidity has resulted in more crowded trades and greater investment in illiquid fixed-income bond funds – most of which allow investors to exit overnight. At the same time, tighter regulation has led to high capital costs which, in turn, has reduced profit incentives and virtually eliminated market makers for fixed-income products. As a result, when market shocks occur, the re-pricing of fixed-income products is abrupt and dramatic, and investors caught in crowded trades need to exit swiftly. Because many investments are in illiquid funds without traditional market makers, sellers are forced into fire sales.
The paradox of macro liquidity and market illiquidity has the similar effect of a flood during an extended period of drought. Macro liquidity is the equivalent of a flash flood, fueling booms and bubbles in its wake. Market illiquidity is the drought. What happens when drought-stricken areas experience excessive amounts of rain? Landslides. When the ground literally accelerates downhill, the effect is more damaging than the trigger. Any questions?

This session looks at the pervasive lack of liquidity throughout the housing finance ecosystem from whole loans, to mortgage-backed and government securities and MSRs; the implications of the liquidity crisis for the near future, and what can or should be done to prevent disaster.

 9:00am - 9:45am | 1.1 THE TECHNIUM: The Technological Forces Shaping Our Future  
 
For the past 14 years, this conference has been discussing the evolution of the housing market in a hyper-globalized world. In our context, globalization is not a single economic phenomenon, but a set of changes that are social, cultural, political, economic, and technological, all of which impact the entire housing ecosystem and not just the finance of it. Those forces, in turn, have created a world with greater complexities and unpredictability, and a world beyond our control.
“The Technium” is a term coined by Kevin Kelly, one of the foremost members of the influential tribe of Silicon Valley trailblazers and technology futurists known as “the digerati”. Similar to our view of globalization, Kelly defines “the Technium” as “the convergence of economics, culture and technology” and focuses on technology as both the driver of new problems as well as new solutions. Where globalization is a “winner take all” world, the Technium is an organism of our own making that increases the number of races in which you can win, and new ways in which to win those races. In Part One of this two-part session, Toni Moss discusses how big data, machine learning, and increased computing power will soon make artificial intelligence (AI) ubiquitous, and the profound consequences of it. In discussing the latest advances in technology in the world today, Toni aggregates the commentary and ideas of the leading technology futurists to explain how those technologies are being used; what business models are using them (and in fact what those businesses actually are); how they are dramatically altering the entire housing ecosystem, and the new challenges and opportunities presented by them.

This session continues our 14-year narrative about the impact of globalization on the housing ecosystem by picking up from where we left off with last year’s theme, “RUBICON: No Turning Back.” RUBICON stressed the unprecedented nature of the world today, and emphasized the need to focus on the future as opposed to expectations of or comparisons to a return to the past. This collaborative and interactive opening session establishes the foundation for this year’s event by bringing together six of the best minds in housing to create a comprehensive S.C.O.R.E. (Strengths, Challenges, Options, Responses, and Effectiveness) analysis and strategy assessment of the entire U.S. housing finance system. Our focus is not only on what should change, but how it can transform into a more vibrant, equitable and sustainable system moving forward into the future.
 
 Host:  Toni Moss  

 10:00am - 11:15am | 1.2 THE TECHNIUM 2.0 | OUR PRODUCT IS OUR PROCESS 
 
Today’s astounding technological advances include big data, artificial intelligence, robotics, 3D printing, digital currency, and blockchain, among many others. These advances occur so rapidly that our ability to invent new Things outpaces our human ability to control them. Despite the tools that currently exist, for the most part, the technological advances in the mortgage and real estate industry are more “improvement” than true innovation. Part of this is due to the fact that regulators’ ability to control our new Things outpaces our ability to invent them. (Yes, you read that right). The other part is due to the legacy systems on which we have built an endless series of layers rather than make the necessary investment to rebuild outdated systems. As such, new market entrants enjoy significant advantages over established institutions. One thing is clear: The greatest change in the world is not just the pace of change, but the prevalence of it. From here on out, we live in a “beta” state of constant adaptation, which requires the equally persistent need to create and learn upgraded versions of everything. Unrelenting change means that our processes to accommodate change have not only become more important than our products, our process is our product. 

In the conclusion of this two-part session, we feature leading industry players and technology providers to discuss how new technology will dramatically alter the housing finance and real estate industry and which sectors should, or are, vulnerable to change. We will also discuss how we can leverage new technology to improve existing products, processes and practices, as well as feature firms with new business models who are leading the real estate and housing finance industry into the future.

 3:15pm - 4:15pm | 1.5 HOW THEN SHALL WE LIVE? Enabling Affordable Housing  
 
Affordable housing is not just a low-income problem anymore. The “American dream of homeownership” is being replaced by the American dream to find an affordable home to live in, whether owned or rented. Not only is there a lack of affordable homes to purchase, there is also an extreme lack of affordable homes to rent. Homebuilders are no longer building any material new supply of entry-level “workforce” housing, creating a significant supply/demand imbalance for affordable single-family homes with first-time buyers. In their 2015 study, “Projecting Trends in Severely Cost-Burdened Renters”, an analysis by Enterprise Community Partners and the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies found that the number of households spending 50 percent or more of their income on rent is expected to rise at least 11 percent from 11.8 million to 13.1 million by 2025. At the same time that rents are rising, homeownership rates are declining, incomes are stagnating, and job layoffs are increasing, all of which portray a bleak picture of the increasing severity of renter burdens for the coming decade. 
Why should you care about affordable housing? Despite the variation in types of housing, the housing market itself is an ecosystem. Like any ecosystem, every part of it is interdependent and a dramatic imbalance in one part eventually, if not immediately, affects the entire system. In addition to dystopian social outcomes, housing becomes more expensive when demand outstrips supply. Add to that a Federal Reserve policy that drives a housing bubble, and we have another serious crisis at a time when the Fed has run out of tools to manage it.

This session delves into how the current crisis negatively impacts the entire housing ecosystem and what’s at stake, and introduces some innovative market-rate development programs designed to mitigate the crisis and rebalance the system.

 1:45pm - 2:50pm | 2.4 DEJA VU: House and Rent Price Projections  
 
As discussed in our previous session “One Trick Pony,” the “blowback” from the Federal Reserve’s protracted period of interest rate suppression has resulted in massive bubbles in real estate and house prices and in turn, has priced many Americans out of the housing market entirely. We’ve been here before. In 2006 American house prices rose unabated for the previous ten years, reaching an all-time high that year. While homes have recovered nearly all losses from the 2006 crash, when adjusted for inflation they are currently 20% below the 2006 peak. Some see this as an indication of further room for house price appreciation. On the other hand, as house and rent prices rise, incomes remain flat and credit remains tight. Something has to give. 
One of the more encouraging differences between the crisis and today is greater access to historical data, the ability to utilize that data to better anticipate the direction of house and rent prices, the most granular accuracy on current (and some would say projected) pricing, and the creation of “early warning systems” to enable lenders and regulators to better prepare for a steep decline. However, key economic data used for making critical national economic decisions is flawed in that current measures of inflation do not adequately factor in house price inflation. This is not just a national problem. It is a global one. This past July, editors at The Economist recently described rising U.S. house prices as “a dangerous menace to the world economy”.

This information-heavy session provides facts and figures with diverse conclusions on house and rent price projections and their impact. Along the way, we will show the cities with the greatest risk/reward profiles for residential investment and rent price appreciation. Inevitably, the data will turn into a hot debate about what the data means for the future.

 9:45am - 10:45am | 2.2  PANDORA'S BOX: Brexit, The European Union and the Future of the World Economy 
 
It’s no accident that we would use a Greek myth to refer to the inordinate “uncertainties” that have been unleashed by the June 23rd decision for the U.K. to exit the European Union. While most of us know the basic concepts of “Pandora’s Box” some may have forgotten the important details. “Brexit” may seem like a small, or remote threat to the U.S. housing and real estate market, it does have very far-reaching consequences. For example, in 2015, the U.K. was the largest single source of foreign direct investment in the U.S., accounting for $483 billion, or 16%, of all foreign investments last year. In addition, U.K. foreign investment supports nearly one million jobs across the U.S., with almost one in four of those in the manufacturing sector. Even more important, Britain is the primary channel through which the U.S. exerts its economic and political agenda in Europe, including trade, global tax reform, financial regulation, diplomacy, and other crucial issues. And we haven’t even begun to describe the impact on Europe and the world economy in this description. If you think that it does not impact the U.S. housing market, you won’t want to miss this session. Regarding the important detail of Pandora’s Box, once she closed the Box she did leave “Hope” inside.

 While there is much more at stake than just the housing finance, in this segment we focus on the unintended consequences of Federal Reserve policy on the housing market and the chain reaction impacting not only housing, but every other asset class for at least the next two generations.

 11:30am - 12:15pm | 2.3b THE WAY FORWARD: DAVID STOCKMAN ON COMING BACK FROM THE BRINK 
 In his 2013 book The Great Deformation: The Corruption of Capitalism in America, David Stockman, former Congressman, director of the Office of Management and Budget and the “Father of Reaganomics”, persuasively argued how the American state – and Federal Reserve in particular – has fallen prey to the politics of crony capitalism and the ideologies of fiscal stimulus, monetary central planning, and financial bailouts. The result has been unrelenting political dysfunction, fiscal collapse, and “casino capitalism”, which swindles the masses and enriches the few. In his new book, Trumped! A Nation on the Brink of Ruin … And How to Bring It Back, Stockman discusses how the rigged American system has led to the rise of Donald Trump (as well as Bernie Sanders). Despite the book’s title, Stockman is not an advocate of Trump’s candidacy or message, but instead focuses on the extent to which Trump is the messenger and rallying force behind the political insurrection of Main Street. This segment is focused on Stockman’s ideas on a way forward to economic recovery and prosperity at home and a more safe and stable world abroad.

The transition of traditional real estate transactions onto the Web is nothing new, but enhancing the online real estate process with artificial intelligence and virtual reality will change everything. Currently, most online firms are focused on saving their customers time. Meanwhile, market leaders are already developing more fluid technological structures that will enable customers to experience properties through virtual reality and transact in real time, accelerating purchase and sales decisions to a matter of minutes. In his presentation, Ten-X CEO Tim Morse provides a clear view of the future of real estate and how advances in the online search, selection, acquisition and disposition of real estate will aggregate a global base of buyers and sellers, and drive the entire housing ecosystem into the stream of now.

 
 Host:  Tim Morse  

 2.3 THE FINANCIALIZATION OF POLITICS: The Fed, the Housing Market and the Future of America | featuring Danielle Di Martino Booth and David Stockman 
 
Over the past seven years, central bankers have gone to unprecedented lengths to find new ways to create monetary stimulus within current central banking frameworks. During this time, official interest rates in the US, UK, and the Euro Area have been reduced to zero. Taking it a step further, each of these countries has augmented monetary policy with massive Quantitative Easing programs: The purchase of massive volumes of long-term government securities to reduce their yields. Even further, these institutions have initiated credit easing and liquidity injections in the banking system by purchasing private assets in order to reduce the costs of private-sector borrowing. Further still, they have introduced forward guidance on monetary policy to keep these low interest rates down for a protracted—and undetermined—period of time. Other countries have gone to even greater extremes such that today almost a quarter of the global bond market now has negative interest rates. 
While these endeavors may have prevented inflation (thus far), fund managers argue that these central bank efforts have distorted the price discovery functionality of global markets to such extremes that they have “broken the market” entirely. Bankers and businesses have gone on an investment strike and use cheap central bank money to inflate the prices of their own assets. The result is a massive bubble in house prices, real estate, and equities, as well as the devastation of bond yields, and the rising number of investors and retirees who are forced into ultra-long government debt which severely restricts their liquidity. If below-trend growth continues and tail risks—economic, financial, political, or geographical—occur, central banks are out of options. Having reached the limits of existing frameworks, they must now contemplate whether or not to redesign the engine mid-flight to keep the plane from stalling.

 2:50pm - 4:15pm | 2.5 BREAKING THROUGH: Scoring Single-Family Rental 
 
As noted earlier in this program, US homeownership has dropped to the lowest percentage in over 50 years, from 69% to 63%. The six million homes affected by the mortgage crisis comprise the majority of the new rental housing stock. Contrary to initial industry-wide doubts, the Single-Family Rental sector has continued to grow from strength to strength since its inception in 2010. While there are reasonable concerns surrounding the sector—such as the ability to acquire homes in scale and the difficulties of profitably renovating, re-leasing, and managing properties en masse—its maturation has been bolstered by factors such as tight lending for aspiring homeowners, rising home prices making home ownership out of reach for middle class families, and a generational shift favoring the access to single-family homes over their ownership. 
Today, revenue and margins for owner/operators are on the rise. The market demand for rentals continues to soar with a 97% occupancy rate for stabilized portfolios; rental rate growth for both renewals and new rentals; markedly lower turnover than the multi-family sector; continued house price appreciation in key SFR markets, and demonstrable improvement in operating metrics differentiate the sector as a strong, growth-oriented investment alternative.
Despite these remarkable factors, access to growth capital remains a key challenge. While upward trending stock prices indicate the success of publicly traded REITs, the stock market has yet to award full credence to the underlying value of the real estate or sustainability in SFR cash flows, as shown in the discount in trading levels of all its publicly traded stocks. While this highlights a long-standing concern, recent developments are an encouraging sign for the future. The successful overnight execution of a nearly $1 billion secondary offering of AMH (American Homes 4 Rent) stock by the Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation last month was remarkable for its sheer size and speed of execution, and an important indication of the sector's growing acceptance by institutional investors. With private equity—both institutional and retail—continuing to rapidly enter the space, SFR may well be breaking through in its liquidity and varying price points.

This session picks up from the keynote Single-Family Rental session at RUBICON AmeriCatalyst 2015, “Renting, The Future,” which featured leading institutional SFR operators discussing the changing strategies, obstacles, and opportunities they face in capturing the fastest growing sector in the housing ecosystem. This year, we bring together leading players to collaborate on a comprehensive S.C.O.R.E. (Strengths, Challenges, Options, Responses, and Effectiveness) analysis and strategy assessment of the U.S. SFR market.

 4:30pm - 5:45pm | 2.6 ON THE RISE: NEW TRENDS IN SINGLE-FAMILY RENTAL 
 
The continuing evolution of Single-Family Rental has given birth to a number of entrepreneurial activities and new avenues to serve or grow the sector. Traditional fix- and-flip models are much more sophisticated and capitalized with institutional equity driven by algorithmic technology and processes; the build-to-rent approach has proven quite profitable and strategically accretive in key markets; the lease-to-own platforms are appealing to families who currently cannot qualify for a mortgage but have the credit and income trajectory to do so; the development of platforms and marketplaces offering comprehensive, turnkey due diligence, property management and asset management for retail and institutional investors anywhere in the world to buy and sell individual or portfolios of properties are in their infancy; and Property Management 2.0 - a consolidation of property management companies offering streamlined, professional services to significant retail and institutional investors is now here.
In Single-Family Rental, every aspect of the sector is on the rise.

This session features some of the new trends and ideas to significantly enhance or improve the Single-Family Rental sector. Leveraging technology, big data, inefficiencies, demographic trends and even improving on pre-existing processes, these firms are on the rise and capitalizing on the dynamics in the market as well as the investors' desire for positions in hard assets, high-growth opportunities and exceptional returns.

A Primer


Changing the industry mindset: History, influences and inspiration
 
It’s hardly commonplace for an event in the housing and mortgage industry to be built upon an academic or intellectual foundation. Then again, this is part and parcel of what differentiates AMERICATALYST (and its predecessors: EUROCATALYST and EUROPESERVICING) from the other events out there. Below, AmeriCatalyst founder and CEO, Toni Moss, explains the intellectual inspirations behind the event, and where some of its unique qualities came from. Along the way, she provides key insights into the historical development of the industry, and details how these insights allowed her to anticipate the market failures responsible for the unprecedented circumstances shaping our present and future.
 

THE REITH LECTURES ON “RUNAWAY WORLD”. In 1999, Professor Anthony Giddens, director of the London School of Economics (and largely considered the world’s most prolific sociologist), presented a stunning series of lectures which rocked the academic world: how a newly defined force called globalization was rapidly reshaping our lives. The five-part presentation series, titled “Runaway World”, was featured in  The Reith Lectures on BBC Radio 4. To illustrate the widespread impact of globalization, each of these lectures was delivered from a different city across the globe, including:  Globalisation: London,  Risk: Hong Kong;  Tradition: Delhi;  Family: Washington DC, and ended with Democracy: London. These broadcasts were just the beginning of the international conversation on the interconnected forces swiftly transforming our cultural environment.
 
...and its influence.  I got hooked on the phenomenon of globalization after reading Kenichi Ohmae’s book The Borderless World in a political science class during college; since then it has become one of my life pursuits to understand its impact on the housing ecosystem. By 2000, “globalization” was a pervasive “buzzword,” yet no one could fully define what it was. What differentiated Giddens’ approach was the way in which he defined it as a synchronous set of forces (social, cultural, political and economic) as opposed to one dimensional change (economics or internationalization). In his series, Giddens describes how these forces change every aspect of our lives from the micro level (our families, ourselves, our identity) to the macro level (multinational corporations, nation-states, and the economy). In this way, globalization has created a world so complex that it is beyond our control and understanding.
Based on my previous career in housing finance and my work in 18 (by that time) European markets, Giddens’ lectures led me to recognize that housing--and the finance of it--has the same ubiquitous micro-to-macro weight on a singular and social level. Notwithstanding the universal need for shelter, for most aspiring homeowners a mortgage is the largest amount of money they will ever borrow, for the longest period of time. Not only is It the axis of their overall financial portfolio, they will spend the majority of their working lives paying it off. At a societal level, mortgages have long been the anchor product for all financial institutions throughout the world. At national economic levels, outstanding mortgage debt typically exceeds at least 60% of the GDP of every Western country in the world. And at the global macroeconomic level, mortgages and real estate were, by 2001, the single largest asset class in global capital markets.
But changes were occurring on all these levels far earlier than this time. By the mid-'90s, securitization had become a global (as opposed to purely U.S.) endeavor, and countless financial institutions began commodifying and leveraging their mortgage assets in order to access global capital markets. The more these products were embraced by the global investor community, the more complex and obtuse the issuance structures became.  As mortgage-related investments and house prices around the world significantly increased, it appeared  to me that mortgage markets were becoming, in essence, the epicenter of the global economic faultline. 
As the forces of globalization continued to accelerate the linkages between financial institutions, it also magnified the systemic risk of over-leverage in a single asset class which would inevitably rupture. Were that to happen, I believed that it would be a global phenomenon that would profoundly change the world, and that we should get all industry constituents together in one place to take a closer look.
Because globalization is ultimately unstoppable, this is why it continues to be the context of of our event and why our program is focused on how its forces are reshaping the housing ecosystem.
So, we adapted Giddens’ idea to hold his lectures in different cities, and began a mobile event to address the reshaping at hand. We moved our forums to a different country each year to show how globalization (and the not-so-invisible hand of Wall Street) was driving change in all housing markets around the world. Our initial event, in 2002, was held in Madrid  because I believed that Spain would get hit worst were the implosion to occur. EUROCATALYST 2003 was held in Lisbon, as Portugal was the largest issuer of MBS in Europe that year. EUROCATALYST 2004 was held in Berlin to highlight (much to their chagrin) the implosion of German banks that year.
We moved EUROCATALYST to Rome in 2005,  the year in which Italian issuance and debt reached its highest level. Fearing the worst, that year we also launched an additional event, EUROPESERVICING, to bring attention to the urgent need to improve the servicing operations of European banks and market players.
By 2006, we decided not to hold EUROCATALYST at all  and instead dedicate our efforts to servicing, emphasizing the need for default servicing. We held EUROPESERVICING 2006 in London at the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, and themed all sessions to film titles. Our closing session was “Crash: When Wall Street meets High Street in The City, which way do you turn?”

In 2007, EUROCATALYST was held a final time in Europe, back in Madrid - one month after the liquidity crisis of August 2007 that led to what everyone still calls “the crisis”.  The problem with calling it a crisis is that it implies a beginning and an end. There is no “end” to this. It was not “the perfect storm” as most analysts referred to at the time. It was climate change.

THE BURNING MAN PROJECT. The Burning Man Project is a highly participatory annual gathering in Nevada’s Black Rock desert which celebrates the creation of a temporary city in which its members engage in radical self-expression and self reliance. The event is a dynamic and collaborative laboratory that changes every year in its themes, massive temporary installations, and villages. At the end of each event, a massive wooden effigy (“the Man”), along with practically the entire city, is burned to the ground.
 
...and its influence. 
While no one runs around naked and sand-covered at our event, the participatory collaboration of Burning Man lays the intellectual foundation for the experiential focus of our event. In this foundation lies the greatest influence from the festival, its motto: “Not every experiment works, but we’ll never know if we don’t try.”

As I began putting the event together in 2000/2001, the Euro had just been launched as an electronic currency (January 1, 1999) and the Euro banknote was about to be introduced as legal tender (January 1, 2002). The world stood puzzled at what would happen as twelve European states ceded their sovereign destiny to a central bank with no political infrastructure to support it.
It struck me as the greatest social experiment in our lifetime, but one whose procedures appeared backwards: were they attempting to build a roof to a house who had no foundation? To me, the lack of calculation showed the extent to which globalization demanded urgent economic integration among smaller countries to compete in a globalized world.
Of course, not every experiment works (take, for instance, Brexit), but we’ll never know if we don’t try.
Burning Man also influenced my choice in playing “Burning Down the House” as the opening song for the event each year. It is a deliberate editorial commentary on the myopia of the housing finance industry in particular, and corporate behavior overall. It is also a warning about globalization and the havoc that it would (and continues) to wreak on an industry entirely largely unaware of--and therefore unprepared for--it. And, after all, our event is one featuring “talking heads”. At this point, you’ll recognize the editorial references:
“BURNING DOWN THE HOUSE” by The Talking Heads
 Watch out, you might get what you're after 
Cool babies, strange but not a stranger 
I'm an ordinary guy  
Burning down the house 
 Hold tight 
Wait 'til the party's over 
Hold tight 
We're in for nasty weather 
There has got to be a way 
Burning down the house
 Here's your ticket pack your bags 
Time for jumpin' overboard 
The transportation is here 
Close enough but not too far, 
Maybe you know where you are 
Fightin' fire with fire
 All wet, hey, you might need a raincoat 
Shakedown, dreams walking in broad daylight 
Three hundred sixty five degrees 
Burning down the house
 It was once upon a place, 
Sometimes I listen to myself 
Gonna come in first place 
People on their way to work, 
Baby, what did you expect? 
Gonna burst into flame
 My house is out of the ordinary 
That's right 
Don't want to hurt nobody 
Some things sure can sweep me off my feet 
Burning down the house
 No visible means of support 
And you have not seen nothin' yet 
Everything's stuck together 
And I don't know what you expect 
Staring into the TV set 
Fighting fire with fire

ESTHER DYSON. The career and work of the renowned visionary and futurist Esther Dyson had an enormous impact on me. Most influential was her self-styled PC (Platforms for Communication) Forum: held from 1997 to 2006, the event featured the most important individuals and burgeoning ideas in the technology industry. Esther was, in fact, the primary catalyst for bringing Silicon Valley together, and continues to be the primary catalyst for gatherings in whichever sector she directs her interest.
As a friend and mentor to me, when I could not convince the IMF or World Economic Forum to do this event, Esther urged me to do it myself. She even participated in our first Madrid event in 2002 as our keynote speaker. Today, Esther is a leading angel investor focused on breakthrough efficacy in healthcare, government transparency, digital technology, biotechnology, and commercial space travel.
Note: The bio on her own website linked above characteristically downplays Esther’s achievements. For a more robust history of Esther’s accomplishments, see Wikipedia. One of the best articles about the power and influence of Esther Dyson in technology can be found in this 1993 Wired magazine article, Release 

THE LONG NOW FOUNDATION. Established in 1996 by the most influential “digerati” in science, culture, and technology, The Long Now foundation strives to promote long-term thinking in today’s fast accelerating culture. As a counterpoint to what they see as the “pathologically short attention span” of civilization, the Foundation has established a 10,000-year clock as an icon for public discourse. In 2003, they established a series of  Seminars  with a narrative of long-term perspective, hoping to help make such thinking common and automatic rather than rare and difficult. With some of the most fascinating discussions amongst the most brilliant minds in the world, The Long Now Foundation is an extraordinary opportunity for anyone who wishes to participate. Participation is open to anyone who wishes to join, and I highly recommend doing so.
...and its influence. I am very proud to be Member 724 of the Foundation, and was introduced to it by Esther Dyson in 2007. The premise, activities and ideas have been instrumental in changing the way that I view the housing industry and its comprehensive viability and sustainability. For an industry that extends credit thirty years into the future, it is shocking that we possess no long-term planning committees or organizations. For this reason, in 2012, I established the 501c(3) non-profit AmeriCatalyst Idea Lab. While the organization carries many goals, the primary intention of the Idea Lab is to establish a long-term thinking committee focused on the viability, sustainability and balance in the housing ecosystem.

JOSEPH STIGLITZ. In his 2001 Nobel prizewinning work on asymmetry of information, economist Joseph Stiglitz (and his colleagues Akerlof and Spence) focused on imperfections of information, and how pervasive imperfections in information can lead to pervasive failures in the market. According to Stiglitz, one cause of these imperfections can be stated very simply but often goes overlooked: different people in a market know different things.
In applying this theory to mortgage markets, as early as 2001 it was already clear that the sellers, structurers and arrangers of mortgage-backed securities (and later, CDOs) knew more about the performance and characteristics of their portfolios than the investors who were buying them. The pace of deal flow led most investors to rely exclusively on ratings instead of performing their own due diligence  - despite the fact that every single industry-wide  MBS conference had sessions with both rating agencies and investors complaining incessantly about the lack of transparency and information in MBS transactions. (This also occurred at EUROCATALYST from 2002 up to 2006, and we have the video footage to prove it).
It is absolutely true that broker-dealers heavily engaged in “ratings arbitrage”--a strategy entailing the exploitation of competitive and profit-driven rating agencies by driving business to the agency willing to assign the highest rating to each deal. I explicitly called out the practice in the funding session description in our 2003 Lisbon program. We subsequently lost financial support from rating agencies (with the exception of FitchRatings) for the indiscretion of exposing it in black and white. Despite knowledge of this explicitly implicit practice, as well as increasing complaints about the opacity of MBS issuances, issuers rode shotgun up the LTV curve and down the credit curve around the world. Investors continued to buy, and investment banks forged ahead in building vertically integrated machinery for more mortgage product and volume around the world.  Ultimately, investor pursuit of higher yields trumped the paucity of information and in 2007, Stiglitz’s theory was proven

GEORGE SOROS. The concept of “reflexivity” in social science was developed by the philosopher  Karl Popper, illustrated in the work of Giddens, and  applied to economic theory by George Soros. Reflexivity is a very dense topic, and difficult to summarize in this editorial. Suffice it to say that it is a way of understanding causes and effects in which the relationship between the two does not flow in just one direction; rather, the agents in any event affect each other bi-directionally (both the apparent causes and effects create each other’s existence). That is, perhaps neither what appears to be a cause or what appears to be an effect can really be understood so simply when investigated under the microscope of a critical mind.
Let us apply this to the changes we’ve undergone in real estate. In a real estate bubble, the precipitating trend has been cheaper and more available credit. What turns this trend into a bubble is the misperception that the value of the collateral is independent from the value of credit. In fact, they are not independent--their relationship is reflexive. The relationship flows both directions in that the more available the credit, the greater the increase in property transactions and the rise in house prices. The same is true for equity leveraging. Et voila: The bubble driven by cheap housing credit, the over-leverage of homeowners and financial institutions, and the globalization-driven interconnectedness of those financial institutions led to an implosion of the global economy.
In the case of mortgage markets, the predominant “efficient market hypothesis”, which states that all relevant and available information is represented in market prices, was not only discredited, but disproven. While Soros’ reflexivity theory continues to receive criticism from economic standard-bearers, I would point out that Soros’ theory predicted the “crisis,” and preceded it. 

ENDNOTE: 
On April 30, 2008, my EUROCATALYST business partner (and EUROCATALYST event producer) Shirley Jackson  and I had just wrapped up our last European event, EUROPESERVICING 2008, which was held  in London. At that time, the unthinkable collapse of housing markets was gaining momentum in the U.S. and its effects were already in full force across Europe. For me, it was time to sell my home in The Netherlands and return to the U.S. after 13 years abroad. Although I had written to both Joseph Stiglitz and George Soros to speak at the EUROCATALYST event each year starting in 2002, Soros graciously sent other speakers from his organization to the event in his stead, but he never spoke himself. As for Stiglitz, my annual (and lengthy) requests went unanswered.  I knew from the outset that my efforts could never stop the inevitable; however, I did feel a certain degree of disappointment that EUROCATALYST did not make a dent in stemming the tide.
Furthermore, because my ideas and vision--in essence, my body of work--were incorporated into the event each year (rather than in high-profile papers or public editorials), and because our events were not open to media, the only awareness of them was among our alumni. In the continual process of research for each year’s program and reaching out to new speakers who are entirely unfamiliar with me, my own history or this event, they most often assume that I am nothing more than “a conference producer” and know little to nothing about the topics or content. One can only imagine the frustration.
In those moments of frustration, I remind myself that this extraordinary occurrence actually happened: When Shirley and I arrived uncharacteristically early at Heathrow Airport for our flight back to Amsterdam, we ran downstairs for coffee at the Starbucks in the Arrivals area. While there, I noticed a chauffeur holding a sign with the name JOSEPH STIGLITZ on it. I went over and asked the chauffeur when “Joe” would be arriving. The chauffeur told me that he was expected soon but didn’t know who he was or what he looked like so I volunteered to find him. I disappeared into the arriving crowd and found an exhausted Stiglitz, fresh off of a flight from South America. I seized the opportunity to introduce myself, and blurted out, “I’m the one who has written to you for six years asking you for help in applying your theory about asymmetries of information to mortgage markets at my conference and you never responded and now look at what has happened! Where were you?” Smooth, wasn’t I? Joe stared at me for a minute, then a glimmer of recognition appeared on his face as he said, “Yes. Toni Moss. EuroCatalyst. You know, you were right! I should have been there.” As he walked off with his chauffeur, I turned to Shirley and asked, “Did you hear that? Tell me you heard it.” She assured me that she did, in fact, hear the whole “episode”.
As we went up the escalator to departures, I told Shirley, “Now, if only I could meet George Soros, these past six years would be complete.” Shirley responded, “I guess Stiglitz wasn’t enough, huh?” Well...not really. But, while showing our passports to security in the unusually empty and private British Airways’ Fast Track security area, one other person miraculously appeared. It was, in fact, George Soros. When I introduced myself, Soros was a bit confused. The previous year, I was supposed to have played tennis with him in Dublin but was turned away at the reception desk when the local pro realized that “Toni Moss” was actually a woman. Soros never knew that I had been turned away, nor did he realize that while I had been a professional tennis player in my youth, I was the same person from EuroCatalyst that had been writing to him about reflexivity and asking him to speak at our event for the past six years. Once he realized that I was the same person, he said, “You know, you were absolutely right. We both saw it coming. I hope you made a fortune trading on it.” He then shook my hand again, and patted me on the shoulder. As I watched him walk off to catch his flight, I thought to myself, “Made a fortune trading on it? Hell no, I just produced a damn event about it.”

P.S.: Seriously. What are the odds of running into those two in one place within ten minutes of each other? It’s too bad that there were no iPhones in 2008, and all I had was a Blackberry. Otherwise, I would be posting the selfies.

Click here for Friends’ Latest News
Background
Ever since the formation of the Friends of Squaw Valley in 2012, we have sought a balanced development approach (aka “a goldilocks solution”…not too big and not too small) to protecting the environment and quality of life in Squaw Valley and acknowledging the legitimate economic interests of the developer. That was the challenge suggested by Supervisor Montgomery several years ago. We have stayed true to that goal up through and including our presentation to the Board of Supervisors at the November 15, 2016 meeting when the Board voted 4 to 1 to approve the Environmental Impact Report and the Specific Plan without change.
Since that decision, the focus of attention and action shifted to the legal process. As expected, the conservation group, Sierra Watch, has filed a lawsuit against the developer and Placer County. To quote from their press release, “Placer County failed …to adequately analyze or mitigate the Project’s numerous significant environmental impacts, including direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts on water supply, hydrology and water quality, traffic and air quality, the Lake Tahoe Basin, fire and emergency hazards, climate change, biological resources, historic resources, night sky and scenic/visual resources, noise, and population and housing.”
Sierra Watch believes their position is “rock solid”. Their goal, as stated, “is not simply to prevail in court but, more importantly, to bring people to the table to come up with a blueprint for Squaw that we can all be proud of.”
As stated earlier, the Friends of Squaw Valley will not engage in an independent lawsuit to challenge the Board’s decision. However, many of our members will be financially and emotionally supporting the Sierra Watch action, as will scores of others who signed petitions, wrote comment letters and who are outraged by the decisions of the Planning Commission and Board of Supervisors.  If you agree with the legal challenge, we suggest that you financially support Sierra Watch http://keepsquawtrue.org . We expect Sierra Watch’s legal battle against Placer County and Squaw Valley Ski Holdings to be contentious, expensive, and lengthy.
While this is going on, the Friends of Squaw Valley will use every opportunity it can to underscore our Mission Statement from 2012:
“The Friends of Squaw Valley is a forum whose mission is to advocate for environmentally sustainable, economically viable, and aesthetically compatible development in Squaw valley while preserving its community character.”
Our position with regard to the environmental impacts has been and remains the same:

The problem of traffic, already often at gridlock, has not been solved by money.
The permanent, increased noise issue is not solved by the speculative and questionable mitigation of applying Rubberized Hot Mix Asphalt to our main road.
The entrance to Shirley Canyon would be adversely impacted by tree cutting and placing fractional homes in currently undeveloped, critical aquifer recharge zones.
Squaw Creek would be permanently threatened by locating the heavy maintenance facility with its hazardous and toxic chemicals as well the “propane tank farm” next to the stream.
The Mountain Adventure Center, a 96 foot high, 90,000 square foot indoor water park, runs contrary to our Squaw Valley ethos and culture.
The requested 25-year timeline approval window is way too lengthy for this community (especially because this developer will likely be gone within 5 years). Recreational drivers change and certainly will be different in the next quarter century.  And
Climate change science is real and is not meaningfully addressed in this proposal, nor has the developer made any commitment to green and solar energy.
