Working in developing commercial real estate and related enterprises that address the needs of under served communities.Our developments are tailored to the specific needs & unique assets of our communities. We provide job opportunities to residents, quality goods and services to serve existing and secure new residents, and unique events and attractions to attract visitors. As a result, we help to stabilize our communities, facilitate their integration with the broader region, and improve the well-being of residents. 





















The Urban Need & OpportunityA wide gap exists between the downtown districts of our leading metropolises and the ethnic and minority communities located in their inner cities. While our ethnic communities are geographically close to downtown, they are often economically and socially distant. Bridging this gap is one of the most important challenges facing America today. Social programs alone have proven to be insufficient. We must invest in creating sound economic foundations for our communities.

 Where Commerce meets CommunitySuccessfully marrying commerce and community requires a deep understanding of and appreciation for commerce and community and the ability to anticipate and address opportunity and conflict between them. To these ends, we work closely with three key sets of constituencies:• With the community to define its needs and leverage its assets, • With the business sector to obtain capital and other resources, • With the public and foundation sectors to create the environment required for success. Our success is measured by our positive impact on our host communities and our ability to deliver attractive returns – in financial as well as human terms – to all of our partners. PartnersWe work with key community, regional, and national groups to facilitate a coordinated and strategic approach to community development.We are a member of the Bronzeville Retail Initiative (BRI), which works with the Metropolitan Planning Council (MPC) and the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning (CMAP) to develop a planning framework for retail development in Bronzeville. This framework focuses on facilitating the creation of unique retail offerings along 47th Street and at the 43rd and 51st Street and CTA Green Line transit nodes.

The Forum — Urban Juncture


























































The Forum




















 









theforumbronzeville.comfacebook.com/TheForumBronzevilleFor 75 years, starting in 1897, The Forum’s muscular presence at 43rd Street and the “El”, its distinctive “Forum Hall”, and six generously sized retail slots made it a South Side Hub for prominent performers, powerful politicians, parties and partygoers, and peddlers and patrons of all persuasions.Nat King Cole played Forum Hall. Captain Walter Dyett directed the Pilgrim Baptist Church orchestra in it. It gave legendary bassist Milt Hinton his start and provided a key stage for many other jazz greats. It hosted the Annual Convention of the Elks, soirees of Green Donkeys and Kute Kittens, beauty contests, boxing, and everything in between. It was an organizing center for the labor movement, radical groups, and Civil Rights activists.All the while, it provided a range of retail offerings from fresh fruit and vegetables to some of the South Side’s best barbecue, from ballroom dancing instruction to Japanese tea. Though the Dark Days of Bronzeville silenced The Forum, it stood tall, defying the elements, grime and crime, and the departure of three quarters of the community’s residents.Now, after a four decade hiatus, Urban Juncture is working to bring it back. We need The Forum to be, as before, a catalyst for the social, political, and economic development of Bronzeville.Work has begun. We’ve replaced loose masonry, repaired sievelike roofs, and removed mountains of debris. History has taught us how The Forum served our community in the past.  It will take commitment, community, and time. With a great structure, rich history, and strong community support as its base and the El as a lifeline, The Forum will be - once again - a unique resource for neighbors, a ‘go-to’ cultural destination for all, and an engine for community revitalization. In our effort to complete the stabilization of The Forum, Urban Juncture has launched a crowd-funding opportunity for neighborhood investors through WeFunder. For more information visit our Wefunder profile page : wefunder.com/urbanjuncture

Challenges In Rebuilding Bronzeville: A Chicago Case ExampleTHE BLACK METROPOLISChicago’s Bronzeville community exemplifies the need for commercial development in poor urban communities. Bronzeville is a community of roughly 100,000 residents located on the Southside of Chicago. Bronzeville enjoys a rich history as the “Black Metropolis”, a primary destination point for blacks migrating from the south from the turn of the 20th century to the 1930’s and 1940’s in search of opportunity. Denied housing elsewhere in the city and with limited access to downtown stores and other opportunities, blacks created a vibrant community around a strong, local consumer-driven economy and a large number of attractive entertainment venues.

Commerce was the glue to the community and diversity of income and occupation marked each neighborhood. Shoe shiners in kitchenette apartments lived next to barons of business in lofty mansions. Ebony Magazine, Soft Sheen, The Chicago Defender, The Supreme Life Insurance Company, Binga Bank and many other black businesses were born in Bronzeville in this era. Culture and the arts flourished.DECLINE AND DESPAIRBronzeville’s fortune began to decline in the 1960’s and 1970’s. With the elimination of restrictive housing covenants, middle class blacks followed the broader societal trend to the suburbs. At the same time, local businesses lost many of their customers to well-capitalized downtown and suburban competitors that were newly opening their doors to black patrons. These trends were worsened by three other key external factors:The placement of large numbers of publicly-subsidized housing units in Bronzeville, which brought many additional low-income residents to the community;Decreased access to opportunity-rich communities west of Bronzeville, due to the building of the Dan Ryan Expressway, which acted as an effective barrier; and,The overall decline of the Chicago economy including, the intense difficulties of two major Southside industries, the stock yards and steel mills;Together these forces drove a decades-long decline of the economic and resident base of the community. Between 1960 and 2000, Bronzeville lost a large portion its residents and housing base, most major businesses closed or moved out, and virtually all of its quality retail and entertainment, venues shut down at one point, Bronzeville included several of the poorest census tracts in the nation.Bronzeville’s economic problems persist. According to the 2000 U.S. census, more than 35% of Bronzeville residents live below the poverty line and roughly 25% are unemployed. Moreover, a McKinsey & Company “deep dive” study performed in conjunction with the Grand Boulevard Federation, a group of leading social service agencies, and focused on an extended Grand Boulevard community, comprised of nearly half of Bronzeville’s residents, revealed needs that are even deeper: The median household income of Grand Boulevard families was less than $25,000, with over 40% of households living below the poverty line of $16,500 for a family of four;More than half of the residents of working age are not employed, the majority of which are no longer in the workforce;Less than half the community’s youth graduate from high school;The infant mortality rate is almost twice that of the state average and Grand Boulevard ranks among the 10 worst in almost every maternal and infant health category of 77 Chicago community areas; and,Crime is a serious problem with violent crime occurring five times more frequently than in the rest of Illinois.Bronzeville’s dismal economic condition prompts large human services expenditures. The study found that over one-quarter of a billion dollars annually is spent to serve an estimated 60% of Grand Boulevard’s 47,000 residents. This funding comes from a number of federal, state, city, and private sources and supports a wide array of services intended to stabilize the community. In the Turnaround - A Place for Everyone?

At the turn of the 21st century, another wave of changes seems set to transform Bronzeville. The Chicago Housing Authority under its Plan for Transformation is demolishing all of its galley-style, family-focused, high-rise housing developments and investing roughly a billion dollars in Bronzeville to replace them with low-rise mixed-income housing meant to blend in with and support the surrounding neighborhoods. At the same time, a Chicago-wide housing boom has begun to bring significant numbers of middle class African Americans to the community, reversing a pattern of out-migration extending for over 4 decades. In aggregate, these trends are creating a substantially increased pool of market-rate housing and are likely to attract middle-class residents looking to take advantage of the community’s proximity to downtown and what remains of the gracious, century-old housing stock.Commercial and industrial development is required to create local jobs that would help lower-income residents find an economic footing as well as to provide the basis for the interaction between all residents that is critical to building cohesive communities. Unfortunately, commercial lags far behind residential development. The lack of local jobs will make it extremely difficult for long-time residents to remain in the community in the face of rapid gentrification. Moreover, an impending half-billion dollar reconstruction of the Dan Ryan Expressway threatens to eliminate a dozen ramps, further reducing access to jobs and isolating community residents and institutions. Consequently, Bronzeville faces the possibility that rather than returning to its latter day role as a commercial and residential haven for people from all walks of life, it will become an exclusive refuge for middle and upper-class Chicagoans, a suburban-style bedroom community 15 minutes from the Loop. Long-time lower-income residents are likely to be pushed further out the economic margin, to southern suburbs that offer even less economic opportunity and access to the regional economy. Bronzeville may grow, but Chicago and our nation would continue to pay the high price of supporting failing lower-income communities.RESOURCESBronzeville"Black Metropolis – A Study of Negro Life in a Northern City"St. Clair Drake & Horace A.

So Long Kickstarter, South Side Projects Can Now Get Neighborhood Investors June 27, 2016Sam CholkeGRAND BOULEVARD — The developer trying to revive the Forum has decided crowd-funding won’t work for redevelopment projects on the South Side, and is now relying on changes to federal regulations to fund the project.Bernard Loyd has spent five years trying to fund the revival of the Forum building at 318 E. 43rd St. and is now looking to a breed of small investors newly on the scene to help him move forward.Loyd saved the 119-year-old building right before it was about to be demolished in 2011, and has struggled to cobble together enough donations, investments and tax subsidies to get his $25 million vision of a community hub with art and performance spaces, a coffee shop and other small retail shops. Where other bold visions would turn to Kickstarter or another crowd-funding platform to rally lots of small donations to get the project started, Loyd said it’s not a realistic option for projects like his. READ THE ENTIRE POST HERE.







Urban Juncture Capitalizes on New Crowdfunding Law for Bronzeville Businesses June 8, 2016Karis HustadBernard Loyd has always wanted Urban Juncture, his Bronzeville-based culinary incubator and theater space, to be an organization for the community, by the community.So when the JOBS Act crowdfunding laws, which state anyone can invest in a business through equity crowdfunding portals, went into place May 16, he was among the first to launch a campaign for people to invest in Urban Juncture.Community projects at Urban..."Previously you had to be rich to make an investment in a startup company," he said. "The reality in our community is that the vast majority of folks don’t fit into that category."With equity crowdfunding, however, "anyone can invest," he said. "We can now do it online and reach an audience that we never before could have reached," he added.Urban Juncture was selected as one of 20 featured crowdfunding projects to launch on Wefunder, a Y Combinator-backed crowdfunding portal that recently went on an 11 city tour searching for projects for their site. As a selected project, Urban Juncture received additional mentorship and resources from Wefunder, as well as help developingUrban Juncture's project site.Initially Urban Juncture is seeking to raise $100,000 to fund renovations on The Forum, an abandoned theater on 43rd street in Bronzeville that was once a center for social, political, and civic events. Loyd wants to see its purpose as a center for community engagement on the south side restored.READ THE ENTIRE POST HERE.















Bronzeville Jerk Shack is Serving Chicago's Very Best Jerk Chicken March 7, 2016Michael NagrantIt will probably be a few years before we really know if Kanye West is a misunderstood genius or certifiably crazy. What I do know—or at least have on good authority—is that despite evidence against it, West is a nice guy. “I know there’s a lot going on and people think Kanye’s gone off, but when I cooked for him on the Yeezus tour, he was the nicest guy ever,” said Pierre Johnson, executive chef of Bronzeville Jerk Shack.As a former Live Nation concert chef, Johnson also went on tour with the likes of Macklemore and One Direction. The Culinary Institute of America-trained chef, who grew up in Bronzeville and attended Dunbar High School, found his current occupation through an odd twist of fate while touring with 1D in 2014.READ THE ENTIRE POST HERE.







 







State Launching Initiative Aimed at Helping Minority Entrepreneurs January 19, 2016Mike KrausnerThe state is launching a new initiative this spring,at little taxpayer cost, to create more opportunities for minority entrepreneurs starting in three cities, reports WBBM’s Mike Krauser. 







Governor Bruce Rauner says things are pretty bleak for minority entrepreneurs so he is creating something called ADME, or Advancing the Development of Minority Entrepreneurship. “We want to be a one stop shop where an entrepreneur can come and get the introductions for financing, for mentorships, for training, for board members, for support,” he said.READ THE ENTIRE POST HERE. 















Bronzeville Jerk Shack Serves Up Economic Empowerment on MLK DayJanuary 18, 2016Ted CoxBRONZEVILLE — The new Bronzeville Jerk Shack restaurant has had success this holiday season with a special of sweet-potato bread pudding, but it's offering a different special for Martin Luther King Day: a big, healthy helping of economic empowerment."We wanted to celebrate MLK Day," said Bernard Loyd, founder of Urban Juncture and its Bronzeville Cookin' project, which aims to spur development at the southern edge of Bronzeville through community and rooftop gardens, restaurants and a business incubator. "Our project is all about economic development, and of course that was a big focus of Dr. King."READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW HERE.

On top of that, walking is fun! Walking pneumonia doesn’t have anything to do with some disorder that’s associated with walking disabilities. You want people in order to see you while you’re on the street. You can even try the alternate route to alleviate a number of the signs.
Walking pneumonia is rather common. It is caused by Mycoplasma pneomoniae, a microscopic organism related to the bacteria family. Although it often resolves on its own, there is a risk of serious complications in some cases. It is not as menacing as it sounds, though a mild form of pneumonia, it does not usually interfere with your daily activities, allowing you to continue walking and going about your normal life. It is not life-threatening, but it is not a condition you should take lightly. It is common in children and teenagers and it is a very contagious disease. Both normal pneumonia and walking pneumonia may be caused by several different kinds of bacteria and viruses.
Walking pneumonia is extremely contagious. It is commonly seen in older children and adults under 40. It is an infectious form of pneumonia, although it is the least dangerous type of pneumonia. The same as the significant type of pneumonia, walking pneumonia results from bacteria that produce their way to the lungs. The other sort is atypical pneumonia, more commonly referred to as walking pneumonia.
Chest pain is usually associated with all kinds of pneumonia. Walking pneumonia symptoms may vary in kids and adults. Ask for medical assistance when you experience the first walking pneumonia symptoms, since the disease can get severe in the lack of appropriate medical therapy. The average walking pneumonia symptoms in adults would incorporate headache, fatigue, cough and colds which have been happening for weeks.
Should youn’t get better with your very first antibiotic, your health care provider may add a 2nd antibiotic to cover different bacteria which are not being treated with the very first one. Within the blood test, the physician will have the ability to decide whether there is a mycoplasma infection. Besides antibiotics, your physician will probably suggest that you eat a healthful diet and get enough rest. The physician will have a physical exam and appear at your medical history to establish a diagnosis. Thus, a doctor needs to be consulted, especially in the event the pregnant ladies develop walking pneumonia.
You and your health care provider should go over this. Your physician will probably recommend a great deal of rest. Depending on the patient’s physical condition, the physician will decide the plan of treatment that must be followed. Should you choose to go to the doctor for walking pneumonia, you are likely going to want be given antibiotics to accelerate the treatment practice.
Should you be walking outside, you might want to put money into a pedometer or similar application that will track your distance and explain to you how fast you’re going. The best thing about walking is the fact that it can be accomplished anywhere, at virtually any moment. Walking your dog daily may also motivate you to remain active and keep a normal schedule. Moreover, you will need to consider about walking shoes. All you will need is a suitable pair of shoes.
