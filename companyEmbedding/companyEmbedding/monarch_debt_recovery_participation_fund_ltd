About Monarch | Monarch LP











 






































Monarch Alternative Capital is an established and recognized distressed debt firm, led by co-founders Michael Weinstock, Andrew Herenstein and Chris Santana.  Established in 2002, the origins of Monarch Alternative Capital date back to 1992 when our co-founders joined together at Lazard Frères & Co. to build an industry-leading distressed debt research effort focused on the United States and Europe.  
Monarch prides itself on the firm’s collaborative and team-based culture.  Our philosophy of hiring at the junior level and promoting from within has enabled our firm to build an experienced and cohesive team that is dedicated to distressed debt investing.  We believe that our one-team model, the strength and experience of our team, and the vast network of relationships cultivated over twenty-five years in the industry are distinguishing competitive advantages for our firm. 
Our flexible and opportunistic approach to investing in the distressed debt asset class and commitment to being active in many of our investments are core to Monarch’s strategy.  Our emphasis on areas with limited competition, particularly in small to mid-sized capital structures, our global mandate, and willingness to take advantage of new opportunities in specialized segments of the distressed debt market are essential to the key tenets of our approach.  
As of April 30, 2017, Monarch manages approximately $4.8 billion in net assets under management and draws on the skills and experience of 67 employees, including 21 investment professionals, across our offices in New York and London.
