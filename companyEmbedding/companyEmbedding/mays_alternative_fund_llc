DEFINING ALTERNATIVES

WHY NOW
3 of 3













Exploring a Broader Opportunity Set

                Mutual funds and ETFs have evolved to offer alternative
investment opportunities to nearly every investor.
            









Alternatives Use Familiar Investments and Apply Differentiated Strategies





Alternative strategies generally use traditional investments, like stocks and bonds, and apply non-traditional investment approaches in an effort to provide differentiated returns. Alternative strategies can also access other asset classes, such as real estate or commodities.










Alternatives Are Now More Accessible





For many years, alternative investments were only available to institutions, like pensions and endowments, and certain individual investors. Today, nearly every investor can access the differentiated return characteristics of alternatives through mutual funds or ETFs, also known as liquid alternatives.

Views and opinions expressed are for informational purposes only and do not constitute a recommendation by GSAM to buy, sell, or hold any security. An investment in alternatives is not appropriate for all investors. Please see additional disclosures. Note that alternative investing is not suitable for all investors and liquid alternatives are not riskless investments, so investors can lose money.

Alternatives: Exploring a Broader Opportunity Set

 / 






















Broader Adoption of Alternatives Is Underway





Liquid alternatives industry assets and the number of available funds have grown tremendously as these strategies have become increasingly available in mutual fund format.










Source: Morningstar as of December 31, 2016. For illustrative purposes only. In an effort to distinguish funds by what they own, as well as by their prospectus objectives and styles, Morningstar developed the Morningstar Categories. While the prospectus objective identifies a fund's investment goals based on the wording in the fund prospectus, the Morningstar Category identifies funds based on their actual investment styles as measured by their underlying portfolio holdings (portfolio and other statistics over the past three years).







Taking an Alternate Path to Generate Returns

                Alternatives may help investors achieve a smoother investment experience over various market cycles, allowing for long-term outperformance.
            









Alternatives Have Often Outperformed Either Stocks or Bonds





A more flexible investment approach allows alternative strategies to access distinct drivers of return. As a result, they may behave more independently than traditional asset classes. Alternatives have historically provided differentiated returns and helped to stabilize investment portfolios over time.





Over the Past 27 Years, Alternatives Outperformed at Least One Element of an Investor’s Core Portfolio 67% of the Time.










Additional Returns

Please see additional disclosures. Time period shown is earliest common inception date (HFRI FoF inception 1/1/1990) through the most recent end of year. Past performance does not guarantee future results, which may vary.











Alternatives Have Provided Additional Stability to Investors





Over the past 25 years, stocks have appreciated in value by a factor of ten, though the ascent has been rocky at times. Bonds have had more modest but stable appreciation. By diversifying sources of return and helping to provide stability in market downturns, alternatives may encourage investors to stay the course over various market cycles.

The example provided does not reflect the deduction of investment advisory fees which would reduce an investor's return. Please be advised that since this example is calculated gross of fees the compounding effect of an investment manager's fees are not taken into consideration and the deduction of such fees would have a significant impact on the returns the greater the time period and as such the value of the $10,000, if calculated on a net basis, would be significantly lower than shown in this example.
Diversification does not protect an investor from market risk and does not ensure a profit.










Solving a Return Conundrum

                After years of strong returns for stocks and bonds, the future may not resemble the past.
            









We Believe Now Is the Time to Diversify Your Portfolio with Alternatives





With stock prices and bond yields near record levels, we believe it is unlikely for current trends to continue. Alternatives have historically delivered attractive returns relative to stocks and bonds during challenging market environments.

Investing in alternative assets involves higher risks than traditional investments and are suitable only for the long term. They are not tax efficient, and have higher fees than traditional investments. They may also be highly leveraged and engage in speculative investment techniques, which can magnify the potential for investment loss or gain.

          RE/MAX National Housing Report on MLS Data from 53 Metro Areas

RE/MAX, LLC

DENVER, June 16, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- After a brief dip in April home sales, the U.S. housing market returned to seasonally high sales in May, increasing 20.6% from the previous month and 4.3% from May 2016, according to the RE/MAX National Housing Report released today. In fact, it was the strongest May in terms of home sales in the nine-year history of the report. To access the housing report infographic, visit rem.ax/2cYFT50.















                (PRNewsfoto/RE/MAX, LLC)...
              

 
 



In addition, the average number of Days on Market dropped to a record low of 51, consistent with the Months Supply of Inventory shrinking to 2.6 months – both records for the report. 
Other notable numbers:

Over two-thirds of the metro areas experienced an increase in transactions. 
The May 2017 Median Sales Price of $232,500 was the second highest in the history of the report, only behind the August 2008 Median Sales Price of $236,062. 
Decreasing 16.2% from May 2016, inventory continued to decline year-over-year. This is the 103rd consecutive month of year-over-year declines dating back to October 2008. 
The U.S. continues to enjoy rising home values as 52 of the 53 metro areas experienced a price increase.

"In May, we saw an uptick of both loan applications and home sales, which is encouraging in terms of more people getting into the market for homes," said Adam Contos, RE/MAX Co-CEO. "We don't expect that the Federal Reserve's announcement on Wednesday to raise interest rates a quarter of a point will greatly affect the market's momentum. But housing demand only intensifies the tug-of-war with tight inventories driving prices up."
Closed Transactions Of the 53 metro areas surveyed in May 2017, the overall average number of home sales increased 4.3% compared to May 2016. Thirty-nine of the 53 metro areas experienced an increase in sales year-over-year including Albuquerque, NM +20.8%, Tulsa, OK +13.4%, Las Vegas, NV +12.2%, Honolulu, HI +11.5%, Phoenix AZ, +11.3%.
Median Sales Price – Median of 53 metro median pricesIn May 2017, the median of all 53 metro Median Sales Prices was $232,500, up 2.9% from April 2017 and up 3.6% from May 2016. Fargo, ND was the only metro area to see a year-over-year price decrease (-2.73%). Six metro areas increased by double-digit percentages, with the largest increases seen in Manchester, NH +13.2%, Seattle, WA +12.8%, Tampa, FL +12.8%, Las Vegas, NV +10.7% and Dallas/Fort Worth +10.7%. 
Days on Market – Average of 53 metro areasThe average Days on Market for homes sold in May 2017 was 51, down six days from the average in April 2017, and down seven days from the May 2016 average. The four metro areas with the lowest Days on Market were Omaha, NE at 20, San Francisco, CA at 21, Seattle, WA at 22 and Denver, CO at 23. The highest Days on Market averages were in Augusta, ME at 136 and Burlington, VT at 98. Days on Market is the number of days between when a home is first listed in an MLS and a sales contract is signed.  
Months Supply of Inventory – Average of 53 metro areasThe number of homes for sale in May 2017 was down 0.6% from April 2017, and down 16.2% from May 2016. Based on the rate of home sales in May, the Months Supply of Inventory was 2.6, compared to April 2017 at 2.8 and May 2016 at 3.0. This is the third month in a row months supply has been below 3.0. A 6.0-months supply indicates a market balanced equally between buyers and sellers. In May 2017, 52 of the 53 metro areas surveyed reported a months supply of less than 6.0, which is typically considered a seller's market. At 6.1, Miami, FL was the only metro area that saw a months supply above 6.0, which is typically considered a buyer's market. The markets with the lowest Months Supply of Inventory continued to be in the west, with both San Francisco, CA and Seattle, WA at 0.9, and Denver, CO at 1.0 for the fourth month in a row.

DescriptionThe RE/MAX National Housing Report is distributed each month on or about the 15th. The first Report was distributed in August 2008. The Report is based on MLS data in approximately 53 metropolitan areas, includes all residential property types, and is not annualized. For maximum representation, many of the largest metro areas in the country are represented, and an attempt is made to include at least one metro from each state. Metro area definitions include the specific counties established by the U.S. Government's Office of Management and Budget, with some exceptions. 
DefinitionsTransactions are the total number of closed residential transactions during the given month. Months Supply of Inventory is the total number of residential properties listed for sale at the end of the month (current inventory) divided by the number of sales contracts signed (pended) during the month. Where "pended" data is unavailable, this calculation is made using closed transactions. Days on Market is the number of days that pass from the time a property is listed until the property goes under contract for all residential properties sold during the month. Median Sales Price is the median of the median sales prices in each of the metro areas included in the survey.   
MLS data is provided by contracted data aggregators, RE/MAX brokerages and regional offices. While MLS data is believed to be accurate, it cannot be guaranteed. MLS data is constantly being updated, making any analysis a snapshot at a particular time. Every month the RE/MAX National Housing Report re-calculates the previous period's data to ensure accuracy over time. All raw data remains the intellectual property of each local MLS organization.

Exploring a Broader Opportunity Set

                Mutual funds and ETFs have evolved to offer alternative
investment opportunities to nearly every investor.
            









Alternatives Use Familiar Investments and Apply Differentiated Strategies





Alternative strategies generally use traditional investments, like stocks and bonds, and apply non-traditional investment approaches in an effort to provide differentiated returns. Alternative strategies can also access other asset classes, such as real estate or commodities.










Alternatives Are Now More Accessible





For many years, alternative investments were only available to institutions, like pensions and endowments, and certain individual investors. Today, nearly every investor can access the differentiated return characteristics of alternatives through mutual funds or ETFs, also known as liquid alternatives.

Alternatives: Exploring a Broader Opportunity Set















Alternatives: Exploring a Broader Opportunity Set

 / 






















Broader Adoption of Alternatives Is Underway





Liquid alternatives industry assets and the number of available funds have grown tremendously as these strategies have become increasingly available in mutual fund format.










Source: Morningstar as of December 31, 2016. For illustrative purposes only. In an effort to distinguish funds by what they own, as well as by their prospectus objectives and styles, Morningstar developed the Morningstar Categories. While the prospectus objective identifies a fund's investment goals based on the wording in the fund prospectus, the Morningstar Category identifies funds based on their actual investment styles as measured by their underlying portfolio holdings (portfolio and other statistics over the past three years).







Taking an Alternate Path to Generate Returns

                Alternatives may help investors achieve a smoother investment experience over various market cycles, allowing for long-term outperformance.
            









Alternatives Have Often Outperformed Either Stocks or Bonds





A more flexible investment approach allows alternative strategies to access distinct drivers of return. As a result, they may behave more independently than traditional asset classes. Alternatives have historically provided differentiated returns and helped to stabilize investment portfolios over time.





Over the Past 27 Years, Alternatives Outperformed at Least One Element of an Investor’s Core Portfolio 67% of the Time.










Additional Returns

Please see additional disclosures. Time period shown is earliest common inception date (HFRI FoF inception 1/1/1990) through the most recent end of year. Past performance does not guarantee future results, which may vary.











Alternatives Have Provided Additional Stability to Investors





Over the past 25 years, stocks have appreciated in value by a factor of ten, though the ascent has been rocky at times. Bonds have had more modest but stable appreciation. By diversifying sources of return and helping to provide stability in market downturns, alternatives may encourage investors to stay the course over various market cycles.

The example provided does not reflect the deduction of investment advisory fees which would reduce an investor's return. Please be advised that since this example is calculated gross of fees the compounding effect of an investment manager's fees are not taken into consideration and the deduction of such fees would have a significant impact on the returns the greater the time period and as such the value of the $10,000, if calculated on a net basis, would be significantly lower than shown in this example.
Diversification does not protect an investor from market risk and does not ensure a profit.










Solving a Return Conundrum

                After years of strong returns for stocks and bonds, the future may not resemble the past.
            









We Believe Now Is the Time to Diversify Your Portfolio with Alternatives





With stock prices and bond yields near record levels, we believe it is unlikely for current trends to continue. Alternatives have historically delivered attractive returns relative to stocks and bonds during challenging market environments.

Investing in alternative assets involves higher risks than traditional investments and are suitable only for the long term. They are not tax efficient, and have higher fees than traditional investments. They may also be highly leveraged and engage in speculative investment techniques, which can magnify the potential for investment loss or gain.
