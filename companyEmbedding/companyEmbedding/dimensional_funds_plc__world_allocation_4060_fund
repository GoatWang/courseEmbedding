The investment objective of the World Allocation 60/40 ("Fund") is to achieve long-term total return. The fund is managed on a discretionary basis and is a "fund of funds" which means that it mainly invests in other investment funds, but may also invest directly in shares and debt. A fuller statement of the investment policy is available in the prospectus and KIIDs.Risks include loss of principal and fluctuating value. Small cap securities are subject to greater volatility than those in other asset categories. Value investing is subject to risk which may cause underperformance compared to other equity investment strategies. Investing outside the country you live may involve special risks such as currency fluctuation and political instability. Investing in emerging markets may accentuate these risks. Fixed income securities are subject to loss of principal during periods of rising yields and may be subject to various other risks including changes in credit quality, liquidity and other factors. For more detail about the risks related to an investment in the Fund, please see the corresponding KIID and prospectus and in particular "Special Considerations and Risk Factors".This is a sub-fund of Dimensional Funds plc.

How it works

The fund aims to invest approximately 60% of its net assets in shares (either directly or through investment in other investment funds) and 40% of its net assets in debt. The fund invests in high quality debt, such as bonds, money market instruments and commercial paper and certificates of deposits issued by governments, other public bodies and companies in developed countries.
The fund invests to gain exposure to developed and emerging markets using a core strategy meaning that the fund has a general exposure to the stock-market with a greater allocation towards shares of smaller sized companies and value companies. Value companies are those where, at the time of purchase, the fund manager thinks the price is low compared to the accounting value of the company. The fund may invest up to 20% of its assets in emerging markets countries. The fund may use financial derivative instruments for the purposes of hedging and efficient portfolio management. As this fund invests some of its assets outside the eurozone, a currency risk arises for a euro investor.
