Shuttle Pharmaceuticals Wants $36 Million In IPO - Shuttle Pharmaceuticals (Pending:SPHR) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Shuttle Pharmaceuticals Wants $36 Million In IPODec.13.16 | About: Shuttle Pharmaceuticals (SPHR) Donovan Jones IPOs, tech, alternative investments, CEO VentureDeal.comVentureDealSummaryShuttle Pharmaceuticals intends to raise $36 million in an IPO.The company is developing a drug that promises to sensitize cancer cells so they are more susceptible to radiation therapy.Shuttle is only in Phase 1 trials, the IPO valuation is unrealistic and management has no previous experience bringing drugs to market.My opinion is to AVOID the IPO.

 Quick Take Shuttle Pharmaceuticals (Pending:SPHR) has filed to raise up to $36 million in its IPO. The company is developing a drug to sensitive cancer cells to radiation therapy. It is only in Phase 1 trials, with no expected results announcement date and the proposed valuation is unrealistic. My opinion is to AVOID the IPO. Company Rockville, Maryland-based Shuttle Pharma was founded in 2012 to sensitize cancer cells to radiation therapy, RT, while protecting normal tissue from the negative effects of radiation. The company is headed by co-founder, Chairman, and CEO Anatoly Dritschilo, M.D., who is 72 years old (owns 65% of company stock) and President and Chief Financial Officer Peter Dritschilo, M.D. Additional co-founders include Chief Scientific Officer for Chemistry Milton Brown (15%) and Chief Scientific Officer for Biology Mira Jung (15%). There are no institutional investors in the company. Technology Shuttle's primary drug development centers around Ropidoxuridine, a halogenated pyrimidine that it believes has hypoxic cancer cell sensitizing properties that when used in conjunction with radiation therapy renders them more susceptible to the effects of radiation. The company received a Small Business Innovation Research grant from the NIH and began Phase 1 safety trials at the Brown University-Lifespan/Rhode Island Hospital in January 2016.
 The drug is being tested on patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancers. Below is the current status of the company's pipeline for its lead candidate: 

 (Source: Shuttle Pharmaceuticals) A second radiation sensitizer candidate, Doranidazole, is being developed in Japan by Pola Pharma. The drug is in Phase 3 trials for the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancers and Shuttle has an exclusive option to license the drug for development and commercialization in the U.S., but as of now has no exercised that option. Market and Competition According to a 2015 report from GlobalData, the global market treatment size for gastric cancer will grow rapidly, from $1.13 billion in 2014 to $4.39 billion in 2024, a CAGR of 14.6%. 

 (Source: GlobalData) The main driver for this growth is expected to be "premium-priced therapies for advanced gastric cancer and, as a consequence, the increased uptake of therapy and lengthier treatment duration." The number of gastric cancer cases is expected to exceed 8 million in 2024, as a result of population aging in the U.S., Europe, and Asia. Key competitors in the treatment of gastric cancer include:  Roche (OTCQX:RHHBY) - Herceptin Taiho - Teysuno/Cisplatin Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) - Cyramza  The company says its cancer cell sensitizing candidate has the potential to apply to other types of cancers. Financials Shuttle's recent financial results are typical of clinical stage drug developers in that it has no revenue or resultant gross margin and significant cash use in operations.
 However, the low amount of spend on R&D and G&A expenses to-date is unusual for a biopharma developing a new drug. Below are the company's operational results for the past two years (Audited GAAP): 

 (Source: Shuttle S-1) Revenue  2015: $0 2014: $0  Gross Margin  2015: N/A 2014: N/A  Cash Flow from Operations  2015: $303,552 2014: $325,738  Notably, the company did not include interim financials for 2016 year-to-date, which is normal and customary for mid- or late-year IPOs. As of December 31, 2015, Shuttle had $128,000 in cash on hand and $4,577 in liabilities. IPO Details Shuttle intends to raise up to $36 million in a 'self-underwritten, best efforts' IPO. What that means is that there is no minimum to the IPO. Yet, the company says it won't consummate the IPO unless it has sold at least $9 million. Also, it means that the company is not using an underwriter and instead is using its executive officers and directors to sell the shares directly to potential investors. The expected terms are 4.5 million shares of common stock at $8 per share, and the IPO will be open for up to 180 days from the effective date of the S-1 filing. After a successful IPO, the market cap of the company at its proposed valuation would be approximately $396 million. Shuttle intends to use the proceeds from the offering primarily to "fund preclinical and clinical trials of product candidate, continued HCAC small molecule technology platform development, working capital and general corporate purposes, as well as potential acquisition or in-licensing activities." Commentary Shuttle is developing Ropidoxuridine to help make radiation therapy more effective against cancers, particularly gastric cancers. Ropidoxuridine has been shown in other studies in conjunction with drugs to potentially improve therapeutic outcomes in breast cancer patients, and the company believes there are other cancers such as small cell lung cancer, SCLC, that may be possible targets.
 But as to Shuttle's current Phase 1 trial, management has not provided an expected date when results will be published. Furthermore, for the company's second listed drug candidate, Doranidazole, it isn't developing the candidate, Pola Pharm in Japan is, and Shuttle hasn't exercised its option to license it, no doubt waiting until Phase 3 trials are further along or completed. So, Shuttle has proposed a $36 million IPO valuing itself at $396 million, and it only has one drug candidate in Phase 1 safety trials. In my opinion, due Shuttle's very early stage of development, unrealistic valuation, lack of discussion about when Phase 1 trial results will be announced, long time range to further clinical trials, thin capitalization, lack of institutional investors, family ownership and shareholder concentration, and no successful experience in bringing drugs to market, investors should AVOID the IPO.

The Offering is a direct public offering being conducted on a self-underwritten,
“best efforts, minimum-maximum” basis, which means (i) the Company will not use
the services of an underwriter and our executive officers and directors will
attempt to sell the shares directly to investors and (ii) the Offering will be
terminated in the event the minimum number of subscriptions set forth herein are
not received and accepted by the Company.

We estimate that the net proceeds from this Offering will be approximately
$9,750,000 if the minimum of 1,250,000 shares is sold and approximately
$35,750,000 if all 4,500,000 shares are purchased, after deducting estimated
Offering expenses. We expect to use the net proceeds from this Offering over the
next twelve months for the purposes set forth in the table below. The following
table sets forth a breakdown of the estimated use of the net proceeds as of the
date of this prospectus, assuming the sale of 100%, 75%, 50% and 28% of the

As indicated in the table above, if we sell only 75%, or 50%, or 28% of the
shares offered for sale in this Offering, we would expect to use the resulting
net proceeds for the same purposes as we would use the net proceeds from a sale
of 100% of the shares, and in approximately the same proportions although we
will need to prioritize our clinical studies to accommodate the availability of
funding. Ropidoxuridine and Doranidazole may be approved by properly designed
Phase I and II clinical trials for the orphan disease indications. If Phase III
clinical trials are required by the FDA, than an additional $22,000,000 will
need to be raised for each of the two clinical candidate drugs. If such
additional funds are required we will have to either secure additional funding
from investors or through a joint development partner.

The expected use of the net proceeds from this Offering represents our
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions, which could
change in the future as our plans and business conditions evolve. The amounts
and timing of our actual expenditures depend on numerous factors, including the
progress of our preclinical development efforts, the results of any clinical
trials and other studies and any unforeseen cash needs. All of our research and
development programs are at an early stage and successful development of product
candidates from these programs is highly uncertain and may not result in
approved products. Completion dates and completion costs can vary significantly
for each product candidate and are difficult to predict. As a result, we cannot
currently specify in more detail the percentage of the net proceeds that we may
use for each of the listed purposes. Accordingly, we will have broad discretion
in the use of the net proceeds from this offering and could spend the proceeds
in ways that do not improve our results of operations or enhance the value of
our stock.

Pending the use of the proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the net
proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities,
certificates of deposit or government securities.

In the event we do not sell all of the Shares being offered, we may seek
additional financing to support the intended use of proceeds discussed above. If
we secure additional equity funding, investors in this offering would be
diluted. In all events, there can be no assurance that additional financing
would be available when needed and, if available, on terms acceptable to us.


The development and commercialization of drugs is highly competitive. We compete
with a variety of multinational pharmaceutical companies and specialized
biotechnology companies, as well as technology being developed at universities
and other research institutions. Our competitors have developed, are developing
or will develop product candidates and processes competitive with our product
candidates. Competitive therapeutic treatments include those that have already
been approved and accepted by the medical community and any new treatments that
enter the market. We believe that a significant number of products are currently
under development, and may become commercially available in the future, for the
treatment of conditions for which we may try to develop product candidates.

Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical,
manufacturing, marketing, sales and supply resources or experience than we have.
If we successfully obtain approval for any product candidate, we will face
competition based on many different factors, including the safety and
effectiveness of our products, the ease with which our products can be
administered and the extent to which patients accept relatively new routes of
administration, the timing and scope of regulatory approvals for these products,
the availability and cost of manufacturing, marketing and sales capabilities,
price, reimbursement coverage and patent position. Competing products could
present superior treatment alternatives, including by being more effective,
safer, and less expensive or marketed and sold more effectively than any
products we may develop. Competitive products may make any products we develop
obsolete or noncompetitive before we recover the expense of developing and
commercializing our product candidates. Such competitors could also recruit our
employees, which could negatively impact our level of expertise and our ability
to execute our business plan.

Fluorouracil (5-FU) is an anti-metabolite used to treat cancer, by injection,
for colon cancer, esophageal cancer, stomach cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast
cancer, and cervical cancer. Fluorouracil was patented in 1956 and is an
effective and safe drug with radiation sensitizing properties. Capecitabine, an
orally available formulation of 5-FU and was patented in 1992. It is used for
the treatment of gastric, esophageal and other cancers for sensitization to
radiation therapy.

Cetuximab is an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor used for the
treatment of metastatic colorectal, lung cancer and head and neck cancers. This
monoclonal antibody is administered by intravenous infusion and improves the
5-year survival of patients when used in combination with radiation therapy,
compared with radiotherapy alone.

Platinum based compounds (cis-platin, carbo-platin and oxaloplatin) also exhibit
radiation sensitizing properties. Platinum and radiation are used together for
the treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer and for head and neck cancers.
Cisplatin is believed to augment the effects of radiation by inhibiting the
repair of radiation-induced sub-lethal damage.

Bevacizumab works as an anti-angiogenic agent. It was approved for medical use
in the United States in 2004.The addition of bevacizumab to standard treatment
can prolong the lives of breast and lung cancer patients by several months and
may be used with radiation therapy.

Irinotecan is given by injection and is used to treat colon cancer and small
cell lung cancer and can be combined with radiation therapy. For colon cancer it
is used either alone or with fluorouracil.


Company Description
Shuttle is a specialty pharmaceutical company founded in 2012, with the goal of
becoming the first U.S. pharmaceutical company focused on the development and
commercialization of innovative first-in-class drugs for sensitizing cancers to
and protecting normal tissue from the effects of radiation


 therapy (“RT”). The
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) considers new molecular entities
as first-in-class, if such drugs, like our in initial product candidates, use a
new and unique mechanism of action for treating a medical condition. The
mechanisms of action underlying our candidate agents have been attributed to (i)
incorporation of IUdR, a metabolite of IPdR, into DNA, yielding reactive uracil
species and DNA double strand breaks following radiation exposure and (ii)
doranidazole is a highly reactive molecule that increases DNA strand breakage in
combination with ionizing radiation under hypoxic conditions in tumors.

Our objective is to improve the outcomes of cancer treatment through RT and
reducing its side effects by:

. sensitizing growing cancer cells, rendering them more susceptible to the 
  effects of RT;                                                              

. sensitizing hypoxic cells in tumors that resist regular RT; and

. activating the DNA damage response pathway to protect normal cells located
  near cancers.                                       

To our knowledge no drugs utilizing these mechanisms have received FDA approval
as radiation sensitizers. To date, we have developed, to clinical stage, small
molecule strategies to sensitize growing cancer cells in tumors to conventional
RT and to sensitize treatment resistant, hypoxic cancer cells in tumors to large
fraction radiation therapy using stereotactic body radiation therapy (“SBRT”). A
pre-clinical technology delivery platform using histone deacetylase (“HDAC”)
inhibitors, which are designed to target cancer cells while protecting healthy
tissue/normal cells, further enhances our product pipeline. Shuttle has two
clinical stage, first in class product candidates that we believe will deliver
these benefits in conjunction with our technology platform:

. Ropidoxuridine, an orally available halogenated pyrimidine with strong cancer
  radiation sensitizing properties, is our lead “clinical phase” product      
  candidate. Halogenated pyrimidines are incorporated into DNA by rapidly 
  growing cancer cells and become more sensitive to the effects of RT. We have
  received a Small Business Innovation Research (“SBIR”) contract from the 
  National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) to fund a Phase 1 clinical trial at and
  in collaboration with Brown University -Lifespan/Rhode Island Hospital to
  determine safety and the maximum tolerated dose in patients with advanced   
  gastrointestinal cancers. In connection with the trial, the National Cancer 
  Institute (“NCI”) has approved the Phase 1 clinical protocol and agreed to 
  provide drug and clinical data management support to Rhode Island Hospital. 
  If we receive positive results from the Phase 1 clinical trial, we plan to
  advance to Phase 1b and Phase 2 clinical trials of using ropidoxuridine in
  conjunction with RT treatments of patients with brain tumors and soft tissue
  sarcomas.     

. Doranidazole, an injectable hypoxic cell radiation sensitizer, is our second
  “clinical phase” product candidate. As cancer cells outgrow the blood supply
  and oxygen availability becomes limiting, regions of hypoxia develop within a
  tumor. Cancer cells under hypoxic conditions are more resistant to the killing
  effects of RT. Electron affinic drugs, such as doranidazole are able to reach
  areas of tumor hypoxia to effect radiation sensitization, thereby offering the
  potential to improve the outcomes of RT treatment by increasing hypoxic cell 
  kill. Unfortunately, first and second generation hypoxic sensitizers used to
  date have shown neurologic toxicity and little clinical benefit. Doranidazole,
  which has been developed in Japan by Pola Pharma, Inc. (“Pola Pharma”), has
  been well-tolerated in clinical studies conducted in Japan and has shown  
  improved survival in a randomized Phase 3 clinical trial of advanced 
  pancreatic cancers, when used in combination with intra-operative radiation 
  therapy (“IORT”), as opposed to treatment by IORT alone. Pola Pharma has 
  already conducted and completed the aforementioned clinical trials of 
  Doranidazole. Shuttle has secured an exclusive option to license doranidazole
  for development and commercialization in the U.S. We have not yet exercised 
  our exclusive option, and the terms of a license agreement with Pola Pharma 
  for the commercialization and development of Doranidazole are under 
  negotiation. We intend to focus on the use of doranidazole for treatment of 
  pancreatic, lung and liver cancers in combination with large fraction SBRT, 
  which is RT administered in large doses over a several day period as opposed
  to conventional RT, which is generally administered in small daily doses over
  an extended period of several weeks.                                 

In addition to our two primary product candidates, we are developing and
planning to commercialize other cancer radiation sensitizers with radiation
protecting properties, which target protecting normal tissue during the
administration of RT and other first in class products utilizing our HDAC small
molecule technology platform.

We have also been awarded two SBIR contracts from the NIH to:

. develop prostate cancer cell lines for African-American men, who are at higher
  risk for prostate cancer, with donor matched normal prostate cells, with the
  goal of establishing 50 prostate cancer cell lines for research aimed at    
  treating prostate cancer in African American men; and                    

. develop predictive biomarkers of prostate patient outcomes following treatment
  with SBRT.                                                                 

The SBIR program is designed to encourage small business to engage in Federal
Research/Research and Development (“R/R&D”) that has the potential for
commercialization.

The Company was founded by members of the faculty at the Georgetown University
Medical School in Washington, D.C., all of whom have significant experiences in
the fields of radiation oncology and medicinal chemistry.

	Forward-Looking Statements







	This report on Form 10

	−

	Q contains certain

	“

	forward-looking statements

	”

	within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created by those laws. We have based our forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events. Our forward-looking statements include information about possible or assumed future results of our operations. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included or incorporated by reference in this report that address activities, events or developments that we expect or anticipate may occur in the future, including such things as the growth of our business and operations, our business strategy, competitive strengths, goals, plans, future capital expenditures and references to future successes may be considered forward-looking statements. Also, when we use words such as anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, intend, plan, probably or similar expressions, we are making forward-looking statements.







	Numerous risks and uncertainties may impact the matters addressed by our forward-looking statements, any of which could negatively and materially affect our future financial results and performance.  We describe some of these risks and uncertainties in greater detail in Item 1A,

	Risk Factors

	, of IHCs annual report on Form 10-K as filed with Securities and Exchange Commission.







	Although we believe that the assumptions underlying our forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of these assumptions, and, therefore, also the forward-looking statements based on these assumptions, could themselves prove to be inaccurate. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements that are included in this report, our inclusion of this information is not a representation by us or any other person that our objectives and plans will be achieved. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made, and we will not update these forward-looking statements unless the securities laws require us to do so. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, any forward-looking event discussed in this report may not occur.

	Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

	Note 1.  




	Organization, Consolidation, Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies









	(A)




	Business and Organization






	Independence Holding Company, a Delaware corporation (IHC), is a holding company principally engaged in the life and health insurance business through: (i) its insurance companies, Standard Security Life Insurance Company of New York ("Standard Security Life"),  Madison National Life Insurance Company, Inc. ("Madison National Life"), Independence American Insurance Company (Independence American); and (ii) its marketing and administrative companies, including IHC Specialty Benefits Inc. and IHC Carrier Solutions, Inc. IHC also owns a significant equity interest in: (i) Ebix Health Exchange Holdings, LLC (Ebix Health Exchange), an administration exchange for health and pet insurance; and (ii) a managing general underwriter (MGU) that writes medical stop-loss. On March 31, 2016, the Company sold IHC Risk Solutions, LLC (Risk Solutions),


	its managing general underwriter of excess or stop-loss insurance. In addition, all of the in-force stop-loss business of Standard Security Life and Independence American produced by Risk Solutions is 100% co-insured as of January 1, 2016 and IHCs block of Medical Stop-Loss business is in run-off.  Standard Security Life, Madison National Life and Independence American are sometimes collectively referred to as the Insurance Group. IHC and its subsidiaries (including the Insurance Group) are sometimes collectively referred to as the "Company", or IHC, or are implicit in the terms we, us and our.  





	Geneve Corporation, a diversified financial holding company, and its affiliated entities, held approximately 53% of IHC's outstanding common stock at March 31, 2016.


	 



	(B)




	Consolidation







	American Independence Corp.






	At March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company owned approximately 92%, respectively, of the outstanding common stock of American Independence Corp. ("AMIC"). In June 2016, IHC started the necessary proceedings to take AMIC private. AMIC is an insurance holding company engaged in the insurance and reinsurance business.  








	Effects of Ownership Changes in Subsidiaries






	The following table summarizes the effects of changes in the Companys ownership interests in its subsidiaries on IHCs equity for the periods indicated (in thousands):

	 (C)




	Basis of Presentation









	The unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") for interim financial statements and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X and, therefore, do not include all of the






	9






	information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. The unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of IHC and its consolidated subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect:  (i) the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements; and (ii) the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. IHCs annual report on Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission should be read in conjunction with the accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.





	On March 31, 2016, the Company sold Risk Solutions, its managing general underwriter of excess or stop-loss insurance for self-insured employer groups that desire to manage the risk of large medical claims (Medical Stop-Loss). In addition, under the purchase and sale agreement, all of the in-force stop-loss business of Standard Security Life and Independence American produced by Risk Solutions is 100% co-insured as of January 1, 2016. IHCs block of Medical Stop-Loss business is in run-off. The sale of Risk Solutions and exit from the medical stop-loss business represents a strategic shift that will have a major effect on the Companys operations and financial results. The disposal transaction qualified for reporting as a discontinued operation in the first quarter of 2016 as a result of the Board of Directors commitment to a plan for its disposal in January 2016. The assets, liabilities, and related income and expenses associated with the disposal group are presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and Notes thereto. See Note 3 for more information.





	In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) that are necessary for a fair presentation of the consolidated financial position and results of operations for the interim periods have been included. The condensed consolidated results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be anticipated for the entire year.

	Recent Accounting Pronouncements











	Recently Adopted Accounting Standards







	In September 2015, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination and eliminate the requirement to retrospectively account for those adjustments. The adoption of this guidance is did not have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements.





	In February 2015,


	the FASB issued guidance that modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities or voting interest entities for the purpose of consolidation. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements.





	In June 2014, the FASB issued explicit guidance for entities that grant their employees share-based payments in which the terms of the award include a performance target that affects vesting and could be achieved after the requisite service period.  The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements.







	Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted







	In June 2016, the FASB issued guidance requiring financial assets measured at amortized cost basis








	10








	to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. An allowance for credit losses will be deducted from the amortized cost basis to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected with changes in the allowance recorded in earnings. Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities will also be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than a write-down, which would be limited to the amount by which fair value is below the amortized cost. Certain existing requirements used to evaluate credit losses have been removed. For public entities that are SEC filers, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. The amendments in this Update should be applied through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings upon adoption as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements.





	In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance that simplify several aspects of accounting for sharebased payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification in the statement of cash flows. The amendments in this Update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements.





	In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance that eliminates the requirement for retroactive adjustments on the date that a previously held investment qualifies for the equity method of accounting as a result of an increase in ownership interest or degree of influence. The amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016 and should be applied prospectively upon their effective date. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements.





	In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance that requires lessees to recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases, including operating leases, on the statement of financial position. The amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, using a modified retrospective approach. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements.





	In January 2016, the FASB issued guidance that eliminates the requirement to classify equity securities with readily determinable fair values as trading or available-for-sale. The guidance requires equity securities (including other ownership interests, such as partnerships, unincorporated joint ventures, and limited liability companies) to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income, simplifies the impairment assessment of equity securities without readily determinable fair values and requires changes in disclosure requirements. For public entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted in certain circumstances. The amendments in this Update should be applied by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The amendments related to equity securities without readily determinable fair values (including disclosure requirements) should be applied prospectively to equity investments that exist as of the date of adoption of the Update. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet or IHCs stockholders equity.





	In May 2015, the FASB issued guidance requiring additional disclosures for short-duration contracts regarding the liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses. For public entities, the guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements.





	In May 2014, the FASB issued revenue recognition guidance for entities that either enter into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enter into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial








	11








	assets unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards such as insurance contracts or lease contracts. The amendment provides specific steps that an entity should apply in order to achieve its main objective which is recognizing revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In 2016, additional guidance was issued to clarify certain aspects of the implementation guidance and to clarify the identification of performance obligations. In August 2015, the effective date of this guidance has been deferred. For public entities, this guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period, and requires one of two specified retrospective methods of application. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Management has not yet determined the impact that the adoption of this guidance will have on the Companys consolidated financial statements.

	Discontinued Operations






	On March 31, 2016, IHC and its subsidiary Independence American sold the stock of Risk Solutions to Swiss Re Corporate Solutions, a division of Swiss Re (Swiss Re).  In addition, under the purchase and sale agreement, all of the in-force stop-loss business of Standard Security Life and Independence American produced by Risk Solutions is co-insured by Westport Insurance Corporation (Westport), Swiss Res largest US carrier, as of January 1, 2016.  The aggregate purchase price was $152,500,000 in cash, subject to adjustments and settlements. Approximately 89% of the purchase price was allocated to AMIC, with the balance being paid to Standard Security Life and other IHC subsidiaries. The Company recorded a gain of $99,793,000, net of taxes and amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, as a result of the transaction. The aforementioned transaction, which includes the sale of Risk Solutions and the corresponding coinsurance agreement, is collectively referred to as the Risk Solutions Sale and Coinsurance Transaction.  IHCs block of Medical Stop-Loss business is in run-off. The sale of Risk Solutions and exit from the medical stop-loss business represents a strategic shift that will have a major effect on the Companys








	12








	operations and financial results. The disposal transaction qualified for reporting as a discontinued operation in the first quarter of 2016 as a result of the Board of Directors commitment to a plan for its disposal in January 2016. Aside from reinsurance and marketing of Westport small group stop-loss, there will be no further involvement with the discontinued operation.

	Total operating cash flows from discontinued operations for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 amounted to $339,000 and $116,000, respectively. The Company elected to classify the proceeds received from the sale of discontinued operations in the investing activities section of the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.





	In connection with the Risk Solutions Sale and Coinsurance Transaction in March 2016, AMIC utilized a significant amount of its Federal NOL carryforwards and made a corresponding adjustment to its valuation allowance (see Note 9). On a consolidated basis, the Company recorded income taxes on discontinued operations of $7,866,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016, consisting of $5,799,000 of state taxes and $2,067,000 of Federal taxes, net of a $38,565,000 decrease in AMICs valuation allowance.

	The amortized cost and fair value of fixed maturities available-for-sale at March 31, 2016, by contractual maturity, are shown below (in thousands). Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. CMOs and MBSs are shown separately, as they are not due at a single maturity.

	Substantially all of the unrealized losses on fixed maturities available-for-sale at March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 relate to investment grade securities and are attributable to changes in market interest rates. Because the Company does not intend to sell, nor is it more likely than not that the Company will have to sell such investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be maturity, the Company does not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at March 31, 2016

	Other-Than-Temporary Impairment Evaluations







	We recognize other-than-temporary impairment losses in earnings in the period that we determine: 1) we intend to sell the security; 2) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis; or 3) the security has a credit loss. Any non-credit portion of the other-than-temporary impairment loss is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss).

	Fair Value Disclosures









	For all financial and non-financial assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company utilizes valuation techniques based upon observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our market expectations. These two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy:






	Level 1

	- Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.






	Level 2

	- Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable.






	Level 3

	- Instruments where significant value drivers are unobservable.








	The following section describes the valuation methodologies we use to measure different assets at fair value.


	  



	Investments in fixed maturities and equity securities:



	  


	Available-for-sale securities included in Level 1 are equities with quoted market prices. Level 2 is primarily comprised of our portfolio of government securities, agency mortgage-backed securities, corporate fixed income securities, foreign government obligations, collateralized mortgage obligations, municipals and GSEs that were priced with observable market inputs. Level 3 securities consist primarily of CMO securities backed by commercial mortgages and municipal tax credit strips.  For these securities, we use industry-standard pricing methodologies, including discounted cash flow models, whose inputs are based on managements assumptions and available market information. Significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of CMOs are prepayment rates, probability of default, and loss severity in the event








	17








	of default. Significant increases (decreases) in any of those inputs in isolation would result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. Generally, a change in the assumption used for the probability of default is accompanied by a directionally similar change in the assumption used for loss severity and a directionally opposite change in the assumption used for prepayment rates. Further we retain independent pricing vendors to assist in valuing certain instruments.






	Trading securities:






	Trading securities included in Level 1 are equity securities with quoted market prices.






	Contingent liabilities:






	Contingent liabilities classified in Level 3 include; (i) a contingent liability assumed in connection with an acquisition related to an earn-out agreement whereby significant unobservable inputs are based on projected income; and (ii) a contingent liability recognized in connection with the deconsolidation of a former subsidiary and a newly formed joint venture transaction whereby significant unobservable inputs are based on projected cash flows.





	The following tables present our financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis for the periods indicated (in thousands):

	The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of the financial instruments that are not carried at fair value in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements:






	(A)




	Policy Loans






	The fair value of policy loans included in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy is estimated by projecting aggregate loan cash flows to the end of the expected lifetime period of the life insurance business at the average policy loan rates, and discounting them at a current market interest rate.






	(B)




	Funds on Deposit






	The Company has two types of funds on deposit. The first type is credited with a current market interest rate, resulting in a fair value which approximates the carrying amount. The second type carries fixed interest rates which are higher than current market interest rates. The fair value of these deposits was estimated by discounting the payments using current market interest rates. The Company's universal life policies are also credited with current market interest rates, resulting in a fair value which approximates the carrying amount. Both types of funds on deposit are included in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.






	(C)




	Debt






	The fair value of debt with variable interest rates approximates its carrying amount and is included in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.














	20












	Note 6.




	Variable Interest Entities






	The Company has a minority interest in certain limited partnerships that we have determined to be Variable Interest Entities (VIEs).  The aforementioned VIEs are not required to be consolidated in the Companys condensed consolidated financial statements as we are not the primary beneficiary since we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance.





	The Company will periodically reassess whether we are the primary beneficiary in any of these investments. The reassessment process will consider whether we have acquired the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE through changes in governing documents or other circumstances. Our maximum loss exposure is limited to our combined $8,844,000 carrying value in these equity investments that are included in other investments in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2016.












	Note 7.




	Related Party Transactions






	Through a joint venture consummated in 2015, the Company has a significant equity interest in Ebix Health Exchange. Ebix Health Exchange administers various lines of health insurance for IHCs insurance subsidiaries. The carrying value of the Companys equity investment in Ebix Health Exchange was $9,061,000 and 9,838,000 at March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  

	Ebix Health Exchange reported a net loss of $821,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The Company recorded $188,000 of the loss in earnings and reduced the contingent liability, previously recognized on the acquisition date, by $633,000 of cash operating losses for the period. The Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets at March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 include $2,403,000 and $1,397,000, respectively, of notes and other amounts receivable from, and $1,083,000 and $405,000, respectively, of administrative fees and other expenses payable to, Ebix Health Exchange which are included in other assets and accounts payable, accruals and other liabilities, respectively.  The Companys Consolidated Statements of Income include $113,000 in fee income from, and $1,247,000 of administrative fee expenses to, Ebix Health Exchange which are included in fee income and selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2016. There are no comparable amounts for the three months ended March 31, 2015.

	Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets






	Certain prior year balances of goodwill and intangible assets were reclassified to assets attributable to discontinued operations on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015 to conform to the 2016 presentation (see Notes 1 and 3).





	The carrying amount of goodwill was $47,276,000 at March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.





	The Company has net other intangible assets of $14,258,000 and $14,598,000 at March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, which are included in other assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. These intangible assets consist of: (i) finite-lived intangible assets, principally the fair value of acquired agent and broker relationships, which are subject to amortization; and (ii) indefinite-lived intangible assets which consist of the estimated fair value of insurance licenses that are not subject to amortization.

	Income Taxes






	The provisions for income taxes shown in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income were computed based on the Company's actual results, which approximate the effective tax rate expected to be applicable for the balance of the current fiscal year in accordance with consolidated life/non-life group income tax regulations. Such regulations adopt a subgroup method in determining consolidated taxable income, whereby taxable income is determined separately for the life insurance company group and the non-life insurance company group.





	As a result of the Risk Solutions Sale and Coinsurance Transaction (see Note 3), AMIC utilized approximately $110,185,000 of its operating loss carryforwards and made a corresponding adjustment to its valuation allowance. At March 31, 2016, AMIC had remaining net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $148,294,000 for federal income tax purposes, which expire in varying amounts through the year 2028, with a significant portion expiring in 2020.












	Note 10.




	Reinsurance






	Effective January 1, 2016, all of the in-force stop-loss business of Standard Security Life and Independence American produced by Risk Solutions was co-insured in connection with the Risk Solutions Sale and Coinsurance Transaction (see Note 3). As a result of this transaction, the Company recorded $56,055,000 of estimated amounts due from reinsurers.





	The Company is contingently liable with respect to reinsurance in the unlikely event that the assuming reinsurers are unable to meet their obligations. The ceding of reinsurance does not discharge the primary liability of the original insurer to the insured.

	In 2016, IHC repurchased 50,000 shares of its common stock in a private transaction for $821,000.

	Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

	Share-Based Compensation






	IHC and AMIC each have share-based compensation plans. The following is a summary of the activity pertaining to each of these plans.






	A)  IHC Share-Based Compensation Plans









	Under the terms of IHCs stock-based compensation plan, option exercise prices are more than or equal to the quoted market price of the shares at the date of grant; option terms are generally five years; and vesting periods are generally three years. The fair value of an option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. In addition to stock options, the Company has also granted restricted stock units and share appreciation rights (SARs) under the plan. Restricted share units are valued








	23








	at the quoted market price of the shares at the date of grant and have a three year vesting period. Compensation costs for options and restricted share units are recognized over the stated vesting periods on a straight-line basis. Exercise prices of SARs are more than or equal to the quoted market price of IHC shares at the date of the grant and have three year vesting periods. The fair value of SARs is calculated using the Black-Scholes valuation model at the grant date and each subsequent reporting period until settlement. Compensation cost is based on the proportionate amount of the requisite service that has been rendered to date. Once fully vested, changes in fair value of the SARs continue to be recognized as compensation expense in the period of the change until settlement.








	At March 31, 2016, there were no shares available for future stock-based compensation grants under IHCs stock incentive plans. The following table summarizes share-based compensation expense, which is included in selling, general and administrative expenses on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income, applicable to the IHC plans, by award type for each of the periods indicated (in thousands):

	Restricted Stock







	At March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were 14,850 unvested restricted stock units outstanding with a weighted average grant-date fair value of $12.26 per share.





	As of March 31, 2016, the total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested restricted stock unit awards was $106,000 which is expected to be recognized over the remaining requisite weighted-average service period of 1.5 years.







	SARs







	IHC had 123,000 and 125,850 of SAR awards outstanding at March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. In the first quarter of 2016, 2,850 SARs were exercised with an aggregate intrinsic value of $16,000.  Included in Other Liabilities in the Companys Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are liabilities of $985,000 and $743,000, respectively, pertaining to SARs.






	B)




	AMIC Share-Based Compensation Plans









	Under the terms of the AMICs stock-based compensation plan, option exercise prices are equal to the quoted market price of the shares at the date of grant; option terms are ten years; and

	have various vesting criteria depending on the grant with most grants vesting ratably over

	four years.  The Company may also grant shares of restricted stock, stock appreciation rights and share-based performance awards.

	MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL






	CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS








	The following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of Independence Holding Company ("IHC") and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company") should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company and the related Notes thereto appearing in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this quarterly report.








	Overview







	Independence Holding Company, a Delaware corporation (IHC), is a holding company principally engaged in the life and health insurance business through: (i) its insurance companies, Standard Security Life Insurance Company of New York ("Standard Security Life"),  Madison National Life Insurance Company, Inc. ("Madison National Life"), Independence American Insurance Company (Independence American); and (ii) its marketing and administrative companies, including IHC Specialty Benefits Inc. and IHC Carrier Solutions, Inc.  IHC also owns a significant equity interest in: (i) Ebix Health Exchange Holdings, LLC (Ebix Health Exchange), an administration exchange for health insurance; and (ii) a managing general underwriter (MGU) that writes medical stop-loss. On March 31, 2016, the Company sold IHC Risk Solutions, LLC (Risk Solutions), its managing general underwriter of excess or stop-loss insurance. In addition, under the purchase and sale agreement, all of the in-force stop-loss business of Standard Security Life and Independence American produced by Risk Solutions is 100% co-insured as of January 1, 2016. IHCs block of Medical Stop-Loss business is in run-off. Standard Security Life, Madison National Life and Independence American are sometimes collectively referred to as the Insurance Group. IHC and its subsidiaries (including the Insurance Group) are sometimes collectively referred to as the "Company", or IHC, or are implicit in the terms we, us and our.   At March 31, 2016, the Company also owned approximately a 92% interest in American Independence Corp. ("AMIC").

	In June 2016, IHC started the necessary proceedings to take AMIC private.






	While management considers a wide range of factors in its strategic planning and decision-making, underwriting profit is consistently emphasized as the primary goal in all decisions as to whether or not to increase our retention in a core line, expand into new products, acquire an entity or a block of business, or otherwise change our business model.  Management's assessment of trends in healthcare and morbidity, with respect to specialty health, disability and DBL; mortality rates with respect to life insurance; and changes in market conditions in general play a significant role in determining the rates charged, deductibles and attachment points quoted, and the percentage of business retained. IHC also seeks transactions that permit it to leverage its vertically integrated organizational structure by generating fee income from production and administrative operating companies as well as risk income for its carriers and profit commissions.  Management has always focused on managing the costs of its operations and providing its insureds with the best cost-containment tools available.

	The following is a summary of key performance information by segment:







	o


	The Medical Stop-Loss segment reported income before taxes of $7.8 million for the first quarter of 2016 compared to $4.3 million in the same quarter in 2015. The increase is principally due to $2.9 million in ceding commission on coinsurance in the first quarter of 2016 due to the sale of Risk Solutions and exit from the medical stop-loss business, as well as lower loss ratios and a negative expense ratio due to lower than anticipated premium tax expense and other reductions in expenses as a function of the medical stop-loss line being in run-off.





	o


	Premiums earned decreased $50.0 million for the three months March 31, 2016 when compared to the same periods in 2015. The decrease in premiums earned is primarily due to the sale of Risk Solutions and the 100% coinsurance of the block produced by it as a result of IHC exiting the medical stop-loss business.

	Underwriting experience for the Medical Stop-Loss segment, as indicated by its U.S. GAAP Combined Ratios, is as follows for the periods indicated (in thousands):

	(C)


	The combined ratio is equal to the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio.





	o


	The lower loss ratio and negative expense ratio in 2016 is primarily attributable to the effects of exiting the medical stop-loss business in connection with the sale of Risk Solutions.

	The Fully Insured Health segment reported $.4 million of income before taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2016

	o


	Premiums earned decreased $8.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 over the comparable period in 2015. A decrease in major medical premiums of $10.0 million as a result of the strategic decision to focus on ancillary products was partially offset by increases from broader marketing of our short-term medical scheduled benefit and gap plans and growth in the pet insurance line of business.

	Although the loss ratio in 2016 was lower than 2015, the loss ratio would have been 36.7% excluding the occupational accident line of business.   We are strategically evaluating this line of business and taking steps to improve the underwriting results.  Expense ratios are higher in 2016 because of a change in the mix of business from major medical to specialty








	30








	health products and as a result of the reallocation of certain fixed costs from the medical stop loss line to the specialty health line.





	·


	Income before taxes from the Group disability, life, annuities and DBL segment increased $3.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The increase in the first-quarter results primarily reflects increases in LTD and group term life lines due to increased volume and retentions combined with lower loss ratios;





	·


	The Individual life, annuities and other segment reported losses before income taxes of $1.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and $1.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015.  The increased losses were related to the accelerated amortization of deferred costs in connection with the assumption of certain ceded life and annuity policies.





	·


	Losses before tax from the Corporate segment increased $2.0 million in the three months ended March 31, 2016 over the same period of 2015 primarily due to increased legal and accounting expenses; and

	CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES







	The accounting and reporting policies of the Company conform to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). The preparation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company's management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. A summary of the Company's significant accounting policies and practices is provided in Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. Management has identified the accounting policies








	31








	related to

	Insurance Premium Revenue Recognition and Policy Charges, Insurance Liabilities, Deferred Acquisition Costs, Investments, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, and Deferred Income Taxes

	as those that, due to the judgments, estimates and assumptions inherent in those policies, are critical to an understanding of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and this Management's Discussion and Analysis. A full discussion of these policies is included under the heading, Critical Accounting Policies in Item 7 of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.  During the three months ended March 31, 2016, there were no additions to or changes in the critical accounting policies disclosed in the 2015 Form 10-K except for the recently adopted accounting standards discussed in Note 1(E) of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

	Premiums Earned








	In the first quarter of 2016, premiums earned decreased $59.5 million over the comparable period of 2015. The decrease is primarily due to: (i) a decrease of $50.0 million in the Stop Loss segment as a result of the sale of Risk Solutions and exit from the medical stop-loss business, further described in Note 3 and (ii) a decrease of $8.1 million in the Fully Insured Health segment principally as a result of a $10.0.million decrease in premiums from exiting the Major Medical line, a $1.8 million decrease in the fixed indemnity limited benefit line and a $.6 million decrease in international medical business premiums, partially offset by premium increases in the short-term medical and pet lines of business of $3.1 million and $1.0 million,








	32








	respectively, as a result of higher volume; and (iii) a decrease of $5.1 million in the Individual life, annuities and other segment as a result of business in run-off; partially offset by (iv) a $3.7 million increase in earned premiums from the Group disability, life, annuities and DBL segment primarily due to increased volume and retention in the LTD and group term life lines.








	Net Investment Income








	Total net investment income decreased $1.0 million. The overall annualized investment yields were 2.8% and 3.2% in the first quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively. The overall decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in investment income on bonds, equities and short-term investments due to cash transferred out in the third quarter of 2015 in connection with a coinsurance and sale transaction, partially offset by cash received in connection with the sale of Risk Solutions in the first quarter of 2016. Additionally, income from partnerships was lower in 2016.





	 The annualized investment yields on bonds, equities and short-term investments were 3.0% in both the first quarter of 2016 and 2015. IHC has approximately $224.6 million in highly rated shorter duration securities earning on average 1.2%. A portfolio that is shorter in duration enables us, if we deem prudent, the flexibility to reinvest in much higher yielding longer-term securities, which would significantly increase investment income.








	Net Realized Investment Gains








	The Company had net realized investment gains of $.6 million in 2016 compared to $2.0 million in 2015. These amounts include gains and losses from sales of fixed maturities and equity securities available-for-sale and other investments. Decisions to sell securities are based on management's ongoing evaluation of investment opportunities and economic and market conditions, thus creating fluctuations in gains and losses from period to period.








	Fee Income and Other Income








	Fee income increased $2.5 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2016


	compared to the three-month period ended March 31, 2015 primarily due to increased fee income related to the increased ownership in an agency holding company partially offset by decreased fees due to the partial sale and deconsolidation of a previously wholly owned Third Party Administrator in the Fully Insured Health segment.





	Other income in the first quarter of 2016 increased $2.3 million from the same period in 2015 primarily due to fees received in conjunction with the administration of the runoff of the Medical Stop Loss segment.








	Insurance Benefits, Claims and Reserves








	In the first quarter of 2016, insurance benefits, claims and reserves decreased $48.9 million over the comparable period in 2015. The decrease is primarily attributable to: (i) a decrease of $37.6 million in the Medical Stop Loss segment primarily as a result of the sale of Risk Solutions and exit from the medical stop-loss business, further described in Note 3; (ii) a decrease of $6.0 million in the Fully Insured Health segment, primarily due to a decrease of $10.3 million in benefits, claims and reserves related to the run-off of the Major Medical business and from $1.2 million in decreased reserves from decreased retention in the international line; partially offset by increases of $4.3 million in claims in the occupational accident lines due to higher claim activity and reserves and increases of $.7 million due to volume in the short term medical line; (iii) a decrease of $4.4 million in the Individual life, annuity and other segment, primarily as a result of business in run-off and (iv) a decrease of $.9 million in


	benefits, claims and reserves in the group disability, life, annuities and DBL segment, primarily due to decreased loss ratios on group term life and LTD lines and DBL business.








	33














	Selling, General and Administrative Expenses










	Total selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $10.3 million over the comparable period in 2015. The decrease is primarily attributable to: (i) a decrease of $12.9 million in the Medical Stop Loss segment primarily as a result of the sale of Risk Solutions and exit from the medical stop-loss business, further described in Note 3, (ii) a decrease of $3.0 million in the Individual life, annuity and other segment largely due to lower amortization of deferred costs and general expenses from business in run-off; partially offset by (iii) an increase of $3.0 million in Corporate principally from increased audit, consulting and legal fees, and (iv) an increase of 2.2 million in the group disability, life, annuities and DBL segment primarily due to increased commission expense in the LTD line as a result of volume; and (iv) an increase of $0.4 million in the Fully Insured Health segment.  








	Income Taxes








	The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2016 of 37.8% was comparable to the rate for the three months ended 2015 of 37.9%.







	LIQUIDITY









	Insurance Group







	The Insurance Group normally provides cash flow from: (i) operations; (ii) the receipt of scheduled principal payments on its portfolio of fixed maturities; and (iii) earnings on investments. Such cash flow is partially used to fund liabilities for insurance policy benefits. These liabilities represent long-term and short-term obligations.







	Corporate







	Corporate derives its funds principally from: (i) dividends from the Insurance Group; (ii) management fees from its subsidiaries; and (iii) investment income from Corporate liquidity. Regulatory constraints historically have not affected the Company's consolidated liquidity, although state insurance laws have provisions relating to the ability of the parent company to use cash generated by the Insurance Group. No dividends were declared or paid by the Insurance Group during the three months ended March 31, 2016 or 2015.  







	Cash Flows







	The Company had $145.6 million and $17.5 million of cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.





	For the three months ended March 31, 2016, operating activities of the Company utilized $21.6 million of cash, $152.7 million was provided for the settlement of investment activities and $2.9 million of cash was utilized for financing activities. The increase in cash from investing is primarily related to the net proceeds of $134.5 from the sale of Risk Solutions. Financing activities include $0.9 million utilized for the repayment of debt, $0.8 million for the payment of dividends and $0.8 million for treasury share purchases.





	The Company has $483.2 million of liabilities for future policy benefits and policy benefits and claims that it expects to ultimately pay out of current assets and cash flows from future business. If necessary, the Company could utilize the cash received from maturities and repayments of its fixed maturity investments if the timing of claim payments associated with the Company's insurance resources does not coincide with future cash flows. For the three months ended March 31, 2016, cash received from the maturities and other repayments of fixed maturities was $10.3 million.











	34








	The Company believes it has sufficient cash to meet its currently anticipated business requirements over the next twelve months including working capital requirements and capital investments.  
















	BALANCE SHEET










	The Company had receivables due from reinsurers of $462.1 million at March 31, 2016 compared to $483.1 million at December 31, 2015. The $21.0 million decrease is primarily due to the novation of assumed policies related to the 2015 coinsurance transaction on individual life and annuity business, partially offset by increased amounts from the 2016 coinsurance transaction on the medical stop-loss business. All of such reinsurance receivables are from highly rated companies or are adequately secured. No allowance for doubtful accounts was necessary at March 31, 2016.





	In connection with the sale of IHC Risk Solutions, the Company purchased securities with the proceeds from the sale which had not yet settled, producing an increase in amounts due to securities brokers of $98.8 million in the first quarter of 2016.





	The Company's liability for policy benefits and claims by segment are as follows (in thousands):

	Major factors that affect the Projected Net Loss Ratio assumption in reserving for medical stop-loss relate to: (i) frequency and severity of claims; (ii) changes in medical trend resulting from the influences of underlying cost inflation, changes in utilization and demand for medical services, the impact of new medical technology and changes in medical treatment protocols; and (ii) the adherence to the Company's underwriting guidelines. Changes in these underlying factors are what determine the reasonably likely changes in the Projected Net Loss Ratio.





	The primary assumption in the determination of fully insured reserves is that historical claim development patterns tend to be representative of future claim development patterns. Factors which may affect this assumption include changes in claim payment processing times and procedures, changes in product design, changes in time delay in submission of claims, and the incidence of unusually large claims. The reserving analysis includes a review of claim processing statistical measures and large claim early notifications; the potential impacts of any changes in these factors are minimal. The time delay in submission of claims tends to be stable over time and not subject to significant volatility. Since our analysis considered a variety of outcomes related to these factors, the Company does not believe that any reasonably likely change in these factors will have a material effect on the Companys financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.





	The $108.4 million increase in IHCs stockholders' equity in the first three months of 2016 is primarily due to the $106.0 million of net income attributable to IHC and $3.0 million of other comprehensive income attributable to IHC, partially offset by $0.8 million of treasury stock purchases.














	35



















	Asset Quality and Investment Impairments










	The nature and quality of insurance company investments must comply with all applicable statutes and regulations, which have been promulgated primarily for the protection of policyholders. Although the Company's gross unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities totaled $6.4 million at March 31, 2016, 100% of the Companys fixed maturities were investment grade and continue to be rated on average AA. The Company marks all of its available-for-sale securities to fair value through accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. These investments tend to carry less default risk and, therefore, lower interest rates than other types of fixed maturity investments. At March 31, 2016, no fixed maturities were invested in non-investment grade fixed maturities. The Company does not have any non-performing fixed maturities at March 31, 2016.





	The Company reviews its investments regularly and monitors its investments continually for impairments. There were no securities with fair values less than 80% of their amortized cost at March 31, 2016 and the Company did not record any other-than-temporary impairment losses in the three months ended March 31, 2016 or 2015.


	 


	The unrealized losses on all available-for-sale securities have been evaluated in accordance with the Company's impairment policy and were determined to be temporary in nature at March 31, 2016. In 2016, the Company recorded $5.3 million of net unrealized gains on available-for sale securities, pre-tax, in other comprehensive income (loss) prior to reclassification adjustments. From time to time, as warranted, the Company may employ investment strategies to mitigate interest rate and other market exposures. Further deterioration in credit quality of the companies backing the securities, further deterioration in the condition of the financial services industry, a continuation of the current imbalances in liquidity that exist in the marketplace, a continuation or worsening of the current economic recession, or additional declines in real estate values may further affect the fair value of these securities and increase the potential that certain unrealized losses be designated as other-than-temporary in future periods and the Company may incur additional write-downs.













	CAPITAL RESOURCES










	Due to its strong capital ratios, broad licensing and excellent asset quality and credit-worthiness, the Insurance Group remains well positioned to increase or diversify its current activities. It is anticipated that future acquisitions or other expansion of operations will be funded internally from existing capital and surplus and parent company liquidity. In the event additional funds are required, it is expected that they would be borrowed or raised in the public or private capital markets to the extent determined to be necessary or desirable.





	IHC enters into a variety of contractual obligations with third parties in the ordinary course of its operations, including liabilities for insurance reserves, funds on deposit, debt and operating lease obligations.  However, IHC does not believe that its cash flow requirements can be fully assessed based solely upon an analysis of these obligations.  Future cash outflows, whether they are contractual obligations or not, also will vary based upon IHCs future needs.  Although some outflows are fixed, others depend on future events. The maturity distribution of the Companys obligations, as of March 31, 2016, is not materially different from that reported in the schedule of such obligations at December 31, 2015 which was included in Item

	7





	of the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K.  








	36



















	OUTLOOK










	For 2016, we anticipate:





	·


	A decrease in premiums and earnings due to exiting the medical stop-loss business as a result of the closing of the Risk Solutions Sale and Coinsurance Transaction.


	·


	Continued significant increase in specialty health premiums (including short-term and supplemental health products, such as dental, accidental medical, gap and critical illness products), and continued decrease in major medical premiums, which is in run-off. Increasing emphasis on direct-to-consumer and career advisor distribution initiatives as we believe this will be a growing means for selling health insurance in the coming years, and accompanying start-up costs of expanding our sales through our call center, career model (including our newly launched Aspira A Mas outreach to the Hispanic community) and transactional websites.


	·


	Increasing retention in our group life and disability lines of business. In 2016, we expect a continuation of the increase in premiums from group long-term and short-term disability driven by higher retention amounts and a full year of premiums generated by a relatively new distribution partnership.


	·


	Continued evaluation of strategic transactions.  As a result of the sale of Risk Solutions, we have significant cash.  We plan to redeploy some of this cash in making investments and acquisitions to bolster existing or new lines of business.  Subsequent to March 31, 2016, Specialty Benefits made a $0.6 million investment in a call center that will begin writing substantially all of its specialty health business with carriers affiliated with IHC.  We are currently negotiating several similar transactions.


	·


	Continued focus on administrative efficiencies, including a reduced operating loss at EHAE.


	·


	Concluding the process to take AMIC private.


	On March 31, 2016, IHC and its subsidiary Independence American Holdings Corp. sold the stock of Risk Solutions.  In addition, under the purchase and sale agreement, all of the in-force stop-loss business of Standard Security Life and Independence American produced by Risk Solutions is co-insured by Westport as of January 1, 2016.  The aggregate purchase price was $152.5 million in cash, subject to adjustments and settlements.  This transaction resulted in a gain of $99.8 million, net of taxes and amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests.  As a result, IHC is highly liquid and has excess capital; however its Medical Stop-Loss line of business will be in run-off, which will have a negative impact on future earnings.





	The Company will remain highly liquid in 2016 as a result of the continuing shorter duration of the portfolio. As a result, the yields on our investment portfolio were, and continue to remain, lower than in prior years and investment income may continue to be depressed for 2016. IHC has approximately $224.6 million in highly rated shorter maturity securities earning on average 1.2%; our portfolio as a whole is rated, on average, AA. The low duration of our portfolio enables us, if we deem prudent, the flexibility to reinvest in much higher yielding longer-term securities, which would significantly increase investment income in the future.  A low duration portfolio such as ours also mitigates the adverse impact of potential inflation.  IHC will continue to monitor the financial markets and invest accordingly.





	Our results depend on the adequacy of our product pricing, our underwriting, the accuracy of our reserving methodology, returns on our invested assets, and our ability to manage expenses.  We will also need to be diligent with the increased rate review scrutiny to effect timely rate changes and will need to stay focused on the management of medical cost drivers as medical trend levels cause margin pressures.  Therefore, factors affecting these items, as well as unemployment and global financial markets, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

	ITEM 3.







	QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK







	The Company manages interest rate risk by seeking to maintain an investment portfolio with a duration and average life that falls within the band of the duration and average life of the applicable liabilities. Options and other derivatives may be utilized to modify the duration and average life of such assets.





	The Company monitors its investment portfolio on a continuous basis and believes that the liquidity of the Insurance Group will not be adversely affected by its current investments. This monitoring includes the maintenance of an asset-liability model that matches current insurance liability cash flows with current investment cash flows. This is accomplished by first creating an insurance model of the Company's in-force policies using current assumptions on mortality, lapses and expenses. Then, current investments are assigned to specific insurance blocks in the model using appropriate prepayment schedules and future reinvestment patterns.





	The results of the model specify whether the investments and their related cash flows can support the related current insurance cash flows. Additionally, various scenarios are developed changing interest rates and other related assumptions. These scenarios help evaluate the market risk due to changing interest rates in relation to the business of the Insurance Group.





	The expected change in fair value as a percentage of the Company's fixed income portfolio at March 31, 2016 given a 100 to 200 basis point rise or decline in interest rates is not materially different than the expected change at December 31, 2015 included in Item 7A of the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K.





	 In the Company's analysis of the asset-liability model, a 100 to 200 basis point change in interest rates on the Insurance Group's liabilities would not be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company. With respect to its liabilities, if interest rates were to increase, the risk to the Company is that policies would be surrendered and assets would need to be sold. This is not a material exposure to the Company since a large portion of the Insurance Group's interest sensitive policies are burial policies that are not subject to the typical surrender patterns of other interest sensitive policies, and many of the Insurance Group's universal life and annuity policies were acquired from liquidated companies which tend to exhibit lower surrender rates than such policies of continuing companies. Additionally, there are charges to help offset the benefits being surrendered. If interest rates were to decrease substantially, the risk to the Company is that some of its investment assets would be subject to early redemption. This is not a material exposure because the Company would have additional unrealized gains in its investment portfolio to help offset the future reduction of investment income. With respect to its investments, the Company employs (from time to time as warranted) investment strategies to mitigate interest rate and other market exposures.

	CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES









	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and procedures







	IHCs Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer supervised and participated in IHCs evaluation of its disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in IHCs periodic reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commissions rules and forms.  





	As previously disclosed in Item 9A of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, management concluded that there was a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting for income taxes. Management determined that we did not maintain effective controls over the accounting for








	38








	and disclosures of technical accounting matters as they relate to income taxes. Specifically, we did not have (i) sufficient tax accounting resources with adequate knowledge of the Companys process and controls over financial reporting related to income taxes to effectively design, operate, and document controls over accounting for income taxes, (ii) an adequate risk assessment process related to income tax accounting to identify and appropriately account for income taxes associated with significant, non-routine transactions and (iii) effective process level controls over completeness, existence, accuracy and disclosure of deferred tax balances.







	Plan for Remediation of Material Weakness







	The Company is actively engaged in evaluating and determining implementation steps to remediate the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting identified related to accounting for income taxes. The Company has begun and will continue to (i) augment existing tax staff with additional skilled tax accounting resources and providing additional training to existing staff on the design and operation of tax related financial reporting and corresponding internal controls, (ii) enhance risk assessment processes that operate over accounting for income taxes, with a particular focus on the tax accounting and disclosure for unusual and complex transactions, and (iii) review the processes and controls in place to measure and record transactions related to tax accounting to enhance the effectiveness of the design and operation of those controls. Though the Company has begun to address the remediation efforts described above, until the remediation actions are fully implemented and the operational effectiveness of related internal controls validated through testing, the material weaknesses described above will continue to exist.

	There has been no change in IHCs internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, IHC's internal control over financial reporting.
