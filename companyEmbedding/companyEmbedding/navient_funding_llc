WHEREAS,
Section 9.2 of the Indenture permits supplemental indentures
to the Indenture with the consent of the Noteholders of at least a
majority of the Outstanding Amount of all of the Notes for the
purpose of adding any provisions to, or changing in any manner or

herewith.

 

NOW,
THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 

SECTION

amended.

 

  

SECTION
2.        Amendment and

(a)

the definitions of “Class A ‑

entirety and replacing them with the following:

 Supplemental Indenture No. 1A of 2016]

 

  


EXHIBIT A

 


CONSENT

 

Each of
the undersigned parties hereby consents, as of November 29, 2016,
to the amendment of the INDENTURE, dated as of February 14, 2013
(the “ Indenture ”), among SLM Student
Loan Trust 2013 ‑
1, as
Issuer (the “ Issuer ”), Deutsche Bank
Trust Company Americas, as eligible lender trustee (the “
Eligible Lender Trustee ”), and Deutsche Bank
National Trust Company, as indenture trustee (the “
Indenture Trustee ”), as amended from time to
time, in substantially the form attached hereto as Annex
A.

 

The
Indenture is being amended to amend certain definitions contained
therein.

 

Ratings
Considerations : Each of
the undersigned parties understands that no assurance can be
provided regarding the impact that the adoption of the amendment
will have on the ratings of the Notes.  As required by the
Indenture, the Issuer has provided prior written notice of the
terms of the amendment to each Rating Agency currently rating the
Notes.  However, no Rating Agency confirmation or affirmation
of the ratings of the Notes has been sought or given.  As a
result, it is not certain what impact the adoption of the amendment
will have on a Rating Agency’s decision to add the Notes to
or remove the Notes from its negative watch list for possible
downgrade or to downgrade the current ratings of the
Notes.

 

Further,
we have been advised that it is possible that a Rating Agency may
view the adoption of this amendment as a restructuring of a
distressed debt instrument.  One potential result of this
designation would be to cause a ratings downgrade of the Notes (to
reflect the distressed debt element of their analysis) followed by
an upgrade of the rating of the Notes (to address the restructuring
of the Notes).

 

U.S.
Federal Income Tax Considerations : Each of
the undersigned parties understands that the adoption of the
amendment may have adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to
the Noteholders, and the undersigned parties will rely on advice
from their own tax advisors on this matter.  The discussion
below is general in nature and does not address all of the tax
consequences of the adoption of the amendment that may be relevant
to Noteholders.

 

Although
we believe that the adoption of the amendment more likely than not
will not adversely affect the tax characterization of the Notes as
indebtedness for U.S. federal income tax purposes, certain adverse
tax consequences could apply to holders if the adoption of the
amendment resulted in the Notes being treated as equity for U.S.
federal income tax purposes.  For a further discussion of the
adverse tax consequences to Noteholders if the Notes were treated
as equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes, see “ U.S.
Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to Holders
of Notes In General—Treatment of the Notes as
Indebtedness ” in the Base Prospectus dated February 4,
2013 (the “ Base Prospectus ”). The
remainder of this discussion assumes that the Notes will constitute
indebtedness for U.S. federal income tax purposes following the
adoption of the amendment.

 

  

The
deferral of the stated maturity date pursuant to the amendment may
be treated as a significant modification of the Notes for U.S.
federal income tax purposes resulting in a deemed exchange. 
If the amendment results in a significant modification and a deemed
exchange of “Old Notes” for “New Notes,”
U.S. Noteholders will recognize gain or loss upon the deemed
exchange unless the exchange qualifies as a tax-free
recapitalization.  Although the matter is not free from doubt,
we intend to treat the deemed exchange as such a
recapitalization.  If the deemed exchange is a tax-free
recapitalization, a noteholder’s tax basis in the New Notes
received pursuant to a deemed exchange generally will equal the
holder’s tax basis in the Old Notes.

 

If the
amendment results in a significant modification, the issue price of
the New Notes will depend on whether the New Notes and the Old
Notes are properly characterized as “traded on an established
market” (her einafter “publicly-traded”) within
the meaning of Treas. Reg. § 1.1273 ‑
2(f)(1). 
We expect the New Class A-3 Notes should be characterized as
publicly traded, and we expect the New Class B Notes should not be
characterized as publicly traded. We expect, and the remainder of
this discussion assumes, that the stated interest on the New Notes
will meet the requirements for “adequate stated
interest” under the Treasury Regulations. Consequently, the
issue price of the New Class A-3 Notes should be the fair market
value of the New Class A-3 Notes on the date of the deemed exchange
(i.e., on the date the amendment becomes effective), and the issue
price of the New Class B Notes should be the “stated
principal amount” of the New Class B Notes.

 

A New Note
received in the deemed exchange will be treated as having been
issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S.
federal income tax purposes if the New Note’s “stated
principal amount” exceeds the issue price of the New Notes by
more than the statutorily defined de minimis amount. 
In light of the current trading prices for the Notes, there is a
significant likelihood that the New Class A-3 Notes will be treated
as re-issued with OID. For a further discussion of the treatment of
OID, see “ U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax
Consequences to Holders of Notes In General—Original Issue
Discount” in the Base Prospectus .

 

If the
deemed exchange qualifies as a recapitalization and a
Noteholder’s initial tax basis in the New Notes exceeds their
stated principal amount, the holder will be considered to have
acquired the New Notes with amortizable bond premium.  In
addition, for any Noteholder that acquired Old Notes with market
discount, any gain recognized on the deemed exchange will be
treated as ordinary income to the extent of the market discount
accrued during its period of ownership, unless such holder
previously elected to include market discount in income as it
accrued for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  Assuming the
deemed exchange qualifies as a recapitalization, in a deemed
exchange of Old Notes with market discount for New Notes, the New
Notes will be treated as acquired with market discount if the issue
price of the New Notes exceeds the holder’s initial tax basis
for such New Notes by more than a de minimis amount, and any
accrued market discount with respect to the Old Notes generally
should carry over to such New Notes.  For a further discussion
of amortizable bond premium and market discount, see “
U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to
Holders of Notes In General—Market Discount ” and
“ U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax
Consequences to Holders of Notes In General—Amortizable Bond
Premium ” in the Base Prospectus.

amendment.

FLOATING
RATE CLASS A-3 STUDENT LOAN-BACKED NOTES

 

SLM
Student Loan Trust 2013-1, a statutory trust organized and existing
under the laws of the State of Delaware (herein referred to as the
“Issuer”), for value received, hereby promises to pay
to CEDE & CO., or registered assigns, the principal sum of FIVE
HUNDRED MILLION AND NO/100 DOLLARS ($500,000,000) payable on each
Distribution Date in an amount equal to the result obtained by
multiplying (i) a fraction, the numerator of which is $500,000,000
and the denominator of which is $538,000,000, by (ii) the aggregate
amount, if any, payable to the Class A-3 Noteholders on such
Distribution Date in respect of principal of the Notes pursuant to
Section 3.1 of the Indenture dated as of February 14, 2013 (the
“Indenture”), among the Issuer, Deutsche Bank Trust
Company Americas, a New York banking corporation, as Eligible
Lender Trustee on behalf of the Issuer, and Deutsche Bank National
Trust Company, a national banking association, as Indenture Trustee
(the “Indenture Trustee”) (capitalized terms used but
not defined herein being defined in Appendix A to the
Indenture, which also contain rules as to usage that shall be
applicable herein); provided , however , that the
entire unpaid principal amount of this Note shall be due and
payable on the May 25, 2055 Distribution Date (the “Class A-3
Maturity Date”).

 

The Issuer
shall pay interest on this Note at the rate per annum equal to the
Class A-3 Rate (as defined on the reverse hereof), on each
Distribution Date until the principal of this Note is paid or made
available for payment, on the principal amount of this Note
outstanding on the preceding Distribution Date (after giving effect
to all payments of principal made on the preceding Distribution
Date), subject to certain limitations contained in Section 3.1 of
the Indenture.  Interest on this Note shall accrue from and
including the immediately preceding Distribution Date (or, in the
case of the first Accrual Period, the Closing Date) to but
excluding the following Distribution Date (each an “Accrual
Period”).  Interest shall be calculated on the basis of
the actual number of days elapsed in each Accrual Period divided by
360.  Such principal of and interest on this Note shall be
paid in the manner specified on the reverse hereof.

 

The
principal of and interest on this Note are payable in such coin or
currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment
is legal tender for payment of public and private debts.  All
payments made by the Issuer with respect to this Note shall be
applied first to interest due and payable on this Note as provided
above and then to the unpaid principal of this Note.

 

Reference
is made to the further provisions of this Note set forth on the
reverse hereof, which shall have the same effect as though fully
set forth on the face of this Note.

 

Unless the
certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the
Indenture Trustee whose name appears below by manual signature,
this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture
referred to on the reverse hereof, or be valid or obligatory for
any purpose.

Class A-3
(R-1) Note

 

  

This Note
is one of a duly authorized issue of Notes of the Issuer,
designated as its Floating Rate Class A-3 Student Loan-Backed Notes
(the “Class A-3 Notes”), together with the Floating
Rate Class A-1 Student Loan-Backed Notes (the “Class A-1
Notes”) and the Floating Rate Class A-2 Student Loan-Backed
Notes (the “Class A-2 Notes” and, together with the
Class A-1 Notes and the Class A-3 Notes, the “Class A
Notes”) which, together with the Issuer’s Floating Rate
Class B Student Loan-Backed Notes (the “Class B Notes”
and, together with the Class A Notes, the “Notes”), are
issued under and secured by the Indenture, to which Indenture and
all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a
statement of the respective rights and obligations thereunder of
the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee, the Eligible Lender Trustee and
the Noteholders.  The Notes are subject to all terms of the
Indenture.

 

This Note
is secured equally and ratably with the Collateral pledged as
security therefore as provided in the Indenture.  On any
Distribution Date, interest on each Class A Note will be paid pari
passu with all other Class A Notes, and, thereafter, interest on
the Class B Notes will be paid.  On any Distribution Date, the
principal on the Class A Notes will be paid, first, to the Class
A-1 Notes; second, to the Class A-2 Notes; and third, to the Class
A-3 Notes, up to the applicable Class A Noteholders’
Principal Distribution Amount. Thereafter, on any Distribution
Date, principal on the Class B Notes will be paid to the Class B
Notes up to the applicable Class B Noteholders’ Principal
Distribution Amount.  Payment priorities following the
occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default will
change as described in the Indenture.

 

Principal
of the Class A-3 Notes shall be payable on each Distribution Date
in an amount described on the face hereof. 
“Distribution Date” means the 25th day of each calendar
month or, if any such date is not a Business Day, the next
succeeding Business Day, commencing March 25, 2013.

 

As
described on the face hereof, the entire unpaid principal amount of
this Note shall be due and payable on the Class A-3 Maturity
Date.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the entire unpaid
principal amount of the Notes shall be due and payable on the date
on which (i) an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing and (ii) the Indenture Trustee or the Noteholders
representing not less than a majority of the Outstanding Amount of
the Notes shall have declared the Notes to be immediately due and
payable in the manner provided in Section 5.2 of the
Indenture.  All principal payments on the Class A-3 Notes
shall be made pro rata to the Noteholders entitled
thereto.

 

Interest
on the Class A-3 Notes shall be payable on each Distribution Date
on the principal amount outstanding of the Class A-3 Notes until
the principal amount thereof is paid in full, at a rate per annum
equal to the Class A-3 Rate.  The “Class A-3 Rate”
for each Accrual Period, other than the initial Accrual Period,
shall be equal to One-Month LIBOR as determined on the second
Business Day before the beginning of that Accrual Period plus
0.55%.  The interest for the initial Accrual Period shall be
as set forth in the definition of Class A-3 Rate contained in
Appendix A to the Indenture.

 

Class A-3
(R-1) Note

 

  

If
Definitive Notes have been issued as of the applicable Record Date,
then payments of interest on this Note on each Distribution Date,
together with the installment of principal, if any, to the extent
not in full payment of this Note, shall be made by check mailed to
the Person whose name appears as the Registered Holder of this Note
(or one or more Predecessor Notes) on the Note Register on the
Record Date.  Such checks shall be mailed to the Person
entitled thereto at the address of such Person as it appears on the
Note Register as of the applicable Record Date without requiring
that this Note be submitted for notation of payment, and the
mailing of such check shall constitute payment of the amount
thereof regardless of whether such check is returned
undelivered.  With respect to Notes registered on the
applicable Record Date in the name of the nominee of the Clearing
Agency (initially, such nominee to be Cede & Co.), unless
Definitive Notes have been issued, payments shall be made by wire
transfer in immediately available funds to the account designated
by such nominee.  Any reduction in the principal amount of
this Note (or any one or more Predecessor Notes) effected by any
payments made on any Distribution Date shall be binding upon all
future Noteholders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the
registration of transfer hereof or in exchange hereof or in lieu
hereof, whether or not noted hereon.  If funds are expected to
be available, as provided in the Indenture, for payment in full of
the then remaining unpaid principal amount of this Note on a
Distribution Date, then the Indenture Trustee, in the name of and
on behalf of the Issuer, shall notify the Person who was the
Noteholder hereof as of the preceding Record Date by notice mailed
no later than five days prior to such Distribution Date and the
amount then due and payable shall be payable only upon presentation
and surrender of this Note at the Indenture Trustee’s
Corporate Trust Office or at the office of the Indenture
Trustee’s agent appointed for such purposes located in the
Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York.

 

The Issuer
shall pay interest on overdue installments of interest on this Note
at the Class A-3 Rate to the extent lawful.

 

As
provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations set
forth therein, the transfer of this Note shall be registered 
on the Note Register upon surrender of this Note for registration
of transfer at the office or agency designated by the Issuer
pursuant to the Indenture, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a
written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the
Indenture Trustee duly executed by, the Noteholder hereof or his
attorney duly authorized in writing, with such signature guaranteed
by an “eligible guarantor institution” meeting the
requirements of the Note Registrar, which requirements include
membership or participation in Securities Transfer Agent’s
Medallion Program (“STAMP”) or such other
“signature guarantee program” as may be determined by
the Note Registrar in addition to, or in substitution for, STAMP
(all in accordance with the Exchange Act), and such other documents
as the Indenture Trustee may require, and thereupon one or more new
Notes of authorized denominations and in the same aggregate
principal amount shall be issued to the designated transferee or
transferees.  No service charge will be charged for any
registration of transfer or exchange of this Note, but the
transferor may be required to pay a sum sufficient to cover any tax
or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with
any such registration of transfer or exchange.

 

Each
Noteholder or Note Owner, by acceptance of this Note or, in the
case of a Note Owner, a beneficial interest in this Note, covenants
and agrees that no recourse may be taken, directly or indirectly,
with respect to the obligations of the Issuer or the Indenture
Trustee on the Notes or under the Indenture or any certificate or
other writing delivered in connection therewith, against (i) the
Indenture Trustee or the Eligible Lender Trustee in its individual
capacity, (ii) any owner of a beneficial interest in the Issuer or
(iii) any partner, owner, beneficiary, agent, officer, director or
employee of the Indenture Trustee or the Eligible Lender Trustee in
its individual capacity, any holder or owner of a beneficial
interest in the Issuer, the Eligible Lender Trustee or the
Indenture Trustee or of any successor or assign thereof in its
individual capacity, except as any such Person may have expressly
agreed (it being understood that the Indenture Trustee and the
Eligible Lender Trustee have no such obligations in their
individual capacity) and except that any such partner, owner or
beneficiary shall be fully liable, to the extent provided by
applicable law, for any unpaid consideration for stock, unpaid
capital contribution or failure to pay any installment or call
owing to such entity.

 

Class A-3
(R-1) Note

 

  

Each
Noteholder or Note Owner, by acceptance of a Note or, in the case
of a Note Owner, a beneficial interest in a Note, covenants and
agrees that by accepting the benefits of the Indenture that for all
tax purposes, financial accounting and all other related purposes,
(a) the Notes will constitute indebtedness of the Issuer and (b)
the Excess Distribution Certificateholder will be treated as owning
all of the assets, and assuming all of the liabilities (including
the Notes),
