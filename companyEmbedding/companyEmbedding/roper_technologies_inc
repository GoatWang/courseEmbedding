Roper Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ROP) Upgraded to Buy at Zacks Investment Research

Posted by Dan Jones on Jul 24th, 2017 // No Comments 

Zacks Investment Research upgraded shares of Roper Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ROP) from a hold rating to a buy rating in a research report sent to investors on Tuesday, July 4th. They currently have $259.00 target price on the industrial products company’s stock. 
According to Zacks, “We continue to believe that the Roper’s asset-light business model will boost financial performance in the long run. Also, winning of key projects like New York City’s MTA project are long term growth drivers. Its aggressive acquisition strategy will continue to help boost its performance. In 2016, Roper spent nearly $3.7 billion in software acquisitions, which include ConstructConnect and Deltek, which will help boost its performance especially in the software and network businesses. Shares have outperformed the broader market in the past one year. Following good first quarter 2017 results, management raised earnings per share guidance for the current year. For 2017, the company expects adjusted earnings per share in a range of $8.98–$9.28, compared with $8.82–$9.22 projected earlier. However, stiff competition, weakness in oil and gas, and a leveraged balance sheet remain overhangs. “

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Roper Technologies, Inc. (formerly Roper Industries, Inc.)[3] is an American diversified industrial company that produces engineered products for global niche markets. The company is headquartered in Sarasota, Florida.[citation needed]
Roper provides a wide range of products and services to customers in over 100 countries. The company has four main business lines: Industrial Technology, Radio Frequency (RF) Technology, Scientific and Industrial Imaging, and Energy Systems and Controls. Roper joined the Russell 1000 index in 2004, and has annual revenues of more than US$1.7 billion, as of 2006.[citation needed]
George D. Roper founded the company in the late 19th century, primarily as a manufacturer of home appliances, pumps, and other industrial products. Roper initiated a corporate acquisition program, supported by an initial public offering, in 1992.[citation needed]
In 2001, Brian Jellison, a former executive of General Electric and Ingersoll-Rand, joined Roper as Chief Executive Officer. The previous holding company business strategy has been replaced with an operating company model. Since 2001 Roper has completed acquisitions accounting for over half its revenues, establishing the company in global growth markets, such as radio frequency identification(RFID) and water.[citation needed]
Roper acquired Sunquest Information Systems, a maker of diagnostic and laboratory software for $1.42 billion in cash in 2012.[4]

DAP Technologies[edit]
DAP Technologies manufactures rugged mobile computers, including portable data terminals, and tablet computers. DAP's computers are designed for harsh environments, so they can be used in logistics operations, transportation, warehouses, field service, utilities, law enforcement, and the energy industry, as well as other applications.[citation needed]
DAP distributes its computers in more than 60 countries, and operates subsidiaries in Paris, France, Abingdon, England, and Tokyo, Japan. The company employs 150 people.[citation needed]
Media Cybernetics[edit]
Media Cybernetics is a company in Maryland, United States, founded in 1981, that produces image processing software used worldwide for industrial, scientific, medical, and biotechnology applications. In recent years, Media Cybernetics acquired the assets of Definitive Imaging, QED Imaging and AutoQuant Imaging.[citation needed]
The company achieved some notoriety when one of their software products, "Image Pro Plus", was used in research on the "Phoenix Lights" phenomenon. The company has indicated that the referenced usage scenario was out of scope for the product.[citation needed]
Photometrics[edit]
Photometrics designs and manufactures scientific imaging equipment for life science and OEM applications.[citation needed]
Princeton Instruments[edit]
Princeton Instruments, Princeton Instruments, manufactures scientific imaging equipment, optical coatings, optical cameras, CCD and EMCCD cameras, spectroscopy instrumentation, and electronic sub-assemblies.[citation needed]
Princeton Instruments is divided into these application-specific groups:[citation needed]

Imaging Group provides cameras for applications that include Astronomy, BEC, Combustion, PIV, Single Molecule, Surface and Material Analysis, PSP, and Nanotechnology.
Spectroscopy Group provides spectrometers, cameras and systems for Raman, LIBS, NIR, Absorption, Fluorescence, and Luminescence.
X-Ray Group manufactures cameras for EUV, Lithography, XRS, Plasma, Diffraction, Microscopy, and Tomography applications.
Industrial Group provides MEGAPLUS cameras for Semiconductor, Web Inspection, Document and Film Capture, Digital Radiography, and Ophthalmology.
Acton Optics & Coatings provides optical components for Medical, Semiconductor, Material Processing, Analytical Instrumentation, Aerospace, and Defense applications.

The company has based in Trenton, New Jersey and Acton, Massachusetts.
QImaging[edit]
QImaging designs and manufactures scientific CCD, EMCCD and sCMOS cameras for life science, industrial, and OEM applications.[citation needed]
Roper Pump Co.[edit]
Roper Pump Co. is part of the founding company from which Roper Industries began. George D. Roper began the company by founding the Roper legacy by entering into part ownership in the Van Wie Gas Stove Company of Cleveland, Ohio. The Van Wie plant moved to Rockford Illinois and passed into trusteeship in the early 1890s. George D. Roper became sole owner of the Van Wie Gas Stove company after the company's debts were paid off on September 1, 1894. A fire completely destroyed the facilities ten days later. The factory was rebuilt and named the Eclipse Gas Stove Company, and later expanded to include the Trahern Pump Company in 1906. The Trahern Pump Company, founded in 1857, would evolve to become Roper Pumps Co., currently located in Commerce, Georgia, United States, North America.[citation needed]
Roper Pump Co. mainly manufactures downhole progressing cavity pumps used in oil drilling, flow dividers used in power generation, and gear pumps used on tanker rail cars and tanker trucks. Roper Pump Co. is a leading US producer of small diameter progressing cavity pumps, flow dividers, and gear pumps.[citation needed]
TransCore and DAT Solutions[edit]
TransCore is a subsidiary of Roper Industries, based in Nashville, Tennessee , that specializes in Intelligent Transportation Systems. TransCore was acquired by Roper Industries in 2004.[citation needed][5]
Roper has divided TransCore into two units: TransCore; and DAT Solutions. TransCore manages RFID transponders and readers. In this family, their original product line reflects their acquisition of Amtech Systems in 2000 (also a supplier of production and automation systems for the manufacture of solar cells). These transponders come in a plastic case, for either windshield or external mounting. Their newer line is the eGo windshield sticker transponder system, which is a low-cost, batteryless system designed for one-time attachment to a windshield. These transponders are found in electronic toll collection, fleet tracking, payment, parking and access control applications.[citation needed]
In addition, TransCore has a substantial services business, designing, building and operating ITS facilities. This may be a complete electronic toll collection system, with design, build, transponders, equipment, customer service and violation enforcement, or any part of it. For example, TransCore operates the ETC systems for several E-ZPass members, even though E-ZPass has an exclusive contract with another manufacturer for transponders.[citation needed]
The Good to Go system in Washington state is an eGo transponder system.[citation needed]
DAT Solutions[edit]
DAT Solutions offers freight load boards products for owner-operators, carriers, brokers, shippers, and 3PLs. The underlying framework is the DAT Network, the first electronic freight posting service, acquired in 2001 from the Jubitz Corporation. DAT Solutions began as Dial-a-truck (DAT), a load board operated at the Jubitz Truck Stop. It evolved to become the original and largest internet load board, a matchmaking service for 100 million freight loads and trucks per year. DAT Solutions offers several load board products including: DAT Power, DAT Express and TruckersEdge. Other products, such as DAT RateView, DAT CarrierWatch, and DAT Keypoint are industry-leading offerings that help transportation professionals create greater efficiencies in their business.[citation needed]
DAT Solutions also offers Tracking & Communications satellite, for truck tracking, trailer tracking, and temperature and cargo monitoring systems for commercial and private fleets. They use GPS and GEOS technology to transmit data from the truck or trailer to the dispatch center.[citation needed]
The CBORD Group, Inc.[edit]
Roper acquired The CBORD Group, Inc. on February 21, 2008. CBORD was founded in Ithaca, NY in 1975. CBORD products are used in food services, catering, campus ID privilege control, and other industries. The products include CS Gold, Odyssey PCS, Foodservice Suite, Webfood, Nutrition Service Suite, Room Service Choice, NetMenu, NetNutrition, C-Store, EventMaster, and GeriMenu. CBORD has offices in: Ithaca, NY; Canton, OH; Waco, TX; Cypress, CA; and Sydney, Australia.[citation needed]
Compressor Controls Corporation (CCC)[edit]
