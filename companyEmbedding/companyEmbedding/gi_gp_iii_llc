This Amendment No. 2 (Amendment No. 2) amends and supplements the statements on
Schedule 13D filed with the SEC on February 21, 2014 (as amended by Amendment No. 1 thereto filed with the SEC on February 5, 2016, the Original Schedule 13D), relating to the Class A Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share (Class
A Common Stock), of Ladder Capital Corp (the Company). The Original Schedule 13D is hereby amended as follows:   


ITEM 3.
SOURCE AND AMOUNT OF FUNDS OR OTHER CONSIDERATION  Item 3 of the Original Schedule 13D
is hereby amended, with effect from the date of the event giving rise to this Amendment No. 2, by adding the following at the end thereof: 
On December 6, 2016, the Company entered into an Equity Underwriting Agreement with GI III-A, GI III-B, Ladder HoldCo, the other selling
stockholders party thereto (collectively, the Selling Stockholders), and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and Wells Fargo Securities, as representative of the several underwriters (the
Underwriters), pursuant to which the Selling Stockholders agreed to (i) sell 10,000,000 shares of Class A Common Stock and (ii) provide the Underwriters an option to purchase an additional 1,500,000 shares of Class A Common Stock from
certain Selling Stockholders other than the Reporting Persons (the Option Shares), in an underwritten offering (the December 2016 Offering). On December 7, 2016, the Underwriters exercised their option to purchase the Option
Shares.  In connection with the December 2016 Offering, on December 8, 2016, Ladder Holdco exchanged an aggregate of 3,137,211 shares of
Class B Common Stock and Units into 3,137,211 shares of Class A Common Stock. No cash or other consideration was exchanged in connection with the foregoing exchange.   


ITEM 4.
PURPOSE OF TRANSACTION  Item 4 of the Original Schedule 13D is hereby amended, with
effect from the date of the event giving rise to this Amendment No. 2, by adding the following at the end thereof:  In connection with the
December 2016 Offering, on December 12, 2016, GI III-A, GI III-B and Ladder HoldCo completed a sale of an aggregate 3,789,446 shares of Class A Common Stock to the Underwriters at a public offering price of $13.60 per share. 
In connection with the December 2016 Offering, GI III-A, GI III-B and Ladder HoldCo agreed, subject to specified exceptions, not to offer,
pledge or sell, or enter into any agreement to sell or otherwise dispose of or transfer, any shares of Class A Common Stock, or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of Class A Common Stock, for a period of 60 days
after December 6, 2016, except with the prior written consent of the Underwriters (the December 2016 Lock-Up Agreement). 
References to and descriptions of the December 2016 Lock-up Agreement set forth above in this Item 4 do not purport to be complete and are
qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the December 2016 Lock-Up Agreement, a form of which has been filed as an exhibit hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
