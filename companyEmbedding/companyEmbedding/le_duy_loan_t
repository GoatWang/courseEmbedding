Early life[edit]
Born in Nha Trang, South Vietnam, in 1962 to a labor-class family,[4] Duy-Loan Le fled to the U.S. without her father and a family of nine in 1975, eventually settling in Houston. Her family joined her in the U.S. few years later.
Although Loan knew no English when she arrived, she mastered the language fast enough to graduate from Alief Hastings High School at 16 as Valedictorian of her class of 335 students.
In 1976, she received her first recognition in the US as 'Citizen of the Month' from Kiwanis International Club.
In 1981, The Houston Chronicle featured her as 'Scholastic Wonder'; she also received commendation from The Office of The Ambassador of The Royal Netherlands for her scholastic achievement and her humanitarian effort in fund raising to aid the Vietnamese refugees.
University work and career[edit]
In 1982, at the age of 19, Duy-Loan received her undergraduate BSEE degree, magna cum laude, from the University of Texas at Austin [4][5][6] and subsequently obtained her MBA in May 1989 from the University of Houston while working full-time. She began her career at Texas Instruments as a memory design engineer.
Duy-Loan's technical contributions at Texas Instruments were recognized when she was elected a Member of Technical Staff in 1990, Senior Member of Technical Staff in 1993, the first woman at TI to be elected Distinguished Member of Technical Staff in 1997, and the first woman elected TI-Fellow in 1999.[4]
Currently she manages development projects for wireless communications as TI program manager for Laplace (a Digital signal processor (DSP) chip for 3G base stations) and also serves as manager of DSP Advanced Ramp. In 2002, Duy-Loan became the first Asian-American, and the first woman, to be elected TI Senior Fellow in Texas Instruments' 75-year history. She joins four men who hold this title at TI worldwide. Today she remains the only woman with this title.[4]
Charity work[edit]
Duy-Loan participates in numerous charity and fund raising projects for colleges, orphanages, and charity foundations. She serves on the Board of two non-profit organizations which promote education and support social economic development projects in the third world.
Duy-Loan has worked to advance education and learning conditions in Vietnam. She believes that by doing so, the environment for learning will produce more students who will be able to improve the overall state of Vietnam. She recently achieved her longtime dream of bringing soundly-built school facilities to rural Vietnam with the opening of “Thanh Thoi B”—a schoolhouse accommodating 120 elementary-age students and whose construction she played a leadership role in implementing. Her dream is to raise enough money to build 100 schools in five years. This activity complements well her similar effort in 10 other countries.
Ms. Le speaks annually at numerous national events to help create an environment that stimulates and releases leadership potential in women and Asian Americans.
Duy-Loan's service to the community includes:

United Way, Vietnamese Culture & Science Association’s sponsored projects, and taught Junior Achievement for many years.
Director of Mona Foundation, promoting education and supporting social economic development in 10 countries including Nur University and Barli Vocational Institute for Rural Women in Indore[7][8]
Founding member and Advisory Board Director for Sunflower mission bringing educational assistance to Vietnam.
Founding member and Honorary Board Director for Science National Honor Society, promoting math and science at high schools.
ECE Visiting committee for The University of Texas College of Engineering.
Serving on University of Texas (UT) Commission 125, shaping UT’s educational future for the next 25 years.
An invited speaker nationwide (including universities, IEEE, and Women in Technology International(WITI))

Personal life[edit]
Duy-Loan Le is married to Tuan N. Dao. They have two sons, Dan Dao and Don Dao. She also holds a black belt in Taekwon-Do and has won several medals and trophies in the State of Texas. For fun, Duy-Loan enjoys deep-sea fishing, playing poker, and reading. She listens to classical music and also traditional Vietnamese music.

Faces in the crowd: Duy-Loan Le
FACES IN THE CROWDEngineer calls hard work key to successLe determined after fleeing from Vietnam


KATANIA CASTANEDA, Chronicle Correspondent


        Published 5:30 am, Thursday, April 21, 2005
    



































































A sixth-grade teacher helped motivate Duy-Loan Le when she was a 12-year-old Vietnamese girl who had just come to the United States.
"I tried very hard that year," said Le, now a Texas Instruments engineer. "The first few months I got good grades only in math and art, but by the last six weeks I got straight A's."
In addition to good grades, she also learned the importance of determination and the willingness to work hard.
Le is particularly proud of that school year because it represents a time when she had to try extra hard to succeed.
"We got out of Vietnam on April 22, 1975, just eight days before the country collapsed," Le said. "We got out on an American airplane, and we were the first family to come to Houston."

(Story continues below ...)


Le, who came with her mother and six siblings, said coming to America was exciting. Back home, she had seen pictures and heard about the luxury in the United States, where everything was big.
"It was exciting to see the big freeways and the modern conveniences," she said. "The hard part was I didn't understand a single thing."
In Vietnam, she would have entered the eighth grade, but because of a language barrier, Le was put in the sixth grade.
She taught herself English by studying the dictionary everyday.
When she got straight A's that final six weeks, her teacher, Mrs. Perkins, gave her a note that read: "I know you will succeed at whatever you do," which was just the motivation she needed to push forward.
She asked her teacher if she could get bumped up to the ninth grade, which was where she would have been in Vietnam. But her teacher said the reading level would be too difficult.
Sad and discouraged, Le went home more determined than ever.
She marched over to Pershing Junior High School and pleaded her case. She was told that she would be given a chance, but she had to pass her first exam.
That first test was an English test, which she passed with flying colors.
Over the next few years, Le took on extra courses, skipped the 11th grade and graduated as valedictorian at age 16 from Alief Hastings High School.
At the University of Texas at Austin, she majored in electrical engineering. She pushed herself to finish school as soon as possible. She took as many classes as she could and graduated college in just three years, in 1982, with high honors.
That same year, she bought her first car, got her first job, bought her first home and got married.
Today, Le is just one of six people in the world to be named a senior fellow at Texas Instruments, and the only woman to ever have obtained such a position. She has a long list of honors credited to her name, including being named Asian-American engineer of the year by the Chinese Institute of Engineers.
"I am not that smart," she said. "It's just determination and hard work."
Michael Hames, TI senior vice president of application of specific products, said he has known Le since the late 1990s and has been impressed by her ability to cut across multiple business domains.
"Most people become comfortable. But Le is able to look across all domains, from the creation of the silicon process, to the design of integrated circuits, to the testing of the product. Her ability to look across the whole process and optimize is really phenomenal."
Her husband Tuan Dao, 49, an executive consultant for an international Houston-based consulting firm, said that he is very proud of Le and her accomplishments.
"She has worked very hard and made an impact to the company and the community she lives in. She works tirelessly to try to impact people's lives, especially children," said Dao.
Le co-founded the Sunflower Mission, an organization that builds schools in Vietnam, and is director of the Mona Foundation, which supports social and economic development in 10 countries.
One of her biggest concerns is minority children, she said, and hopes to serve as an example to them of what one can accomplish through hard work and determination.
"I think the sky is the limit," she said. "If you think you want to be the best cardiologist, you can be. It will take sacrifice, but it can be done. If you want to be an astronaut or the best musician, you can do it. But it takes hard work and a belief in one's self."
The sixth-grade report card serves as an important reminder for her.
"I carry it around with me to remind me when somebody says that something can't be done, it can. You just have to work hard at it."

Early life[edit]
Born in Nha Trang, South Vietnam, in 1962 to a labor-class family,[4] Duy-Loan Le fled to the U.S. without her father and a family of nine in 1975, eventually settling in Houston. Her family joined her in the U.S. few years later.
Although Loan knew no English when she arrived, she mastered the language fast enough to graduate from Alief Hastings High School at 16 as Valedictorian of her class of 335 students.
In 1976, she received her first recognition in the US as 'Citizen of the Month' from Kiwanis International Club.
In 1981, The Houston Chronicle featured her as 'Scholastic Wonder'; she also received commendation from The Office of The Ambassador of The Royal Netherlands for her scholastic achievement and her humanitarian effort in fund raising to aid the Vietnamese refugees.
University work and career[edit]
In 1982, at the age of 19, Duy-Loan received her undergraduate BSEE degree, magna cum laude, from the University of Texas at Austin [4][5][6] and subsequently obtained her MBA in May 1989 from the University of Houston while working full-time. She began her career at Texas Instruments as a memory design engineer.
Duy-Loan's technical contributions at Texas Instruments were recognized when she was elected a Member of Technical Staff in 1990, Senior Member of Technical Staff in 1993, the first woman at TI to be elected Distinguished Member of Technical Staff in 1997, and the first woman elected TI-Fellow in 1999.[4]
Currently she manages development projects for wireless communications as TI program manager for Laplace (a Digital signal processor (DSP) chip for 3G base stations) and also serves as manager of DSP Advanced Ramp. In 2002, Duy-Loan became the first Asian-American, and the first woman, to be elected TI Senior Fellow in Texas Instruments' 75-year history. She joins four men who hold this title at TI worldwide. Today she remains the only woman with this title.[4]
Charity work[edit]
Duy-Loan participates in numerous charity and fund raising projects for colleges, orphanages, and charity foundations. She serves on the Board of two non-profit organizations which promote education and support social economic development projects in the third world.
Duy-Loan has worked to advance education and learning conditions in Vietnam. She believes that by doing so, the environment for learning will produce more students who will be able to improve the overall state of Vietnam. She recently achieved her longtime dream of bringing soundly-built school facilities to rural Vietnam with the opening of “Thanh Thoi B”—a schoolhouse accommodating 120 elementary-age students and whose construction she played a leadership role in implementing. Her dream is to raise enough money to build 100 schools in five years. This activity complements well her similar effort in 10 other countries.
Ms. Le speaks annually at numerous national events to help create an environment that stimulates and releases leadership potential in women and Asian Americans.
Duy-Loan's service to the community includes:

United Way, Vietnamese Culture & Science Association’s sponsored projects, and taught Junior Achievement for many years.
Director of Mona Foundation, promoting education and supporting social economic development in 10 countries including Nur University and Barli Vocational Institute for Rural Women in Indore[7][8]
Founding member and Advisory Board Director for Sunflower mission bringing educational assistance to Vietnam.
Founding member and Honorary Board Director for Science National Honor Society, promoting math and science at high schools.
ECE Visiting committee for The University of Texas College of Engineering.
Serving on University of Texas (UT) Commission 125, shaping UT’s educational future for the next 25 years.
An invited speaker nationwide (including universities, IEEE, and Women in Technology International(WITI))

Personal life[edit]
Duy-Loan Le is married to Tuan N. Dao. They have two sons, Dan Dao and Don Dao. She also holds a black belt in Taekwon-Do and has won several medals and trophies in the State of Texas. For fun, Duy-Loan enjoys deep-sea fishing, playing poker, and reading. She listens to classical music and also traditional Vietnamese music.
Achievements and Awards[edit]

Accumulated 24 patents, all earning places in Texas Instruments' Hall of Fame.

Early life[edit]
Born in Nha Trang, South Vietnam, in 1962 to a labor-class family,[4] Duy-Loan Le fled to the U.S. without her father and a family of nine in 1975, eventually settling in Houston. Her family joined her in the U.S. few years later.
Although Loan knew no English when she arrived, she mastered the language fast enough to graduate from Alief Hastings High School at 16 as Valedictorian of her class of 335 students.
In 1976, she received her first recognition in the US as 'Citizen of the Month' from Kiwanis International Club.
In 1981, The Houston Chronicle featured her as 'Scholastic Wonder'; she also received commendation from The Office of The Ambassador of The Royal Netherlands for her scholastic achievement and her humanitarian effort in fund raising to aid the Vietnamese refugees.
University work and career[edit]
In 1982, at the age of 19, Duy-Loan received her undergraduate BSEE degree, magna cum laude, from the University of Texas at Austin [4][5][6] and subsequently obtained her MBA in May 1989 from the University of Houston while working full-time. She began her career at Texas Instruments as a memory design engineer.
Duy-Loan's technical contributions at Texas Instruments were recognized when she was elected a Member of Technical Staff in 1990, Senior Member of Technical Staff in 1993, the first woman at TI to be elected Distinguished Member of Technical Staff in 1997, and the first woman elected TI-Fellow in 1999.[4]
Currently she manages development projects for wireless communications as TI program manager for Laplace (a Digital signal processor (DSP) chip for 3G base stations) and also serves as manager of DSP Advanced Ramp. In 2002, Duy-Loan became the first Asian-American, and the first woman, to be elected TI Senior Fellow in Texas Instruments' 75-year history. She joins four men who hold this title at TI worldwide. Today she remains the only woman with this title.[4]
Charity work[edit]
Duy-Loan participates in numerous charity and fund raising projects for colleges, orphanages, and charity foundations. She serves on the Board of two non-profit organizations which promote education and support social economic development projects in the third world.
Duy-Loan has worked to advance education and learning conditions in Vietnam. She believes that by doing so, the environment for learning will produce more students who will be able to improve the overall state of Vietnam. She recently achieved her longtime dream of bringing soundly-built school facilities to rural Vietnam with the opening of “Thanh Thoi B”—a schoolhouse accommodating 120 elementary-age students and whose construction she played a leadership role in implementing. Her dream is to raise enough money to build 100 schools in five years. This activity complements well her similar effort in 10 other countries.
Ms. Le speaks annually at numerous national events to help create an environment that stimulates and releases leadership potential in women and Asian Americans.
Duy-Loan's service to the community includes:

United Way, Vietnamese Culture & Science Association’s sponsored projects, and taught Junior Achievement for many years.
Director of Mona Foundation, promoting education and supporting social economic development in 10 countries including Nur University and Barli Vocational Institute for Rural Women in Indore[7][8]
Founding member and Advisory Board Director for Sunflower mission bringing educational assistance to Vietnam.
Founding member and Honorary Board Director for Science National Honor Society, promoting math and science at high schools.
ECE Visiting committee for The University of Texas College of Engineering.
Serving on University of Texas (UT) Commission 125, shaping UT’s educational future for the next 25 years.
An invited speaker nationwide (including universities, IEEE, and Women in Technology International(WITI))

Personal life[edit]
Duy-Loan Le is married to Tuan N. Dao. They have two sons, Dan Dao and Don Dao. She also holds a black belt in Taekwon-Do and has won several medals and trophies in the State of Texas. For fun, Duy-Loan enjoys deep-sea fishing, playing poker, and reading. She listens to classical music and also traditional Vietnamese music.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:
