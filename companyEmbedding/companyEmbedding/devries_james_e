It was absolutely amazing and beyond our expectations! Working with Daisy and our photographer Carmel was a priceless journey. Carmel was amazing with our son who is very shy and was able to bring out his best side during our photo shoot, so kind, humble and humorous. We could not be more appreciative and grateful. Working with Daisy throughout the process was beyond our expectations. She was very genuine, kind and knowledge, helping us to get exactly what we were hoping for, actually better than what we had hoped for. In our journey through our first family pictures and our 1.5 year old sons pictures, deVries photography, Daisy and Carmel guided us and treated us as if we were family. We now have priceless portraits that will be treasured forever and will be forever thankful for our "beyond words" experience.

The Application of Magnesium Die Casting to Vehicle Closures


2005-04-11



Technical Paper




2005-01-0338
Patrick J. Blanchard, Gregory T. Bretz, Saravanan Subramanian, James E. deVries, Andrew Syvret, Andrew MacDonald, Peter Jolley
During the last decade, advances in magnesium die casting technology have enabled the production of large lightweight thin walled die castings that offer new approaches for low investment body construction techniques. As a result, many OEMs have expressed an interest in magnesium door closure systems due to investment reduction opportunities, coupled with potential weight savings of up to 50%. However, for such applications, product engineers are faced with the challenge of designing for stiffness and strength in crash critical applications with a material of lower modulus and ductility compared to wrought sheet product. Concept designs for side door systems have been presented in the literature, and indicate that structural performance targets can be achieved. However, to date, series production designs feature a multitude of supplementary sheet metal reinforcements, attached to die castings, to handle structural loads.

Nordson Corporation Appoints James E. DeVries to Vice President of 
      Global Continuous Improvement





        New Enterprise-Level Position to Drive Profitable Growth by Elevating 
        Continuous Improvement and Margin Enhancement Efforts to Higher Levels
      






October 28, 2010 09:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



WESTLAKE, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nordson 
      Corporation (NASDAQ: NDSN) today announced the appointment of James 
      E. DeVries to the newly created enterprise-level position of Vice 
      President of Global Continuous Improvement. Reporting directly to 
      Nordson President and CEO Michael F. Hilton, DeVries will be tasked with 
      driving profitable growth in all operating segments through elevation of 
      Nordson’s ongoing continuous improvement and margin enhancement efforts.
    


      “We are committed to building on excellence and extending our 
      competitive advantages everywhere we operate,” said Hilton. “While 
      Nordson’s current performance is at a very strong level, we believe 
      there are multiple opportunities for us to deliver even better 
      performance. The creation of this new position provides the additional 
      organizational focus necessary to capitalize on these opportunities. Jim 
      DeVries is an ideal choice for this new challenge and among Nordson’s 
      most proven senior leaders. As Vice President of Operations for 
      Nordson’s largest operating segment, Adhesive 
      Dispensing Systems, Jim has demonstrated the ability to drive 
      improved performance across multiple geographies and end markets over a 
      sustained period. His ongoing efforts in his new position will take 
      Nordson beyond Lean to the next level of performance, enable us to serve 
      our customers more effectively and ultimately deliver greater benefits 
      to our shareholders over the long term.”
    

      DeVries will build and lead a global team tasked with setting 
      productivity goals, defining key metrics, ensuring overall process 
      consistency across the company, and leading large enterprise step-change 
      projects. He will lead the reporting and development of business 
      decision information and tools in partnership with Nordson’s finance 
      team. Additional responsibilities include development and training for 
      continuous improvement tools including Lean and Six Sigma. He also will 
      drive other margin enhancing processes including customer and product 
      segmentation with profitability analysis, pricing management and 
      strategy, and broad based internal and external benchmarking.
    

      DeVries has held a variety of operational and engineering positions with 
      increasing responsibilities during his 25 year career at Nordson. Most 
      recently he served as Adhesive Dispensing Systems Vice President, North 
      America and China Engineering & Operations. During his time in that 
      role, two facilities within the segment were selected as winners in IndustryWeek 
      magazine’s prestigious Best Plants competition. Nordson’s plants were 
      recognized for excellence in operational improvements, agile production 
      systems, supplier partnerships, customer focus, employee empowerment, 
      quality systems, management practices, proactive environmental and 
      safety practices, and manufacturing capability. DeVries has also served 
      as Vice President of Adhesives Dispensing Systems’ nonwovens product 
      line and as a systems engineering manager. He began his Nordson career 
      as an engineer in the company’s Industrial 
      Coating Systems segment. DeVries earned an MBA from Baldwin Wallace 
      College and a BS degree in Mechanical Engineering from Cleveland State 
      University.
    

      Nordson Corporation is one of the world’s leading producers of precision 
      dispensing equipment that applies adhesives, sealants, liquid and powder 
      coatings and other materials to a broad range of consumer and 
      industrial products during manufacturing operations. The company also 
      manufactures equipment used in the testing 
      and inspection of electronic components as well as technology-based 
      systems for UV 
      curing and surface

      direct operations and sales support offices in more than 30 countries.

 OverviewIntegrative Cardiology is an exploration of a new and much-needed perspective in cardiac care: the intelligent synthesis of conventional medicine with alternative approaches not typically part of Western medical curriculum. More than a blending of two approaches, this new perspective in cardiology highlights specific gaps in conventional heart care, and examines how alternative approaches may be ideally suited to address these missed opportunities. Cardiology is an ideal specialty for an integrative approach. Heart disease is largely preventable. The influence of nutrition, physical activity, metabolic factors, and emotional state on heart health is unmistakable, and the wide-angle lens of integrative medicine is an ideal model to address these multi-faceted needs. Most importantly, the focus of this work is directed at prevention. The approaches described in this book emphasize collaboration of the patient and health care provider--both seeking to obtain the best possible outcome taking into account the intangible, but vital, nuances of the patient's culture, beliefs, and preferences. The first section in this book describes the core elements of integrative cardiology, beginning with nutrition. Foundational chapters that follow include exercise, botanicals, aspirin, metabolic cardiology, acupuncture, spirituality, mind/body approaches, and energy medicine. Contributing authors, all of whom have a background in academic medicine, share the approaches they have found most effective in their own practices, referencing their work with the best scientific evidence available.

Integrative Cardiology
Edited by Stephen Devries and James Dalen
Weil Integrative Medicine Library



Description



Integrative Cardiology is an exploration of a new and much-needed perspective in cardiac care: the intelligent synthesis of conventional medicine with alternative approaches not typically part of Western medical curriculum. More than a blending of two approaches, this new perspective in cardiology highlights specific gaps in conventional heart care, and examines how alternative approaches may be ideally suited to address these missed opportunities. Cardiology is an ideal specialty for an integrative approach. Heart disease is largely preventable. The influence of nutrition, physical activity, metabolic factors, and emotional state on heart health is unmistakable, and the wide-angle lens of integrative medicine is an ideal model to address these multi-faceted needs. Most importantly, the focus of this work is directed at prevention. The approaches described in this book emphasize collaboration of the patient and health care provider--both seeking to obtain the best possible outcome taking into account the intangible, but vital, nuances of the patient's culture, beliefs, and preferences.The first section in this book describes the core elements of integrative cardiology, beginning with nutrition. Foundational chapters that follow include exercise, botanicals, aspirin, metabolic cardiology, acupuncture, spirituality, mind/body approaches, and energy medicine. Contributing authors, all of whom have a background in academic medicine, share the approaches they have found most effective in their own practices, referencing their work with the best scientific evidence available.
