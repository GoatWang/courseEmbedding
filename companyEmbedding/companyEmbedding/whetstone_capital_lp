Whetstone Capital Urges Columbia Pipeline Partners Unitholders to 
      Vote against Merger with TransCanada Corporation




States that the Current $17.00 per Unit Merger Materially Undervalues 
      Columbia Pipeline Partners and its Network of Uniquely Positioned 
      Natural Gas Assets


Critical of TransCanada for Seeking to Take Advantage of its Minority 
      Partners at an Unfairly Low Price and Reap the Windfall


Explains That the Only Way for Unitholders to Preserve Their Ability 
      to Receive Full and Fair Value for Their Investment Is By Rejecting the 
      Proposed Merger at the Reconvened Special Meeting on February 16






February 09, 2017 12:16 PM Eastern Standard Time



MISSION WOODS, Kan.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Whetstone Capital Advisors, LLC ("Whetstone Capital"), a significant 
      unitholder of Columbia Pipeline Partners LP (NYSE:CPPL) (“CPPL” or the 
      “Partnership”), with ownership of approximately 1.2% of the common units 
      outstanding, issued a letter to CPPL unitholders today urging them to 
      vote against the proposed $17.00 per unit merger with TransCanada 
      Corporation (NYSE: TRP).
    


      The full text of the letter follows:
    

      February 9, 2017
    

      Dear Fellow Columbia Pipeline Partners, LP Unitholders:
    

      On February 7th, TransCanada (“TRP”) held a special meeting 
      to vote on the proposed sale of Columbia Pipeline Partners, LP (“CPPL”) 
      to TRP for $17.00 per unit. The meeting was adjourned and rescheduled 
      for February 16th because a majority of the holders had not 
      cast a vote either for or against the proposed sale. We believe that the 
      lack of quorum illustrates that long-term holders, such as ourselves, 
      are dissatisfied with the offer price. We are writing this letter to 
      recommend that you vote against the proposed sale. As of this writing 
      (and the January 4th record date), we own approximately 
      658,000 units, or 1.2% of the common units outstanding. We have voted 
      against the sale in favor of either a fairer offer or the opportunity to 
      participate in the value created by the partnership’s ongoing organic 
      growth program.
    

      On September 26, 2016, CPPL announced that it had received an 
      unsolicited offer from TRP to acquire the outstanding common units of 
      CPPL for $15.75 per unit. Nine weeks later, TRP raised their offer to 
      $17.00 per unit (the “LP Offer”). We believe that this offer materially 
      understates the value of CPPL and urge fellow unitholders to reject it. 
      Based on our estimate of intrinsic value, which takes into consideration 
      TransCanada’s acquisition of Columbia Pipeline Group ("CPGX"), we 
      believe the fair value of CPPL is at least $20 per unit. We would like 
      to take the opportunity to share our thoughts on TRP’s offer with fellow 
      unitholders.
    

      We, like many CPPL unitholders, first invested with the company at its 
      IPO in February 2015 at $23 per unit. We share TRP’s enthusiasm for the 
      quality and growth that Columbia Pipeline’s asset footprint offers. In 
      sharing this enthusiasm, we don’t want to sell our interest in this 
      business. It is an irreplaceable and unmatched network of natural gas 
      transmission pipes that blankets perhaps the most prolific natural gas 
      basin in the world. If we are forced to sell, then we expect to get 
      fairly compensated.
    

      In March of last year, TRP announced its intent to acquire CPGX (the “GP 
      Offer”), the general partner of CPPL, for $25.50 per share in cash. This 
      valued CPGX at roughly 20.2x and 16.4x estimated 2016 and 2017 EBITDA 
      (including forecasted IDR payments), respectively. CPGX's only asset at 
      the time was its ownership of Columbia OpCo, the entity through which 
      all of Columbia Pipeline's business and operations are conducted. The LP 
      Offer of $17.00 for CPPL would result in TRP acquiring the remaining 
      interest in OpCo at more than a 15% discount to the price it paid for 
      the rest of the very same business one year ago, at a time when the 
      energy market was severely depressed. We feel this is an attempt by TRP 
      to disadvantage its minority partners.
    

      Since TRP announced the GP Offer last March, TRP’s share price has 
      increased over 22% (3/16/16-2/7/17, denominated in USD), adding nearly 
      $7.5 billion to its market capitalization. We believe that this strong 
      performance is very much related to the market’s appreciation of the 
      Columbia Pipeline assets. The LP Offer is a diminutive 4% premium to the 
      average trading price during the month preceding TRP’s GP Offer.
    

      Today’s market is unequivocally better than the conditions that were 
      present when TRP made the GP Offer. Natural gas prices have increased 
      more than 65%. As a result, the credit quality and market 
      capitalizations of Columbia Pipeline’s key producer counterparties have 
      dramatically improved. Furthermore, greenfield energy infrastructure 
      projects in the Northeast must overcome increasingly high hurdles and 
      strong opposition (e.g. Constitution Pipeline and Northeast Energy 
      Direct). Consequently, we believe that the value of low-risk brownfield 
      expansion opportunities, such as Columbia Pipeline’s $8 billion growth 
      capex backlog, has never been higher.
    

      In the event that TRP is unwilling to fairly compensate CPPL, we, and 
      other unitholders, should be more than happy to continue with the status 
      quo as a separate company. Outside of a scenario in which TRP uses its 
      position as general partner to punish CPPL unitholders for being 
      unwilling to take the LP Offer, we believe that CPPL is well-positioned 
      to fund its share of growth capital expenditures. Currently, Columbia 
      OpCo (and by extension, CPPL) carries less than 1.0x debt-to-EBITDA. 
      Today’s debt market is favorable, and CPPL could readily access debt at 
      a cost that is in-line with investment grade MLPs. Based on the capital 
      expenditure and EBITDA guidance that CPGX had previously provided, we 
      think that CPPL could debt finance most, if not all, of its share of 
      growth capital and maintain investment grade quality debt metrics.
    

      We believe that TRP’s LP Offer significantly undervalues CPPL in a 
      “go-it alone” situation. We estimate that the LP Offer values CPPL at 
      roughly 10.7x 2019 EBITDA, adjusted for GP cash flows and growth capital 
      expenditures. Assuming a more appropriate multiple of 12.7x EBITDA, 
      which is in line with Spectra Energy Partners (CPPL’s closest 
      comparable), we estimate that the fair value of CPPL is near $22 per 
      unit. This estimate corresponds with our previously articulated approach 
      of using the same multiple that TRP paid for CPGX (the exact same 
      operating assets as CPPL) in much less favorable market conditions.
    

      In closing, we would like to implore TransCanada to consider its image 
      as a good corporate citizen and its ongoing reliance on the capital 
      markets to fund over $20 billion in growth projects. As TRP’s Code of 
      Business Ethics highlights, “TransCanada prides itself on being a 
      company that all of our stakeholders (whether they are customers, 
      suppliers, investors, lenders, regulators, neighbors, or employees), can 
      count on to make the right choices and do the right thing.” We have 
      remained investors in CPPL since TRP became our general partner, in 
      part, because we believe TransCanada intends to continue to “do the 
      right thing” and treat its minority partners in a fair and equitable 
      manner.
    

      Should anyone wish to discuss our thoughts and assumptions regarding our 
      investment in CPPL, we would encourage you to contact us using the 
      information below.
    

      Best regards,
    

      (Signed)

Whetstone Capital Urges Columbia Pipeline Partners Unitholders to 
      Vote against Merger with TransCanada Corporation
States that the Current $17.00 per Unit Merger Materially Undervalues 
      Columbia Pipeline Partners and its Network of Uniquely Positioned 
      Natural Gas AssetsCritical of TransCanada for Seeking to Take Advantage of its Minority

      to Receive Full and Fair Value for Their Investment Is By Rejecting the 
      Proposed Merger at the Reconvened Special Meeting on February 16
































MISSION WOODS, Kan., Feb 09, 2017 (BUSINESS WIRE) --
Whetstone Capital Advisors, LLC ("Whetstone Capital"), a significant 
      unitholder of Columbia Pipeline Partners LP  (“CPPL” or the 
      “Partnership”), with ownership of approximately 1.2% of the common units 
      outstanding, issued a letter to CPPL unitholders today urging them to 
      vote against the proposed $17.00 per unit merger with TransCanada 
      Corporation

The full text of the letter follows:


                                        








February 9, 2017


                                        








Dear Fellow Columbia Pipeline Partners, LP Unitholders:


                                        








On February 7
		[th]
	, TransCanada (“TRP”) held a special meeting 
      to vote on the proposed sale of Columbia Pipeline Partners, LP (“CPPL”) 
      to TRP for $17.00 per unit. The meeting was adjourned and rescheduled 
      for February 16
		[th]
	 because a majority of the holders had not 
      cast a vote either for or against the proposed sale. We believe that the 
      lack of quorum illustrates that long-term holders, such as ourselves, 
      are dissatisfied with the offer price. We are writing this letter to 
      recommend that you vote against the proposed sale. As of this writing 
      (and the January 4
		[th]
	 record date), we own approximately 
      658,000 units, or 1.2% of the common units outstanding. We have voted 
      against the sale in favor of either a fairer offer or the opportunity to 
      participate in the value created by the partnership’s ongoing organic 
      growth program.


                                        








On September 26, 2016, CPPL announced that it had received an 
      unsolicited offer from TRP to acquire the outstanding common units of 
      CPPL for $15.75 per unit. Nine weeks later, TRP raised their offer to 
      $17.00 per unit (the “LP Offer”). We believe that this offer materially 
      understates the value of CPPL and urge fellow unitholders to reject it. 
      Based on our estimate of intrinsic value, which takes into consideration 
      TransCanada’s acquisition of Columbia Pipeline Group ("CPGX"), we 
      believe the fair value of CPPL is at least $20 per unit. We would like 
      to take the opportunity to share our thoughts on TRP’s offer with fellow 
      unitholders.


                                        








We, like many CPPL unitholders, first invested with the company at its 
      IPO in February 2015 at $23 per unit. We share TRP’s enthusiasm for the 
      quality and growth that Columbia Pipeline’s asset footprint offers. In 
      sharing this enthusiasm, we don’t want to sell our interest in this 
      business. It is an irreplaceable and unmatched network of natural gas 
      transmission pipes that blankets perhaps the most prolific natural gas 
      basin in the world. If we are forced to sell, then we expect to get 
      fairly compensated.


                                        








In March of last year, TRP announced its intent to acquire CPGX (the “GP 
      Offer”), the general partner of CPPL, for $25.50 per share in cash. This 
      valued CPGX at roughly 20.2x and 16.4x estimated 2016 and 2017 EBITDA 
      (including forecasted IDR payments), respectively. CPGX's only asset at 
      the time was its ownership of Columbia OpCo, the entity through which 
      all of Columbia Pipeline's business and operations are conducted. The LP 
      Offer of $17.00 for CPPL would result in TRP acquiring the remaining 
      interest in OpCo at more than a 15% discount to the price it paid for 
      the rest of the very same business one year ago, at a time when the 
      energy market was severely depressed. We feel this is an attempt by TRP 
      to disadvantage its minority partners.


                                        








Since TRP announced the GP Offer last March, TRP’s share price has 
      increased over 22% (3/16/16-2/7/17, denominated in USD), adding nearly 
      $7.5 billion to its market capitalization. We believe that this strong 
      performance is very much related to the market’s appreciation of the 
      Columbia Pipeline assets. The LP Offer is a diminutive 4% premium to the 
      average trading price during the month preceding TRP’s GP Offer.


                                        








Today’s market is unequivocally better than the conditions that were 
      present when TRP made the GP Offer. Natural gas prices have increased 
      more than 65%. As a result, the credit quality and market 
      capitalizations of Columbia Pipeline’s key producer counterparties have 
      dramatically improved. Furthermore, greenfield energy infrastructure 
      projects in the Northeast must overcome increasingly high hurdles and 
      strong opposition (e.g. Constitution Pipeline and Northeast Energy 
      Direct). Consequently, we believe that the value of low-risk brownfield 
      expansion opportunities, such as Columbia Pipeline’s $8 billion growth 
      capex backlog, has never been higher.


                                        








In the event that TRP is unwilling to fairly compensate CPPL, we, and 
      other unitholders, should be more than happy to continue with the status 
      quo as a separate company. Outside of a scenario in which TRP uses its 
      position as general partner to punish CPPL unitholders for being 
      unwilling to take the LP Offer, we believe that CPPL is well-positioned 
      to fund its share of growth capital expenditures. Currently, Columbia 
      OpCo (and by extension, CPPL) carries less than 1.0x debt-to-EBITDA. 
      Today’s debt market is favorable, and CPPL could readily access debt at 
      a cost that is in-line with investment grade MLPs. Based on the capital 
      expenditure and EBITDA guidance that CPGX had previously provided, we 
      think that CPPL could debt finance most, if not all, of its share of 
      growth capital and maintain investment grade quality debt metrics.


                                        








We believe that TRP’s LP Offer significantly undervalues CPPL in a 
      “go-it alone” situation. We estimate that the LP Offer values CPPL at 
      roughly 10.7x 2019 EBITDA, adjusted for GP cash flows and growth capital 
      expenditures. Assuming a more appropriate multiple of 12.7x EBITDA, 
      which is in line with Spectra Energy Partners (CPPL’s closest 
      comparable), we estimate that the fair value of CPPL is near $22 per 
      unit. This estimate corresponds with our previously articulated approach 
      of using the same multiple that TRP paid for CPGX (the exact same 
      operating assets as CPPL) in much less favorable market conditions.


                                        








In closing, we would like to implore TransCanada to consider its image 
      as a good corporate citizen and its ongoing reliance on the capital 
      markets to fund over $20 billion in growth projects. As TRP’s         
Code of 
      Business Ethics         
highlights, “TransCanada prides itself on being a 
      company that all of our stakeholders (whether they are customers, 
      suppliers, investors, lenders, regulators, neighbors, or employees), can 
      count on to make the right choices and do the right thing.” We have 
      remained investors in CPPL since TRP became our general partner, in 
      part, because we believe TransCanada intends to continue to “do the 
      right thing” and treat its minority partners in a fair and equitable 
      manner.


                                        








Should anyone wish to discuss our thoughts and assumptions regarding our 
      investment in CPPL, we would encourage you to contact us using the 
      information below.
