SAN FRANCISCO, May 18, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Zipongo, Eating Well Made Simple, has announced the appointment of Viet Nguyen as the company's first Vice President of Data Science. Nguyen most recently served as the senior director of data engineering and advanced analytics for apparel retailer Gap, Inc. 








The appointment reflects Zipongo's commitment to developing a new approach to eating well that is backed by the best nutritional science, behavioral science, data science and analytics. Nguyen will oversee and refine Zipongo's algorithms to help nudge users gradually towards better food choices. Zipongo offers recipe, food shopping and restaurant recommendations that are personalized to each user's food preferences, health status, health goals and genetic makeup.
Nguyen spent more than eight years at Gap, Inc., during which time he grew the analytics team from four to 30 FTEs and 50 contractors. His primary expertise is in scaling analytics operations to meet growing customer needs. At Gap, Inc., he was responsible for both inventory management and customer data science.  Prior to his tenure at Gap, Inc., he spent six years developing data-centric applications at Oracle.
"Food poses an exciting challenge for data science — we must both keep consumers engaged, and also gradually help them advance on a path to better health," Nguyen said. "Zipongo is the only healthy eating technology application I have seen that really 'gets it.' The focus is on meeting users where they are and working with them to change unhealthy behaviors in a personalized approach that really works."
Nguyen's connection to Zipongo dates back eight years, when he first worked with Zipongo CEO and Founder Jason Langheier, MD, MPH to create a nutritional database that would eventually become the backbone of the current technology platform.
"We are thrilled to welcome Viet, an early contributor to our Food Terminology Index," said Dr. Langheier. "Given his experience with both enterprise analytics at Oracle and leading a large consumer-oriented data science organization at Gap, Inc., Viet will skillfully continue to build out our full-stack data science team at an important inflection point for Zipongo." 
Dr. Langheier continued, "Data Science is integral to the R&D process at Zipongo, driving product science that optimizes the user experience, analytics and actuarial sciences for health plan and employer customers, as well as ontology development behind our Food Terminology Index, and predictive modeling that drives our personalized nutrition recommendations that sync with national guidelines."
Zipongo offers recipe, food shopping and restaurant recommendations that are personalized to each user's food preferences, health status, health goals and genetic makeup. Zipongo's expanding food benefits offerings include recipe recommendations, customized grocery lists, grocery delivery, restaurant ordering support and digital nutrition coaching. 
Zipongo envisions a future where employers deploy food as medicine to improve the overall health of the workforce and help rein in health costs. Zipongo's current and future products are backed by the latest data science to track and report success metrics to customers.
About Zipongo Zipongo is Eating Well Made Simple.  Zipongo's platform enables digital nutrition coaching for large employers, health plans and health systems, and provides food utility tools to families that make it easier to consistently select and buy healthy food people love.  Zipongo provides trusted food selection and buying environments for cooking and eating prepared meals that meet the needs of diverse groups of people, with tools ranging from meal planning, recipes, grocery rewards and online grocery ordering, to menu coaching and mobile meal ordering.

About Us 
 
 











Who We Are
 



Founded in 2011, Zipongo is a digital nutrition platform that takes the guesswork out of healthy eating with personalized meal recommendations based on biometrics and food preferences. We work with employers, health plans and wellness companies to reduce chronic disease and improve the health of their employees and members.Our solution delivers real-time support for all the places a person makes food decisions – at home, at work, at the grocery store, and at restaurants. Pointing users to the healthiest recipe and menu choices reduces the likelihood of making poor food choices based on convenience, cost and other factors. 
 
 



















Our Mission
Zipongo’s mission is to reduce chronic disease by positively impacting the one thing everyone does: eat. 

We work with employers, health plans and other wellness partners who want to find easy ways to help people eat healthier and prevent chronic disease. 




 







How We Got Here
Zipongo was founded because its leaders understand the significant role nutrition plays in improving overall health.

Changing how we eat is the single behavior that can have the biggest impact on your health. It can reverse chronic disease, help you lose weight and, ultimately, lower your healthcare costs. Yet many wellness programs don’t focus effectively on food and nutrition.Historically, wellness programs tried to address nutrition through methods that are hard to stick to -- food tracking, calorie-restricted diets, weight loss challenges.  Zipongo aims for sustainable, long-term behavior change by pointing individuals to the healthy options all around them -- at home, at the grocery store, at their employer’s onsite cafe, and in local restaurants. 








 
 
 











Fueled by Strong Leadership.

See Section 6 below regarding the treatment of partial redemptions of Vouchers.Neither Zipongo nor the Manufacturer or the Merchant is responsible for lost, stolen, damaged or mutilated Vouchers or Voucher reference numbers.Vouchers cannot be combined with any other vouchers, third party certificates, coupons, or promotions, unless otherwise specified by the Manufacturer or Merchant.Reproduction, sale or trade of any Voucher is prohibited unless done so in compliance with applicable law.Any attempted redemption not consistent with these Terms of Sale or the terms and conditions on the Voucher will render the Voucher null and void.All Vouchers are void to the extent prohibited by law.The following additional terms and conditions apply only to Manufacturer Vouchers:Each Manufacturer Voucher comes in the form of one (1) or more coupons which can be redeemed at Resellers in accordance with said Reseller’s and Manufacturer’s established coupon redemption policies and practices.Manufacturer Vouchers may be applied only to the specific goods identified on the Voucher, and may not be applied to tax, shipping or handling charges.Limit one (1) Manufacturer Voucher per redemption. Only one Manufacturer Voucher can be used per order unless otherwise specified by Manufacturer. Two (2) or more coupons that are part of the same Voucher can be used together in a single visit or on separate occasions.The issuing of credit is at the sole discretion of the Manufacturer unless otherwise required by law.The following additional terms and conditions apply only to Merchant Vouchers:Merchant Vouchers may be applied only to merchandise sold by Merchant, and may not be applied to tax, shipping or handling charges.Limit one (1) Merchant Voucher per redemption. Only one Merchant Voucher can be used per order unless otherwise specified by Merchant.The issuing of credit is at the sole discretion of the Merchant unless otherwise required by law.3. Terms and Conditions for Restaurant VouchersFor this Section, “Restaurant” shall be defined as a Merchant who offers food and beverage for sale in its regular business operations, and is making such food and beverages available to purchasers of Vouchers. The following additional terms and conditions apply only to Restaurant Vouchers:The frequency by which you can redeem Restaurant Vouchers is determined by Restaurants, and shall be specified in the terms and conditions indicated for that Voucher on the Zipongo site.Use of Restaurant Vouchers for alcoholic beverages is prohibited, unless otherwise specified on the Voucher by the Restaurant and only to the extent permitted by applicable law. The applicability and compliance with any relevant law is solely determined and consummated by the Restaurant, and Zipongo has no role in such determination or action on the part of the Restaurant.Restaurant Vouchers cannot be used for taxes, tips or prior balances, unless permitted by the Restaurant.Restaurant Vouchers are valid for dine-in only unless otherwise stated.The issuing of restaurant credit is at the sole discretion of the Restaurant unless otherwise required by applicable law.4. Charges for Multiple, Unauthorized or Fraudulent Use of VouchersYou are responsible for all uses of Vouchers you purchase through the Site. You are only permitted to use a Voucher for the allotted amount (typically limit 1 per person, with option to buy 1 additional as a gift). Zipongo will charge you (to the credit card you provided for the initial purchase) if a Voucher in your name is used more than the allotted amount. However, if such multiple use was without your knowledge or authorization, please contact us at help@zipongo.com and we will investigate your case and work with you to resolve the issue.5. Voucher Expiration DatesA. Promotional OfferThe Vouchers issued through the Site are promotional vouchers in which a Manufacturer or Merchant offers you the ability to purchase goods and services at a certain value (“Promotional Offer”) during a limited period of time. This Promotional Offer is sold to you at a discount. For example, you may be offered the opportunity to purchase $50 worth of a Manufacturer’s or Merchant’s goods for $25; in this case, this Promotional Offer is worth $50. This Promotional Offer expires as of the expiration date indicated on the Voucher (“Promotional Offer Expiration Date”) and you will not be able to redeem the Voucher for the Promotional Value after that expiration date, unless a Manufacturer or Merchant is otherwise required by law to honor that Promotional Offer after the Promotional Offer Expiration Date.B. Consumer Payment AmountYou also paid a certain amount to purchase the Voucher (the “Consumer Payment Amount”), which will typically be less than the Promotional Offer of the Voucher. While the Promotional Offer Expiration Date dictates the last date that you can use your Voucher for the Promotional Offer or offer stated on the Voucher, applicable law may require that the Manufacturer or Merchant redeem the Voucher for the Consumer Payment Amount after the Promotional Offer Expiration Date stated on the Voucher. If such redemption is required by law, you will only be entitled to redeem the Voucher if the amount you have previously redeemed (if any) is less than the Cash Payment Amount. In such a case, you will be only be allowed to redeem the Consumer Payment Amount (less any amount previously redeemed) up until the later of: five (5) years after the date of issuance of the Voucher or (2) the minimum length of time allowed by applicable law for a Voucher to expire if such length of time is longer than five (5) years.C. Failure of Merchant, Manufacturer or Restaurant to Redeem VouchersYou agree that only the Merchant, Manufacturer or Restaurant (not Zipongo) is responsible for redeeming any Promotional Offer or Consumer Payment Amount that is required by law to be redeemed after the Promotional Offer Expiration Date. However, if you have an expired Voucher and would like to redeem it for the Consumer Payment Amount, and if applicable law entitles you to such redemption, but the Merchant, Manufacturer or Restaurant have refused to do so, then please contact Zipongo at support@zipongo.com and explain your situation in writing (including why you did not use the voucher in full before the promotional expiration date, the name and address of the Merchant, and the name, email and phone for the Merchant staff that rejected your Voucher) and Zipongo will issue you a Voucher with a new expiration date or refund the Consumer Payment Amount of the Voucher in credit for purchases of future Vouchers from Zipongo (presently known as “Pongo Bucks”).6. Partial RedemptionAs a general rule, you are not entitled to cash or credit if you redeem the Voucher for less than the value of the Promotional Offer. However, if such cash or credit is required by law, you will only be entitled to a credit or cash equal to the difference between the Consumer Payment Amount and the amount you redeemed, if the amount you redeemed is less than the Consumer Payment Amount. For example, if you paid $20 for a Voucher which entitles you to purchase $50 of a product by October 1, 2011, the Consumer Payment Amount is $20 and the Promotional Offer is worth $50. If you make a purchase for $40 on September 28, 2011, you will not be entitled to any cash or credit back.. If you make a purchase for only $15, you would be entitled to $5 in cash or purchase credit, for use on a future purchase, if such cash or credit is required by applicable law.7. Zipongo Has No Liability for Goods and ServicesThe holder and issuer of a Manufacturer Voucher is the Manufacturer and the holder and issuer of the Merchant Voucher is the Merchant. As a holder and issuer of the Voucher, the Manufacturer or Merchant shall be fully and solely responsible for any and all injuries, illnesses, damages, claims, liabilities and costs suffered by or in respect of a customer, caused in whole or in part by the Manufacturer or Merchant, as well as for any unclaimed property liability arising from unredeemed Vouchers or portions thereof. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU WAIVE, RELEASE AND HOLD HARMLESS ZIPONGO, AND ITS PARENT, SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANIES AND EACH OF THEIR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS FROM, ANY CLAIM, LIABILITIES, DAMAGES, INJURY OR DEATH ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO ANY ACT OR OMISSION OF MANUFACTURER OR MERCHANT IN CONNECTION WITH A VOUCHER, THE SERVICES/GOODS PROVIDED IN CONNECTION THEREWITH, OR ANY CLAIM RELATING TO COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE UNCLAIMED PROPERTY, GIFT CARD AND OTHER LAWS RELATING TO THE REDEMPTION OF THE VOUCHERS OR ANY PORTION THEREOF.8. Limitation of Liability/Exclusive RemedyYOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT NEITHER ZIPONGO NOR ITS SUBSIDIARIES, PARENTS, AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, CONTRACTORS, VENDORS OR LICENSORS SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES (EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), RESULTING FROM: (I) YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE VOUCHER OR THE ZIPONGO SITE; OR (II) YOUR USE OR CONSUMPTION OF ANY GOODS OR SERVICES PROVIDED BY AN MERCHANT OR MANUFACTURER.ZIPONGO’S MAXIMUM LIABILITY AND YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY BREACH OF THESE TERMS OF SALE OR ANY CLAIM RELATING TO A VOUCHER OR ANY GOODS OR SERVICES PURCHASED WITH A VOUCHER SHALL IN NO EVENT EXCEED THE GREATER OF THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THE VOUCHER OR ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100). THIS LIMITATION WILL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY.SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF REMEDIES, SO THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.9. NoticesYou agree that Zipongo may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to the Terms of Sale, by email, regular mail, or postings on the Site. In addition, Zipongo may also provide notices of changes to these Terms of Sale or other matters by displaying notices or links to notices to you generally on the Site.10. GeneralA. The Terms of Sale constitute the entire agreement between you and us relating to your use of the Vouchers and govern your use of the Vouchers, superseding any prior agreements between you and Zipongo.B. These Terms of Sale and the relationship between you and us shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any action or proceeding relating to these Terms of Sale must be brought in a federal or state court located in San Francisco, California and each party irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction and venue of any such court in any such action or proceeding, except that: (i) a party bringing an action may choose to resolve the dispute through binding non-appearance-based arbitration in accordance with the following: (a) the arbitration will be provided through a nationally-recognized alternative dispute resolution provider mutually agreed upon by the parties; (b) the arbitration will be conducted in one or more of the following manners at the option of the party initiating arbitration: telephone, online, or written submissions; (c) the arbitration will not involve any personal appearances by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the parties; and (d) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction; and (ii) Zipongo may seek injunctive relief in any court having jurisdiction to protect its intellectual property or confidential or proprietary information.C. Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action by you arising out of or related to use of the Vouchers or these Terms of Sale must be filed within one (1) year after such claim of action arose or be forever barred.D. If any of the provisions in these Terms of Sale are held to be in violation of applicable law or applicable court decision, then such provisions are hereby waived or amended to the extent necessary to achieve the same economic effect for this Agreement to be enforceable in such jurisdiction and the rest of the agreement shall remain in full force and effect.E. Zipongo’s failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Sale shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.F. The Section titles in these Terms of Sale are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.G. These Terms of Sale and the access granted hereunder may not be assigned by you, by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of Zipongo. These Terms of Sale shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the permitted successors and assigns of each party.
