Exhibit (i)(1)  
  September 21, 2007  The 787
Fund, Inc.  1290 Avenue of the Americas  New York, New York
10104  Ladies and Gentlemen:  We have acted as counsel to The
787 Fund, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the “Company”), in connection with the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) of Post-Effective Amendment No. 1 to the Company’s Registration Statement on
Form N-1A (File Nos. 333-141582 and 811-22041) (the “Post-Effective Amendment”), registering an indefinite number of Class A, Class B, Class C and Class Y shares of common stock of the AXA Enterprise Mergers and Acquisitions Fund, a
series of the Company, (the “Shares”) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”).  You have requested our opinion as
to the matters set forth below in connection with the filing of the Post-Effective Amendment. For purposes of rendering that opinion, we have examined the Post-Effective Amendment, the Company’s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, and the
corporate action of the Company that provides for the issuance of the Shares, and we have made such other investigation as we have deemed appropriate. We have examined and relied upon certificates of public officials and, as to certain matters of
fact that are material to our opinions, we have also relied on a certificate of an officer of the Company. In rendering our opinion, we also have made the assumptions that are customary in opinion letters of this kind. We have further assumed that,
as of any date of determination, the number of issued Shares of each class and series will not exceed the number of such shares authorized to be issued under the Company’s Articles of Incorporation. We have not verified any of those
assumptions.  Our opinion, as set forth herein, is based on the facts in existence and the laws in effect on the date hereof and is limited to the federal
laws of the United States of America and the laws of the State of Maryland that, in our experience, generally are applicable to the issuance of shares by entities such as the Company. We express no opinion with respect to any other laws. 
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:   


 
1.
The Shares to be issued pursuant to the Post-Effective Amendment have been duly authorized for issuance by the Company; and   


 
2.
When issued and paid for upon the terms provided in the Post-Effective Amendment, the Shares to be issued pursuant to the Post-Effective Amendment will be validly issued, fully
paid, and nonassessable. 



  The 787 Fund, Inc.  September 21, 2007  Page 2  This opinion is
rendered solely in connection with the filing of the Post-Effective Amendment and supersedes any previous opinions of this firm in connection with the issuance of Shares. We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion with the SEC in connection
with the Post-Effective Amendment and to the reference to this firm in the statement of additional information that is being filed as part of the Post-Effective Amendment. In giving our consent we do not thereby admit that we are in the category of
persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the 1933 Act or the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder.  Very truly yours,  /s/ Kirkpatrick & Lockhart Preston Gates Ellis LLP  Kirkpatrick & Lockhart Preston Gates Ellis LLP

The Morningstar Category is shown next to the Morningstar Style Box which identifies a fund's investment focus, based on the underlying securities in the fund.Morningstar CategoryWhile the investment objective stated in a fund's prospectus may or may not reflect how the fund actually invests, the Morningstar category is assigned based on the underlying securities in each portfolio. Morningstar categories help investors and investment professionals make meaningful comparisons between funds. The categories make it easier to build well-diversified portfolios, assess potential risk, and identify top-performing funds. We place funds in a given category based on their portfolio statistics and compositions over the past three years. If the fund is new and has no portfolio history, we estimate where it will fall before giving it a more permanent category assignment. When necessary, we may change a category assignment based on recent changes to the portfolio.Fund OverviewCategoryMid-Cap BlendFund FamilyGabelliNet Assets167.91MYTD Return2.75%Yield0.00%Morningstar Rating★★Inception DateFeb 27, 2001Fund OperationsLast Dividend0.05Last Cap Gain0.00Holdings Turnover151.00%Average for CategoryN/AFees & ExpensesExpenseEMAAXCategory AverageAnnual Report Expense Ratio (net)1.62%1.11%Prospectus Net Expense Ratio1.72%N/AProspectus Gross Expense Ratio1.72%N/AMax 12b1 Fee0.45%N/AMax Front End Sales Load5.75%5.46%Max Deferred Sales LoadN/A1.63%3 Yr Expense Projection1,086N/A5 Yr Expense Projection1,455N/A10 Yr Expense Projection2,488N/AYahoo Small BusinessData DisclaimerHelpSuggestionsPrivacyAbout Our AdsTerms (Updated)
