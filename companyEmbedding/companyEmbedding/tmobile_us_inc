If you have T-Mobile ONE Plus or T-Mobile ONE Plus International, you can visit a T-Mobile store or call 1-800-T-MOBILE to have a rep help you set up your new DIGITS Talk & Text line.






                                    Is there a limit to how many lines can take advantage of this offer?

                                    Do I need a new phone to use DIGITS?
                                



No. All you need is a compatible device and the DIGITS app. The DIGITS app will run on: 

Any Android device running Lollipop (5.0+) or above. Download the DIGITS app from the Play Store.
Any iOS device running iOS 9 or above. Download the DIGITS app from the Apple App Store.
Any PC or Mac using Chrome or Firefox. Visit https://webdigits.t-mobile.com to log in or download the application.








                                    Can I use my new DIGITS number on a non-T-Mobile device?
                                



Yes. Even if your Android or iOS device is with another carrier, you can make and take calls or send and receive texts using the T-Mobile DIGITS app. Once you’ve downloaded and logged into the app, you can turn on your DIGITS. If the device is not on the T-Mobile network, any data used will decrement from the phone plan with the other carrier.






                                    How do I access and manage my DIGITS?
                                



If you have a T-Mobile number, you can use the T-Mobile DIGITS app on any Android (5.0 +) or iOS (iOS 9 +) device, even if the device is with another carrier.  You can also access DIGITS from any Mac or PC browser by visiting https://webdigits.t-mobile.com on Chrome or Firefox, or download a standalone app.  The US versions of the Samsung Galaxy S6 or newer and the LG 5 or newer already have the DIGITS functionality built in, so you don’t need to download the DIGITS app. For additional support, visit http://www.t-mobile.com/DIGITS. 






                                    Which Samsung smartphones have the DIGITS functionality built in?  And what do I do if I don’t have one of those devices?
                                



There are multiple Samsung smartphones that have the DIGITS functionality built in. They are: Samsung Galaxy S8, Samsung Galaxy S8+, Samsung Galaxy S7, Samsung Galaxy S7 edge, Samsung Galaxy S6, Samsung Galaxy S6 edge, Samsung Galaxy S6 edge +, and the Samsung Note5. Make sure that the device has been updated to the latest software version. If you have any other Android or iOS device, simply download the DIGITS app from the appropriate app store.






                                    How do I get DIGITS set up?
                                



First, you need to unlock the DIGITS function. Open the T-Mobile app and select Usage & Plans. Find the line you want to unlock and select View Line Details. Then, select “unlock” on the DIGITS card. Restart your device, then you can search your settings for “Multi-line settings” and log in with your T-Mobile ID. Once logged in, you will see a list of all lines available to you, which you can turn on and off as needed. For additional support, visit http://www.t-mobile.com/DIGITS. 






                                    How do I share my phone number with other devices, like my desktop, laptop, or tablet?
                                



Simply download the DIGITS app on the device you’d like to share your number with. On PC and Mac, go to https://webdigits.t-mobile.com to log in or download the application.  Then, open the app, log in with your T-Mobile ID, and turn on your line.






                                    My mobile phone number already works on all my Apple devices (iPhone, iPad, Mac). How is this different?
                                



Continuity is restricted to the iOS ecosystem. DIGITS allows calls and texts to work on any device in which you have enabled your DIGITS lines, regardless of the operating system.  If you use Apple devices exclusively, then there’s no need to use the DIGITS app.






                                    Can I call or text 911 with DIGITS?
                                



Yes. But calls and texts to 911 still work best from your landline or primary cell phone number, and without using Wi-Fi. You should always provide your actual location and callback number to the 911 operator, and be aware that if the operator calls you back, the call may be answered by others sharing your DIGITS line. See the DIGITS Terms of Use for additional 911 information.






                                    How have you made sure DIGITS is secure?
                                



DIGITS calls and texts use the same leading level of security and encryption as traditional T-Mobile calls and texts.






                                    I want to use my main phone number but switch between phones such as an iPhone and Android device without swapping my SIM. Can I do this?
                                



Absolutely. There are two ways to do this depending on your needs.
 
If both devices already have their own phone number and data plan then you can access your primary number from either phone any time through the DIGITS app.  Manage all your DIGITS here: https://mydigits.t-mobile.com
 
If you want each phone to simply share the same primary number and you don’t need high-speed data on the second device then you can pair your number with another device for just $10 a month using a Data with Paired DIGITS plan.
 
*Data with Paired DIGITS comes with unlimited data at 512 kbs.
















Limited-time offer; subject to change. Compatible device & qualifying service required. 1 non-DIGITS line required. App download may be required. Without T-Mobile ONE Plus/ONE Plus International, free DIGITS Talk & Text line may increase to $5/mo. (with AutoPay) after 30 days unless you call 611 to cancel. Pricing reflects AutoPay discount; without AutoPay, $5 more/line. Up to 5 numbers per device and up to 5 devices per number. DIGITS supports 911 but calls and texts to 911 work best from your landline or primary cell phone/number and without using Wi-Fi; always provide your actual location and callback number to 911 operator; callback may be answered by others sharing your DIGITS line. See DIGITS Terms of Use for additional 911 information.

Transferring from Sprint, messed up few steps, but Sean was stellar in getting things sorted for me.  Great service.







I came here for my first time to buy a new phone and the guys were so friendly and helpful, specially Xavier and Manuel, thank you guys for your help,
Also I wasted my money before with At&t, sprint, metro pcs, but T-mobile definitely makes me happy..







Eek is right!  I've had poor service before, but this is the first time in my life I've been ACCUSED OF FRAUD by a customer service rep who also refused to help me.

I have been an existing T-Mobile prepaid customer for 1.5 years.  I have a great unlocked phone that's still going strong, and I'm waiting for the next Nexus before signing on to a 2-yr contract.  

I came to this T-Mobile store to convert my existing plan to an international plan since I have some travel coming up.  (I had called the 1-800 #s from a landline, but was disconnected repeatedly).

There were 2 reps in the store.  One said he couldn't convert my account in time for my travel.  I said I had called online and they could do it today, but I kept getting disconnected during the activation process.  The rep said maybe they could do it from the service center, but the store couldn't.

I suspect this is just store policy, but I called from my T-Mobile phone.  Every time I reached a human, I asked for his/her direct line in case I was disconnected.  They would all give me the number for the dept.  I would provide my number, and ask to be called back.

They dropped me repeatedly, but yay!  after sharing far too much personal info, and being transferred between reps, I was approved for service.

So far, I have received no service from the store.  On my way out, I ask one rep: "Excuse me, do you have a rate table for making international calls on the Simple Choice plan?"

"No."

"Maybe you can show me where it is on the website?  I had trouble finding it."

"No.  You should be aware what you're doing is fraudulent."

"Excuse me?"

"You're going on a Simple Choice plan to go abroad and you're just going to cancel it after.  Isn't that fraudulent?"

"No.  I'm waiting for you to offer the Nexus before signing on to a contract.  But even if I were going to switch to another plan at some point, how is that fraudulent?  It's only fraudulent if I say I'm staying with this plan, and then I don't."

"I'm not saying you're fraudulent.  I'm just saying that's fraudulent."

So: No service from the store.  Free & false accusation of fraud thrown in.







Really rude manager who does not know enough about what can be and can not be done at store.  Went there to  buy off a leased phone, paid it off but the manager did not mention anything about unlocking. 

When I went back and requested an unlock all I got was "we can't do that at store. You have to call customer service," when I tried to give feedback that this is a hassle to customers, all I got was "it's a policy." 

And it turns out they can actually put in a request to unlock the phone just like customer service can. I just confirmed that with t-mobile customer service. The guy just did not know/did not want to do it.  And behaved extremely rude refusing to help. 

Who does this? First time such a bad  experience at t-mobile store. Stay away from this store.







Amazing customer service, quick and very friendly. I decided to switch from AT&T to T mobile because they had great offers. You don't have to use your data to play pandora, Netflix and YouTube. The whole process was done so fast and easy, thanks T-mobile!
The employees at this location are so great and friendly and will answer all your questions.







Wow brand new store in Mountain View really nice and clean store! Friendly staff! Since it's a new store there is literally NO wait! T-Mobile rocks!







Super good service. Very knowledgeable staff.  Highly recommend this location. The best wireless experience so far for me.

From the business

Specialties

            We're not like other wireless carriers. We're breaking the old rules of wireless with no annual service contracts, no overages, and no data sharing on America's Fastest 4G LTE Network. This is a consumer revolution and we're just getting started. We're changing the wireless industry, one pain-point at a time. Stuck counting the days until your next phone upgrade? Not with T-Mobile® and JUMP! On Demand®. Get the phone you want, when you want up to three times per year. Mobile Without Borders brings you coverage in three countries for the price of one with unlimited calls, texts, and data in Mexico and Canada at no extra charge. And with Data Stash®, now your unused data rolls forward for up to 12 months and 20 GB. It's your data. Keep it®. So why wait? Make the switch to T-Mobile today. Coverage Think you know T-Mobile's coverage? Think again. In the last year we've doubled our 4G LTE network. Now The Un-Carrier® is covering nearly every American. And our new Extended Range LTE reaches twice as far and is four times better in buildings than before.

T-Mobile US is a major wireless network operator in the United States. The German telecommunications company Deutsche Telekom (DT) is its majority shareholder. Its headquarters are located in Bellevue, Washington, in the Seattle metropolitan area. T-Mobile is the third largest wireless carrier in the United States with 72.6 million customers as of Q1 2017.[2][5]
T-Mobile US provides wireless voice and data services in the United States, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands under the T-Mobile and MetroPCS brands (which it acquired in a reverse takeover in 2013, resulting in the company going public on the NASDAQ stock exchange), and also serves as the host network for many mobile virtual network operators. The company has annual revenues of $37 billion.[2] Its network reaches 98 percent of Americans.[6][7][non-primary source needed] In 2015, Consumer Reports named T-Mobile the number one American wireless carrier.[8] In 2017, T-Mobile was ranked #1 in Customer Service Satisfaction by Nielsen.[9]

History[edit]
T-Mobile US traces its roots to the 1994 establishment of VoiceStream Wireless PCS as a subsidiary of Western Wireless Corporation. Spun off from parent Western Wireless on May 3, 1999, VoiceStream Wireless was purchased by Deutsche Telekom AG in 2001 for $35 billion and renamed T-Mobile USA, Inc. in July, 2002. In 2013, T-Mobile and MetroPCS finalized a merger of the two companies. The two companies began trading as T-Mobile US[10][11][12] [13]
VoiceStream Wireless[edit]
VoiceStream Wireless PCS was established in 1994 as a subsidiary of Western Wireless Corporation to provide digital wireless personal communications services (PCS) in 19 FCC-defined metropolitan service areas in several western and southwestern states.[14] VoiceStream Wireless' digital, urban service areas complemented the analog, rural service areas marketed by Western Wireless under the Cellular One brand.[15]
Western Wireless spun off its VoiceStream Wireless division into a new company called VoiceStream Wireless Corporation in May 1999.[16]
Omnipoint and Aerial acquisitions[edit]
In 2000, VoiceStream Wireless acquired two regional GSM carriers. Omnipoint Corporation, a regional network operator in the Northeastern U.S., was acquired on February 25, 2000. Aerial Communications Inc.; a regional network operator in the Columbus, Houston, Kansas City, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Pittsburgh and Tampa-St. Petersburg-Orlando markets; was acquired on May 4, 2000.[17] The combined company retired the Omnipoint and Aerial brands and completed integrating the three companies by converting to a single customer billing platform, implementing standard business practices and launching the VoiceStream brand and "GET MORE" marketing strategy in all markets.[18]
Deutsche Telekom acquires VoiceStream and Powertel[edit]

On June 1, 2001, Deutsche Telekom (DT) completed the acquisition of VoiceStream Wireless Inc. for $35 billion and Southern U.S. regional GSM network operator Powertel, Inc. for $24 billion. By the end of 2001, VoiceStream Wireless had 19,000 employees serving 7 million subscribers.
On September 2, 2001, VoiceStream Wireless Inc. took the name, T-Mobile USA, Inc. and began rolling out the T-Mobile brand, starting with locations in California and Nevada.[19] T-Mobile USA, Inc. was an operating entity of T-Mobile International AG,[4] before becoming a direct subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom AG.[20]
SunCom acquisition[edit]
On September 17, 2007, the company announced the acquisition of SunCom Wireless Holdings, Inc. for $2.4 billion; the acquisition closed on February 22, 2008. By September 8, 2008, SunCom's operations were integrated with those of the company. The acquisition added SunCom's 1.1 million customers to the company's customer base and expanded the company's network coverage to include southern Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, eastern Tennessee, northeastern Georgia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
Attempted acquisition by AT&T[edit]
Main article: Attempted purchase of T-Mobile USA by AT&T
On March 20, 2011, DT accepted a $39 billion stock and cash purchase offer from AT&T for the company. The acquisition was subject to regulatory approvals, a reverse breakup fee in certain circumstances, and customary regulatory and closing conditions.[11][21][22][23]
If the merger had been completed, AT&T Mobility would have had a customer base of approximately 130 million users, making it the largest wireless carrier in the U.S.[11]
On August 31, 2011, the United States Department of Justice sued to block AT&T's merger with T-Mobile on the grounds that it would "substantially lessen competition" in the wireless market.[24] Further reports indicated that the FCC would likely oppose the merger.[25]
On December 19, 2011, in the face of this heavy resistance from the U.S. government, AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson announced that the company had officially withdrawn its $39 billion bid.[26] In an official statement, Stephenson addressed the continuing spectrum shortage (due to a significant increase in wireless demand), hinting that the company will continue to seek other options to solve the shortage in the short term.[27]
Merger with MetroPCS Communications[edit]
On October 3, 2012, MetroPCS Communications reached an agreement to merge with T-Mobile USA. MetroPCS shareholders would hold a 26% stake in the merged company, which retained the T-Mobile brand. While the merged company was still the fourth largest carrier in the United States (at the time), the acquisition gave T-Mobile access to more spectrum and financial resources to maintain competitiveness and expand its LTE network.[28] The merger between T-Mobile USA Inc. and MetroPCS was officially approved by MetroPCS shareholders on April 24, 2013. The deal was structured as a reverse takeover; the combined company went public on the New York Stock Exchange as TMUS and became known as T-Mobile US, Inc., on May 1, 2013.[29] The merger agreement gave Deutsche Telekom the option to sell its 72% stake in the merged company, valued at around $14.2 billion, to a third party before the end of the 18-month lock-up period.[30]
The "Un-carrier", additional wireless spectrum acquisition[edit]
In March 2013, T-Mobile introduced a major overhaul of its plan structure, marketed by branding themselves as being "the Un-carrier". Among the changes, a new contract-free pricing structure with simpler plans were introduced, in which a phone's cost is paid over a two-year financing plan.[31] The "Un-carrier" strategy has since been expanded to encompass other value-added services, such as a plan add-on allowing phone trade-ins for early upgrades twice per year,[32] carrying over unused data allotments for up to a year,[33] and zero-rating of selected music and video services (the latter locked to "DVD quality") over the mobile network,[34][35] These moves came as part of an effort under new CEO John Legere to help revitalize the business as it improves its network quality.[31]
On June 28, 2013, T-Mobile agreed to buy wireless spectrum for the Mississippi Valley region from competitor U.S. Cellular for around $308 million, allowing the company to expand its 4G network across a further 29 markets.[36]
On January 6, 2014, T-Mobile signed agreements with Verizon Wireless to purchase some 700 MHz A-Block spectrum licenses for $2.365 billion. Further, a transfer of some AWS and PCS spectrum licenses with a value of $950 million has been agreed upon by T-Mobile and Verizon. The acquisition reportedly gave T-Mobile additional coverage for approximately 158 million people in 9 of the top 10 and 21 of the top 30 U.S. markets.[37]
Attempted acquisition by Sprint[edit]
In December 2013, multiple reports indicated that Sprint Corporation and its parent company Softbank were working towards a deal to acquire a majority stake in T-Mobile for at least US$20 billion. The proposed merger, which would result in the country's major national carriers being controlled by only three companies, would further bolster T-Mobile's position in the overall market.[38][39][40] Members of the government were skeptical that such an acquisition would be approved by regulators, citing antitrust concerns and an explicit goal by FCC chairman Tom Wheeler to maintain four national carriers in the United States.[41][42] On April 30, 2014, Bloomberg reported that Sprint was in talks with its lenders to ensure that the company would be financially prepared for the bid, now valued at $24 billion and planned for "summer 2014". It was also reported that due to his success within the company, current T-Mobile CEO John Legere was the top contender to be named CEO of a merged Sprint/T-Mobile, and that Sprint had insisted on a low termination fee to prevent regulators from being given an incentive to block the deal, as had occurred with AT&T's failed attempt to purchase T-Mobile.[43]
On August 1, 2014, Xavier Niel's Iliad SA publicly announced a US$16 billion all-cash counter-bid to acquire a 56% stake in T-Mobile US, which would be funded using equity and debt. Iliad is the parent company of French carrier Free Mobile, which had—similarly to T-Mobile, performed disruptive business moves to undercut its competitors, triggering a "price war" among them upon its launch in 2012. Credit Suisse analysts felt that the bid would not be "attractive" to the company's current shareholders due to its lower value in comparison to Sprint's bid, but could "put pressure on Sprint to move sooner rather [than] later."[44][45]
On August 4, 2014, Bloomberg reported that Sprint had abandoned its bid to acquire T-Mobile, considering the unlikelihood that such a deal would be approved by the U.S. government and its regulators.[46]
On February 17, 2017, it was reported by Reuters that Softbank was considering selling its majority share in Sprint to Deutsche Telekom (an effective reversal of the original deal), citing struggling growth in the U.S. market, and a higher likelihood that the deal would be approved by the Trump administration.[47]
Wireless networks[edit]
The company owns licenses to operate a cellular communications network in the 1900 MHz (PCS) and 1700 MHz (AWS) bands with coverage in many parts of the continental U.S., Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, as well as licenses in the 700 MHz (block A) band available in certain parts of the country. With respect to technology, depending on the location, in the 1900 MHz band it deploys GSM, UMTS/HSPA+, and/or LTE (B2); in the 1700 MHz band it deploys UMTS/HSPA+ and/or LTE (B4); and LTE (B12) only in the 700A band. Its LTE network also supports VoLTE. It provides coverage in areas where it does not own radio frequency spectrum licenses via roaming agreements with other operators of compatible networks.
Cellular network[edit]
The company's predecessor, VoiceStream Wireless, began building a regional, 2G, 1900 MHz GSM, circuit switched, digital cellular network in 1994 and first offered service in 1996 in Honolulu and Salt Lake City. From that starting point, the network has expanded in size through acquisitions of other cellular-network operators and additional spectrum purchases. The network has also expanded in capabilities through the introduction of new technologies. VoiceStream upgraded the 1900 MHz network to include packet switching via General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), then increased packet switched data transmission speeds via Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution. In 2006, the company spent $4.2 billion to purchase 120 D, E or F block 1700 MHz AWS licenses[48] and began rolling out 3G UMTS services in those frequency bands. The company upgraded network equipment and back-haul capabilities to enable HSPA (High Speed Packet Access), and later HSPA+ and LTE services.

Packet-switched data upgrade[edit]
Packet-switched data service first became available to users in the form of General Packet Radio Service (GPRS). Packet-switched data speeds increased when Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE) was incorporated into the network. EDGE coverage was available within at least forty percent of the GSM footprint.[49]
Both voice capacity and packet-switched data speeds improved when 3G Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) equipment was installed in the network. On January 5, 2010, the company announced that it had upgraded its entire 3G network to HSPA 7.2 Mbit/s, an improvement from its previous peak of 3.6 Mbit/s. It also said that it planned to be the first U.S. carrier to deploy HSPA+ across its network by mid-2010. The company had finished HSPA+ trials in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and had begun deploying HSPA+ across its network.
3G upgrade / discontinuation[edit]
In September 2006, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) auctioned licenses in the first Advanced Wireless Services band. This band was an area of wireless spectrum, half in the 1700 MHz (1.7 GHz) and half in the 2100 MHz (2.1 GHz) frequencies, that was already in use by government services. The spectrum was planned to become available after the government users migrated to different frequencies.
The auction made numerous licenses available in overlapping market-areas, economic-areas, and regional levels. Each license was individually bid upon, and T-Mobile USA was the winner in 120 license auctions, at an aggregate price of $4.18 billion. As part of its winnings, T-Mobile USA gained nationwide coverage of 1.7 GHz and 2.1 GHz, with numerous areas being supplemented with additional licenses. Examples include New York City, Chicago, and Boston where T-Mobile USA acquired one-third (33 percent) of the available spectrum, or San Francisco, Houston, and Miami where they acquired 45 percent of the available spectrum.[50]
October 6, 2006, two weeks after confirming its winning bids, the company announced its intentions to create a UMTS third-generation, or 3G, cellular network with the spectrum it had won. It said it would utilize and build on the experience of T-Mobile International's European subsidiaries, which already implemented 3G networks. At the time of initial roll-out, the company intended to offer 7.2 Mbit/s service, making the company's 3G network the fastest in the U.S. The upgrade was forecast to cost $2.6 billion, in addition to the $4.12 billion spent to acquire the spectrum licenses.[51]
In the same announcement, the company indicated it had already begun to deploy about half of the upgraded equipment, beginning in major markets such as New York City. With the equipment in place, it would be able to activate its network as soon as the government agencies vacated the spectrum. The company had hoped to have its network activated by mid-2007, but as of September 2007, the government users had not vacated the AWS band.[51]
The company began selling its first 3G-capable phone, the Nokia 6263, in November 2007 and announced in February 2008 that its 3G network would finally be activated "within the next few months".[52][53] and released in the New York City market on May 1, 2008.[54]
By 2009, the company had launched its 3G network in more than 200 markets, covering some 208 million points of presence (POPS).[55] Throughout 2015, T-Mobile began refarming UMTS/HSPA services from the original AWS band to their PCS band to expand bandwidth available for LTE. This rendered a select number of T-Mobile 3G devices inoperable on the 3G network.[56]
HSPA/HSPA+ upgrade[edit]
On June 28, 2010, the company announced that it would begin to upgrade its network from HSPA+ 21 to HSPA+ 42 beginning sometime in 2011.[57] T-Mobile marketed HSPA+ services as 4G.[58]
4G LTE upgrade[edit]
On February 23, 2012, during the Q4 Earnings Call, T-Mobile laid out the future of their 4G upgrade path. They would roll out the LTE network on the AWS spectrum, and transition their HSPA+ network to the PCS band. To achieve compatibility with other networks and phones in the USA, T-Mobile began this transition in March 2013, and the rollout of LTE is currently underway as T-Mobile expands to more markets.[59] Due to the failed acquisition of T-Mobile USA by AT&T, T-Mobile USA received additional UMTS frequency band IV (AWS) spectrum. On March 26, 2013, T-Mobile began rolling out LTE in 7 markets: Baltimore, San Jose, Washington, D.C., Phoenix, Las Vegas, Kansas City, and Houston.[60]
On August 21, 2012, the FCC approved a deal between T-Mobile and Verizon in which T-Mobile gained additional AWS spectrum licenses in 125 Cellular Market Areas.[61]
On February 25, 2014, T-Mobile announced in their Q4 2013 earnings call that their 4G LTE network covered 209 million people in 273 metro areas. They also planned to start rolling out their 700 MHz A-Block spectrum by the end of 2014, which by the end of the roll out would cover 158 million people. This spectrum led to improved LTE coverage overall in these areas, particularly indoors.[62]
On March 13, 2014, T-Mobile announced a new plan to upgrade its entire 2G/EDGE network to 4G LTE. They expected 50% to be done by the end of 2014, and it to be "substantially complete" by the middle of 2015.[63]
On December 16, 2014, T-Mobile announced during CEO John Legere's Un-carrier 8.0 interview that their 4G LTE network covered 260 million people and their 700 MHz Band 12 LTE had been rolled out in Cleveland, Colorado Springs, Minneapolis, and Washington, D.C. They expected to cover 280 million with LTE by mid-2015 and 300 million by the end of 2015. They also stated that they covered 121 metro areas with their Wideband LTE.[64]
On October 27, 2015, T-Mobile announced in its Q3 2015 earnings call that they covered over 300 million people with LTE, reaching their 2015 end of year goal months ahead of schedule. They had 245 markets with Wideband (at least 15+15 MHz) LTE. They also had 204 markets with Extended Range 700 MHz Band 12 LTE covering around 175 million people. Their coverage map revealed that they now had new native LTE coverage in Montana, the Dakotas, Eastern West Virginia, and Northern Michigan.[65]
On May 25, 2016 T-Mobile announced that it will be purchasing the 700Mhz A-block license (LTE band 12) for the Chicago metro area. When this transaction closes, together with several other pending 700Mhz license acquisitions, T-Mobile expects to possess 700Mhz licenses covering a total of 272 million people, or 84% of the US population – including 10 of the top 10 largest US metro areas. T-Mobile refers to its 700Mhz low-band network as 'Extended-range LTE' and claims it penetrates buildings and reaches out farther than its PCS and AWS only network.[66] In September 2016, T-Mobile launched 4x4 MIMO and 3 channel carrier aggregation allowing theoretical speeds of 400 Mbit/s, and also announced that the company's LTE network reaches over 312 million potential subscribers.[67]
Roaming[edit]
T-Mobile has roaming arrangements with a number of national and regional mobile network operators, including AT&T Mobility.
As of 2008, prepaid customers have almost all of the postpaid domestic roaming privileges and restricted international roaming to Canada and Mexico.[68]
On June 29, 2010, the company launched voice service in the Gulf of Mexico on GSM via roaming agreement through Broadpoint. T-Mobile USA was scheduled to launch data service in Fall 2010.[69]
In 2009, T-Mobile USA began removing AT&T Mobility roaming coverage in many locations across the country, and updated its on-line coverage maps[70][71] to reflect the smaller coverage area. AT&T Mobility roaming remains available in select locations, primarily on smaller carriers that were acquired by AT&T Mobility after long-term roaming contracts were in place between T-Mobile and the smaller carriers, including Centennial Wireless and Edge Wireless.
On October 9, 2013, T-Mobile announced Simple Global, a service included with eligible Simple Choice plans. This service allows one to roam in over 100 countries with unlimited text and speed-limited data, and make calls at $0.20/minute. High-speed data passes will be available for purchase.[72] On March 7, 2014, T-Mobile announced this number will be increasing to 122 countries.[73] If one is connected to WiFi in one of these countries, and their phone supports WiFi calling, all calls and texts to and from the USA are free, and work the same as if they were on the cellular network.[74]
On July 15, 2015, T-Mobile announced Mobile Without Borders, a service included with all new T-Mobile plans and available as an add-on to grandfathered or promotional plans for $10. This service allows the user to use their normal voice, text message, and data allotments while roaming in Mexico and Canada. Most T-Mobile services are available while roaming, with the notable exception of using the data in one's Data Stash.
In August 2015, T-Mobile joined the Competitive Carriers Association's Data Services Hub, enabling the company to expand roaming partnerships with over a dozen rural and regional carriers. Smaller carriers will now be able to access T-Mobile's LTE network for roaming and T-Mobile will be able to expand roaming partnerships and extend its footprint with members whose network technologies had previously been incompatible.[75]

T-Mobile HotSpots[edit]
T-Mobile has used the term "Hotspot" to represent various products and technologies.
Wi-Fi network (public)[edit]
The company operates a nationwide Wi-Fi Internet access network under the T-Mobile HotSpots brand. The T-Mobile HotSpots network consists of thousands of Wi-Fi access points installed in businesses, hotels and airports throughout the U.S.
The T-Mobile HotSpot service offers access to a nationwide network of approximately 8,350 access points, installed in venues such as Starbucks coffeehouses, FedEx Office Office and Print Centers, Hyatt hotels and resorts, Red Roof Inns, Sofitel hotels, Novotel hotels, the airline clubs of American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and US Airways, and airports.[86]
The T-Mobile HotSpots network can be traced to the company's 2002 purchase of bankrupt wireless ISP MobileStar, which began building its network in 1998. After completing the purchase, the company expanded the network into 400 Borders bookstores, as well as 100 of the most-frequented airport clubs and lounges operated by American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and United Airlines.[87][88]
On September 14, 2014, T-Mobile partnered up with GoGo to provide free texting on airplanes for its customers. GoGo services are provided on Delta Airlines, American Airlines, United Airlines, US Airways, Virgin America and Alaska Airlines.[89]
On June 6, 2016, T-Mobile expanded its partnership with GoGo to offer T-Mobile users one hour of free WiFi on customers phones. T-Mobile also included other messaging apps (iMessage, Google Hangouts, WhatsApp and Viber) in addition to SMS texting being provided since September 2014.[90]
Wi-Fi network (private)[edit]
T-Mobile has also used the term to describe Wi-Fi Access Points that it sold to end users to expand their cell phone network to phones equipped to also receive Wi-Fi using a VOIP-like technology. (The models included at least two by Linksys: the WRTU54G-TM and the WRT54G-TM and one by D-Link: the TM-G5240.)
Products and services[edit]
T-Mobile ONE[edit]
In August 2016, T-Mobile introduced T-Mobile ONE. It will be the only rate plan offered in the future, with plans to gradually phase out Simple Choice.[91] It combines unlimited voice minutes, text messaging, and high-speed data (the top 3% of users—currently 32 GB/month—may be deprioritized under congested conditions), replacing Binge On, Music Freedom, and Data Stash. Video streaming is limited to 1.5 Mbps, allowing 480p resolution in most cases, and mobile hotspot (tethering) is limited to 3G speeds. The $10/line/month ONE Plus add-on allows HD streaming and adds 10 GB of mobile hotspot at 4G LTE speeds; the $25/line/month ONE Plus International additionally provides international calling and texting and unlimited mobile hotspot at 4G LTE speeds. Subscribers who do not enable auto-pay are charged a $5/line/month fee; otherwise, as of January 22, 2017, all taxes and regulatory fees are included in the plan cost.[92][93] The plan has been criticized by the Electronic Frontier Foundation and others for potentially violating net neutrality rules and making previously-included features paid extras.[94][95][96] Subscribers on Simple Choice can keep their current plans.[91]
In response to Verizon launching their new Verizon Unlimited Plan, T-Mobile revised their T-Mobile ONE plan to include High Definition (1080p) video streaming and 10 GB of High Speed Mobile Hot Spot data (to be slowed to 3G speeds after using the allowance). Also, their prioritization threshold was raised to 32 GB.
Simple Choice[edit]
In March 2013, T-Mobile introduced a new streamlined plan structure known as Simple Choice for new customers. This is part of an initiative called Un-carrier which drops contracts, subsidized phones, overage fees for data, and early termination fees.[31]
Capping unlimited data users[edit]
On August 31, 2015, T-Mobile announced it will ask users who abuse its unlimited on-smartphone data plan by violating T-Mobile's Terms & Conditions regarding tethering (which like unlimited on-smartphone data, remains unlimited, however, offers a 14 GB high speed allotment before deprioritizing takes effect), by permanently removing user access to unlimited plans and migrating users to a tiered data plan. By doing so, all plans after a select amount of inclusive high-speed data, result in automatic throttled speeds, preventing unlimited high-speed tethering use and abuse of the network. T-Mobile stated that there are a small handful of users who abuse the tethering plan by altering device software and/or the use of an Android app that masks T-Mobile's ability monitoring whether data is on-smartphone, or through smartphone mobile hotspot (tethering) by mimicking all data as on-smartphone use, with some customers abusing the service by using as much as 2 TB per month, causing speed issues for all other customers.[97]
InReach program[edit]
The InReach program[98] provides a free cell phone and a limited number of voice minutes each month for low-income-eligible families (one per family) who do not use Lifeline services offered by any other phone or wireless company. It is funded through the Universal Service Fund,[99] but is only operational in a limited number of states and Puerto Rico.[100]
MetroPCS[edit]
Main article: MetroPCS
MetroPCS was taken over by T-Mobile in 2013, the new company formed T-Mobile US and currently continues to offer prepaid wireless services under the MetroPCS brand.
GoSmart Mobile[edit]
GoSmart Mobile was a T-Mobile branded service that launched in beta on December 7, 2012, and became officially available nationwide on February 19, 2013.[101] GoSmart offered no-contract SIM wireless services. GoSmart Mobile was sold to consumers through dealers who worked as independent contractors under their own company name. Such sellers are known as "Authorized Dealers" with either physical or online stores. In September 2016, T-Mobile sold the brand and 326,000 GoSmart Mobile customers to TracFone Wireless.[102] The customers were reclassified as wholesale subscribers.[103]
Banking Cards[edit]
On January 22, 2014, T-Mobile announced that it would expand its products into banking. T-Mobile would provide Visa card with banking features and a smartphone money management application with reduced-fee or zero-cost services for T-Mobile wireless customers. In addition, customers would have access to over 42,000 ATMs with no fees.[104]
In early 2016 T-mobile decided to discontinue the banking cards. They can no longer be purchased at T-Mobile.
Customer service[edit]

T-Mobile Store in Hartford, CT


Awards[edit]
From as early as 2004, the company has captured multiple J. D. Power annual awards in the areas of retail sales satisfaction, wireless customer care, and overall customer satisfaction.[4] In 2011, J. D. Power and Associates stated that T-Mobile retail stores achieved the highest ratings among major wireless carriers for customer satisfaction for the fourth consecutive year, performing particularly well in price and promotions.[105] Also in 2011, J. D. Power and Associates ranked T-Mobile USA highest among major providers in wireless customer care for the second consecutive year.[106]
On December 3, 2015, Consumer Reports named T-Mobile the number one American wireless service provider. The results combine data from customer service, voice quality, text messaging services, and data speeds.[8]
On February 6, 2016, T-Mobile was awarded the JD Power Award for customer satisfaction in the full service wireless category for the second year in a row. T-Mobile received the highest score ever in the wireless industry.[107]
Outages[edit]
Sidekick data outage[edit]
Main article: Microsoft data loss 2009
On October 1, 2009, Sidekick users lost all data functionality and some users also experienced personal data loss including contacts, notes, and calendars. On October 8, most data services were restored to some users but the company and Microsoft announced on October 10 that data "almost certainly has been lost as a result of a server failure at Microsoft/Danger."[108] On October 15, Microsoft said it had been able to recover most or all data and would begin to restore it.[109][110] A few weeks later, all Sidekick customers were able to recover their data via Danger's sync website using a restore file, or had the option to wait until data was restored to the device itself. Due to this outage, many users abandoned the Sidekick for another device, or left T-Mobile USA for another carrier entirely.[citation needed]
Network outage[edit]
On November 9, 2009, the company's subscribers lost the ability to send and receive calls and text messages.[111] The company confirmed the outage via Twitter and later stated that five percent of its user base had been affected. It blamed a software error for the service interruption, stating that a backend system software error had generated abnormal congestion on the network. The root cause was determined and steps were taken to update a patch on the backend as a permanent resolution.[112]
On February 13 and March 25, 2015, T-Mobile suffered LTE outages along the east coast causing users to lose data connections.[citation needed]
Marketing[edit]
Jamie Lee Curtis was the spokesperson for T-Mobile USA's predecessor, VoiceStream Wireless, since 1998. VoiceStream's advertising slogan was: "Get more from life". During the transition to the T-Mobile brand, Jamie Lee Curtis continued as spokesperson for a short time and the slogan was changed to "T-Mobile. Get More."
Starting in 2002, the company's spokesperson was Catherine Zeta-Jones who was the main figure in its branding strategy. As of September 2006, Zeta-Jones had officially been dropped as the "face" of the company for its advertising campaigns due to a corporate rebranding strategy.[113] The company also relied on rapper Snoop Dogg as the spokesperson for its T-Mobile Sidekick in a series of commercials late in 2004, the company also released a series of Sidekick phones known as the D-Wade Edition for basketball player Dwyane Wade.
The company is also an official sponsor of the Major League Baseball, National Basketball Association, the NBA Rookie Challenge and the Women's National Basketball Association.
In 2009, it changed its approach to advertising, and moved from the "Get More" slogan to a "Stick Together" slogan to focus more on the personal aspect of staying together with those who matter the most to its customers.[citation needed] The slogan was also meant to promote its MyFaves calling-circle plan. With this the company also ended its relationship with Zeta-Jones, and now use mainly non-celebrity spokespeople (though Dwyane Wade, Charles Barkley, and Dwight Howard are featured in some commercials, in association with the company's sponsorship of the NBA as official wireless provider).
In late May 2009, Zeta-Jones was brought back as a company spokesperson to show customers how to pay less for their wireless plan in a new "Mobile Makeovers" advertising campaign that refers customer to third-party comparison site BillShrink.com.[114][115]
In late 2009, commercials for the T-Mobile MyTouch 3G featured the song "If You Want to Sing Out, Sing Out" by Cat Stevens[116] and celebrities such as Chevy Chase, Molly Shannon, Dana Carvey and Darrell Hammond.[117] Another commercial with the same song performed by a different artist showed Wyclef Jean, Avril Lavigne and Brad Paisley.[118]
Carly Foulkes is the spokeswoman for the myTouch 4G in commercials that parody the Get a Mac campaign. The model is known for Rugby Ralph Lauren ads.[119][120][121] Although Foulkes is often identified with the color pink, T-Mobile actually has a color trademark for the color magenta,[122] and markets itself using its corporate colors.[123][124] Virgin Mobile has, in turn, parodied the Carly Foulkes ads.[125]
In September 2010, the company launched "Kids are free till 2012" for family lines.
On December 1, 2011, a group of 100 Chicago-area women, along with Carly Foulkes, were featured in a flash-mob style performance at Woodfield Mall in Schaumburg, Illinois, where the group, dressed in magenta dresses, sang and danced through the mall's atrium to their cover of (There's No Place Like) Home for the Holidays. The performance was filmed and edited into a holiday commercial, which was a success.
Un-carrier movement[edit]
Starting in 2013, T-Mobile launched the Un-carrier marketing campaign. This movement introduced a slew of new tactics to offer consumers cheaper rate plans, cheaper global coverage, and several other benefits. T-Mobile CEO John Legere laid out an 'Un-Carrier manifesto' highlighting the approach and goals he wanted the company to pursue. One popular Un-carrier move features T-Mobile Tuesdays, where customers are offered a variety of free products and also able to win prizes.[126][127] The most recent Un-carrier campaign is titled 'T-Mobile One'. This is a new family plan offering, replacing all previous plans and is an all inclusive unlimited plan, giving unlimited talk, text and data. The only caveat being video streaming on any device is limited to 480p resolution.[128] CEO John Legere in an interview said "The biggest pain point that a million customers told me about is that they hate data buckets. And we had such success with Binge On that we wanted to turn our company into somebody that's selling a monthly subscription to the internet, all in, unlimited." [129] As of October 7, 2016, about a quarter of the overall account numbers have moved over to T-Mobile One, and about three quarters of new postpaid accounts are activating on T-Mobile One.
Labor relations[edit]
T-Mobile US employees and two labor unions have led multiple unionization attempts beginning as early as 2001.
Formation of TU[edit]
Hundreds of T-Mobile employees, with the backing of the Communications Workers of America (CWA) and the German union ver.di, have joined together as TU to gain representation at T-Mobile.[130] In July, 2011, technicians in Connecticut, voted for representation by the Communications Workers of America-TU.[131] On September 25, 2013, MetroPCS workers in Harlem, NY, voted for a union voice and representation by CWA-TU.[132]
2009 coordinated organizing effort[edit]




CWA President Larry Cohen and a disguised, unidentified T-Mobile USA employee pictured at a 2009 press conference announcing a coordinated unionizing effort.


In 2008, the CWA and ver.di launched a coordinated effort to unionize company employees. A spokesman for the CWA called on the company to stop resisting mobilization efforts and allow company employees to unionize as German employees of T-Mobile USA's parent company, DT, have done. In response, the company released an employee satisfaction study showing that more than seventy percent of the company's 40,000 workers were "very satisfied" with their jobs. Through a spokesman, the company stated, "Despite the Communication Workers of America's periodic organizing efforts for more than nine years, no group of T-Mobile employees has ever chosen to be represented by a union. While our company is always striving to find ways to improve, year after year, employees continue to view T-Mobile as a good place to work where they have no need for, or interest in, a union."[131]
Political pressure[edit]
In 2009, a number of politicians, in one case acting after lobbying efforts by CWA union activists, wrote letters to René Obermann, DT's chief executive officer, in an effort to influence T-Mobile USA's labor practices in the U.S.[133]
In a March 13, 2009, letter, U.S. Senator John Kerry (D-MA) asked "why the company's approach to labor rights are different in Germany than in the United States". In an April 30, 2010, letter sent after lobbying by Communications Workers of America activists, 26 Democratic members of Congress called on DT to protect and respect workers' rights in the U.S.[133] A separate July 1, 2010, letter from seven Republicans addressed the same issue.[134][135] On August 10, 2010, U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) released a statement in support of the worker's efforts to organize a union at the company.[136] In a letter, dated September 21, 2010, fifteen Californian Members of Congress urged Obermann to take action and implement fair and equitable labor relations.[citation needed]
In a November 5, 2009, letter, Thomas DiNapoli, New York State Comptroller and Trustee of the New York State Common Retirement Fund, stated concerns about "the potential impact on the value of T-Mobile that may result from a disenfranchised workforce and the associated negative publicity that may impact T-Mobile's profitability."[citation needed]
Reports[edit]




A Cover image of a report written by John Logan and published in 2009 by American Rights at Work


On December 9, 2009, the non-profit organization American Rights at Work published a report written by Prof. John Logan, Director of Labor Studies at San Francisco State University, titled "Lowering the Bar or Setting the Standard? Deutsche Telekom's U.S. Labor Practices". The report details behavior by the company that the author perceives as anti-union including dissemination of anti-union materials, intimidation and threats directed at pro-union workers, "captive audience meetings" and the retention of anti-union specialists.[137] In the report, which is based on documents from the National Labor Relations Board, internal company memos and handbooks, and interviews with workers, Logan asserts that the company engaged in a systematic campaign to prevent employees from forming a union and that DT was guilty of operating by a double standard. He claims that Deutsche Telekom respects workers' rights in Germany, where it cooperates closely with unions, but mistreats workers in the United States and interferes with their right to organize.[clarification needed][138]
On September 2, 2010, Human Rights Watch released a report written by Lance Compa titled "A Strange Case: Violations of Workers' Freedom of Association in the United States by European Multinational Corporations". The report concludes that "company policy has translated into practices that leave the workforce fearful about even seeking union representation."[139] DT proclaims its adherence to international labor law and standards that are embodied in German domestic laws. But HRW found that "T-Mobile USA's harsh opposition to workers' freedom of association in the United States betrays Deutsche Telekom's purported commitment to social responsibility, impedes constructive dialogue with employee representatives, and in several cases, has violated ILO and OECD labor and human rights standards".[140]
Workplace activities[edit]
At the company's Allentown, Pennsylvania, call center, security guards were ordered by company managers to write up incident reports whenever union supporters appeared on nearby public grounds and to record the license plate numbers of employees who stopped to take leaflets. In 2006, the National Labor Relations Board found that these activities violated Section 8(a)(1) of the National Labor Relations Act.[141]
In 2008, company management in the Pacific Northwest and Southwest Retail Divisions sent a memorandum to store managers instructing them to immediately report any union activity to their supervisors.[142] Human Rights Watch states, "The NLRB has long held that such activity interferes with, restrains, and coerces employees in the exercise of Section 7 rights in violation of workers' right to freedom of association."[143]
Information Security[edit]
Nicolas Jacobsen was charged with intruding into the company's internal network in January 2005.[144] Reports indicated that for about a year Jacobsen had access to customer passwords, e-mail, address books, Social Security numbers, birth dates, and Sidekick photos. Affected customers included members of the United States Secret Service. Secret Service informant identified Jacobsen as part of "Operation Firewall" which provided evidence that Jacobsen had attempted to sell customer information to others for identity theft. T-Mobile USA and the Secret Service did not elaborate on the methods Jacobsen used to gain access but sources close to the case indicated that Jacobsen exploited an unpatched flaw in the Oracle WebLogic Server application software used by the company.[145] Additional SQL injection vulnerabilities with the company's web site were reported by Jack Koziol of the InfoSec Institute.[146]
T-Mobile offers access to voice mail without the input of a password by default. Parties acting in bad faith may be able to access such voice mailboxes via Caller ID spoofing. To avoid this possibility, T-Mobile recommends that all customers password protect their mailboxes, but still offers the no password configuration by default due to customer demand.[147]
On June 6, 2009, a message posted from an email account "pwnmobile_at_Safe-mail.net" to the Full Disclosure mailing list claimed that the company's network had been breached and showed sample data. The sender offered "databases, confidential documents, scripts and programs from their servers, financial documents up to 2009" to the highest bidder.[148][149] On June 9, the company issued a statement confirming the breach but stating that customer data was safe. It claimed to have identified the source document for the sample data and believe it was not obtained by hacking.[150] A later statement claimed that there was not any evidence of a breach.[151]
Privacy and surveillance[edit]
T-Mobile USA received a portion of the 1.3 million largely warrantless law enforcement requests for subscriber information (including text messages and phone location data) made in 2011, but refused to state how many requests it received.[152] It did say that in the last decade, the number of requests have increased by 12 to 16 percent annually.[153]
Data retention policies[edit]
According to T-Mobile's privacy policy highlights, "Retention and Disposal", information is retained for as long as there is business or tax need or as applicable laws, regulations, or government orders require. T-Mobile notes that it disposes of Personal Information, uses reasonable procedures designed to erase or render it unreadable (for example, shredding documents and wiping electronic media).[154]
In 2010, the Department of Justice (DOJ) released a document entitled, "Retention Periods of Major Cellular Providers," to advise law enforcement agents seeking to obtain cell phone records. This document was uncovered by the ACLU's coordinated records request on cell phone location tracking by police. Notably, the document showed that T-Mobile subscriber information was retained for 5 years and call detail records were kept for 2 years (prepaid) and 5 years (postpaid).[155]
In 2013, Massachusetts Sen. Edward Markey revealed responses from the top four U.S. wireless providers as well as U.S. Cellular, C Spire, and Cricket/Leap Wireless, to his inquiry regarding user information disclosed to law enforcement officials. The following was T-Mobile's response regarding data retention: T-Mobile US retains customers' historic cell site information and cell tower dump information (180 days); call details records (7–10 years); text message content, data requests, and geo-location data not stored; voicemail content (up to 21 days); subscriber information (6 years after account is closed).[156]
Comparing the 2010 DOJ memo released by the ACLU and Massachusetts Senator Edward Markey's 2013 wireless data retention disclosures, it should be noted that T-Mobile increased the retention period for subscriber information from 5 years to 6 years. T-Mobile also increased its call detail record retention from 2 years (prepaid) and 5 years (postpaid) to 7–10 years.

T-Mobile US is a major wireless network operator in the United States. The German telecommunications company Deutsche Telekom (DT) is its majority shareholder. Its headquarters are located in Bellevue, Washington, in the Seattle metropolitan area. T-Mobile is the third largest wireless carrier in the United States with 72.6 million customers as of Q1 2017.[2][5]
T-Mobile US provides wireless voice and data services in the United States, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands under the T-Mobile and MetroPCS brands (which it acquired in a reverse takeover in 2013, resulting in the company going public on the NASDAQ stock exchange), and also serves as the host network for many mobile virtual network operators. The company has annual revenues of $37 billion.[2] Its network reaches 98 percent of Americans.[6][7][non-primary source needed] In 2015, Consumer Reports named T-Mobile the number one American wireless carrier.[8] In 2017, T-Mobile was ranked #1 in Customer Service Satisfaction by Nielsen.[9]

History[edit]
T-Mobile US traces its roots to the 1994 establishment of VoiceStream Wireless PCS as a subsidiary of Western Wireless Corporation. Spun off from parent Western Wireless on May 3, 1999, VoiceStream Wireless was purchased by Deutsche Telekom AG in 2001 for $35 billion and renamed T-Mobile USA, Inc. in July, 2002. In 2013, T-Mobile and MetroPCS finalized a merger of the two companies. The two companies began trading as T-Mobile US[10][11][12] [13]
VoiceStream Wireless[edit]
VoiceStream Wireless PCS was established in 1994 as a subsidiary of Western Wireless Corporation to provide digital wireless personal communications services (PCS) in 19 FCC-defined metropolitan service areas in several western and southwestern states.[14] VoiceStream Wireless' digital, urban service areas complemented the analog, rural service areas marketed by Western Wireless under the Cellular One brand.[15]
Western Wireless spun off its VoiceStream Wireless division into a new company called VoiceStream Wireless Corporation in May 1999.[16]
Omnipoint and Aerial acquisitions[edit]
In 2000, VoiceStream Wireless acquired two regional GSM carriers. Omnipoint Corporation, a regional network operator in the Northeastern U.S., was acquired on February 25, 2000. Aerial Communications Inc.; a regional network operator in the Columbus, Houston, Kansas City, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Pittsburgh and Tampa-St. Petersburg-Orlando markets; was acquired on May 4, 2000.[17] The combined company retired the Omnipoint and Aerial brands and completed integrating the three companies by converting to a single customer billing platform, implementing standard business practices and launching the VoiceStream brand and "GET MORE" marketing strategy in all markets.[18]
Deutsche Telekom acquires VoiceStream and Powertel[edit]

On June 1, 2001, Deutsche Telekom (DT) completed the acquisition of VoiceStream Wireless Inc. for $35 billion and Southern U.S. regional GSM network operator Powertel, Inc. for $24 billion. By the end of 2001, VoiceStream Wireless had 19,000 employees serving 7 million subscribers.
On September 2, 2001, VoiceStream Wireless Inc. took the name, T-Mobile USA, Inc. and began rolling out the T-Mobile brand, starting with locations in California and Nevada.[19] T-Mobile USA, Inc. was an operating entity of T-Mobile International AG,[4] before becoming a direct subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom AG.[20]
SunCom acquisition[edit]
On September 17, 2007, the company announced the acquisition of SunCom Wireless Holdings, Inc. for $2.4 billion; the acquisition closed on February 22, 2008. By September 8, 2008, SunCom's operations were integrated with those of the company. The acquisition added SunCom's 1.1 million customers to the company's customer base and expanded the company's network coverage to include southern Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, eastern Tennessee, northeastern Georgia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
Attempted acquisition by AT&T[edit]
Main article: Attempted purchase of T-Mobile USA by AT&T
On March 20, 2011, DT accepted a $39 billion stock and cash purchase offer from AT&T for the company. The acquisition was subject to regulatory approvals, a reverse breakup fee in certain circumstances, and customary regulatory and closing conditions.[11][21][22][23]
If the merger had been completed, AT&T Mobility would have had a customer base of approximately 130 million users, making it the largest wireless carrier in the U.S.[11]
On August 31, 2011, the United States Department of Justice sued to block AT&T's merger with T-Mobile on the grounds that it would "substantially lessen competition" in the wireless market.[24] Further reports indicated that the FCC would likely oppose the merger.[25]
On December 19, 2011, in the face of this heavy resistance from the U.S. government, AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson announced that the company had officially withdrawn its $39 billion bid.[26] In an official statement, Stephenson addressed the continuing spectrum shortage (due to a significant increase in wireless demand), hinting that the company will continue to seek other options to solve the shortage in the short term.[27]
Merger with MetroPCS Communications[edit]
On October 3, 2012, MetroPCS Communications reached an agreement to merge with T-Mobile USA. MetroPCS shareholders would hold a 26% stake in the merged company, which retained the T-Mobile brand. While the merged company was still the fourth largest carrier in the United States (at the time), the acquisition gave T-Mobile access to more spectrum and financial resources to maintain competitiveness and expand its LTE network.[28] The merger between T-Mobile USA Inc. and MetroPCS was officially approved by MetroPCS shareholders on April 24, 2013. The deal was structured as a reverse takeover; the combined company went public on the New York Stock Exchange as TMUS and became known as T-Mobile US, Inc., on May 1, 2013.[29] The merger agreement gave Deutsche Telekom the option to sell its 72% stake in the merged company, valued at around $14.2 billion, to a third party before the end of the 18-month lock-up period.[30]
The "Un-carrier", additional wireless spectrum acquisition[edit]
In March 2013, T-Mobile introduced a major overhaul of its plan structure, marketed by branding themselves as being "the Un-carrier". Among the changes, a new contract-free pricing structure with simpler plans were introduced, in which a phone's cost is paid over a two-year financing plan.[31] The "Un-carrier" strategy has since been expanded to encompass other value-added services, such as a plan add-on allowing phone trade-ins for early upgrades twice per year,[32] carrying over unused data allotments for up to a year,[33] and zero-rating of selected music and video services (the latter locked to "DVD quality") over the mobile network,[34][35] These moves came as part of an effort under new CEO John Legere to help revitalize the business as it improves its network quality.[31]
On June 28, 2013, T-Mobile agreed to buy wireless spectrum for the Mississippi Valley region from competitor U.S. Cellular for around $308 million, allowing the company to expand its 4G network across a further 29 markets.[36]
On January 6, 2014, T-Mobile signed agreements with Verizon Wireless to purchase some 700 MHz A-Block spectrum licenses for $2.365 billion. Further, a transfer of some AWS and PCS spectrum licenses with a value of $950 million has been agreed upon by T-Mobile and Verizon. The acquisition reportedly gave T-Mobile additional coverage for approximately 158 million people in 9 of the top 10 and 21 of the top 30 U.S. markets.[37]
Attempted acquisition by Sprint[edit]
In December 2013, multiple reports indicated that Sprint Corporation and its parent company Softbank were working towards a deal to acquire a majority stake in T-Mobile for at least US$20 billion. The proposed merger, which would result in the country's major national carriers being controlled by only three companies, would further bolster T-Mobile's position in the overall market.[38][39][40] Members of the government were skeptical that such an acquisition would be approved by regulators, citing antitrust concerns and an explicit goal by FCC chairman Tom Wheeler to maintain four national carriers in the United States.[41][42] On April 30, 2014, Bloomberg reported that Sprint was in talks with its lenders to ensure that the company would be financially prepared for the bid, now valued at $24 billion and planned for "summer 2014". It was also reported that due to his success within the company, current T-Mobile CEO John Legere was the top contender to be named CEO of a merged Sprint/T-Mobile, and that Sprint had insisted on a low termination fee to prevent regulators from being given an incentive to block the deal, as had occurred with AT&T's failed attempt to purchase T-Mobile.[43]
On August 1, 2014, Xavier Niel's Iliad SA publicly announced a US$16 billion all-cash counter-bid to acquire a 56% stake in T-Mobile US, which would be funded using equity and debt. Iliad is the parent company of French carrier Free Mobile, which had—similarly to T-Mobile, performed disruptive business moves to undercut its competitors, triggering a "price war" among them upon its launch in 2012. Credit Suisse analysts felt that the bid would not be "attractive" to the company's current shareholders due to its lower value in comparison to Sprint's bid, but could "put pressure on Sprint to move sooner rather [than] later."[44][45]
On August 4, 2014, Bloomberg reported that Sprint had abandoned its bid to acquire T-Mobile, considering the unlikelihood that such a deal would be approved by the U.S. government and its regulators.[46]
On February 17, 2017, it was reported by Reuters that Softbank was considering selling its majority share in Sprint to Deutsche Telekom (an effective reversal of the original deal), citing struggling growth in the U.S. market, and a higher likelihood that the deal would be approved by the Trump administration.[47]
Wireless networks[edit]
The company owns licenses to operate a cellular communications network in the 1900 MHz (PCS) and 1700 MHz (AWS) bands with coverage in many parts of the continental U.S., Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, as well as licenses in the 700 MHz (block A) band available in certain parts of the country. With respect to technology, depending on the location, in the 1900 MHz band it deploys GSM, UMTS/HSPA+, and/or LTE (B2); in the 1700 MHz band it deploys UMTS/HSPA+ and/or LTE (B4); and LTE (B12) only in the 700A band. Its LTE network also supports VoLTE. It provides coverage in areas where it does not own radio frequency spectrum licenses via roaming agreements with other operators of compatible networks.
Cellular network[edit]
The company's predecessor, VoiceStream Wireless, began building a regional, 2G, 1900 MHz GSM, circuit switched, digital cellular network in 1994 and first offered service in 1996 in Honolulu and Salt Lake City. From that starting point, the network has expanded in size through acquisitions of other cellular-network operators and additional spectrum purchases. The network has also expanded in capabilities through the introduction of new technologies. VoiceStream upgraded the 1900 MHz network to include packet switching via General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), then increased packet switched data transmission speeds via Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution. In 2006, the company spent $4.2 billion to purchase 120 D, E or F block 1700 MHz AWS licenses[48] and began rolling out 3G UMTS services in those frequency bands. The company upgraded network equipment and back-haul capabilities to enable HSPA (High Speed Packet Access), and later HSPA+ and LTE services.

Packet-switched data upgrade[edit]
Packet-switched data service first became available to users in the form of General Packet Radio Service (GPRS). Packet-switched data speeds increased when Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE) was incorporated into the network. EDGE coverage was available within at least forty percent of the GSM footprint.[49]
Both voice capacity and packet-switched data speeds improved when 3G Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) equipment was installed in the network. On January 5, 2010, the company announced that it had upgraded its entire 3G network to HSPA 7.2 Mbit/s, an improvement from its previous peak of 3.6 Mbit/s. It also said that it planned to be the first U.S. carrier to deploy HSPA+ across its network by mid-2010. The company had finished HSPA+ trials in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and had begun deploying HSPA+ across its network.
3G upgrade / discontinuation[edit]
In September 2006, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) auctioned licenses in the first Advanced Wireless Services band. This band was an area of wireless spectrum, half in the 1700 MHz (1.7 GHz) and half in the 2100 MHz (2.1 GHz) frequencies, that was already in use by government services. The spectrum was planned to become available after the government users migrated to different frequencies.
The auction made numerous licenses available in overlapping market-areas, economic-areas, and regional levels. Each license was individually bid upon, and T-Mobile USA was the winner in 120 license auctions, at an aggregate price of $4.18 billion. As part of its winnings, T-Mobile USA gained nationwide coverage of 1.7 GHz and 2.1 GHz, with numerous areas being supplemented with additional licenses. Examples include New York City, Chicago, and Boston where T-Mobile USA acquired one-third (33 percent) of the available spectrum, or San Francisco, Houston, and Miami where they acquired 45 percent of the available spectrum.[50]
October 6, 2006, two weeks after confirming its winning bids, the company announced its intentions to create a UMTS third-generation, or 3G, cellular network with the spectrum it had won. It said it would utilize and build on the experience of T-Mobile International's European subsidiaries, which already implemented 3G networks. At the time of initial roll-out, the company intended to offer 7.2 Mbit/s service, making the company's 3G network the fastest in the U.S. The upgrade was forecast to cost $2.6 billion, in addition to the $4.12 billion spent to acquire the spectrum licenses.[51]
In the same announcement, the company indicated it had already begun to deploy about half of the upgraded equipment, beginning in major markets such as New York City. With the equipment in place, it would be able to activate its network as soon as the government agencies vacated the spectrum. The company had hoped to have its network activated by mid-2007, but as of September 2007, the government users had not vacated the AWS band.[51]
The company began selling its first 3G-capable phone, the Nokia 6263, in November 2007 and announced in February 2008 that its 3G network would finally be activated "within the next few months".[52][53] and released in the New York City market on May 1, 2008.[54]
By 2009, the company had launched its 3G network in more than 200 markets, covering some 208 million points of presence (POPS).[55] Throughout 2015, T-Mobile began refarming UMTS/HSPA services from the original AWS band to their PCS band to expand bandwidth available for LTE. This rendered a select number of T-Mobile 3G devices inoperable on the 3G network.[56]
HSPA/HSPA+ upgrade[edit]
On June 28, 2010, the company announced that it would begin to upgrade its network from HSPA+ 21 to HSPA+ 42 beginning sometime in 2011.[57] T-Mobile marketed HSPA+ services as 4G.[58]
4G LTE upgrade[edit]
On February 23, 2012, during the Q4 Earnings Call, T-Mobile laid out the future of their 4G upgrade path. They would roll out the LTE network on the AWS spectrum, and transition their HSPA+ network to the PCS band. To achieve compatibility with other networks and phones in the USA, T-Mobile began this transition in March 2013, and the rollout of LTE is currently underway as T-Mobile expands to more markets.[59] Due to the failed acquisition of T-Mobile USA by AT&T, T-Mobile USA received additional UMTS frequency band IV (AWS) spectrum. On March 26, 2013, T-Mobile began rolling out LTE in 7 markets: Baltimore, San Jose, Washington, D.C., Phoenix, Las Vegas, Kansas City, and Houston.[60]
On August 21, 2012, the FCC approved a deal between T-Mobile and Verizon in which T-Mobile gained additional AWS spectrum licenses in 125 Cellular Market Areas.[61]
On February 25, 2014, T-Mobile announced in their Q4 2013 earnings call that their 4G LTE network covered 209 million people in 273 metro areas. They also planned to start rolling out their 700 MHz A-Block spectrum by the end of 2014, which by the end of the roll out would cover 158 million people. This spectrum led to improved LTE coverage overall in these areas, particularly indoors.[62]
On March 13, 2014, T-Mobile announced a new plan to upgrade its entire 2G/EDGE network to 4G LTE. They expected 50% to be done by the end of 2014, and it to be "substantially complete" by the middle of 2015.[63]
On December 16, 2014, T-Mobile announced during CEO John Legere's Un-carrier 8.0 interview that their 4G LTE network covered 260 million people and their 700 MHz Band 12 LTE had been rolled out in Cleveland, Colorado Springs, Minneapolis, and Washington, D.C. They expected to cover 280 million with LTE by mid-2015 and 300 million by the end of 2015. They also stated that they covered 121 metro areas with their Wideband LTE.[64]
On October 27, 2015, T-Mobile announced in its Q3 2015 earnings call that they covered over 300 million people with LTE, reaching their 2015 end of year goal months ahead of schedule. They had 245 markets with Wideband (at least 15+15 MHz) LTE. They also had 204 markets with Extended Range 700 MHz Band 12 LTE covering around 175 million people. Their coverage map revealed that they now had new native LTE coverage in Montana, the Dakotas, Eastern West Virginia, and Northern Michigan.[65]
On May 25, 2016 T-Mobile announced that it will be purchasing the 700Mhz A-block license (LTE band 12) for the Chicago metro area. When this transaction closes, together with several other pending 700Mhz license acquisitions, T-Mobile expects to possess 700Mhz licenses covering a total of 272 million people, or 84% of the US population – including 10 of the top 10 largest US metro areas. T-Mobile refers to its 700Mhz low-band network as 'Extended-range LTE' and claims it penetrates buildings and reaches out farther than its PCS and AWS only network.[66] In September 2016, T-Mobile launched 4x4 MIMO and 3 channel carrier aggregation allowing theoretical speeds of 400 Mbit/s, and also announced that the company's LTE network reaches over 312 million potential subscribers.[67]
Roaming[edit]
T-Mobile has roaming arrangements with a number of national and regional mobile network operators, including AT&T Mobility.
As of 2008, prepaid customers have almost all of the postpaid domestic roaming privileges and restricted international roaming to Canada and Mexico.[68]
On June 29, 2010, the company launched voice service in the Gulf of Mexico on GSM via roaming agreement through Broadpoint. T-Mobile USA was scheduled to launch data service in Fall 2010.[69]
In 2009, T-Mobile USA began removing AT&T Mobility roaming coverage in many locations across the country, and updated its on-line coverage maps[70][71] to reflect the smaller coverage area. AT&T Mobility roaming remains available in select locations, primarily on smaller carriers that were acquired by AT&T Mobility after long-term roaming contracts were in place between T-Mobile and the smaller carriers, including Centennial Wireless and Edge Wireless.
On October 9, 2013, T-Mobile announced Simple Global, a service included with eligible Simple Choice plans. This service allows one to roam in over 100 countries with unlimited text and speed-limited data, and make calls at $0.20/minute. High-speed data passes will be available for purchase.[72] On March 7, 2014, T-Mobile announced this number will be increasing to 122 countries.[73] If one is connected to WiFi in one of these countries, and their phone supports WiFi calling, all calls and texts to and from the USA are free, and work the same as if they were on the cellular network.[74]
On July 15, 2015, T-Mobile announced Mobile Without Borders, a service included with all new T-Mobile plans and available as an add-on to grandfathered or promotional plans for $10. This service allows the user to use their normal voice, text message, and data allotments while roaming in Mexico and Canada. Most T-Mobile services are available while roaming, with the notable exception of using the data in one's Data Stash.
In August 2015, T-Mobile joined the Competitive Carriers Association's Data Services Hub, enabling the company to expand roaming partnerships with over a dozen rural and regional carriers. Smaller carriers will now be able to access T-Mobile's LTE network for roaming and T-Mobile will be able to expand roaming partnerships and extend its footprint with members whose network technologies had previously been incompatible.[75]

T-Mobile HotSpots[edit]
T-Mobile has used the term "Hotspot" to represent various products and technologies.
Wi-Fi network (public)[edit]
The company operates a nationwide Wi-Fi Internet access network under the T-Mobile HotSpots brand. The T-Mobile HotSpots network consists of thousands of Wi-Fi access points installed in businesses, hotels and airports throughout the U.S.
The T-Mobile HotSpot service offers access to a nationwide network of approximately 8,350 access points, installed in venues such as Starbucks coffeehouses, FedEx Office Office and Print Centers, Hyatt hotels and resorts, Red Roof Inns, Sofitel hotels, Novotel hotels, the airline clubs of American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and US Airways, and airports.[86]
The T-Mobile HotSpots network can be traced to the company's 2002 purchase of bankrupt wireless ISP MobileStar, which began building its network in 1998. After completing the purchase, the company expanded the network into 400 Borders bookstores, as well as 100 of the most-frequented airport clubs and lounges operated by American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and United Airlines.[87][88]
On September 14, 2014, T-Mobile partnered up with GoGo to provide free texting on airplanes for its customers. GoGo services are provided on Delta Airlines, American Airlines, United Airlines, US Airways, Virgin America and Alaska Airlines.[89]
On June 6, 2016, T-Mobile expanded its partnership with GoGo to offer T-Mobile users one hour of free WiFi on customers phones. T-Mobile also included other messaging apps (iMessage, Google Hangouts, WhatsApp and Viber) in addition to SMS texting being provided since September 2014.[90]
Wi-Fi network (private)[edit]
T-Mobile has also used the term to describe Wi-Fi Access Points that it sold to end users to expand their cell phone network to phones equipped to also receive Wi-Fi using a VOIP-like technology. (The models included at least two by Linksys: the WRTU54G-TM and the WRT54G-TM and one by D-Link: the TM-G5240.)
Products and services[edit]
T-Mobile ONE[edit]
In August 2016, T-Mobile introduced T-Mobile ONE. It will be the only rate plan offered in the future, with plans to gradually phase out Simple Choice.[91] It combines unlimited voice minutes, text messaging, and high-speed data (the top 3% of users—currently 32 GB/month—may be deprioritized under congested conditions), replacing Binge On, Music Freedom, and Data Stash. Video streaming is limited to 1.5 Mbps, allowing 480p resolution in most cases, and mobile hotspot (tethering) is limited to 3G speeds. The $10/line/month ONE Plus add-on allows HD streaming and adds 10 GB of mobile hotspot at 4G LTE speeds; the $25/line/month ONE Plus International additionally provides international calling and texting and unlimited mobile hotspot at 4G LTE speeds. Subscribers who do not enable auto-pay are charged a $5/line/month fee; otherwise, as of January 22, 2017, all taxes and regulatory fees are included in the plan cost.[92][93] The plan has been criticized by the Electronic Frontier Foundation and others for potentially violating net neutrality rules and making previously-included features paid extras.[94][95][96] Subscribers on Simple Choice can keep their current plans.[91]
In response to Verizon launching their new Verizon Unlimited Plan, T-Mobile revised their T-Mobile ONE plan to include High Definition (1080p) video streaming and 10 GB of High Speed Mobile Hot Spot data (to be slowed to 3G speeds after using the allowance). Also, their prioritization threshold was raised to 32 GB.
Simple Choice[edit]
In March 2013, T-Mobile introduced a new streamlined plan structure known as Simple Choice for new customers. This is part of an initiative called Un-carrier which drops contracts, subsidized phones, overage fees for data, and early termination fees.[31]
Capping unlimited data users[edit]
On August 31, 2015, T-Mobile announced it will ask users who abuse its unlimited on-smartphone data plan by violating T-Mobile's Terms & Conditions regarding tethering (which like unlimited on-smartphone data, remains unlimited, however, offers a 14 GB high speed allotment before deprioritizing takes effect), by permanently removing user access to unlimited plans and migrating users to a tiered data plan. By doing so, all plans after a select amount of inclusive high-speed data, result in automatic throttled speeds, preventing unlimited high-speed tethering use and abuse of the network. T-Mobile stated that there are a small handful of users who abuse the tethering plan by altering device software and/or the use of an Android app that masks T-Mobile's ability monitoring whether data is on-smartphone, or through smartphone mobile hotspot (tethering) by mimicking all data as on-smartphone use, with some customers abusing the service by using as much as 2 TB per month, causing speed issues for all other customers.[97]
InReach program[edit]
The InReach program[98] provides a free cell phone and a limited number of voice minutes each month for low-income-eligible families (one per family) who do not use Lifeline services offered by any other phone or wireless company. It is funded through the Universal Service Fund,[99] but is only operational in a limited number of states and Puerto Rico.[100]
MetroPCS[edit]
Main article: MetroPCS
MetroPCS was taken over by T-Mobile in 2013, the new company formed T-Mobile US and currently continues to offer prepaid wireless services under the MetroPCS brand.
GoSmart Mobile[edit]
GoSmart Mobile was a T-Mobile branded service that launched in beta on December 7, 2012, and became officially available nationwide on February 19, 2013.[101] GoSmart offered no-contract SIM wireless services. GoSmart Mobile was sold to consumers through dealers who worked as independent contractors under their own company name. Such sellers are known as "Authorized Dealers" with either physical or online stores. In September 2016, T-Mobile sold the brand and 326,000 GoSmart Mobile customers to TracFone Wireless.[102] The customers were reclassified as wholesale subscribers.[103]
Banking Cards[edit]
On January 22, 2014, T-Mobile announced that it would expand its products into banking. T-Mobile would provide Visa card with banking features and a smartphone money management application with reduced-fee or zero-cost services for T-Mobile wireless customers. In addition, customers would have access to over 42,000 ATMs with no fees.[104]
In early 2016 T-mobile decided to discontinue the banking cards. They can no longer be purchased at T-Mobile.
Customer service[edit]

Awards[edit]
From as early as 2004, the company has captured multiple J. D. Power annual awards in the areas of retail sales satisfaction, wireless customer care, and overall customer satisfaction.[4] In 2011, J. D. Power and Associates stated that T-Mobile retail stores achieved the highest ratings among major wireless carriers for customer satisfaction for the fourth consecutive year, performing particularly well in price and promotions.[105] Also in 2011, J. D. Power and Associates ranked T-Mobile USA highest among major providers in wireless customer care for the second consecutive year.[106]
On December 3, 2015, Consumer Reports named T-Mobile the number one American wireless service provider. The results combine data from customer service, voice quality, text messaging services, and data speeds.[8]
On February 6, 2016, T-Mobile was awarded the JD Power Award for customer satisfaction in the full service wireless category for the second year in a row. T-Mobile received the highest score ever in the wireless industry.[107]
Outages[edit]
Sidekick data outage[edit]
Main article: Microsoft data loss 2009
On October 1, 2009, Sidekick users lost all data functionality and some users also experienced personal data loss including contacts, notes, and calendars. On October 8, most data services were restored to some users but the company and Microsoft announced on October 10 that data "almost certainly has been lost as a result of a server failure at Microsoft/Danger."[108] On October 15, Microsoft said it had been able to recover most or all data and would begin to restore it.[109][110] A few weeks later, all Sidekick customers were able to recover their data via Danger's sync website using a restore file, or had the option to wait until data was restored to the device itself. Due to this outage, many users abandoned the Sidekick for another device, or left T-Mobile USA for another carrier entirely.[citation needed]
Network outage[edit]
On November 9, 2009, the company's subscribers lost the ability to send and receive calls and text messages.[111] The company confirmed the outage via Twitter and later stated that five percent of its user base had been affected. It blamed a software error for the service interruption, stating that a backend system software error had generated abnormal congestion on the network. The root cause was determined and steps were taken to update a patch on the backend as a permanent resolution.[112]
On February 13 and March 25, 2015, T-Mobile suffered LTE outages along the east coast causing users to lose data connections.[citation needed]
Marketing[edit]
Jamie Lee Curtis was the spokesperson for T-Mobile USA's predecessor, VoiceStream Wireless, since 1998. VoiceStream's advertising slogan was: "Get more from life". During the transition to the T-Mobile brand, Jamie Lee Curtis continued as spokesperson for a short time and the slogan was changed to "T-Mobile. Get More."
Starting in 2002, the company's spokesperson was Catherine Zeta-Jones who was the main figure in its branding strategy. As of September 2006, Zeta-Jones had officially been dropped as the "face" of the company for its advertising campaigns due to a corporate rebranding strategy.[113] The company also relied on rapper Snoop Dogg as the spokesperson for its T-Mobile Sidekick in a series of commercials late in 2004, the company also released a series of Sidekick phones known as the D-Wade Edition for basketball player Dwyane Wade.
The company is also an official sponsor of the Major League Baseball, National Basketball Association, the NBA Rookie Challenge and the Women's National Basketball Association.
In 2009, it changed its approach to advertising, and moved from the "Get More" slogan to a "Stick Together" slogan to focus more on the personal aspect of staying together with those who matter the most to its customers.[citation needed] The slogan was also meant to promote its MyFaves calling-circle plan. With this the company also ended its relationship with Zeta-Jones, and now use mainly non-celebrity spokespeople (though Dwyane Wade, Charles Barkley, and Dwight Howard are featured in some commercials, in association with the company's sponsorship of the NBA as official wireless provider).
In late May 2009, Zeta-Jones was brought back as a company spokesperson to show customers how to pay less for their wireless plan in a new "Mobile Makeovers" advertising campaign that refers customer to third-party comparison site BillShrink.com.[114][115]
In late 2009, commercials for the T-Mobile MyTouch 3G featured the song "If You Want to Sing Out, Sing Out" by Cat Stevens[116] and celebrities such as Chevy Chase, Molly Shannon, Dana Carvey and Darrell Hammond.[117] Another commercial with the same song performed by a different artist showed Wyclef Jean, Avril Lavigne and Brad Paisley.[118]
Carly Foulkes is the spokeswoman for the myTouch 4G in commercials that parody the Get a Mac campaign. The model is known for Rugby Ralph Lauren ads.[119][120][121] Although Foulkes is often identified with the color pink, T-Mobile actually has a color trademark for the color magenta,[122] and markets itself using its corporate colors.[123][124] Virgin Mobile has, in turn, parodied the Carly Foulkes ads.[125]
In September 2010, the company launched "Kids are free till 2012" for family lines.
On December 1, 2011, a group of 100 Chicago-area women, along with Carly Foulkes, were featured in a flash-mob style performance at Woodfield Mall in Schaumburg, Illinois, where the group, dressed in magenta dresses, sang and danced through the mall's atrium to their cover of (There's No Place Like) Home for the Holidays. The performance was filmed and edited into a holiday commercial, which was a success.
Un-carrier movement[edit]
Starting in 2013, T-Mobile launched the Un-carrier marketing campaign. This movement introduced a slew of new tactics to offer consumers cheaper rate plans, cheaper global coverage, and several other benefits. T-Mobile CEO John Legere laid out an 'Un-Carrier manifesto' highlighting the approach and goals he wanted the company to pursue. One popular Un-carrier move features T-Mobile Tuesdays, where customers are offered a variety of free products and also able to win prizes.[126][127] The most recent Un-carrier campaign is titled 'T-Mobile One'. This is a new family plan offering, replacing all previous plans and is an all inclusive unlimited plan, giving unlimited talk, text and data. The only caveat being video streaming on any device is limited to 480p resolution.[128] CEO John Legere in an interview said "The biggest pain point that a million customers told me about is that they hate data buckets. And we had such success with Binge On that we wanted to turn our company into somebody that's selling a monthly subscription to the internet, all in, unlimited." [129] As of October 7, 2016, about a quarter of the overall account numbers have moved over to T-Mobile One, and about three quarters of new postpaid accounts are activating on T-Mobile One.
Labor relations[edit]
T-Mobile US employees and two labor unions have led multiple unionization attempts beginning as early as 2001.
Formation of TU[edit]
Hundreds of T-Mobile employees, with the backing of the Communications Workers of America (CWA) and the German union ver.di, have joined together as TU to gain representation at T-Mobile.[130] In July, 2011, technicians in Connecticut, voted for representation by the Communications Workers of America-TU.[131] On September 25, 2013, MetroPCS workers in Harlem, NY, voted for a union voice and representation by CWA-TU.[132]
2009 coordinated organizing effort[edit]




CWA President Larry Cohen and a disguised, unidentified T-Mobile USA employee pictured at a 2009 press conference announcing a coordinated unionizing effort.


In 2008, the CWA and ver.di launched a coordinated effort to unionize company employees. A spokesman for the CWA called on the company to stop resisting mobilization efforts and allow company employees to unionize as German employees of T-Mobile USA's parent company, DT, have done. In response, the company released an employee satisfaction study showing that more than seventy percent of the company's 40,000 workers were "very satisfied" with their jobs. Through a spokesman, the company stated, "Despite the Communication Workers of America's periodic organizing efforts for more than nine years, no group of T-Mobile employees has ever chosen to be represented by a union. While our company is always striving to find ways to improve, year after year, employees continue to view T-Mobile as a good place to work where they have no need for, or interest in, a union."[131]
Political pressure[edit]
In 2009, a number of politicians, in one case acting after lobbying efforts by CWA union activists, wrote letters to René Obermann, DT's chief executive officer, in an effort to influence T-Mobile USA's labor practices in the U.S.[133]
In a March 13, 2009, letter, U.S. Senator John Kerry (D-MA) asked "why the company's approach to labor rights are different in Germany than in the United States". In an April 30, 2010, letter sent after lobbying by Communications Workers of America activists, 26 Democratic members of Congress called on DT to protect and respect workers' rights in the U.S.[133] A separate July 1, 2010, letter from seven Republicans addressed the same issue.[134][135] On August 10, 2010, U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) released a statement in support of the worker's efforts to organize a union at the company.[136] In a letter, dated September 21, 2010, fifteen Californian Members of Congress urged Obermann to take action and implement fair and equitable labor relations.[citation needed]
In a November 5, 2009, letter, Thomas DiNapoli, New York State Comptroller and Trustee of the New York State Common Retirement Fund, stated concerns about "the potential impact on the value of T-Mobile that may result from a disenfranchised workforce and the associated negative publicity that may impact T-Mobile's profitability."[citation needed]
Reports[edit]




A Cover image of a report written by John Logan and published in 2009 by American Rights at Work


On December 9, 2009, the non-profit organization American Rights at Work published a report written by Prof. John Logan, Director of Labor Studies at San Francisco State University, titled "Lowering the Bar or Setting the Standard? Deutsche Telekom's U.S. Labor Practices". The report details behavior by the company that the author perceives as anti-union including dissemination of anti-union materials, intimidation and threats directed at pro-union workers, "captive audience meetings" and the retention of anti-union specialists.[137] In the report, which is based on documents from the National Labor Relations Board, internal company memos and handbooks, and interviews with workers, Logan asserts that the company engaged in a systematic campaign to prevent employees from forming a union and that DT was guilty of operating by a double standard. He claims that Deutsche Telekom respects workers' rights in Germany, where it cooperates closely with unions, but mistreats workers in the United States and interferes with their right to organize.[clarification needed][138]
On September 2, 2010, Human Rights Watch released a report written by Lance Compa titled "A Strange Case: Violations of Workers' Freedom of Association in the United States by European Multinational Corporations". The report concludes that "company policy has translated into practices that leave the workforce fearful about even seeking union representation."[139] DT proclaims its adherence to international labor law and standards that are embodied in German domestic laws. But HRW found that "T-Mobile USA's harsh opposition to workers' freedom of association in the United States betrays Deutsche Telekom's purported commitment to social responsibility, impedes constructive dialogue with employee representatives, and in several cases, has violated ILO and OECD labor and human rights standards".[140]
Workplace activities[edit]
At the company's Allentown, Pennsylvania, call center, security guards were ordered by company managers to write up incident reports whenever union supporters appeared on nearby public grounds and to record the license plate numbers of employees who stopped to take leaflets. In 2006, the National Labor Relations Board found that these activities violated Section 8(a)(1) of the National Labor Relations Act.[141]
In 2008, company management in the Pacific Northwest and Southwest Retail Divisions sent a memorandum to store managers instructing them to immediately report any union activity to their supervisors.[142] Human Rights Watch states, "The NLRB has long held that such activity interferes with, restrains, and coerces employees in the exercise of Section 7 rights in violation of workers' right to freedom of association."[143]
Information Security[edit]
Nicolas Jacobsen was charged with intruding into the company's internal network in January 2005.[144] Reports indicated that for about a year Jacobsen had access to customer passwords, e-mail, address books, Social Security numbers, birth dates, and Sidekick photos. Affected customers included members of the United States Secret Service. Secret Service informant identified Jacobsen as part of "Operation Firewall" which provided evidence that Jacobsen had attempted to sell customer information to others for identity theft. T-Mobile USA and the Secret Service did not elaborate on the methods Jacobsen used to gain access but sources close to the case indicated that Jacobsen exploited an unpatched flaw in the Oracle WebLogic Server application software used by the company.[145] Additional SQL injection vulnerabilities with the company's web site were reported by Jack Koziol of the InfoSec Institute.[146]
T-Mobile offers access to voice mail without the input of a password by default. Parties acting in bad faith may be able to access such voice mailboxes via Caller ID spoofing. To avoid this possibility, T-Mobile recommends that all customers password protect their mailboxes, but still offers the no password configuration by default due to customer demand.[147]
On June 6, 2009, a message posted from an email account "pwnmobile_at_Safe-mail.net" to the Full Disclosure mailing list claimed that the company's network had been breached and showed sample data. The sender offered "databases, confidential documents, scripts and programs from their servers, financial documents up to 2009" to the highest bidder.[148][149] On June 9, the company issued a statement confirming the breach but stating that customer data was safe. It claimed to have identified the source document for the sample data and believe it was not obtained by hacking.[150] A later statement claimed that there was not any evidence of a breach.[151]
Privacy and surveillance[edit]
T-Mobile USA received a portion of the 1.3 million largely warrantless law enforcement requests for subscriber information (including text messages and phone location data) made in 2011, but refused to state how many requests it received.[152] It did say that in the last decade, the number of requests have increased by 12 to 16 percent annually.[153]
Data retention policies[edit]
According to T-Mobile's privacy policy highlights, "Retention and Disposal", information is retained for as long as there is business or tax need or as applicable laws, regulations, or government orders require. T-Mobile notes that it disposes of Personal Information, uses reasonable procedures designed to erase or render it unreadable (for example, shredding documents and wiping electronic media).[154]
In 2010, the Department of Justice (DOJ) released a document entitled, "Retention Periods of Major Cellular Providers," to advise law enforcement agents seeking to obtain cell phone records. This document was uncovered by the ACLU's coordinated records request on cell phone location tracking by police. Notably, the document showed that T-Mobile subscriber information was retained for 5 years and call detail records were kept for 2 years (prepaid) and 5 years (postpaid).[155]
In 2013, Massachusetts Sen. Edward Markey revealed responses from the top four U.S. wireless providers as well as U.S. Cellular, C Spire, and Cricket/Leap Wireless, to his inquiry regarding user information disclosed to law enforcement officials. The following was T-Mobile's response regarding data retention: T-Mobile US retains customers' historic cell site information and cell tower dump information (180 days); call details records (7–10 years); text message content, data requests, and geo-location data not stored; voicemail content (up to 21 days); subscriber information (6 years after account is closed).[156]
Comparing the 2010 DOJ memo released by the ACLU and Massachusetts Senator Edward Markey's 2013 wireless data retention disclosures, it should be noted that T-Mobile increased the retention period for subscriber information from 5 years to 6 years. T-Mobile also increased its call detail record retention from 2 years (prepaid) and 5 years (postpaid) to 7–10 years.

History[edit]
T-Mobile US traces its roots to the 1994 establishment of VoiceStream Wireless PCS as a subsidiary of Western Wireless Corporation. Spun off from parent Western Wireless on May 3, 1999, VoiceStream Wireless was purchased by Deutsche Telekom AG in 2001 for $35 billion and renamed T-Mobile USA, Inc. in July, 2002. In 2013, T-Mobile and MetroPCS finalized a merger of the two companies. The two companies began trading as T-Mobile US[10][11][12] [13]
VoiceStream Wireless[edit]
VoiceStream Wireless PCS was established in 1994 as a subsidiary of Western Wireless Corporation to provide digital wireless personal communications services (PCS) in 19 FCC-defined metropolitan service areas in several western and southwestern states.[14] VoiceStream Wireless' digital, urban service areas complemented the analog, rural service areas marketed by Western Wireless under the Cellular One brand.[15]
Western Wireless spun off its VoiceStream Wireless division into a new company called VoiceStream Wireless Corporation in May 1999.[16]
Omnipoint and Aerial acquisitions[edit]
In 2000, VoiceStream Wireless acquired two regional GSM carriers. Omnipoint Corporation, a regional network operator in the Northeastern U.S., was acquired on February 25, 2000. Aerial Communications Inc.; a regional network operator in the Columbus, Houston, Kansas City, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Pittsburgh and Tampa-St. Petersburg-Orlando markets; was acquired on May 4, 2000.[17] The combined company retired the Omnipoint and Aerial brands and completed integrating the three companies by converting to a single customer billing platform, implementing standard business practices and launching the VoiceStream brand and "GET MORE" marketing strategy in all markets.[18]
Deutsche Telekom acquires VoiceStream and Powertel[edit]

On June 1, 2001, Deutsche Telekom (DT) completed the acquisition of VoiceStream Wireless Inc. for $35 billion and Southern U.S. regional GSM network operator Powertel, Inc. for $24 billion. By the end of 2001, VoiceStream Wireless had 19,000 employees serving 7 million subscribers.
On September 2, 2001, VoiceStream Wireless Inc. took the name, T-Mobile USA, Inc. and began rolling out the T-Mobile brand, starting with locations in California and Nevada.[19] T-Mobile USA, Inc. was an operating entity of T-Mobile International AG,[4] before becoming a direct subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom AG.[20]
SunCom acquisition[edit]
On September 17, 2007, the company announced the acquisition of SunCom Wireless Holdings, Inc. for $2.4 billion; the acquisition closed on February 22, 2008. By September 8, 2008, SunCom's operations were integrated with those of the company. The acquisition added SunCom's 1.1 million customers to the company's customer base and expanded the company's network coverage to include southern Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, eastern Tennessee, northeastern Georgia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
Attempted acquisition by AT&T[edit]
Main article: Attempted purchase of T-Mobile USA by AT&T
On March 20, 2011, DT accepted a $39 billion stock and cash purchase offer from AT&T for the company. The acquisition was subject to regulatory approvals, a reverse breakup fee in certain circumstances, and customary regulatory and closing conditions.[11][21][22][23]
If the merger had been completed, AT&T Mobility would have had a customer base of approximately 130 million users, making it the largest wireless carrier in the U.S.[11]
On August 31, 2011, the United States Department of Justice sued to block AT&T's merger with T-Mobile on the grounds that it would "substantially lessen competition" in the wireless market.[24] Further reports indicated that the FCC would likely oppose the merger.[25]
On December 19, 2011, in the face of this heavy resistance from the U.S. government, AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson announced that the company had officially withdrawn its $39 billion bid.[26] In an official statement, Stephenson addressed the continuing spectrum shortage (due to a significant increase in wireless demand), hinting that the company will continue to seek other options to solve the shortage in the short term.[27]
Merger with MetroPCS Communications[edit]
On October 3, 2012, MetroPCS Communications reached an agreement to merge with T-Mobile USA. MetroPCS shareholders would hold a 26% stake in the merged company, which retained the T-Mobile brand. While the merged company was still the fourth largest carrier in the United States (at the time), the acquisition gave T-Mobile access to more spectrum and financial resources to maintain competitiveness and expand its LTE network.[28] The merger between T-Mobile USA Inc. and MetroPCS was officially approved by MetroPCS shareholders on April 24, 2013. The deal was structured as a reverse takeover; the combined company went public on the New York Stock Exchange as TMUS and became known as T-Mobile US, Inc., on May 1, 2013.[29] The merger agreement gave Deutsche Telekom the option to sell its 72% stake in the merged company, valued at around $14.2 billion, to a third party before the end of the 18-month lock-up period.[30]
The "Un-carrier", additional wireless spectrum acquisition[edit]
In March 2013, T-Mobile introduced a major overhaul of its plan structure, marketed by branding themselves as being "the Un-carrier". Among the changes, a new contract-free pricing structure with simpler plans were introduced, in which a phone's cost is paid over a two-year financing plan.[31] The "Un-carrier" strategy has since been expanded to encompass other value-added services, such as a plan add-on allowing phone trade-ins for early upgrades twice per year,[32] carrying over unused data allotments for up to a year,[33] and zero-rating of selected music and video services (the latter locked to "DVD quality") over the mobile network,[34][35] These moves came as part of an effort under new CEO John Legere to help revitalize the business as it improves its network quality.[31]
On June 28, 2013, T-Mobile agreed to buy wireless spectrum for the Mississippi Valley region from competitor U.S. Cellular for around $308 million, allowing the company to expand its 4G network across a further 29 markets.[36]
On January 6, 2014, T-Mobile signed agreements with Verizon Wireless to purchase some 700 MHz A-Block spectrum licenses for $2.365 billion. Further, a transfer of some AWS and PCS spectrum licenses with a value of $950 million has been agreed upon by T-Mobile and Verizon. The acquisition reportedly gave T-Mobile additional coverage for approximately 158 million people in 9 of the top 10 and 21 of the top 30 U.S. markets.[37]
Attempted acquisition by Sprint[edit]
In December 2013, multiple reports indicated that Sprint Corporation and its parent company Softbank were working towards a deal to acquire a majority stake in T-Mobile for at least US$20 billion. The proposed merger, which would result in the country's major national carriers being controlled by only three companies, would further bolster T-Mobile's position in the overall market.[38][39][40] Members of the government were skeptical that such an acquisition would be approved by regulators, citing antitrust concerns and an explicit goal by FCC chairman Tom Wheeler to maintain four national carriers in the United States.[41][42] On April 30, 2014, Bloomberg reported that Sprint was in talks with its lenders to ensure that the company would be financially prepared for the bid, now valued at $24 billion and planned for "summer 2014". It was also reported that due to his success within the company, current T-Mobile CEO John Legere was the top contender to be named CEO of a merged Sprint/T-Mobile, and that Sprint had insisted on a low termination fee to prevent regulators from being given an incentive to block the deal, as had occurred with AT&T's failed attempt to purchase T-Mobile.[43]
On August 1, 2014, Xavier Niel's Iliad SA publicly announced a US$16 billion all-cash counter-bid to acquire a 56% stake in T-Mobile US, which would be funded using equity and debt. Iliad is the parent company of French carrier Free Mobile, which had—similarly to T-Mobile, performed disruptive business moves to undercut its competitors, triggering a "price war" among them upon its launch in 2012. Credit Suisse analysts felt that the bid would not be "attractive" to the company's current shareholders due to its lower value in comparison to Sprint's bid, but could "put pressure on Sprint to move sooner rather [than] later."[44][45]
On August 4, 2014, Bloomberg reported that Sprint had abandoned its bid to acquire T-Mobile, considering the unlikelihood that such a deal would be approved by the U.S. government and its regulators.[46]
On February 17, 2017, it was reported by Reuters that Softbank was considering selling its majority share in Sprint to Deutsche Telekom (an effective reversal of the original deal), citing struggling growth in the U.S. market, and a higher likelihood that the deal would be approved by the Trump administration.[47]
Wireless networks[edit]
The company owns licenses to operate a cellular communications network in the 1900 MHz (PCS) and 1700 MHz (AWS) bands with coverage in many parts of the continental U.S., Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, as well as licenses in the 700 MHz (block A) band available in certain parts of the country. With respect to technology, depending on the location, in the 1900 MHz band it deploys GSM, UMTS/HSPA+, and/or LTE (B2); in the 1700 MHz band it deploys UMTS/HSPA+ and/or LTE (B4); and LTE (B12) only in the 700A band. Its LTE network also supports VoLTE. It provides coverage in areas where it does not own radio frequency spectrum licenses via roaming agreements with other operators of compatible networks.
Cellular network[edit]
The company's predecessor, VoiceStream Wireless, began building a regional, 2G, 1900 MHz GSM, circuit switched, digital cellular network in 1994 and first offered service in 1996 in Honolulu and Salt Lake City. From that starting point, the network has expanded in size through acquisitions of other cellular-network operators and additional spectrum purchases. The network has also expanded in capabilities through the introduction of new technologies. VoiceStream upgraded the 1900 MHz network to include packet switching via General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), then increased packet switched data transmission speeds via Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution. In 2006, the company spent $4.2 billion to purchase 120 D, E or F block 1700 MHz AWS licenses[48] and began rolling out 3G UMTS services in those frequency bands. The company upgraded network equipment and back-haul capabilities to enable HSPA (High Speed Packet Access), and later HSPA+ and LTE services.

Packet-switched data upgrade[edit]
Packet-switched data service first became available to users in the form of General Packet Radio Service (GPRS). Packet-switched data speeds increased when Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE) was incorporated into the network. EDGE coverage was available within at least forty percent of the GSM footprint.[49]
Both voice capacity and packet-switched data speeds improved when 3G Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) equipment was installed in the network. On January 5, 2010, the company announced that it had upgraded its entire 3G network to HSPA 7.2 Mbit/s, an improvement from its previous peak of 3.6 Mbit/s. It also said that it planned to be the first U.S. carrier to deploy HSPA+ across its network by mid-2010. The company had finished HSPA+ trials in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and had begun deploying HSPA+ across its network.
3G upgrade / discontinuation[edit]
In September 2006, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) auctioned licenses in the first Advanced Wireless Services band. This band was an area of wireless spectrum, half in the 1700 MHz (1.7 GHz) and half in the 2100 MHz (2.1 GHz) frequencies, that was already in use by government services. The spectrum was planned to become available after the government users migrated to different frequencies.
The auction made numerous licenses available in overlapping market-areas, economic-areas, and regional levels. Each license was individually bid upon, and T-Mobile USA was the winner in 120 license auctions, at an aggregate price of $4.18 billion. As part of its winnings, T-Mobile USA gained nationwide coverage of 1.7 GHz and 2.1 GHz, with numerous areas being supplemented with additional licenses. Examples include New York City, Chicago, and Boston where T-Mobile USA acquired one-third (33 percent) of the available spectrum, or San Francisco, Houston, and Miami where they acquired 45 percent of the available spectrum.[50]
October 6, 2006, two weeks after confirming its winning bids, the company announced its intentions to create a UMTS third-generation, or 3G, cellular network with the spectrum it had won. It said it would utilize and build on the experience of T-Mobile International's European subsidiaries, which already implemented 3G networks. At the time of initial roll-out, the company intended to offer 7.2 Mbit/s service, making the company's 3G network the fastest in the U.S. The upgrade was forecast to cost $2.6 billion, in addition to the $4.12 billion spent to acquire the spectrum licenses.[51]
In the same announcement, the company indicated it had already begun to deploy about half of the upgraded equipment, beginning in major markets such as New York City. With the equipment in place, it would be able to activate its network as soon as the government agencies vacated the spectrum. The company had hoped to have its network activated by mid-2007, but as of September 2007, the government users had not vacated the AWS band.[51]
The company began selling its first 3G-capable phone, the Nokia 6263, in November 2007 and announced in February 2008 that its 3G network would finally be activated "within the next few months".[52][53] and released in the New York City market on May 1, 2008.[54]
By 2009, the company had launched its 3G network in more than 200 markets, covering some 208 million points of presence (POPS).[55] Throughout 2015, T-Mobile began refarming UMTS/HSPA services from the original AWS band to their PCS band to expand bandwidth available for LTE. This rendered a select number of T-Mobile 3G devices inoperable on the 3G network.[56]
HSPA/HSPA+ upgrade[edit]
On June 28, 2010, the company announced that it would begin to upgrade its network from HSPA+ 21 to HSPA+ 42 beginning sometime in 2011.[57] T-Mobile marketed HSPA+ services as 4G.[58]
4G LTE upgrade[edit]
On February 23, 2012, during the Q4 Earnings Call, T-Mobile laid out the future of their 4G upgrade path. They would roll out the LTE network on the AWS spectrum, and transition their HSPA+ network to the PCS band. To achieve compatibility with other networks and phones in the USA, T-Mobile began this transition in March 2013, and the rollout of LTE is currently underway as T-Mobile expands to more markets.[59] Due to the failed acquisition of T-Mobile USA by AT&T, T-Mobile USA received additional UMTS frequency band IV (AWS) spectrum. On March 26, 2013, T-Mobile began rolling out LTE in 7 markets: Baltimore, San Jose, Washington, D.C., Phoenix, Las Vegas, Kansas City, and Houston.[60]
On August 21, 2012, the FCC approved a deal between T-Mobile and Verizon in which T-Mobile gained additional AWS spectrum licenses in 125 Cellular Market Areas.[61]
On February 25, 2014, T-Mobile announced in their Q4 2013 earnings call that their 4G LTE network covered 209 million people in 273 metro areas. They also planned to start rolling out their 700 MHz A-Block spectrum by the end of 2014, which by the end of the roll out would cover 158 million people. This spectrum led to improved LTE coverage overall in these areas, particularly indoors.[62]
On March 13, 2014, T-Mobile announced a new plan to upgrade its entire 2G/EDGE network to 4G LTE. They expected 50% to be done by the end of 2014, and it to be "substantially complete" by the middle of 2015.[63]
On December 16, 2014, T-Mobile announced during CEO John Legere's Un-carrier 8.0 interview that their 4G LTE network covered 260 million people and their 700 MHz Band 12 LTE had been rolled out in Cleveland, Colorado Springs, Minneapolis, and Washington, D.C. They expected to cover 280 million with LTE by mid-2015 and 300 million by the end of 2015. They also stated that they covered 121 metro areas with their Wideband LTE.[64]
On October 27, 2015, T-Mobile announced in its Q3 2015 earnings call that they covered over 300 million people with LTE, reaching their 2015 end of year goal months ahead of schedule. They had 245 markets with Wideband (at least 15+15 MHz) LTE. They also had 204 markets with Extended Range 700 MHz Band 12 LTE covering around 175 million people. Their coverage map revealed that they now had new native LTE coverage in Montana, the Dakotas, Eastern West Virginia, and Northern Michigan.[65]
On May 25, 2016 T-Mobile announced that it will be purchasing the 700Mhz A-block license (LTE band 12) for the Chicago metro area. When this transaction closes, together with several other pending 700Mhz license acquisitions, T-Mobile expects to possess 700Mhz licenses covering a total of 272 million people, or 84% of the US population – including 10 of the top 10 largest US metro areas. T-Mobile refers to its 700Mhz low-band network as 'Extended-range LTE' and claims it penetrates buildings and reaches out farther than its PCS and AWS only network.[66] In September 2016, T-Mobile launched 4x4 MIMO and 3 channel carrier aggregation allowing theoretical speeds of 400 Mbit/s, and also announced that the company's LTE network reaches over 312 million potential subscribers.[67]
Roaming[edit]
T-Mobile has roaming arrangements with a number of national and regional mobile network operators, including AT&T Mobility.
As of 2008, prepaid customers have almost all of the postpaid domestic roaming privileges and restricted international roaming to Canada and Mexico.[68]
On June 29, 2010, the company launched voice service in the Gulf of Mexico on GSM via roaming agreement through Broadpoint. T-Mobile USA was scheduled to launch data service in Fall 2010.[69]
In 2009, T-Mobile USA began removing AT&T Mobility roaming coverage in many locations across the country, and updated its on-line coverage maps[70][71] to reflect the smaller coverage area. AT&T Mobility roaming remains available in select locations, primarily on smaller carriers that were acquired by AT&T Mobility after long-term roaming contracts were in place between T-Mobile and the smaller carriers, including Centennial Wireless and Edge Wireless.
On October 9, 2013, T-Mobile announced Simple Global, a service included with eligible Simple Choice plans. This service allows one to roam in over 100 countries with unlimited text and speed-limited data, and make calls at $0.20/minute. High-speed data passes will be available for purchase.[72] On March 7, 2014, T-Mobile announced this number will be increasing to 122 countries.[73] If one is connected to WiFi in one of these countries, and their phone supports WiFi calling, all calls and texts to and from the USA are free, and work the same as if they were on the cellular network.[74]
On July 15, 2015, T-Mobile announced Mobile Without Borders, a service included with all new T-Mobile plans and available as an add-on to grandfathered or promotional plans for $10. This service allows the user to use their normal voice, text message, and data allotments while roaming in Mexico and Canada. Most T-Mobile services are available while roaming, with the notable exception of using the data in one's Data Stash.
In August 2015, T-Mobile joined the Competitive Carriers Association's Data Services Hub, enabling the company to expand roaming partnerships with over a dozen rural and regional carriers. Smaller carriers will now be able to access T-Mobile's LTE network for roaming and T-Mobile will be able to expand roaming partnerships and extend its footprint with members whose network technologies had previously been incompatible.[75]

T-Mobile HotSpots[edit]
T-Mobile has used the term "Hotspot" to represent various products and technologies.
Wi-Fi network (public)[edit]
The company operates a nationwide Wi-Fi Internet access network under the T-Mobile HotSpots brand. The T-Mobile HotSpots network consists of thousands of Wi-Fi access points installed in businesses, hotels and airports throughout the U.S.
The T-Mobile HotSpot service offers access to a nationwide network of approximately 8,350 access points, installed in venues such as Starbucks coffeehouses, FedEx Office Office and Print Centers, Hyatt hotels and resorts, Red Roof Inns, Sofitel hotels, Novotel hotels, the airline clubs of American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and US Airways, and airports.[86]
The T-Mobile HotSpots network can be traced to the company's 2002 purchase of bankrupt wireless ISP MobileStar, which began building its network in 1998. After completing the purchase, the company expanded the network into 400 Borders bookstores, as well as 100 of the most-frequented airport clubs and lounges operated by American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and United Airlines.[87][88]
On September 14, 2014, T-Mobile partnered up with GoGo to provide free texting on airplanes for its customers. GoGo services are provided on Delta Airlines, American Airlines, United Airlines, US Airways, Virgin America and Alaska Airlines.[89]
On June 6, 2016, T-Mobile expanded its partnership with GoGo to offer T-Mobile users one hour of free WiFi on customers phones. T-Mobile also included other messaging apps (iMessage, Google Hangouts, WhatsApp and Viber) in addition to SMS texting being provided since September 2014.[90]
Wi-Fi network (private)[edit]
T-Mobile has also used the term to describe Wi-Fi Access Points that it sold to end users to expand their cell phone network to phones equipped to also receive Wi-Fi using a VOIP-like technology. (The models included at least two by Linksys: the WRTU54G-TM and the WRT54G-TM and one by D-Link: the TM-G5240.)
Products and services[edit]
T-Mobile ONE[edit]
In August 2016, T-Mobile introduced T-Mobile ONE. It will be the only rate plan offered in the future, with plans to gradually phase out Simple Choice.[91] It combines unlimited voice minutes, text messaging, and high-speed data (the top 3% of users—currently 32 GB/month—may be deprioritized under congested conditions), replacing Binge On, Music Freedom, and Data Stash. Video streaming is limited to 1.5 Mbps, allowing 480p resolution in most cases, and mobile hotspot (tethering) is limited to 3G speeds. The $10/line/month ONE Plus add-on allows HD streaming and adds 10 GB of mobile hotspot at 4G LTE speeds; the $25/line/month ONE Plus International additionally provides international calling and texting and unlimited mobile hotspot at 4G LTE speeds. Subscribers who do not enable auto-pay are charged a $5/line/month fee; otherwise, as of January 22, 2017, all taxes and regulatory fees are included in the plan cost.[92][93] The plan has been criticized by the Electronic Frontier Foundation and others for potentially violating net neutrality rules and making previously-included features paid extras.[94][95][96] Subscribers on Simple Choice can keep their current plans.[91]
In response to Verizon launching their new Verizon Unlimited Plan, T-Mobile revised their T-Mobile ONE plan to include High Definition (1080p) video streaming and 10 GB of High Speed Mobile Hot Spot data (to be slowed to 3G speeds after using the allowance). Also, their prioritization threshold was raised to 32 GB.
Simple Choice[edit]
In March 2013, T-Mobile introduced a new streamlined plan structure known as Simple Choice for new customers. This is part of an initiative called Un-carrier which drops contracts, subsidized phones, overage fees for data, and early termination fees.[31]
Capping unlimited data users[edit]
On August 31, 2015, T-Mobile announced it will ask users who abuse its unlimited on-smartphone data plan by violating T-Mobile's Terms & Conditions regarding tethering (which like unlimited on-smartphone data, remains unlimited, however, offers a 14 GB high speed allotment before deprioritizing takes effect), by permanently removing user access to unlimited plans and migrating users to a tiered data plan. By doing so, all plans after a select amount of inclusive high-speed data, result in automatic throttled speeds, preventing unlimited high-speed tethering use and abuse of the network. T-Mobile stated that there are a small handful of users who abuse the tethering plan by altering device software and/or the use of an Android app that masks T-Mobile's ability monitoring whether data is on-smartphone, or through smartphone mobile hotspot (tethering) by mimicking all data as on-smartphone use, with some customers abusing the service by using as much as 2 TB per month, causing speed issues for all other customers.[97]
InReach program[edit]
The InReach program[98] provides a free cell phone and a limited number of voice minutes each month for low-income-eligible families (one per family) who do not use Lifeline services offered by any other phone or wireless company. It is funded through the Universal Service Fund,[99] but is only operational in a limited number of states and Puerto Rico.[100]
MetroPCS[edit]
Main article: MetroPCS
MetroPCS was taken over by T-Mobile in 2013, the new company formed T-Mobile US and currently continues to offer prepaid wireless services under the MetroPCS brand.
GoSmart Mobile[edit]
GoSmart Mobile was a T-Mobile branded service that launched in beta on December 7, 2012, and became officially available nationwide on February 19, 2013.[101] GoSmart offered no-contract SIM wireless services. GoSmart Mobile was sold to consumers through dealers who worked as independent contractors under their own company name. Such sellers are known as "Authorized Dealers" with either physical or online stores. In September 2016, T-Mobile sold the brand and 326,000 GoSmart Mobile customers to TracFone Wireless.[102] The customers were reclassified as wholesale subscribers.[103]
Banking Cards[edit]
On January 22, 2014, T-Mobile announced that it would expand its products into banking. T-Mobile would provide Visa card with banking features and a smartphone money management application with reduced-fee or zero-cost services for T-Mobile wireless customers. In addition, customers would have access to over 42,000 ATMs with no fees.[104]
In early 2016 T-mobile decided to discontinue the banking cards. They can no longer be purchased at T-Mobile.
Customer service[edit]

Awards[edit]
From as early as 2004, the company has captured multiple J. D. Power annual awards in the areas of retail sales satisfaction, wireless customer care, and overall customer satisfaction.[4] In 2011, J. D. Power and Associates stated that T-Mobile retail stores achieved the highest ratings among major wireless carriers for customer satisfaction for the fourth consecutive year, performing particularly well in price and promotions.[105] Also in 2011, J. D. Power and Associates ranked T-Mobile USA highest among major providers in wireless customer care for the second consecutive year.[106]
On December 3, 2015, Consumer Reports named T-Mobile the number one American wireless service provider. The results combine data from customer service, voice quality, text messaging services, and data speeds.[8]
On February 6, 2016, T-Mobile was awarded the JD Power Award for customer satisfaction in the full service wireless category for the second year in a row. T-Mobile received the highest score ever in the wireless industry.[107]
Outages[edit]
Sidekick data outage[edit]
Main article: Microsoft data loss 2009
On October 1, 2009, Sidekick users lost all data functionality and some users also experienced personal data loss including contacts, notes, and calendars. On October 8, most data services were restored to some users but the company and Microsoft announced on October 10 that data "almost certainly has been lost as a result of a server failure at Microsoft/Danger."[108] On October 15, Microsoft said it had been able to recover most or all data and would begin to restore it.[109][110] A few weeks later, all Sidekick customers were able to recover their data via Danger's sync website using a restore file, or had the option to wait until data was restored to the device itself. Due to this outage, many users abandoned the Sidekick for another device, or left T-Mobile USA for another carrier entirely.[citation needed]
Network outage[edit]
On November 9, 2009, the company's subscribers lost the ability to send and receive calls and text messages.[111] The company confirmed the outage via Twitter and later stated that five percent of its user base had been affected. It blamed a software error for the service interruption, stating that a backend system software error had generated abnormal congestion on the network. The root cause was determined and steps were taken to update a patch on the backend as a permanent resolution.[112]
On February 13 and March 25, 2015, T-Mobile suffered LTE outages along the east coast causing users to lose data connections.[citation needed]
Marketing[edit]
Jamie Lee Curtis was the spokesperson for T-Mobile USA's predecessor, VoiceStream Wireless, since 1998. VoiceStream's advertising slogan was: "Get more from life". During the transition to the T-Mobile brand, Jamie Lee Curtis continued as spokesperson for a short time and the slogan was changed to "T-Mobile. Get More."
Starting in 2002, the company's spokesperson was Catherine Zeta-Jones who was the main figure in its branding strategy. As of September 2006, Zeta-Jones had officially been dropped as the "face" of the company for its advertising campaigns due to a corporate rebranding strategy.[113] The company also relied on rapper Snoop Dogg as the spokesperson for its T-Mobile Sidekick in a series of commercials late in 2004, the company also released a series of Sidekick phones known as the D-Wade Edition for basketball player Dwyane Wade.
The company is also an official sponsor of the Major League Baseball, National Basketball Association, the NBA Rookie Challenge and the Women's National Basketball Association.
In 2009, it changed its approach to advertising, and moved from the "Get More" slogan to a "Stick Together" slogan to focus more on the personal aspect of staying together with those who matter the most to its customers.[citation needed] The slogan was also meant to promote its MyFaves calling-circle plan. With this the company also ended its relationship with Zeta-Jones, and now use mainly non-celebrity spokespeople (though Dwyane Wade, Charles Barkley, and Dwight Howard are featured in some commercials, in association with the company's sponsorship of the NBA as official wireless provider).
In late May 2009, Zeta-Jones was brought back as a company spokesperson to show customers how to pay less for their wireless plan in a new "Mobile Makeovers" advertising campaign that refers customer to third-party comparison site BillShrink.com.[114][115]
In late 2009, commercials for the T-Mobile MyTouch 3G featured the song "If You Want to Sing Out, Sing Out" by Cat Stevens[116] and celebrities such as Chevy Chase, Molly Shannon, Dana Carvey and Darrell Hammond.[117] Another commercial with the same song performed by a different artist showed Wyclef Jean, Avril Lavigne and Brad Paisley.[118]
Carly Foulkes is the spokeswoman for the myTouch 4G in commercials that parody the Get a Mac campaign. The model is known for Rugby Ralph Lauren ads.[119][120][121] Although Foulkes is often identified with the color pink, T-Mobile actually has a color trademark for the color magenta,[122] and markets itself using its corporate colors.[123][124] Virgin Mobile has, in turn, parodied the Carly Foulkes ads.[125]
In September 2010, the company launched "Kids are free till 2012" for family lines.
On December 1, 2011, a group of 100 Chicago-area women, along with Carly Foulkes, were featured in a flash-mob style performance at Woodfield Mall in Schaumburg, Illinois, where the group, dressed in magenta dresses, sang and danced through the mall's atrium to their cover of (There's No Place Like) Home for the Holidays. The performance was filmed and edited into a holiday commercial, which was a success.
Un-carrier movement[edit]
Starting in 2013, T-Mobile launched the Un-carrier marketing campaign. This movement introduced a slew of new tactics to offer consumers cheaper rate plans, cheaper global coverage, and several other benefits. T-Mobile CEO John Legere laid out an 'Un-Carrier manifesto' highlighting the approach and goals he wanted the company to pursue. One popular Un-carrier move features T-Mobile Tuesdays, where customers are offered a variety of free products and also able to win prizes.[126][127] The most recent Un-carrier campaign is titled 'T-Mobile One'. This is a new family plan offering, replacing all previous plans and is an all inclusive unlimited plan, giving unlimited talk, text and data. The only caveat being video streaming on any device is limited to 480p resolution.[128] CEO John Legere in an interview said "The biggest pain point that a million customers told me about is that they hate data buckets. And we had such success with Binge On that we wanted to turn our company into somebody that's selling a monthly subscription to the internet, all in, unlimited." [129] As of October 7, 2016, about a quarter of the overall account numbers have moved over to T-Mobile One, and about three quarters of new postpaid accounts are activating on T-Mobile One.
Labor relations[edit]
T-Mobile US employees and two labor unions have led multiple unionization attempts beginning as early as 2001.

Hundreds of T-Mobile employees, with the backing of the Communications Workers of America (CWA) and the German union ver.di, have joined together as TU to gain representation at T-Mobile.[130] In July, 2011, technicians in Connecticut, voted for representation by the Communications Workers of America-TU.[131] On September 25, 2013, MetroPCS workers in Harlem, NY, voted for a union voice and representation by CWA-TU.[132]
2009 coordinated organizing effort[edit]

In 2008, the CWA and ver.di launched a coordinated effort to unionize company employees. A spokesman for the CWA called on the company to stop resisting mobilization efforts and allow company employees to unionize as German employees of T-Mobile USA's parent company, DT, have done. In response, the company released an employee satisfaction study showing that more than seventy percent of the company's 40,000 workers were "very satisfied" with their jobs. Through a spokesman, the company stated, "Despite the Communication Workers of America's periodic organizing efforts for more than nine years, no group of T-Mobile employees has ever chosen to be represented by a union. While our company is always striving to find ways to improve, year after year, employees continue to view T-Mobile as a good place to work where they have no need for, or interest in, a union."[131]
Political pressure[edit]
In 2009, a number of politicians, in one case acting after lobbying efforts by CWA union activists, wrote letters to René Obermann, DT's chief executive officer, in an effort to influence T-Mobile USA's labor practices in the U.S.[133]
In a March 13, 2009, letter, U.S. Senator John Kerry (D-MA) asked "why the company's approach to labor rights are different in Germany than in the United States". In an April 30, 2010, letter sent after lobbying by Communications Workers of America activists, 26 Democratic members of Congress called on DT to protect and respect workers' rights in the U.S.[133] A separate July 1, 2010, letter from seven Republicans addressed the same issue.[134][135] On August 10, 2010, U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) released a statement in support of the worker's efforts to organize a union at the company.[136] In a letter, dated September 21, 2010, fifteen Californian Members of Congress urged Obermann to take action and implement fair and equitable labor relations.[citation needed]
In a November 5, 2009, letter, Thomas DiNapoli, New York State Comptroller and Trustee of the New York State Common Retirement Fund, stated concerns about "the potential impact on the value of T-Mobile that may result from a disenfranchised workforce and the associated negative publicity that may impact T-Mobile's profitability."[citation needed]
Reports[edit]




A Cover image of a report written by John Logan and published in 2009 by American Rights at Work


On December 9, 2009, the non-profit organization American Rights at Work published a report written by Prof. John Logan, Director of Labor Studies at San Francisco State University, titled "Lowering the Bar or Setting the Standard? Deutsche Telekom's U.S. Labor Practices". The report details behavior by the company that the author perceives as anti-union including dissemination of anti-union materials, intimidation and threats directed at pro-union workers, "captive audience meetings" and the retention of anti-union specialists.[137] In the report, which is based on documents from the National Labor Relations Board, internal company memos and handbooks, and interviews with workers, Logan asserts that the company engaged in a systematic campaign to prevent employees from forming a union and that DT was guilty of operating by a double standard. He claims that Deutsche Telekom respects workers' rights in Germany, where it cooperates closely with unions, but mistreats workers in the United States and interferes with their right to organize.[clarification needed][138]
On September 2, 2010, Human Rights Watch released a report written by Lance Compa titled "A Strange Case: Violations of Workers' Freedom of Association in the United States by European Multinational Corporations". The report concludes that "company policy has translated into practices that leave the workforce fearful about even seeking union representation."[139] DT proclaims its adherence to international labor law and standards that are embodied in German domestic laws. But HRW found that "T-Mobile USA's harsh opposition to workers' freedom of association in the United States betrays Deutsche Telekom's purported commitment to social responsibility, impedes constructive dialogue with employee representatives, and in several cases, has violated ILO and OECD labor and human rights standards".[140]
Workplace activities[edit]
At the company's Allentown, Pennsylvania, call center, security guards were ordered by company managers to write up incident reports whenever union supporters appeared on nearby public grounds and to record the license plate numbers of employees who stopped to take leaflets. In 2006, the National Labor Relations Board found that these activities violated Section 8(a)(1) of the National Labor Relations Act.[141]
In 2008, company management in the Pacific Northwest and Southwest Retail Divisions sent a memorandum to store managers instructing them to immediately report any union activity to their supervisors.[142] Human Rights Watch states, "The NLRB has long held that such activity interferes with, restrains, and coerces employees in the exercise of Section 7 rights in violation of workers' right to freedom of association."[143]
Information Security[edit]
Nicolas Jacobsen was charged with intruding into the company's internal network in January 2005.[144] Reports indicated that for about a year Jacobsen had access to customer passwords, e-mail, address books, Social Security numbers, birth dates, and Sidekick photos. Affected customers included members of the United States Secret Service. Secret Service informant identified Jacobsen as part of "Operation Firewall" which provided evidence that Jacobsen had attempted to sell customer information to others for identity theft. T-Mobile USA and the Secret Service did not elaborate on the methods Jacobsen used to gain access but sources close to the case indicated that Jacobsen exploited an unpatched flaw in the Oracle WebLogic Server application software used by the company.[145] Additional SQL injection vulnerabilities with the company's web site were reported by Jack Koziol of the InfoSec Institute.[146]
T-Mobile offers access to voice mail without the input of a password by default. Parties acting in bad faith may be able to access such voice mailboxes via Caller ID spoofing. To avoid this possibility, T-Mobile recommends that all customers password protect their mailboxes, but still offers the no password configuration by default due to customer demand.[147]
On June 6, 2009, a message posted from an email account "pwnmobile_at_Safe-mail.net" to the Full Disclosure mailing list claimed that the company's network had been breached and showed sample data. The sender offered "databases, confidential documents, scripts and programs from their servers, financial documents up to 2009" to the highest bidder.[148][149] On June 9, the company issued a statement confirming the breach but stating that customer data was safe. It claimed to have identified the source document for the sample data and believe it was not obtained by hacking.[150] A later statement claimed that there was not any evidence of a breach.[151]
Privacy and surveillance[edit]
T-Mobile USA received a portion of the 1.3 million largely warrantless law enforcement requests for subscriber information (including text messages and phone location data) made in 2011, but refused to state how many requests it received.[152] It did say that in the last decade, the number of requests have increased by 12 to 16 percent annually.[153]
Data retention policies[edit]
According to T-Mobile's privacy policy highlights, "Retention and Disposal", information is retained for as long as there is business or tax need or as applicable laws, regulations, or government orders require. T-Mobile notes that it disposes of Personal Information, uses reasonable procedures designed to erase or render it unreadable (for example, shredding documents and wiping electronic media).[154]
In 2010, the Department of Justice (DOJ) released a document entitled, "Retention Periods of Major Cellular Providers," to advise law enforcement agents seeking to obtain cell phone records. This document was uncovered by the ACLU's coordinated records request on cell phone location tracking by police. Notably, the document showed that T-Mobile subscriber information was retained for 5 years and call detail records were kept for 2 years (prepaid) and 5 years (postpaid).[155]
In 2013, Massachusetts Sen. Edward Markey revealed responses from the top four U.S. wireless providers as well as U.S. Cellular, C Spire, and Cricket/Leap Wireless, to his inquiry regarding user information disclosed to law enforcement officials. The following was T-Mobile's response regarding data retention: T-Mobile US retains customers' historic cell site information and cell tower dump information (180 days); call details records (7–10 years); text message content, data requests, and geo-location data not stored; voicemail content (up to 21 days); subscriber information (6 years after account is closed).[156]
Comparing the 2010 DOJ memo released by the ACLU and Massachusetts Senator Edward Markey's 2013 wireless data retention disclosures, it should be noted that T-Mobile increased the retention period for subscriber information from 5 years to 6 years. T-Mobile also increased its call detail record retention from 2 years (prepaid) and 5 years (postpaid) to 7–10 years.

T-Mobile US is a major wireless network operator in the United States. The German telecommunications company Deutsche Telekom (DT) is its majority shareholder. Its headquarters are located in Bellevue, Washington, in the Seattle metropolitan area. T-Mobile is the third largest wireless carrier in the United States with 72.6 million customers as of Q1 2017.[2][5]
T-Mobile US provides wireless voice and data services in the United States, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands under the T-Mobile and MetroPCS brands (which it acquired in a reverse takeover in 2013, resulting in the company going public on the NASDAQ stock exchange), and also serves as the host network for many mobile virtual network operators. The company has annual revenues of $37 billion.[2] Its network reaches 98 percent of Americans.[6][7][non-primary source needed] In 2015, Consumer Reports named T-Mobile the number one American wireless carrier.[8] In 2017, T-Mobile was ranked #1 in Customer Service Satisfaction by Nielsen.[9]

History[edit]
T-Mobile US traces its roots to the 1994 establishment of VoiceStream Wireless PCS as a subsidiary of Western Wireless Corporation. Spun off from parent Western Wireless on May 3, 1999, VoiceStream Wireless was purchased by Deutsche Telekom AG in 2001 for $35 billion and renamed T-Mobile USA, Inc. in July, 2002. In 2013, T-Mobile and MetroPCS finalized a merger of the two companies. The two companies began trading as T-Mobile US[10][11][12] [13]
VoiceStream Wireless[edit]
VoiceStream Wireless PCS was established in 1994 as a subsidiary of Western Wireless Corporation to provide digital wireless personal communications services (PCS) in 19 FCC-defined metropolitan service areas in several western and southwestern states.[14] VoiceStream Wireless' digital, urban service areas complemented the analog, rural service areas marketed by Western Wireless under the Cellular One brand.[15]
Western Wireless spun off its VoiceStream Wireless division into a new company called VoiceStream Wireless Corporation in May 1999.[16]
Omnipoint and Aerial acquisitions[edit]
In 2000, VoiceStream Wireless acquired two regional GSM carriers. Omnipoint Corporation, a regional network operator in the Northeastern U.S., was acquired on February 25, 2000. Aerial Communications Inc.; a regional network operator in the Columbus, Houston, Kansas City, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Pittsburgh and Tampa-St. Petersburg-Orlando markets; was acquired on May 4, 2000.[17] The combined company retired the Omnipoint and Aerial brands and completed integrating the three companies by converting to a single customer billing platform, implementing standard business practices and launching the VoiceStream brand and "GET MORE" marketing strategy in all markets.[18]
Deutsche Telekom acquires VoiceStream and Powertel[edit]

On June 1, 2001, Deutsche Telekom (DT) completed the acquisition of VoiceStream Wireless Inc. for $35 billion and Southern U.S. regional GSM network operator Powertel, Inc. for $24 billion. By the end of 2001, VoiceStream Wireless had 19,000 employees serving 7 million subscribers.
On September 2, 2001, VoiceStream Wireless Inc. took the name, T-Mobile USA, Inc. and began rolling out the T-Mobile brand, starting with locations in California and Nevada.[19] T-Mobile USA, Inc. was an operating entity of T-Mobile International AG,[4] before becoming a direct subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom AG.[20]
SunCom acquisition[edit]
On September 17, 2007, the company announced the acquisition of SunCom Wireless Holdings, Inc. for $2.4 billion; the acquisition closed on February 22, 2008. By September 8, 2008, SunCom's operations were integrated with those of the company. The acquisition added SunCom's 1.1 million customers to the company's customer base and expanded the company's network coverage to include southern Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, eastern Tennessee, northeastern Georgia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
Attempted acquisition by AT&T[edit]
Main article: Attempted purchase of T-Mobile USA by AT&T
On March 20, 2011, DT accepted a $39 billion stock and cash purchase offer from AT&T for the company. The acquisition was subject to regulatory approvals, a reverse breakup fee in certain circumstances, and customary regulatory and closing conditions.[11][21][22][23]
If the merger had been completed, AT&T Mobility would have had a customer base of approximately 130 million users, making it the largest wireless carrier in the U.S.[11]
On August 31, 2011, the United States Department of Justice sued to block AT&T's merger with T-Mobile on the grounds that it would "substantially lessen competition" in the wireless market.[24] Further reports indicated that the FCC would likely oppose the merger.[25]
On December 19, 2011, in the face of this heavy resistance from the U.S. government, AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson announced that the company had officially withdrawn its $39 billion bid.[26] In an official statement, Stephenson addressed the continuing spectrum shortage (due to a significant increase in wireless demand), hinting that the company will continue to seek other options to solve the shortage in the short term.[27]
Merger with MetroPCS Communications[edit]
On October 3, 2012, MetroPCS Communications reached an agreement to merge with T-Mobile USA. MetroPCS shareholders would hold a 26% stake in the merged company, which retained the T-Mobile brand. While the merged company was still the fourth largest carrier in the United States (at the time), the acquisition gave T-Mobile access to more spectrum and financial resources to maintain competitiveness and expand its LTE network.[28] The merger between T-Mobile USA Inc. and MetroPCS was officially approved by MetroPCS shareholders on April 24, 2013. The deal was structured as a reverse takeover; the combined company went public on the New York Stock Exchange as TMUS and became known as T-Mobile US, Inc., on May 1, 2013.[29] The merger agreement gave Deutsche Telekom the option to sell its 72% stake in the merged company, valued at around $14.2 billion, to a third party before the end of the 18-month lock-up period.[30]
The "Un-carrier", additional wireless spectrum acquisition[edit]
In March 2013, T-Mobile introduced a major overhaul of its plan structure, marketed by branding themselves as being "the Un-carrier". Among the changes, a new contract-free pricing structure with simpler plans were introduced, in which a phone's cost is paid over a two-year financing plan.[31] The "Un-carrier" strategy has since been expanded to encompass other value-added services, such as a plan add-on allowing phone trade-ins for early upgrades twice per year,[32] carrying over unused data allotments for up to a year,[33] and zero-rating of selected music and video services (the latter locked to "DVD quality") over the mobile network,[34][35] These moves came as part of an effort under new CEO John Legere to help revitalize the business as it improves its network quality.[31]
On June 28, 2013, T-Mobile agreed to buy wireless spectrum for the Mississippi Valley region from competitor U.S. Cellular for around $308 million, allowing the company to expand its 4G network across a further 29 markets.[36]
On January 6, 2014, T-Mobile signed agreements with Verizon Wireless to purchase some 700 MHz A-Block spectrum licenses for $2.365 billion. Further, a transfer of some AWS and PCS spectrum licenses with a value of $950 million has been agreed upon by T-Mobile and Verizon. The acquisition reportedly gave T-Mobile additional coverage for approximately 158 million people in 9 of the top 10 and 21 of the top 30 U.S. markets.[37]
Attempted acquisition by Sprint[edit]
In December 2013, multiple reports indicated that Sprint Corporation and its parent company Softbank were working towards a deal to acquire a majority stake in T-Mobile for at least US$20 billion. The proposed merger, which would result in the country's major national carriers being controlled by only three companies, would further bolster T-Mobile's position in the overall market.[38][39][40] Members of the government were skeptical that such an acquisition would be approved by regulators, citing antitrust concerns and an explicit goal by FCC chairman Tom Wheeler to maintain four national carriers in the United States.[41][42] On April 30, 2014, Bloomberg reported that Sprint was in talks with its lenders to ensure that the company would be financially prepared for the bid, now valued at $24 billion and planned for "summer 2014". It was also reported that due to his success within the company, current T-Mobile CEO John Legere was the top contender to be named CEO of a merged Sprint/T-Mobile, and that Sprint had insisted on a low termination fee to prevent regulators from being given an incentive to block the deal, as had occurred with AT&T's failed attempt to purchase T-Mobile.[43]
On August 1, 2014, Xavier Niel's Iliad SA publicly announced a US$16 billion all-cash counter-bid to acquire a 56% stake in T-Mobile US, which would be funded using equity and debt. Iliad is the parent company of French carrier Free Mobile, which had—similarly to T-Mobile, performed disruptive business moves to undercut its competitors, triggering a "price war" among them upon its launch in 2012. Credit Suisse analysts felt that the bid would not be "attractive" to the company's current shareholders due to its lower value in comparison to Sprint's bid, but could "put pressure on Sprint to move sooner rather [than] later."[44][45]
On August 4, 2014, Bloomberg reported that Sprint had abandoned its bid to acquire T-Mobile, considering the unlikelihood that such a deal would be approved by the U.S. government and its regulators.[46]
On February 17, 2017, it was reported by Reuters that Softbank was considering selling its majority share in Sprint to Deutsche Telekom (an effective reversal of the original deal), citing struggling growth in the U.S. market, and a higher likelihood that the deal would be approved by the Trump administration.[47]
Wireless networks[edit]
The company owns licenses to operate a cellular communications network in the 1900 MHz (PCS) and 1700 MHz (AWS) bands with coverage in many parts of the continental U.S., Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, as well as licenses in the 700 MHz (block A) band available in certain parts of the country. With respect to technology, depending on the location, in the 1900 MHz band it deploys GSM, UMTS/HSPA+, and/or LTE (B2); in the 1700 MHz band it deploys UMTS/HSPA+ and/or LTE (B4); and LTE (B12) only in the 700A band. Its LTE network also supports VoLTE. It provides coverage in areas where it does not own radio frequency spectrum licenses via roaming agreements with other operators of compatible networks.
Cellular network[edit]
The company's predecessor, VoiceStream Wireless, began building a regional, 2G, 1900 MHz GSM, circuit switched, digital cellular network in 1994 and first offered service in 1996 in Honolulu and Salt Lake City. From that starting point, the network has expanded in size through acquisitions of other cellular-network operators and additional spectrum purchases. The network has also expanded in capabilities through the introduction of new technologies. VoiceStream upgraded the 1900 MHz network to include packet switching via General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), then increased packet switched data transmission speeds via Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution. In 2006, the company spent $4.2 billion to purchase 120 D, E or F block 1700 MHz AWS licenses[48] and began rolling out 3G UMTS services in those frequency bands. The company upgraded network equipment and back-haul capabilities to enable HSPA (High Speed Packet Access), and later HSPA+ and LTE services.

Packet-switched data upgrade[edit]
Packet-switched data service first became available to users in the form of General Packet Radio Service (GPRS). Packet-switched data speeds increased when Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE) was incorporated into the network. EDGE coverage was available within at least forty percent of the GSM footprint.[49]
Both voice capacity and packet-switched data speeds improved when 3G Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) equipment was installed in the network. On January 5, 2010, the company announced that it had upgraded its entire 3G network to HSPA 7.2 Mbit/s, an improvement from its previous peak of 3.6 Mbit/s. It also said that it planned to be the first U.S. carrier to deploy HSPA+ across its network by mid-2010. The company had finished HSPA+ trials in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and had begun deploying HSPA+ across its network.
3G upgrade / discontinuation[edit]
In September 2006, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) auctioned licenses in the first Advanced Wireless Services band. This band was an area of wireless spectrum, half in the 1700 MHz (1.7 GHz) and half in the 2100 MHz (2.1 GHz) frequencies, that was already in use by government services. The spectrum was planned to become available after the government users migrated to different frequencies.
The auction made numerous licenses available in overlapping market-areas, economic-areas, and regional levels. Each license was individually bid upon, and T-Mobile USA was the winner in 120 license auctions, at an aggregate price of $4.18 billion. As part of its winnings, T-Mobile USA gained nationwide coverage of 1.7 GHz and 2.1 GHz, with numerous areas being supplemented with additional licenses. Examples include New York City, Chicago, and Boston where T-Mobile USA acquired one-third (33 percent) of the available spectrum, or San Francisco, Houston, and Miami where they acquired 45 percent of the available spectrum.[50]
October 6, 2006, two weeks after confirming its winning bids, the company announced its intentions to create a UMTS third-generation, or 3G, cellular network with the spectrum it had won. It said it would utilize and build on the experience of T-Mobile International's European subsidiaries, which already implemented 3G networks. At the time of initial roll-out, the company intended to offer 7.2 Mbit/s service, making the company's 3G network the fastest in the U.S. The upgrade was forecast to cost $2.6 billion, in addition to the $4.12 billion spent to acquire the spectrum licenses.[51]
In the same announcement, the company indicated it had already begun to deploy about half of the upgraded equipment, beginning in major markets such as New York City. With the equipment in place, it would be able to activate its network as soon as the government agencies vacated the spectrum. The company had hoped to have its network activated by mid-2007, but as of September 2007, the government users had not vacated the AWS band.[51]
The company began selling its first 3G-capable phone, the Nokia 6263, in November 2007 and announced in February 2008 that its 3G network would finally be activated "within the next few months".[52][53] and released in the New York City market on May 1, 2008.[54]
By 2009, the company had launched its 3G network in more than 200 markets, covering some 208 million points of presence (POPS).[55] Throughout 2015, T-Mobile began refarming UMTS/HSPA services from the original AWS band to their PCS band to expand bandwidth available for LTE. This rendered a select number of T-Mobile 3G devices inoperable on the 3G network.[56]
HSPA/HSPA+ upgrade[edit]
On June 28, 2010, the company announced that it would begin to upgrade its network from HSPA+ 21 to HSPA+ 42 beginning sometime in 2011.[57] T-Mobile marketed HSPA+ services as 4G.[58]
4G LTE upgrade[edit]
On February 23, 2012, during the Q4 Earnings Call, T-Mobile laid out the future of their 4G upgrade path. They would roll out the LTE network on the AWS spectrum, and transition their HSPA+ network to the PCS band. To achieve compatibility with other networks and phones in the USA, T-Mobile began this transition in March 2013, and the rollout of LTE is currently underway as T-Mobile expands to more markets.[59] Due to the failed acquisition of T-Mobile USA by AT&T, T-Mobile USA received additional UMTS frequency band IV (AWS) spectrum. On March 26, 2013, T-Mobile began rolling out LTE in 7 markets: Baltimore, San Jose, Washington, D.C., Phoenix, Las Vegas, Kansas City, and Houston.[60]
On August 21, 2012, the FCC approved a deal between T-Mobile and Verizon in which T-Mobile gained additional AWS spectrum licenses in 125 Cellular Market Areas.[61]
On February 25, 2014, T-Mobile announced in their Q4 2013 earnings call that their 4G LTE network covered 209 million people in 273 metro areas. They also planned to start rolling out their 700 MHz A-Block spectrum by the end of 2014, which by the end of the roll out would cover 158 million people. This spectrum led to improved LTE coverage overall in these areas, particularly indoors.[62]
On March 13, 2014, T-Mobile announced a new plan to upgrade its entire 2G/EDGE network to 4G LTE. They expected 50% to be done by the end of 2014, and it to be "substantially complete" by the middle of 2015.[63]
On December 16, 2014, T-Mobile announced during CEO John Legere's Un-carrier 8.0 interview that their 4G LTE network covered 260 million people and their 700 MHz Band 12 LTE had been rolled out in Cleveland, Colorado Springs, Minneapolis, and Washington, D.C. They expected to cover 280 million with LTE by mid-2015 and 300 million by the end of 2015. They also stated that they covered 121 metro areas with their Wideband LTE.[64]
On October 27, 2015, T-Mobile announced in its Q3 2015 earnings call that they covered over 300 million people with LTE, reaching their 2015 end of year goal months ahead of schedule. They had 245 markets with Wideband (at least 15+15 MHz) LTE. They also had 204 markets with Extended Range 700 MHz Band 12 LTE covering around 175 million people. Their coverage map revealed that they now had new native LTE coverage in Montana, the Dakotas, Eastern West Virginia, and Northern Michigan.[65]
On May 25, 2016 T-Mobile announced that it will be purchasing the 700Mhz A-block license (LTE band 12) for the Chicago metro area. When this transaction closes, together with several other pending 700Mhz license acquisitions, T-Mobile expects to possess 700Mhz licenses covering a total of 272 million people, or 84% of the US population – including 10 of the top 10 largest US metro areas. T-Mobile refers to its 700Mhz low-band network as 'Extended-range LTE' and claims it penetrates buildings and reaches out farther than its PCS and AWS only network.[66] In September 2016, T-Mobile launched 4x4 MIMO and 3 channel carrier aggregation allowing theoretical speeds of 400 Mbit/s, and also announced that the company's LTE network reaches over 312 million potential subscribers.[67]
Roaming[edit]
T-Mobile has roaming arrangements with a number of national and regional mobile network operators, including AT&T Mobility.
As of 2008, prepaid customers have almost all of the postpaid domestic roaming privileges and restricted international roaming to Canada and Mexico.[68]
On June 29, 2010, the company launched voice service in the Gulf of Mexico on GSM via roaming agreement through Broadpoint. T-Mobile USA was scheduled to launch data service in Fall 2010.[69]
In 2009, T-Mobile USA began removing AT&T Mobility roaming coverage in many locations across the country, and updated its on-line coverage maps[70][71] to reflect the smaller coverage area. AT&T Mobility roaming remains available in select locations, primarily on smaller carriers that were acquired by AT&T Mobility after long-term roaming contracts were in place between T-Mobile and the smaller carriers, including Centennial Wireless and Edge Wireless.
On October 9, 2013, T-Mobile announced Simple Global, a service included with eligible Simple Choice plans. This service allows one to roam in over 100 countries with unlimited text and speed-limited data, and make calls at $0.20/minute. High-speed data passes will be available for purchase.[72] On March 7, 2014, T-Mobile announced this number will be increasing to 122 countries.[73] If one is connected to WiFi in one of these countries, and their phone supports WiFi calling, all calls and texts to and from the USA are free, and work the same as if they were on the cellular network.[74]
On July 15, 2015, T-Mobile announced Mobile Without Borders, a service included with all new T-Mobile plans and available as an add-on to grandfathered or promotional plans for $10. This service allows the user to use their normal voice, text message, and data allotments while roaming in Mexico and Canada. Most T-Mobile services are available while roaming, with the notable exception of using the data in one's Data Stash.
In August 2015, T-Mobile joined the Competitive Carriers Association's Data Services Hub, enabling the company to expand roaming partnerships with over a dozen rural and regional carriers. Smaller carriers will now be able to access T-Mobile's LTE network for roaming and T-Mobile will be able to expand roaming partnerships and extend its footprint with members whose network technologies had previously been incompatible.[75]

T-Mobile HotSpots[edit]
T-Mobile has used the term "Hotspot" to represent various products and technologies.
Wi-Fi network (public)[edit]
The company operates a nationwide Wi-Fi Internet access network under the T-Mobile HotSpots brand. The T-Mobile HotSpots network consists of thousands of Wi-Fi access points installed in businesses, hotels and airports throughout the U.S.
The T-Mobile HotSpot service offers access to a nationwide network of approximately 8,350 access points, installed in venues such as Starbucks coffeehouses, FedEx Office Office and Print Centers, Hyatt hotels and resorts, Red Roof Inns, Sofitel hotels, Novotel hotels, the airline clubs of American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and US Airways, and airports.[86]
The T-Mobile HotSpots network can be traced to the company's 2002 purchase of bankrupt wireless ISP MobileStar, which began building its network in 1998. After completing the purchase, the company expanded the network into 400 Borders bookstores, as well as 100 of the most-frequented airport clubs and lounges operated by American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and United Airlines.[87][88]
On September 14, 2014, T-Mobile partnered up with GoGo to provide free texting on airplanes for its customers. GoGo services are provided on Delta Airlines, American Airlines, United Airlines, US Airways, Virgin America and Alaska Airlines.[89]
On June 6, 2016, T-Mobile expanded its partnership with GoGo to offer T-Mobile users one hour of free WiFi on customers phones. T-Mobile also included other messaging apps (iMessage, Google Hangouts, WhatsApp and Viber) in addition to SMS texting being provided since September 2014.[90]
Wi-Fi network (private)[edit]
T-Mobile has also used the term to describe Wi-Fi Access Points that it sold to end users to expand their cell phone network to phones equipped to also receive Wi-Fi using a VOIP-like technology. (The models included at least two by Linksys: the WRTU54G-TM and the WRT54G-TM and one by D-Link: the TM-G5240.)
Products and services[edit]
T-Mobile ONE[edit]
In August 2016, T-Mobile introduced T-Mobile ONE. It will be the only rate plan offered in the future, with plans to gradually phase out Simple Choice.[91] It combines unlimited voice minutes, text messaging, and high-speed data (the top 3% of users—currently 32 GB/month—may be deprioritized under congested conditions), replacing Binge On, Music Freedom, and Data Stash. Video streaming is limited to 1.5 Mbps, allowing 480p resolution in most cases, and mobile hotspot (tethering) is limited to 3G speeds. The $10/line/month ONE Plus add-on allows HD streaming and adds 10 GB of mobile hotspot at 4G LTE speeds; the $25/line/month ONE Plus International additionally provides international calling and texting and unlimited mobile hotspot at 4G LTE speeds. Subscribers who do not enable auto-pay are charged a $5/line/month fee; otherwise, as of January 22, 2017, all taxes and regulatory fees are included in the plan cost.[92][93] The plan has been criticized by the Electronic Frontier Foundation and others for potentially violating net neutrality rules and making previously-included features paid extras.[94][95][96] Subscribers on Simple Choice can keep their current plans.[91]
In response to Verizon launching their new Verizon Unlimited Plan, T-Mobile revised their T-Mobile ONE plan to include High Definition (1080p) video streaming and 10 GB of High Speed Mobile Hot Spot data (to be slowed to 3G speeds after using the allowance). Also, their prioritization threshold was raised to 32 GB.
Simple Choice[edit]
In March 2013, T-Mobile introduced a new streamlined plan structure known as Simple Choice for new customers. This is part of an initiative called Un-carrier which drops contracts, subsidized phones, overage fees for data, and early termination fees.[31]
Capping unlimited data users[edit]
On August 31, 2015, T-Mobile announced it will ask users who abuse its unlimited on-smartphone data plan by violating T-Mobile's Terms & Conditions regarding tethering (which like unlimited on-smartphone data, remains unlimited, however, offers a 14 GB high speed allotment before deprioritizing takes effect), by permanently removing user access to unlimited plans and migrating users to a tiered data plan. By doing so, all plans after a select amount of inclusive high-speed data, result in automatic throttled speeds, preventing unlimited high-speed tethering use and abuse of the network. T-Mobile stated that there are a small handful of users who abuse the tethering plan by altering device software and/or the use of an Android app that masks T-Mobile's ability monitoring whether data is on-smartphone, or through smartphone mobile hotspot (tethering) by mimicking all data as on-smartphone use, with some customers abusing the service by using as much as 2 TB per month, causing speed issues for all other customers.[97]
InReach program[edit]
The InReach program[98] provides a free cell phone and a limited number of voice minutes each month for low-income-eligible families (one per family) who do not use Lifeline services offered by any other phone or wireless company. It is funded through the Universal Service Fund,[99] but is only operational in a limited number of states and Puerto Rico.[100]
MetroPCS[edit]
Main article: MetroPCS
MetroPCS was taken over by T-Mobile in 2013, the new company formed T-Mobile US and currently continues to offer prepaid wireless services under the MetroPCS brand.
GoSmart Mobile[edit]
GoSmart Mobile was a T-Mobile branded service that launched in beta on December 7, 2012, and became officially available nationwide on February 19, 2013.[101] GoSmart offered no-contract SIM wireless services. GoSmart Mobile was sold to consumers through dealers who worked as independent contractors under their own company name. Such sellers are known as "Authorized Dealers" with either physical or online stores. In September 2016, T-Mobile sold the brand and 326,000 GoSmart Mobile customers to TracFone Wireless.[102] The customers were reclassified as wholesale subscribers.[103]
Banking Cards[edit]
On January 22, 2014, T-Mobile announced that it would expand its products into banking. T-Mobile would provide Visa card with banking features and a smartphone money management application with reduced-fee or zero-cost services for T-Mobile wireless customers. In addition, customers would have access to over 42,000 ATMs with no fees.[104]
In early 2016 T-mobile decided to discontinue the banking cards. They can no longer be purchased at T-Mobile.
Customer service[edit]

Awards[edit]
From as early as 2004, the company has captured multiple J. D. Power annual awards in the areas of retail sales satisfaction, wireless customer care, and overall customer satisfaction.[4] In 2011, J. D. Power and Associates stated that T-Mobile retail stores achieved the highest ratings among major wireless carriers for customer satisfaction for the fourth consecutive year, performing particularly well in price and promotions.[105] Also in 2011, J. D. Power and Associates ranked T-Mobile USA highest among major providers in wireless customer care for the second consecutive year.[106]
On December 3, 2015, Consumer Reports named T-Mobile the number one American wireless service provider. The results combine data from customer service, voice quality, text messaging services, and data speeds.[8]
On February 6, 2016, T-Mobile was awarded the JD Power Award for customer satisfaction in the full service wireless category for the second year in a row. T-Mobile received the highest score ever in the wireless industry.[107]
Outages[edit]
Sidekick data outage[edit]
Main article: Microsoft data loss 2009
On October 1, 2009, Sidekick users lost all data functionality and some users also experienced personal data loss including contacts, notes, and calendars. On October 8, most data services were restored to some users but the company and Microsoft announced on October 10 that data "almost certainly has been lost as a result of a server failure at Microsoft/Danger."[108] On October 15, Microsoft said it had been able to recover most or all data and would begin to restore it.[109][110] A few weeks later, all Sidekick customers were able to recover their data via Danger's sync website using a restore file, or had the option to wait until data was restored to the device itself. Due to this outage, many users abandoned the Sidekick for another device, or left T-Mobile USA for another carrier entirely.[citation needed]
Network outage[edit]
On November 9, 2009, the company's subscribers lost the ability to send and receive calls and text messages.[111] The company confirmed the outage via Twitter and later stated that five percent of its user base had been affected. It blamed a software error for the service interruption, stating that a backend system software error had generated abnormal congestion on the network. The root cause was determined and steps were taken to update a patch on the backend as a permanent resolution.[112]
On February 13 and March 25, 2015, T-Mobile suffered LTE outages along the east coast causing users to lose data connections.[citation needed]
Marketing[edit]
Jamie Lee Curtis was the spokesperson for T-Mobile USA's predecessor, VoiceStream Wireless, since 1998. VoiceStream's advertising slogan was: "Get more from life". During the transition to the T-Mobile brand, Jamie Lee Curtis continued as spokesperson for a short time and the slogan was changed to "T-Mobile. Get More."
Starting in 2002, the company's spokesperson was Catherine Zeta-Jones who was the main figure in its branding strategy. As of September 2006, Zeta-Jones had officially been dropped as the "face" of the company for its advertising campaigns due to a corporate rebranding strategy.[113] The company also relied on rapper Snoop Dogg as the spokesperson for its T-Mobile Sidekick in a series of commercials late in 2004, the company also released a series of Sidekick phones known as the D-Wade Edition for basketball player Dwyane Wade.
The company is also an official sponsor of the Major League Baseball, National Basketball Association, the NBA Rookie Challenge and the Women's National Basketball Association.
In 2009, it changed its approach to advertising, and moved from the "Get More" slogan to a "Stick Together" slogan to focus more on the personal aspect of staying together with those who matter the most to its customers.[citation needed] The slogan was also meant to promote its MyFaves calling-circle plan. With this the company also ended its relationship with Zeta-Jones, and now use mainly non-celebrity spokespeople (though Dwyane Wade, Charles Barkley, and Dwight Howard are featured in some commercials, in association with the company's sponsorship of the NBA as official wireless provider).
In late May 2009, Zeta-Jones was brought back as a company spokesperson to show customers how to pay less for their wireless plan in a new "Mobile Makeovers" advertising campaign that refers customer to third-party comparison site BillShrink.com.[114][115]
In late 2009, commercials for the T-Mobile MyTouch 3G featured the song "If You Want to Sing Out, Sing Out" by Cat Stevens[116] and celebrities such as Chevy Chase, Molly Shannon, Dana Carvey and Darrell Hammond.[117] Another commercial with the same song performed by a different artist showed Wyclef Jean, Avril Lavigne and Brad Paisley.[118]
Carly Foulkes is the spokeswoman for the myTouch 4G in commercials that parody the Get a Mac campaign. The model is known for Rugby Ralph Lauren ads.[119][120][121] Although Foulkes is often identified with the color pink, T-Mobile actually has a color trademark for the color magenta,[122] and markets itself using its corporate colors.[123][124] Virgin Mobile has, in turn, parodied the Carly Foulkes ads.[125]
In September 2010, the company launched "Kids are free till 2012" for family lines.
On December 1, 2011, a group of 100 Chicago-area women, along with Carly Foulkes, were featured in a flash-mob style performance at Woodfield Mall in Schaumburg, Illinois, where the group, dressed in magenta dresses, sang and danced through the mall's atrium to their cover of (There's No Place Like) Home for the Holidays. The performance was filmed and edited into a holiday commercial, which was a success.
Un-carrier movement[edit]
Starting in 2013, T-Mobile launched the Un-carrier marketing campaign. This movement introduced a slew of new tactics to offer consumers cheaper rate plans, cheaper global coverage, and several other benefits. T-Mobile CEO John Legere laid out an 'Un-Carrier manifesto' highlighting the approach and goals he wanted the company to pursue. One popular Un-carrier move features T-Mobile Tuesdays, where customers are offered a variety of free products and also able to win prizes.[126][127] The most recent Un-carrier campaign is titled 'T-Mobile One'. This is a new family plan offering, replacing all previous plans and is an all inclusive unlimited plan, giving unlimited talk, text and data. The only caveat being video streaming on any device is limited to 480p resolution.[128] CEO John Legere in an interview said "The biggest pain point that a million customers told me about is that they hate data buckets. And we had such success with Binge On that we wanted to turn our company into somebody that's selling a monthly subscription to the internet, all in, unlimited." [129] As of October 7, 2016, about a quarter of the overall account numbers have moved over to T-Mobile One, and about three quarters of new postpaid accounts are activating on T-Mobile One.
Labor relations[edit]
T-Mobile US employees and two labor unions have led multiple unionization attempts beginning as early as 2001.
Formation of TU[edit]
Hundreds of T-Mobile employees, with the backing of the Communications Workers of America (CWA) and the German union ver.di, have joined together as TU to gain representation at T-Mobile.[130] In July, 2011, technicians in Connecticut, voted for representation by the Communications Workers of America-TU.[131] On September 25, 2013, MetroPCS workers in Harlem, NY, voted for a union voice and representation by CWA-TU.[132]
2009 coordinated organizing effort[edit]




CWA President Larry Cohen and a disguised, unidentified T-Mobile USA employee pictured at a 2009 press conference announcing a coordinated unionizing effort.


In 2008, the CWA and ver.di launched a coordinated effort to unionize company employees. A spokesman for the CWA called on the company to stop resisting mobilization efforts and allow company employees to unionize as German employees of T-Mobile USA's parent company, DT, have done. In response, the company released an employee satisfaction study showing that more than seventy percent of the company's 40,000 workers were "very satisfied" with their jobs. Through a spokesman, the company stated, "Despite the Communication Workers of America's periodic organizing efforts for more than nine years, no group of T-Mobile employees has ever chosen to be represented by a union. While our company is always striving to find ways to improve, year after year, employees continue to view T-Mobile as a good place to work where they have no need for, or interest in, a union."[131]
Political pressure[edit]
In 2009, a number of politicians, in one case acting after lobbying efforts by CWA union activists, wrote letters to René Obermann, DT's chief executive officer, in an effort to influence T-Mobile USA's labor practices in the U.S.[133]
In a March 13, 2009, letter, U.S. Senator John Kerry (D-MA) asked "why the company's approach to labor rights are different in Germany than in the United States". In an April 30, 2010, letter sent after lobbying by Communications Workers of America activists, 26 Democratic members of Congress called on DT to protect and respect workers' rights in the U.S.[133] A separate July 1, 2010, letter from seven Republicans addressed the same issue.[134][135] On August 10, 2010, U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) released a statement in support of the worker's efforts to organize a union at the company.[136] In a letter, dated September 21, 2010, fifteen Californian Members of Congress urged Obermann to take action and implement fair and equitable labor relations.[citation needed]
In a November 5, 2009, letter, Thomas DiNapoli, New York State Comptroller and Trustee of the New York State Common Retirement Fund, stated concerns about "the potential impact on the value of T-Mobile that may result from a disenfranchised workforce and the associated negative publicity that may impact T-Mobile's profitability."[citation needed]
Reports[edit]




A Cover image of a report written by John Logan and published in 2009 by American Rights at Work


On December 9, 2009, the non-profit organization American Rights at Work published a report written by Prof. John Logan, Director of Labor Studies at San Francisco State University, titled "Lowering the Bar or Setting the Standard? Deutsche Telekom's U.S. Labor Practices". The report details behavior by the company that the author perceives as anti-union including dissemination of anti-union materials, intimidation and threats directed at pro-union workers, "captive audience meetings" and the retention of anti-union specialists.[137] In the report, which is based on documents from the National Labor Relations Board, internal company memos and handbooks, and interviews with workers, Logan asserts that the company engaged in a systematic campaign to prevent employees from forming a union and that DT was guilty of operating by a double standard. He claims that Deutsche Telekom respects workers' rights in Germany, where it cooperates closely with unions, but mistreats workers in the United States and interferes with their right to organize.[clarification needed][138]
On September 2, 2010, Human Rights Watch released a report written by Lance Compa titled "A Strange Case: Violations of Workers' Freedom of Association in the United States by European Multinational Corporations". The report concludes that "company policy has translated into practices that leave the workforce fearful about even seeking union representation."[139] DT proclaims its adherence to international labor law and standards that are embodied in German domestic laws. But HRW found that "T-Mobile USA's harsh opposition to workers' freedom of association in the United States betrays Deutsche Telekom's purported commitment to social responsibility, impedes constructive dialogue with employee representatives, and in several cases, has violated ILO and OECD labor and human rights standards".[140]
Workplace activities[edit]
At the company's Allentown, Pennsylvania, call center, security guards were ordered by company managers to write up incident reports whenever union supporters appeared on nearby public grounds and to record the license plate numbers of employees who stopped to take leaflets. In 2006, the National Labor Relations Board found that these activities violated Section 8(a)(1) of the National Labor Relations Act.[141]
In 2008, company management in the Pacific Northwest and Southwest Retail Divisions sent a memorandum to store managers instructing them to immediately report any union activity to their supervisors.[142] Human Rights Watch states, "The NLRB has long held that such activity interferes with, restrains, and coerces employees in the exercise of Section 7 rights in violation of workers' right to freedom of association."[143]
Information Security[edit]
Nicolas Jacobsen was charged with intruding into the company's internal network in January 2005.[144] Reports indicated that for about a year Jacobsen had access to customer passwords, e-mail, address books, Social Security numbers, birth dates, and Sidekick photos. Affected customers included members of the United States Secret Service. Secret Service informant identified Jacobsen as part of "Operation Firewall" which provided evidence that Jacobsen had attempted to sell customer information to others for identity theft. T-Mobile USA and the Secret Service did not elaborate on the methods Jacobsen used to gain access but sources close to the case indicated that Jacobsen exploited an unpatched flaw in the Oracle WebLogic Server application software used by the company.[145] Additional SQL injection vulnerabilities with the company's web site were reported by Jack Koziol of the InfoSec Institute.[146]
T-Mobile offers access to voice mail without the input of a password by default. Parties acting in bad faith may be able to access such voice mailboxes via Caller ID spoofing. To avoid this possibility, T-Mobile recommends that all customers password protect their mailboxes, but still offers the no password configuration by default due to customer demand.[147]
On June 6, 2009, a message posted from an email account "pwnmobile_at_Safe-mail.net" to the Full Disclosure mailing list claimed that the company's network had been breached and showed sample data. The sender offered "databases, confidential documents, scripts and programs from their servers, financial documents up to 2009" to the highest bidder.[148][149] On June 9, the company issued a statement confirming the breach but stating that customer data was safe. It claimed to have identified the source document for the sample data and believe it was not obtained by hacking.[150] A later statement claimed that there was not any evidence of a breach.[151]
Privacy and surveillance[edit]
T-Mobile USA received a portion of the 1.3 million largely warrantless law enforcement requests for subscriber information (including text messages and phone location data) made in 2011, but refused to state how many requests it received.[152] It did say that in the last decade, the number of requests have increased by 12 to 16 percent annually.[153]
Data retention policies[edit]
According to T-Mobile's privacy policy highlights, "Retention and Disposal", information is retained for as long as there is business or tax need or as applicable laws, regulations, or government orders require. T-Mobile notes that it disposes of Personal Information, uses reasonable procedures designed to erase or render it unreadable (for example, shredding documents and wiping electronic media).[154]
In 2010, the Department of Justice (DOJ) released a document entitled, "Retention Periods of Major Cellular Providers," to advise law enforcement agents seeking to obtain cell phone records. This document was uncovered by the ACLU's coordinated records request on cell phone location tracking by police. Notably, the document showed that T-Mobile subscriber information was retained for 5 years and call detail records were kept for 2 years (prepaid) and 5 years (postpaid).[155]
In 2013, Massachusetts Sen. Edward Markey revealed responses from the top four U.S. wireless providers as well as U.S. Cellular, C Spire, and Cricket/Leap Wireless, to his inquiry regarding user information disclosed to law enforcement officials. The following was T-Mobile's response regarding data retention: T-Mobile US retains customers' historic cell site information and cell tower dump information (180 days); call details records (7–10 years); text message content, data requests, and geo-location data not stored; voicemail content (up to 21 days); subscriber information (6 years after account is closed).[156]
Comparing the 2010 DOJ memo released by the ACLU and Massachusetts Senator Edward Markey's 2013 wireless data retention disclosures, it should be noted that T-Mobile increased the retention period for subscriber information from 5 years to 6 years. T-Mobile also increased its call detail record retention from 2 years (prepaid) and 5 years (postpaid) to 7–10 years.

T-Mobile US is a major wireless network operator in the United States. The German telecommunications company Deutsche Telekom (DT) is its majority shareholder. Its headquarters are located in Bellevue, Washington, in the Seattle metropolitan area. T-Mobile is the third largest wireless carrier in the United States with 72.6 million customers as of Q1 2017.[2][5]
T-Mobile US provides wireless voice and data services in the United States, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands under the T-Mobile and MetroPCS brands (which it acquired in a reverse takeover in 2013, resulting in the company going public on the NASDAQ stock exchange), and also serves as the host network for many mobile virtual network operators. The company has annual revenues of $37 billion.[2] Its network reaches 98 percent of Americans.[6][7][non-primary source needed] In 2015, Consumer Reports named T-Mobile the number one American wireless carrier.[8] In 2017, T-Mobile was ranked #1 in Customer Service Satisfaction by Nielsen.[9]

History[edit]
T-Mobile US traces its roots to the 1994 establishment of VoiceStream Wireless PCS as a subsidiary of Western Wireless Corporation. Spun off from parent Western Wireless on May 3, 1999, VoiceStream Wireless was purchased by Deutsche Telekom AG in 2001 for $35 billion and renamed T-Mobile USA, Inc. in July, 2002. In 2013, T-Mobile and MetroPCS finalized a merger of the two companies. The two companies began trading as T-Mobile US[10][11][12] [13]
VoiceStream Wireless[edit]
VoiceStream Wireless PCS was established in 1994 as a subsidiary of Western Wireless Corporation to provide digital wireless personal communications services (PCS) in 19 FCC-defined metropolitan service areas in several western and southwestern states.[14] VoiceStream Wireless' digital, urban service areas complemented the analog, rural service areas marketed by Western Wireless under the Cellular One brand.[15]
Western Wireless spun off its VoiceStream Wireless division into a new company called VoiceStream Wireless Corporation in May 1999.[16]
Omnipoint and Aerial acquisitions[edit]
In 2000, VoiceStream Wireless acquired two regional GSM carriers. Omnipoint Corporation, a regional network operator in the Northeastern U.S., was acquired on February 25, 2000. Aerial Communications Inc.; a regional network operator in the Columbus, Houston, Kansas City, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Pittsburgh and Tampa-St. Petersburg-Orlando markets; was acquired on May 4, 2000.[17] The combined company retired the Omnipoint and Aerial brands and completed integrating the three companies by converting to a single customer billing platform, implementing standard business practices and launching the VoiceStream brand and "GET MORE" marketing strategy in all markets.[18]
Deutsche Telekom acquires VoiceStream and Powertel[edit]

On June 1, 2001, Deutsche Telekom (DT) completed the acquisition of VoiceStream Wireless Inc. for $35 billion and Southern U.S. regional GSM network operator Powertel, Inc. for $24 billion. By the end of 2001, VoiceStream Wireless had 19,000 employees serving 7 million subscribers.
On September 2, 2001, VoiceStream Wireless Inc. took the name, T-Mobile USA, Inc. and began rolling out the T-Mobile brand, starting with locations in California and Nevada.[19] T-Mobile USA, Inc. was an operating entity of T-Mobile International AG,[4] before becoming a direct subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom AG.[20]
SunCom acquisition[edit]
On September 17, 2007, the company announced the acquisition of SunCom Wireless Holdings, Inc. for $2.4 billion; the acquisition closed on February 22, 2008. By September 8, 2008, SunCom's operations were integrated with those of the company. The acquisition added SunCom's 1.1 million customers to the company's customer base and expanded the company's network coverage to include southern Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, eastern Tennessee, northeastern Georgia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
Attempted acquisition by AT&T[edit]
Main article: Attempted purchase of T-Mobile USA by AT&T
On March 20, 2011, DT accepted a $39 billion stock and cash purchase offer from AT&T for the company. The acquisition was subject to regulatory approvals, a reverse breakup fee in certain circumstances, and customary regulatory and closing conditions.[11][21][22][23]
If the merger had been completed, AT&T Mobility would have had a customer base of approximately 130 million users, making it the largest wireless carrier in the U.S.[11]
On August 31, 2011, the United States Department of Justice sued to block AT&T's merger with T-Mobile on the grounds that it would "substantially lessen competition" in the wireless market.[24] Further reports indicated that the FCC would likely oppose the merger.[25]
On December 19, 2011, in the face of this heavy resistance from the U.S. government, AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson announced that the company had officially withdrawn its $39 billion bid.[26] In an official statement, Stephenson addressed the continuing spectrum shortage (due to a significant increase in wireless demand), hinting that the company will continue to seek other options to solve the shortage in the short term.[27]
Merger with MetroPCS Communications[edit]
On October 3, 2012, MetroPCS Communications reached an agreement to merge with T-Mobile USA. MetroPCS shareholders would hold a 26% stake in the merged company, which retained the T-Mobile brand. While the merged company was still the fourth largest carrier in the United States (at the time), the acquisition gave T-Mobile access to more spectrum and financial resources to maintain competitiveness and expand its LTE network.[28] The merger between T-Mobile USA Inc. and MetroPCS was officially approved by MetroPCS shareholders on April 24, 2013. The deal was structured as a reverse takeover; the combined company went public on the New York Stock Exchange as TMUS and became known as T-Mobile US, Inc., on May 1, 2013.[29] The merger agreement gave Deutsche Telekom the option to sell its 72% stake in the merged company, valued at around $14.2 billion, to a third party before the end of the 18-month lock-up period.[30]
The "Un-carrier", additional wireless spectrum acquisition[edit]
In March 2013, T-Mobile introduced a major overhaul of its plan structure, marketed by branding themselves as being "the Un-carrier". Among the changes, a new contract-free pricing structure with simpler plans were introduced, in which a phone's cost is paid over a two-year financing plan.[31] The "Un-carrier" strategy has since been expanded to encompass other value-added services, such as a plan add-on allowing phone trade-ins for early upgrades twice per year,[32] carrying over unused data allotments for up to a year,[33] and zero-rating of selected music and video services (the latter locked to "DVD quality") over the mobile network,[34][35] These moves came as part of an effort under new CEO John Legere to help revitalize the business as it improves its network quality.[31]
On June 28, 2013, T-Mobile agreed to buy wireless spectrum for the Mississippi Valley region from competitor U.S. Cellular for around $308 million, allowing the company to expand its 4G network across a further 29 markets.[36]
On January 6, 2014, T-Mobile signed agreements with Verizon Wireless to purchase some 700 MHz A-Block spectrum licenses for $2.365 billion. Further, a transfer of some AWS and PCS spectrum licenses with a value of $950 million has been agreed upon by T-Mobile and Verizon. The acquisition reportedly gave T-Mobile additional coverage for approximately 158 million people in 9 of the top 10 and 21 of the top 30 U.S. markets.[37]
Attempted acquisition by Sprint[edit]
In December 2013, multiple reports indicated that Sprint Corporation and its parent company Softbank were working towards a deal to acquire a majority stake in T-Mobile for at least US$20 billion. The proposed merger, which would result in the country's major national carriers being controlled by only three companies, would further bolster T-Mobile's position in the overall market.[38][39][40] Members of the government were skeptical that such an acquisition would be approved by regulators, citing antitrust concerns and an explicit goal by FCC chairman Tom Wheeler to maintain four national carriers in the United States.[41][42] On April 30, 2014, Bloomberg reported that Sprint was in talks with its lenders to ensure that the company would be financially prepared for the bid, now valued at $24 billion and planned for "summer 2014". It was also reported that due to his success within the company, current T-Mobile CEO John Legere was the top contender to be named CEO of a merged Sprint/T-Mobile, and that Sprint had insisted on a low termination fee to prevent regulators from being given an incentive to block the deal, as had occurred with AT&T's failed attempt to purchase T-Mobile.[43]
On August 1, 2014, Xavier Niel's Iliad SA publicly announced a US$16 billion all-cash counter-bid to acquire a 56% stake in T-Mobile US, which would be funded using equity and debt. Iliad is the parent company of French carrier Free Mobile, which had—similarly to T-Mobile, performed disruptive business moves to undercut its competitors, triggering a "price war" among them upon its launch in 2012. Credit Suisse analysts felt that the bid would not be "attractive" to the company's current shareholders due to its lower value in comparison to Sprint's bid, but could "put pressure on Sprint to move sooner rather [than] later."[44][45]
On August 4, 2014, Bloomberg reported that Sprint had abandoned its bid to acquire T-Mobile, considering the unlikelihood that such a deal would be approved by the U.S. government and its regulators.[46]
On February 17, 2017, it was reported by Reuters that Softbank was considering selling its majority share in Sprint to Deutsche Telekom (an effective reversal of the original deal), citing struggling growth in the U.S. market, and a higher likelihood that the deal would be approved by the Trump administration.[47]
Wireless networks[edit]
The company owns licenses to operate a cellular communications network in the 1900 MHz (PCS) and 1700 MHz (AWS) bands with coverage in many parts of the continental U.S., Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, as well as licenses in the 700 MHz (block A) band available in certain parts of the country. With respect to technology, depending on the location, in the 1900 MHz band it deploys GSM, UMTS/HSPA+, and/or LTE (B2); in the 1700 MHz band it deploys UMTS/HSPA+ and/or LTE (B4); and LTE (B12) only in the 700A band. Its LTE network also supports VoLTE. It provides coverage in areas where it does not own radio frequency spectrum licenses via roaming agreements with other operators of compatible networks.
Cellular network[edit]
The company's predecessor, VoiceStream Wireless, began building a regional, 2G, 1900 MHz GSM, circuit switched, digital cellular network in 1994 and first offered service in 1996 in Honolulu and Salt Lake City. From that starting point, the network has expanded in size through acquisitions of other cellular-network operators and additional spectrum purchases. The network has also expanded in capabilities through the introduction of new technologies. VoiceStream upgraded the 1900 MHz network to include packet switching via General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), then increased packet switched data transmission speeds via Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution. In 2006, the company spent $4.2 billion to purchase 120 D, E or F block 1700 MHz AWS licenses[48] and began rolling out 3G UMTS services in those frequency bands. The company upgraded network equipment and back-haul capabilities to enable HSPA (High Speed Packet Access), and later HSPA+ and LTE services.

Packet-switched data upgrade[edit]
Packet-switched data service first became available to users in the form of General Packet Radio Service (GPRS). Packet-switched data speeds increased when Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE) was incorporated into the network. EDGE coverage was available within at least forty percent of the GSM footprint.[49]
Both voice capacity and packet-switched data speeds improved when 3G Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) equipment was installed in the network. On January 5, 2010, the company announced that it had upgraded its entire 3G network to HSPA 7.2 Mbit/s, an improvement from its previous peak of 3.6 Mbit/s. It also said that it planned to be the first U.S. carrier to deploy HSPA+ across its network by mid-2010. The company had finished HSPA+ trials in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and had begun deploying HSPA+ across its network.
3G upgrade / discontinuation[edit]
In September 2006, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) auctioned licenses in the first Advanced Wireless Services band. This band was an area of wireless spectrum, half in the 1700 MHz (1.7 GHz) and half in the 2100 MHz (2.1 GHz) frequencies, that was already in use by government services. The spectrum was planned to become available after the government users migrated to different frequencies.
The auction made numerous licenses available in overlapping market-areas, economic-areas, and regional levels. Each license was individually bid upon, and T-Mobile USA was the winner in 120 license auctions, at an aggregate price of $4.18 billion. As part of its winnings, T-Mobile USA gained nationwide coverage of 1.7 GHz and 2.1 GHz, with numerous areas being supplemented with additional licenses. Examples include New York City, Chicago, and Boston where T-Mobile USA acquired one-third (33 percent) of the available spectrum, or San Francisco, Houston, and Miami where they acquired 45 percent of the available spectrum.[50]
October 6, 2006, two weeks after confirming its winning bids, the company announced its intentions to create a UMTS third-generation, or 3G, cellular network with the spectrum it had won. It said it would utilize and build on the experience of T-Mobile International's European subsidiaries, which already implemented 3G networks. At the time of initial roll-out, the company intended to offer 7.2 Mbit/s service, making the company's 3G network the fastest in the U.S. The upgrade was forecast to cost $2.6 billion, in addition to the $4.12 billion spent to acquire the spectrum licenses.[51]
In the same announcement, the company indicated it had already begun to deploy about half of the upgraded equipment, beginning in major markets such as New York City. With the equipment in place, it would be able to activate its network as soon as the government agencies vacated the spectrum. The company had hoped to have its network activated by mid-2007, but as of September 2007, the government users had not vacated the AWS band.[51]
The company began selling its first 3G-capable phone, the Nokia 6263, in November 2007 and announced in February 2008 that its 3G network would finally be activated "within the next few months".[52][53] and released in the New York City market on May 1, 2008.[54]
By 2009, the company had launched its 3G network in more than 200 markets, covering some 208 million points of presence (POPS).[55] Throughout 2015, T-Mobile began refarming UMTS/HSPA services from the original AWS band to their PCS band to expand bandwidth available for LTE. This rendered a select number of T-Mobile 3G devices inoperable on the 3G network.[56]
HSPA/HSPA+ upgrade[edit]
On June 28, 2010, the company announced that it would begin to upgrade its network from HSPA+ 21 to HSPA+ 42 beginning sometime in 2011.[57] T-Mobile marketed HSPA+ services as 4G.[58]
4G LTE upgrade[edit]
On February 23, 2012, during the Q4 Earnings Call, T-Mobile laid out the future of their 4G upgrade path. They would roll out the LTE network on the AWS spectrum, and transition their HSPA+ network to the PCS band. To achieve compatibility with other networks and phones in the USA, T-Mobile began this transition in March 2013, and the rollout of LTE is currently underway as T-Mobile expands to more markets.[59] Due to the failed acquisition of T-Mobile USA by AT&T, T-Mobile USA received additional UMTS frequency band IV (AWS) spectrum. On March 26, 2013, T-Mobile began rolling out LTE in 7 markets: Baltimore, San Jose, Washington, D.C., Phoenix, Las Vegas, Kansas City, and Houston.[60]
On August 21, 2012, the FCC approved a deal between T-Mobile and Verizon in which T-Mobile gained additional AWS spectrum licenses in 125 Cellular Market Areas.[61]
On February 25, 2014, T-Mobile announced in their Q4 2013 earnings call that their 4G LTE network covered 209 million people in 273 metro areas. They also planned to start rolling out their 700 MHz A-Block spectrum by the end of 2014, which by the end of the roll out would cover 158 million people. This spectrum led to improved LTE coverage overall in these areas, particularly indoors.[62]
On March 13, 2014, T-Mobile announced a new plan to upgrade its entire 2G/EDGE network to 4G LTE. They expected 50% to be done by the end of 2014, and it to be "substantially complete" by the middle of 2015.[63]
On December 16, 2014, T-Mobile announced during CEO John Legere's Un-carrier 8.0 interview that their 4G LTE network covered 260 million people and their 700 MHz Band 12 LTE had been rolled out in Cleveland, Colorado Springs, Minneapolis, and Washington, D.C. They expected to cover 280 million with LTE by mid-2015 and 300 million by the end of 2015. They also stated that they covered 121 metro areas with their Wideband LTE.[64]
On October 27, 2015, T-Mobile announced in its Q3 2015 earnings call that they covered over 300 million people with LTE, reaching their 2015 end of year goal months ahead of schedule. They had 245 markets with Wideband (at least 15+15 MHz) LTE. They also had 204 markets with Extended Range 700 MHz Band 12 LTE covering around 175 million people. Their coverage map revealed that they now had new native LTE coverage in Montana, the Dakotas, Eastern West Virginia, and Northern Michigan.[65]
On May 25, 2016 T-Mobile announced that it will be purchasing the 700Mhz A-block license (LTE band 12) for the Chicago metro area. When this transaction closes, together with several other pending 700Mhz license acquisitions, T-Mobile expects to possess 700Mhz licenses covering a total of 272 million people, or 84% of the US population – including 10 of the top 10 largest US metro areas. T-Mobile refers to its 700Mhz low-band network as 'Extended-range LTE' and claims it penetrates buildings and reaches out farther than its PCS and AWS only network.[66] In September 2016, T-Mobile launched 4x4 MIMO and 3 channel carrier aggregation allowing theoretical speeds of 400 Mbit/s, and also announced that the company's LTE network reaches over 312 million potential subscribers.[67]
Roaming[edit]
T-Mobile has roaming arrangements with a number of national and regional mobile network operators, including AT&T Mobility.
As of 2008, prepaid customers have almost all of the postpaid domestic roaming privileges and restricted international roaming to Canada and Mexico.[68]
On June 29, 2010, the company launched voice service in the Gulf of Mexico on GSM via roaming agreement through Broadpoint. T-Mobile USA was scheduled to launch data service in Fall 2010.[69]
In 2009, T-Mobile USA began removing AT&T Mobility roaming coverage in many locations across the country, and updated its on-line coverage maps[70][71] to reflect the smaller coverage area. AT&T Mobility roaming remains available in select locations, primarily on smaller carriers that were acquired by AT&T Mobility after long-term roaming contracts were in place between T-Mobile and the smaller carriers, including Centennial Wireless and Edge Wireless.
On October 9, 2013, T-Mobile announced Simple Global, a service included with eligible Simple Choice plans. This service allows one to roam in over 100 countries with unlimited text and speed-limited data, and make calls at $0.20/minute. High-speed data passes will be available for purchase.[72] On March 7, 2014, T-Mobile announced this number will be increasing to 122 countries.[73] If one is connected to WiFi in one of these countries, and their phone supports WiFi calling, all calls and texts to and from the USA are free, and work the same as if they were on the cellular network.[74]
On July 15, 2015, T-Mobile announced Mobile Without Borders, a service included with all new T-Mobile plans and available as an add-on to grandfathered or promotional plans for $10. This service allows the user to use their normal voice, text message, and data allotments while roaming in Mexico and Canada. Most T-Mobile services are available while roaming, with the notable exception of using the data in one's Data Stash.
In August 2015, T-Mobile joined the Competitive Carriers Association's Data Services Hub, enabling the company to expand roaming partnerships with over a dozen rural and regional carriers. Smaller carriers will now be able to access T-Mobile's LTE network for roaming and T-Mobile will be able to expand roaming partnerships and extend its footprint with members whose network technologies had previously been incompatible.[75]

T-Mobile HotSpots[edit]
T-Mobile has used the term "Hotspot" to represent various products and technologies.
Wi-Fi network (public)[edit]
The company operates a nationwide Wi-Fi Internet access network under the T-Mobile HotSpots brand. The T-Mobile HotSpots network consists of thousands of Wi-Fi access points installed in businesses, hotels and airports throughout the U.S.
The T-Mobile HotSpot service offers access to a nationwide network of approximately 8,350 access points, installed in venues such as Starbucks coffeehouses, FedEx Office Office and Print Centers, Hyatt hotels and resorts, Red Roof Inns, Sofitel hotels, Novotel hotels, the airline clubs of American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and US Airways, and airports.[86]
The T-Mobile HotSpots network can be traced to the company's 2002 purchase of bankrupt wireless ISP MobileStar, which began building its network in 1998. After completing the purchase, the company expanded the network into 400 Borders bookstores, as well as 100 of the most-frequented airport clubs and lounges operated by American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and United Airlines.[87][88]
On September 14, 2014, T-Mobile partnered up with GoGo to provide free texting on airplanes for its customers. GoGo services are provided on Delta Airlines, American Airlines, United Airlines, US Airways, Virgin America and Alaska Airlines.[89]
On June 6, 2016, T-Mobile expanded its partnership with GoGo to offer T-Mobile users one hour of free WiFi on customers phones. T-Mobile also included other messaging apps (iMessage, Google Hangouts, WhatsApp and Viber) in addition to SMS texting being provided since September 2014.[90]
Wi-Fi network (private)[edit]
T-Mobile has also used the term to describe Wi-Fi Access Points that it sold to end users to expand their cell phone network to phones equipped to also receive Wi-Fi using a VOIP-like technology. (The models included at least two by Linksys: the WRTU54G-TM and the WRT54G-TM and one by D-Link: the TM-G5240.)
Products and services[edit]
T-Mobile ONE[edit]
In August 2016, T-Mobile introduced T-Mobile ONE. It will be the only rate plan offered in the future, with plans to gradually phase out Simple Choice.[91] It combines unlimited voice minutes, text messaging, and high-speed data (the top 3% of users—currently 32 GB/month—may be deprioritized under congested conditions), replacing Binge On, Music Freedom, and Data Stash. Video streaming is limited to 1.5 Mbps, allowing 480p resolution in most cases, and mobile hotspot (tethering) is limited to 3G speeds. The $10/line/month ONE Plus add-on allows HD streaming and adds 10 GB of mobile hotspot at 4G LTE speeds; the $25/line/month ONE Plus International additionally provides international calling and texting and unlimited mobile hotspot at 4G LTE speeds. Subscribers who do not enable auto-pay are charged a $5/line/month fee; otherwise, as of January 22, 2017, all taxes and regulatory fees are included in the plan cost.[92][93] The plan has been criticized by the Electronic Frontier Foundation and others for potentially violating net neutrality rules and making previously-included features paid extras.[94][95][96] Subscribers on Simple Choice can keep their current plans.[91]
In response to Verizon launching their new Verizon Unlimited Plan, T-Mobile revised their T-Mobile ONE plan to include High Definition (1080p) video streaming and 10 GB of High Speed Mobile Hot Spot data (to be slowed to 3G speeds after using the allowance). Also, their prioritization threshold was raised to 32 GB.
Simple Choice[edit]
In March 2013, T-Mobile introduced a new streamlined plan structure known as Simple Choice for new customers. This is part of an initiative called Un-carrier which drops contracts, subsidized phones, overage fees for data, and early termination fees.[31]
Capping unlimited data users[edit]
On August 31, 2015, T-Mobile announced it will ask users who abuse its unlimited on-smartphone data plan by violating T-Mobile's Terms & Conditions regarding tethering (which like unlimited on-smartphone data, remains unlimited, however, offers a 14 GB high speed allotment before deprioritizing takes effect), by permanently removing user access to unlimited plans and migrating users to a tiered data plan. By doing so, all plans after a select amount of inclusive high-speed data, result in automatic throttled speeds, preventing unlimited high-speed tethering use and abuse of the network. T-Mobile stated that there are a small handful of users who abuse the tethering plan by altering device software and/or the use of an Android app that masks T-Mobile's ability monitoring whether data is on-smartphone, or through smartphone mobile hotspot (tethering) by mimicking all data as on-smartphone use, with some customers abusing the service by using as much as 2 TB per month, causing speed issues for all other customers.[97]
InReach program[edit]
The InReach program[98] provides a free cell phone and a limited number of voice minutes each month for low-income-eligible families (one per family) who do not use Lifeline services offered by any other phone or wireless company. It is funded through the Universal Service Fund,[99] but is only operational in a limited number of states and Puerto Rico.[100]
MetroPCS[edit]
Main article: MetroPCS
MetroPCS was taken over by T-Mobile in 2013, the new company formed T-Mobile US and currently continues to offer prepaid wireless services under the MetroPCS brand.
GoSmart Mobile[edit]
GoSmart Mobile was a T-Mobile branded service that launched in beta on December 7, 2012, and became officially available nationwide on February 19, 2013.[101] GoSmart offered no-contract SIM wireless services. GoSmart Mobile was sold to consumers through dealers who worked as independent contractors under their own company name. Such sellers are known as "Authorized Dealers" with either physical or online stores. In September 2016, T-Mobile sold the brand and 326,000 GoSmart Mobile customers to TracFone Wireless.[102] The customers were reclassified as wholesale subscribers.[103]
Banking Cards[edit]
On January 22, 2014, T-Mobile announced that it would expand its products into banking. T-Mobile would provide Visa card with banking features and a smartphone money management application with reduced-fee or zero-cost services for T-Mobile wireless customers. In addition, customers would have access to over 42,000 ATMs with no fees.[104]
In early 2016 T-mobile decided to discontinue the banking cards. They can no longer be purchased at T-Mobile.
Customer service[edit]

Awards[edit]
From as early as 2004, the company has captured multiple J. D. Power annual awards in the areas of retail sales satisfaction, wireless customer care, and overall customer satisfaction.[4] In 2011, J. D. Power and Associates stated that T-Mobile retail stores achieved the highest ratings among major wireless carriers for customer satisfaction for the fourth consecutive year, performing particularly well in price and promotions.[105] Also in 2011, J. D. Power and Associates ranked T-Mobile USA highest among major providers in wireless customer care for the second consecutive year.[106]
On December 3, 2015, Consumer Reports named T-Mobile the number one American wireless service provider. The results combine data from customer service, voice quality, text messaging services, and data speeds.[8]
On February 6, 2016, T-Mobile was awarded the JD Power Award for customer satisfaction in the full service wireless category for the second year in a row. T-Mobile received the highest score ever in the wireless industry.[107]
Outages[edit]
Sidekick data outage[edit]
Main article: Microsoft data loss 2009
On October 1, 2009, Sidekick users lost all data functionality and some users also experienced personal data loss including contacts, notes, and calendars. On October 8, most data services were restored to some users but the company and Microsoft announced on October 10 that data "almost certainly has been lost as a result of a server failure at Microsoft/Danger."[108] On October 15, Microsoft said it had been able to recover most or all data and would begin to restore it.[109][110] A few weeks later, all Sidekick customers were able to recover their data via Danger's sync website using a restore file, or had the option to wait until data was restored to the device itself. Due to this outage, many users abandoned the Sidekick for another device, or left T-Mobile USA for another carrier entirely.[citation needed]
Network outage[edit]
On November 9, 2009, the company's subscribers lost the ability to send and receive calls and text messages.[111] The company confirmed the outage via Twitter and later stated that five percent of its user base had been affected. It blamed a software error for the service interruption, stating that a backend system software error had generated abnormal congestion on the network. The root cause was determined and steps were taken to update a patch on the backend as a permanent resolution.[112]
On February 13 and March 25, 2015, T-Mobile suffered LTE outages along the east coast causing users to lose data connections.[citation needed]
Marketing[edit]
Jamie Lee Curtis was the spokesperson for T-Mobile USA's predecessor, VoiceStream Wireless, since 1998. VoiceStream's advertising slogan was: "Get more from life". During the transition to the T-Mobile brand, Jamie Lee Curtis continued as spokesperson for a short time and the slogan was changed to "T-Mobile. Get More."
Starting in 2002, the company's spokesperson was Catherine Zeta-Jones who was the main figure in its branding strategy. As of September 2006, Zeta-Jones had officially been dropped as the "face" of the company for its advertising campaigns due to a corporate rebranding strategy.[113] The company also relied on rapper Snoop Dogg as the spokesperson for its T-Mobile Sidekick in a series of commercials late in 2004, the company also released a series of Sidekick phones known as the D-Wade Edition for basketball player Dwyane Wade.
The company is also an official sponsor of the Major League Baseball, National Basketball Association, the NBA Rookie Challenge and the Women's National Basketball Association.
In 2009, it changed its approach to advertising, and moved from the "Get More" slogan to a "Stick Together" slogan to focus more on the personal aspect of staying together with those who matter the most to its customers.[citation needed] The slogan was also meant to promote its MyFaves calling-circle plan. With this the company also ended its relationship with Zeta-Jones, and now use mainly non-celebrity spokespeople (though Dwyane Wade, Charles Barkley, and Dwight Howard are featured in some commercials, in association with the company's sponsorship of the NBA as official wireless provider).
In late May 2009, Zeta-Jones was brought back as a company spokesperson to show customers how to pay less for their wireless plan in a new "Mobile Makeovers" advertising campaign that refers customer to third-party comparison site BillShrink.com.[114][115]
In late 2009, commercials for the T-Mobile MyTouch 3G featured the song "If You Want to Sing Out, Sing Out" by Cat Stevens[116] and celebrities such as Chevy Chase, Molly Shannon, Dana Carvey and Darrell Hammond.[117] Another commercial with the same song performed by a different artist showed Wyclef Jean, Avril Lavigne and Brad Paisley.[118]
Carly Foulkes is the spokeswoman for the myTouch 4G in commercials that parody the Get a Mac campaign. The model is known for Rugby Ralph Lauren ads.[119][120][121] Although Foulkes is often identified with the color pink, T-Mobile actually has a color trademark for the color magenta,[122] and markets itself using its corporate colors.[123][124] Virgin Mobile has, in turn, parodied the Carly Foulkes ads.[125]
In September 2010, the company launched "Kids are free till 2012" for family lines.
On December 1, 2011, a group of 100 Chicago-area women, along with Carly Foulkes, were featured in a flash-mob style performance at Woodfield Mall in Schaumburg, Illinois, where the group, dressed in magenta dresses, sang and danced through the mall's atrium to their cover of (There's No Place Like) Home for the Holidays. The performance was filmed and edited into a holiday commercial, which was a success.
Un-carrier movement[edit]
Starting in 2013, T-Mobile launched the Un-carrier marketing campaign. This movement introduced a slew of new tactics to offer consumers cheaper rate plans, cheaper global coverage, and several other benefits. T-Mobile CEO John Legere laid out an 'Un-Carrier manifesto' highlighting the approach and goals he wanted the company to pursue. One popular Un-carrier move features T-Mobile Tuesdays, where customers are offered a variety of free products and also able to win prizes.[126][127] The most recent Un-carrier campaign is titled 'T-Mobile One'. This is a new family plan offering, replacing all previous plans and is an all inclusive unlimited plan, giving unlimited talk, text and data. The only caveat being video streaming on any device is limited to 480p resolution.[128] CEO John Legere in an interview said "The biggest pain point that a million customers told me about is that they hate data buckets. And we had such success with Binge On that we wanted to turn our company into somebody that's selling a monthly subscription to the internet, all in, unlimited." [129] As of October 7, 2016, about a quarter of the overall account numbers have moved over to T-Mobile One, and about three quarters of new postpaid accounts are activating on T-Mobile One.
Labor relations[edit]
T-Mobile US employees and two labor unions have led multiple unionization attempts beginning as early as 2001.
Formation of TU[edit]
Hundreds of T-Mobile employees, with the backing of the Communications Workers of America (CWA) and the German union ver.di, have joined together as TU to gain representation at T-Mobile.[130] In July, 2011, technicians in Connecticut, voted for representation by the Communications Workers of America-TU.[131] On September 25, 2013, MetroPCS workers in Harlem, NY, voted for a union voice and representation by CWA-TU.[132]
2009 coordinated organizing effort[edit]




CWA President Larry Cohen and a disguised, unidentified T-Mobile USA employee pictured at a 2009 press conference announcing a coordinated unionizing effort.


In 2008, the CWA and ver.di launched a coordinated effort to unionize company employees. A spokesman for the CWA called on the company to stop resisting mobilization efforts and allow company employees to unionize as German employees of T-Mobile USA's parent company, DT, have done. In response, the company released an employee satisfaction study showing that more than seventy percent of the company's 40,000 workers were "very satisfied" with their jobs. Through a spokesman, the company stated, "Despite the Communication Workers of America's periodic organizing efforts for more than nine years, no group of T-Mobile employees has ever chosen to be represented by a union. While our company is always striving to find ways to improve, year after year, employees continue to view T-Mobile as a good place to work where they have no need for, or interest in, a union."[131]
Political pressure[edit]
In 2009, a number of politicians, in one case acting after lobbying efforts by CWA union activists, wrote letters to René Obermann, DT's chief executive officer, in an effort to influence T-Mobile USA's labor practices in the U.S.[133]
In a March 13, 2009, letter, U.S. Senator John Kerry (D-MA) asked "why the company's approach to labor rights are different in Germany than in the United States". In an April 30, 2010, letter sent after lobbying by Communications Workers of America activists, 26 Democratic members of Congress called on DT to protect and respect workers' rights in the U.S.[133] A separate July 1, 2010, letter from seven Republicans addressed the same issue.[134][135] On August 10, 2010, U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) released a statement in support of the worker's efforts to organize a union at the company.[136] In a letter, dated September 21, 2010, fifteen Californian Members of Congress urged Obermann to take action and implement fair and equitable labor relations.[citation needed]
In a November 5, 2009, letter, Thomas DiNapoli, New York State Comptroller and Trustee of the New York State Common Retirement Fund, stated concerns about "the potential impact on the value of T-Mobile that may result from a disenfranchised workforce and the associated negative publicity that may impact T-Mobile's profitability."[citation needed]
Reports[edit]




A Cover image of a report written by John Logan and published in 2009 by American Rights at Work


On December 9, 2009, the non-profit organization American Rights at Work published a report written by Prof. John Logan, Director of Labor Studies at San Francisco State University, titled "Lowering the Bar or Setting the Standard? Deutsche Telekom's U.S. Labor Practices". The report details behavior by the company that the author perceives as anti-union including dissemination of anti-union materials, intimidation and threats directed at pro-union workers, "captive audience meetings" and the retention of anti-union specialists.[137] In the report, which is based on documents from the National Labor Relations Board, internal company memos and handbooks, and interviews with workers, Logan asserts that the company engaged in a systematic campaign to prevent employees from forming a union and that DT was guilty of operating by a double standard. He claims that Deutsche Telekom respects workers' rights in Germany, where it cooperates closely with unions, but mistreats workers in the United States and interferes with their right to organize.[clarification needed][138]
On September 2, 2010, Human Rights Watch released a report written by Lance Compa titled "A Strange Case: Violations of Workers' Freedom of Association in the United States by European Multinational Corporations". The report concludes that "company policy has translated into practices that leave the workforce fearful about even seeking union representation."[139] DT proclaims its adherence to international labor law and standards that are embodied in German domestic laws. But HRW found that "T-Mobile USA's harsh opposition to workers' freedom of association in the United States betrays Deutsche Telekom's purported commitment to social responsibility, impedes constructive dialogue with employee representatives, and in several cases, has violated ILO and OECD labor and human rights standards".[140]
Workplace activities[edit]
At the company's Allentown, Pennsylvania, call center, security guards were ordered by company managers to write up incident reports whenever union supporters appeared on nearby public grounds and to record the license plate numbers of employees who stopped to take leaflets. In 2006, the National Labor Relations Board found that these activities violated Section 8(a)(1) of the National Labor Relations Act.[141]
In 2008, company management in the Pacific Northwest and Southwest Retail Divisions sent a memorandum to store managers instructing them to immediately report any union activity to their supervisors.[142] Human Rights Watch states, "The NLRB has long held that such activity interferes with, restrains, and coerces employees in the exercise of Section 7 rights in violation of workers' right to freedom of association."[143]
Information Security[edit]
Nicolas Jacobsen was charged with intruding into the company's internal network in January 2005.[144] Reports indicated that for about a year Jacobsen had access to customer passwords, e-mail, address books, Social Security numbers, birth dates, and Sidekick photos. Affected customers included members of the United States Secret Service. Secret Service informant identified Jacobsen as part of "Operation Firewall" which provided evidence that Jacobsen had attempted to sell customer information to others for identity theft. T-Mobile USA and the Secret Service did not elaborate on the methods Jacobsen used to gain access but sources close to the case indicated that Jacobsen exploited an unpatched flaw in the Oracle WebLogic Server application software used by the company.[145] Additional SQL injection vulnerabilities with the company's web site were reported by Jack Koziol of the InfoSec Institute.[146]
T-Mobile offers access to voice mail without the input of a password by default. Parties acting in bad faith may be able to access such voice mailboxes via Caller ID spoofing. To avoid this possibility, T-Mobile recommends that all customers password protect their mailboxes, but still offers the no password configuration by default due to customer demand.[147]
On June 6, 2009, a message posted from an email account "pwnmobile_at_Safe-mail.net" to the Full Disclosure mailing list claimed that the company's network had been breached and showed sample data. The sender offered "databases, confidential documents, scripts and programs from their servers, financial documents up to 2009" to the highest bidder.[148][149] On June 9, the company issued a statement confirming the breach but stating that customer data was safe. It claimed to have identified the source document for the sample data and believe it was not obtained by hacking.[150] A later statement claimed that there was not any evidence of a breach.[151]
Privacy and surveillance[edit]
T-Mobile USA received a portion of the 1.3 million largely warrantless law enforcement requests for subscriber information (including text messages and phone location data) made in 2011, but refused to state how many requests it received.[152] It did say that in the last decade, the number of requests have increased by 12 to 16 percent annually.[153]
Data retention policies[edit]
According to T-Mobile's privacy policy highlights, "Retention and Disposal", information is retained for as long as there is business or tax need or as applicable laws, regulations, or government orders require. T-Mobile notes that it disposes of Personal Information, uses reasonable procedures designed to erase or render it unreadable (for example, shredding documents and wiping electronic media).[154]
In 2010, the Department of Justice (DOJ) released a document entitled, "Retention Periods of Major Cellular Providers," to advise law enforcement agents seeking to obtain cell phone records. This document was uncovered by the ACLU's coordinated records request on cell phone location tracking by police. Notably, the document showed that T-Mobile subscriber information was retained for 5 years and call detail records were kept for 2 years (prepaid) and 5 years (postpaid).[155]
In 2013, Massachusetts Sen. Edward Markey revealed responses from the top four U.S. wireless providers as well as U.S. Cellular, C Spire, and Cricket/Leap Wireless, to his inquiry regarding user information disclosed to law enforcement officials. The following was T-Mobile's response regarding data retention: T-Mobile US retains customers' historic cell site information and cell tower dump information (180 days); call details records (7–10 years); text message content, data requests, and geo-location data not stored; voicemail content (up to 21 days); subscriber information (6 years after account is closed).[156]
Comparing the 2010 DOJ memo released by the ACLU and Massachusetts Senator Edward Markey's 2013 wireless data retention disclosures, it should be noted that T-Mobile increased the retention period for subscriber information from 5 years to 6 years. T-Mobile also increased its call detail record retention from 2 years (prepaid) and 5 years (postpaid) to 7–10 years.

WHY CHOOSE RESEARCH AND MARKETS?



WORLD'S LARGEST SELECTION




TRUSTED BY THE BEST




CUSTOMER FOCUSED




SAFE & SECURE







When I was placing my order I was unsure if my Visa card was authorised for the transaction and was unsure

                         if my payment would be successful.
One minute after I inserted the VISA for payment I had a call from Claire from Research and Markets outlining there was a problem with my card and offering me different solutions to overcome that issue.

It was a great customer experience that clearly surprised me in a very positive way. I shared the experience with some of my colleagues at the office. thanks for your quick and efficient service!

Got Questions?





                                    What is the DIGITS launch offer?
                                



Starting May 31, 2017, for a limited time, customers with a T-Mobile ONE™ taxes-and-fees-inclusive plan who add T-Mobile ONE Plus or T-Mobile ONE Plus International can get a free DIGITS Talk & Text line for as long as they have T-Mobile ONE Plus or T-Mobile ONE Plus International.






                                    Who is eligible for the DIGITS launch offer?
                                



Any customer who has, adds, or migrates to a T-Mobile ONE taxes-and-fees-inclusive plan, and who adds T-Mobile ONE Plus or T-Mobile ONE Plus International, can take advantage of the offer.  Customers who redeemed the “free” T-Mobile ONE Plus upgrade promotion are not eligible.






                                    How do I take advantage of the DIGITS launch offer?
                                



Visit a T-Mobile store or call 1-800-T-MOBILE to have a rep help you add T-Mobile ONE Plus or T-Mobile ONE Plus International to your T-Mobile ONE plan, and set up your new DIGITS Talk & Text line. 






                                    Can T-Mobile @Work customers take advantage of the DIGITS launch offer?  
                                



Yes. T-Mobile @Work customers can take advantage of this offer.






                                    If I’m an existing customer, will I automatically receive this offer?
                                



If you have T-Mobile ONE Plus or T-Mobile ONE Plus International, you can visit a T-Mobile store or call 1-800-T-MOBILE to have a rep help you set up your new DIGITS Talk & Text line.






                                    Is there a limit to how many lines can take advantage of this offer?
                                



Yes. You can get 1 free DIGITS Talk & Text line for every line on your account that adds T-Mobile ONE Plus or T-Mobile ONE Plus International, up to your maximum number of lines determined by your credit class. For example, if 2 lines on your 4 line account have the T-Mobile ONE Plus feature, you will be eligible for 2 free DIGITS Talk & Text lines.






                                    Do I have to add a line to receive this offer?
                                



No. As long as you have an eligible T-Mobile ONE line with T-Mobile ONE Plus or T-Mobile ONE Plus International, you qualify for this offer.






                                    Will I lose my DIGITS line if I cancel T-Mobile ONE Plus or T-Mobile ONE Plus International?
                                



Without T-Mobile ONE Plus, the free DIGITS Talk & Text line will be increased to $10 with AutoPay, $15 without after 30 days unless you call 611 to cancel your free DIGITS Talk & Text line.






                                    How much does DIGITS cost?  What if I need an additional number?
                                



All your existing T-Mobile numbers are now DIGITS lines. You can use them for free on any compatible internet-connected device via the DIGITS app or on phones with the DIGITS functionality built in.

If you want additional DIGITS lines, you can purchase a DIGITS Talk & Text line for $10/month (with AutoPay). Or, if you have T-Mobile ONE Plus or T-Mobile ONE Plus International, you’ll get a DIGITS Talk & Text line for free for as long as you have T-Mobile ONE Plus or T-Mobile ONE Plus International.

If you want your smartwatch to use the same number as your primary phone, you can purchase Data with Paired DIGITS for your smartwatch for just $10/month (with AutoPay).






                                    Do I need a new phone to use DIGITS?
                                



No. All you need is a compatible device and the DIGITS app. The DIGITS app will run on: 

Any Android device running Lollipop (5.0+) or above. Download the DIGITS app from the Play Store.
Any iOS device running iOS 9 or above. Download the DIGITS app from the Apple App Store.
Any PC or Mac using Chrome or Firefox. Visit https://webdigits.t-mobile.com to log in or download the application.








                                    Can I use my new DIGITS number on a non-T-Mobile device?
                                



Yes. Even if your Android or iOS device is with another carrier, you can make and take calls or send and receive texts using the T-Mobile DIGITS app. Once you’ve downloaded and logged into the app, you can turn on your DIGITS. If the device is not on the T-Mobile network, any data used will decrement from the phone plan with the other carrier.






                                    How do I access and manage my DIGITS?
                                



If you have a T-Mobile number, you can use the T-Mobile DIGITS app on any Android (5.0 +) or iOS (iOS 9 +) device, even if the device is with another carrier.  You can also access DIGITS from any Mac or PC browser by visiting https://webdigits.t-mobile.com on Chrome or Firefox, or download a standalone app.  The US versions of the Samsung Galaxy S6 or newer and the LG 5 or newer already have the DIGITS functionality built in, so you don’t need to download the DIGITS app. For additional support, visit http://www.t-mobile.com/DIGITS. 






                                    Which Samsung smartphones have the DIGITS functionality built in?  And what do I do if I don’t have one of those devices?
                                



There are multiple Samsung smartphones that have the DIGITS functionality built in. They are: Samsung Galaxy S8, Samsung Galaxy S8+, Samsung Galaxy S7, Samsung Galaxy S7 edge, Samsung Galaxy S6, Samsung Galaxy S6 edge, Samsung Galaxy S6 edge +, and the Samsung Note5. Make sure that the device has been updated to the latest software version. If you have any other Android or iOS device, simply download the DIGITS app from the appropriate app store.






                                    How do I get DIGITS set up?
                                



First, you need to unlock the DIGITS function. Open the T-Mobile app and select Usage & Plans. Find the line you want to unlock and select View Line Details. Then, select “unlock” on the DIGITS card. Restart your device, then you can search your settings for “Multi-line settings” and log in with your T-Mobile ID. Once logged in, you will see a list of all lines available to you, which you can turn on and off as needed. For additional support, visit http://www.t-mobile.com/DIGITS. 






                                    How do I share my phone number with other devices, like my desktop, laptop, or tablet?
                                



Simply download the DIGITS app on the device you’d like to share your number with. On PC and Mac, go to https://webdigits.t-mobile.com to log in or download the application.  Then, open the app, log in with your T-Mobile ID, and turn on your line.






                                    My mobile phone number already works on all my Apple devices (iPhone, iPad, Mac). How is this different?
                                



Continuity is restricted to the iOS ecosystem. DIGITS allows calls and texts to work on any device in which you have enabled your DIGITS lines, regardless of the operating system.  If you use Apple devices exclusively, then there’s no need to use the DIGITS app.






                                    Can I call or text 911 with DIGITS?
                                



Yes. But calls and texts to 911 still work best from your landline or primary cell phone number, and without using Wi-Fi. You should always provide your actual location and callback number to the 911 operator, and be aware that if the operator calls you back, the call may be answered by others sharing your DIGITS line. See the DIGITS Terms of Use for additional 911 information.






                                    How have you made sure DIGITS is secure?
                                



DIGITS calls and texts use the same leading level of security and encryption as traditional T-Mobile calls and texts.






                                    I want to use my main phone number but switch between phones such as an iPhone and Android device without swapping my SIM. Can I do this?
                                



Absolutely. There are two ways to do this depending on your needs.
 
If both devices already have their own phone number and data plan then you can access your primary number from either phone any time through the DIGITS app.  Manage all your DIGITS here: https://mydigits.t-mobile.com
 
If you want each phone to simply share the same primary number and you don’t need high-speed data on the second device then you can pair your number with another device for just $10 a month using a Data with Paired DIGITS plan.
 
*Data with Paired DIGITS comes with unlimited data at 512 kbs.
















Limited-time offer; subject to change. Compatible device & qualifying service required. 1 non-DIGITS line required. App download may be required. Without T-Mobile ONE Plus/ONE Plus International, free DIGITS Talk & Text line may increase to $5/mo. (with AutoPay) after 30 days unless you call 611 to cancel. Pricing reflects AutoPay discount; without AutoPay, $5 more/line. Up to 5 numbers per device and up to 5 devices per number. DIGITS supports 911 but calls and texts to 911 work best from your landline or primary cell phone/number and without using Wi-Fi; always provide your actual location and callback number to 911 operator; callback may be answered by others sharing your DIGITS line.

Transferring from Sprint, messed up few steps, but Sean was stellar in getting things sorted for me.  Great service.







I came here for my first time to buy a new phone and the guys were so friendly and helpful, specially Xavier and Manuel, thank you guys for your help,
Also I wasted my money before with At&t, sprint, metro pcs, but T-mobile definitely makes me happy..







Eek is right!  I've had poor service before, but this is the first time in my life I've been ACCUSED OF FRAUD by a customer service rep who also refused to help me.

I have been an existing T-Mobile prepaid customer for 1.5 years.  I have a great unlocked phone that's still going strong, and I'm waiting for the next Nexus before signing on to a 2-yr contract.  

I came to this T-Mobile store to convert my existing plan to an international plan since I have some travel coming up.  (I had called the 1-800 #s from a landline, but was disconnected repeatedly).

There were 2 reps in the store.  One said he couldn't convert my account in time for my travel.  I said I had called online and they could do it today, but I kept getting disconnected during the activation process.  The rep said maybe they could do it from the service center, but the store couldn't.

I suspect this is just store policy, but I called from my T-Mobile phone.  Every time I reached a human, I asked for his/her direct line in case I was disconnected.  They would all give me the number for the dept.  I would provide my number, and ask to be called back.

They dropped me repeatedly, but yay!  after sharing far too much personal info, and being transferred between reps, I was approved for service.

So far, I have received no service from the store.  On my way out, I ask one rep: "Excuse me, do you have a rate table for making international calls on the Simple Choice plan?"

"No."

"Maybe you can show me where it is on the website?  I had trouble finding it."

"No.  You should be aware what you're doing is fraudulent."

"Excuse me?"

"You're going on a Simple Choice plan to go abroad and you're just going to cancel it after.  Isn't that fraudulent?"

"No.  I'm waiting for you to offer the Nexus before signing on to a contract.  But even if I were going to switch to another plan at some point, how is that fraudulent?  It's only fraudulent if I say I'm staying with this plan, and then I don't."

"I'm not saying you're fraudulent.  I'm just saying that's fraudulent."

So: No service from the store.  Free & false accusation of fraud thrown in.







Really rude manager who does not know enough about what can be and can not be done at store.  Went there to  buy off a leased phone, paid it off but the manager did not mention anything about unlocking. 

When I went back and requested an unlock all I got was "we can't do that at store. You have to call customer service," when I tried to give feedback that this is a hassle to customers, all I got was "it's a policy." 

And it turns out they can actually put in a request to unlock the phone just like customer service can. I just confirmed that with t-mobile customer service. The guy just did not know/did not want to do it.  And behaved extremely rude refusing to help. 

Who does this? First time such a bad  experience at t-mobile store. Stay away from this store.







Amazing customer service, quick and very friendly. I decided to switch from AT&T to T mobile because they had great offers. You don't have to use your data to play pandora, Netflix and YouTube. The whole process was done so fast and easy, thanks T-mobile!
The employees at this location are so great and friendly and will answer all your questions.







Wow brand new store in Mountain View really nice and clean store! Friendly staff! Since it's a new store there is literally NO wait! T-Mobile rocks!







Super good service. Very knowledgeable staff.  Highly recommend this location. The best wireless experience so far for me.

From the business

Specialties

            We're not like other wireless carriers. We're breaking the old rules of wireless with no annual service contracts, no overages, and no data sharing on America's Fastest 4G LTE Network. This is a consumer revolution and we're just getting started. We're changing the wireless industry, one pain-point at a time. Stuck counting the days until your next phone upgrade? Not with T-Mobile® and JUMP! On Demand®. Get the phone you want, when you want up to three times per year.

Transferring from Sprint, messed up few steps, but Sean was stellar in getting things sorted for me.  Great service.







I came here for my first time to buy a new phone and the guys were so friendly and helpful, specially Xavier and Manuel, thank you guys for your help,
Also I wasted my money before with At&t, sprint, metro pcs, but T-mobile definitely makes me happy..







Eek is right!  I've had poor service before, but this is the first time in my life I've been ACCUSED OF FRAUD by a customer service rep who also refused to help me.

I have been an existing T-Mobile prepaid customer for 1.5 years.  I have a great unlocked phone that's still going strong, and I'm waiting for the next Nexus before signing on to a 2-yr contract.  

I came to this T-Mobile store to convert my existing plan to an international plan since I have some travel coming up.  (I had called the 1-800 #s from a landline, but was disconnected repeatedly).

There were 2 reps in the store.  One said he couldn't convert my account in time for my travel.  I said I had called online and they could do it today, but I kept getting disconnected during the activation process.  The rep said maybe they could do it from the service center, but the store couldn't.

I suspect this is just store policy, but I called from my T-Mobile phone.  Every time I reached a human, I asked for his/her direct line in case I was disconnected.  They would all give me the number for the dept.  I would provide my number, and ask to be called back.

They dropped me repeatedly, but yay!  after sharing far too much personal info, and being transferred between reps, I was approved for service.

So far, I have received no service from the store.  On my way out, I ask one rep: "Excuse me, do you have a rate table for making international calls on the Simple Choice plan?"

"No."

"Maybe you can show me where it is on the website?  I had trouble finding it."

"No.  You should be aware what you're doing is fraudulent."

"Excuse me?"

"You're going on a Simple Choice plan to go abroad and you're just going to cancel it after.  Isn't that fraudulent?"

"No.  I'm waiting for you to offer the Nexus before signing on to a contract.  But even if I were going to switch to another plan at some point, how is that fraudulent?  It's only fraudulent if I say I'm staying with this plan, and then I don't."

"I'm not saying you're fraudulent.  I'm just saying that's fraudulent."

So: No service from the store.  Free & false accusation of fraud thrown in.







Really rude manager who does not know enough about what can be and can not be done at store.  Went there to  buy off a leased phone, paid it off but the manager did not mention anything about unlocking. 

When I went back and requested an unlock all I got was "we can't do that at store. You have to call customer service," when I tried to give feedback that this is a hassle to customers, all I got was "it's a policy." 

And it turns out they can actually put in a request to unlock the phone just like customer service can. I just confirmed that with t-mobile customer service. The guy just did not know/did not want to do it.  And behaved extremely rude refusing to help. 

Who does this? First time such a bad  experience at t-mobile store. Stay away from this store.







Amazing customer service, quick and very friendly. I decided to switch from AT&T to T mobile because they had great offers. You don't have to use your data to play pandora, Netflix and YouTube. The whole process was done so fast and easy, thanks T-mobile!
The employees at this location are so great and friendly and will answer all your questions.







Wow brand new store in Mountain View really nice and clean store! Friendly staff! Since it's a new store there is literally NO wait! T-Mobile rocks!







Super good service. Very knowledgeable staff.  Highly recommend this location. The best wireless experience so far for me.

Amazing customer service, quick and very friendly. I decided to switch from AT&T to T mobile because they had great offers. You don't have to use your data to play pandora, Netflix and YouTube. The whole process was done so fast and easy, thanks T-mobile!The employees at this location are so great and friendly and will answer all your questions.

From the business

Specialties

            We're not like other wireless carriers. We're breaking the old rules of wireless with no annual service contracts, no overages, and no data sharing on America's Fastest 4G LTE Network. This is a consumer revolution and we're just getting started. We're changing the wireless industry, one pain-point at a time. Stuck counting the days until your next phone upgrade? Not with T-Mobile® and JUMP! On Demand®. Get the phone you want, when you want up to three times per year. Mobile Without Borders brings you coverage in three countries for the price of one with unlimited calls, texts, and data in Mexico and Canada at no extra charge. And with Data Stash®, now your unused data rolls forward for up to 12 months and 20 GB. It's your data. Keep it®. So why wait? Make the switch to T-Mobile today. Coverage Think you know T-Mobile's coverage? Think again. In the last year we've doubled our 4G LTE network. Now The Un-Carrier® is covering nearly every American. And our new Extended Range LTE reaches twice as far and is four times better in buildings than before.

Transferring from Sprint, messed up few steps, but Sean was stellar in getting things sorted for me.  Great service.







Amazing customer service, quick and very friendly. I decided to switch from AT&T to T mobile because they had great offers. You don't have to use your data to play pandora, Netflix and YouTube. The whole process was done so fast and easy, thanks T-mobile!
The employees at this location are so great and friendly and will answer all your questions.







Super good service. Very knowledgeable staff.  Highly recommend this location. The best wireless experience so far for me.







I came here for my first time to buy a new phone and the guys were so friendly and helpful, specially Xavier and Manuel, thank you guys for your help,
Also I wasted my money before with At&t, sprint, metro pcs, but T-mobile definitely makes me happy..







Wow brand new store in Mountain View really nice and clean store! Friendly staff! Since it's a new store there is literally NO wait! T-Mobile rocks!







Really rude manager who does not know enough about what can be and can not be done at store.  Went there to  buy off a leased phone, paid it off but the manager did not mention anything about unlocking. 

When I went back and requested an unlock all I got was "we can't do that at store. You have to call customer service," when I tried to give feedback that this is a hassle to customers, all I got was "it's a policy." 

And it turns out they can actually put in a request to unlock the phone just like customer service can. I just confirmed that with t-mobile customer service. The guy just did not know/did not want to do it.  And behaved extremely rude refusing to help. 

Who does this? First time such a bad  experience at t-mobile store. Stay away from this store.







Eek is right!  I've had poor service before, but this is the first time in my life I've been ACCUSED OF FRAUD by a customer service rep who also refused to help me.

I have been an existing T-Mobile prepaid customer for 1.5 years.  I have a great unlocked phone that's still going strong, and I'm waiting for the next Nexus before signing on to a 2-yr contract.  

I came to this T-Mobile store to convert my existing plan to an international plan since I have some travel coming up.  (I had called the 1-800 #s from a landline, but was disconnected repeatedly).

There were 2 reps in the store.  One said he couldn't convert my account in time for my travel.  I said I had called online and they could do it today, but I kept getting disconnected during the activation process.  The rep said maybe they could do it from the service center, but the store couldn't.

I suspect this is just store policy, but I called from my T-Mobile phone.  Every time I reached a human, I asked for his/her direct line in case I was disconnected.  They would all give me the number for the dept.  I would provide my number, and ask to be called back.

They dropped me repeatedly, but yay!  after sharing far too much personal info, and being transferred between reps, I was approved for service.

So far, I have received no service from the store.  On my way out, I ask one rep: "Excuse me, do you have a rate table for making international calls on the Simple Choice plan?"

"No."

"Maybe you can show me where it is on the website?  I had trouble finding it."

"No.  You should be aware what you're doing is fraudulent."

"Excuse me?"

"You're going on a Simple Choice plan to go abroad and you're just going to cancel it after.  Isn't that fraudulent?"

"No.  I'm waiting for you to offer the Nexus before signing on to a contract.  But even if I were going to switch to another plan at some point, how is that fraudulent?  It's only fraudulent if I say I'm staying with this plan, and then I don't."

"I'm not saying you're fraudulent.  I'm just saying that's fraudulent."

So: No service from the store.  Free & false accusation of fraud thrown in.

Really rude manager who does not know enough about what can be and can not be done at store.  Went there to  buy off a leased phone, paid it off but the manager did not mention anything about unlocking. When I went back and requested an unlock all I got was "we can't do that at store. You have to call customer service," when I tried to give feedback that this is a hassle to customers, all I got was "it's a policy." And it turns out they can actually put in a request to unlock the phone just like customer service can. I just confirmed that with t-mobile customer service. The guy just did not know/did not want to do it.  And behaved extremely rude refusing to help. Who does this? First time such a bad  experience at t-mobile store. Stay away from this store.

Eek is right!  I've had poor service before, but this is the first time in my life I've been ACCUSED OF FRAUD by a customer service rep who also refused to help me.I have been an existing T-Mobile prepaid customer for 1.5 years.  I have a great unlocked phone that's still going strong, and I'm waiting for the next Nexus before signing on to a 2-yr contract.  I came to this T-Mobile store to convert my existing plan to an international plan since I have some travel coming up.  (I had called the 1-800 #s from a landline, but was disconnected repeatedly).There were 2 reps in the store.  One said he couldn't convert my account in time for my travel.  I said I had called online and they could do it today, but I kept getting disconnected during the activation process.  The rep said maybe they could do it from the service center, but the store couldn't.I suspect this is just store policy, but I called from my T-Mobile phone.  Every time I reached a human, I asked for his/her direct line in case I was disconnected.  They would all give me the number for the dept.  I would provide my number, and ask to be called back.They dropped me repeatedly, but yay!  after sharing far too much personal info, and being transferred between reps, I was approved for service.So far, I have received no service from the store.  On my way out, I ask one rep: "Excuse me, do you have a rate table for making international calls on the Simple Choice plan?""No.""Maybe you can show me where it is on the website?  I had trouble finding it.""No.  You should be aware what you're doing is fraudulent.""Excuse me?""You're going on a Simple Choice plan to go abroad and you're just going to cancel it after.  Isn't that fraudulent?""No.  I'm waiting for you to offer the Nexus before signing on to a contract.  But even if I were going to switch to another plan at some point, how is that fraudulent?  It's only fraudulent if I say I'm staying with this plan, and then I don't.""I'm not saying you're fraudulent.  I'm just saying that's fraudulent."So: No service from the store.  Free & false accusation of fraud thrown in.

This is a consumer revolution and we're just getting started. We're changing the wireless industry, one pain-point at a time. Stuck counting the days until your next phone upgrade? Not with T-Mobile® and JUMP! On Demand®. Get the phone you want, when you want up to three times per year. Mobile Without Borders brings you coverage in three countries for the price of one with unlimited calls, texts, and data in Mexico and Canada at no extra charge. And with Data Stash®, now your unused data rolls forward for up to 12 months and 20 GB. It's your data. Keep it®. So why wait? Make the switch to T-Mobile today. Coverage Think you know T-Mobile's coverage? Think again. In the last year we've doubled our 4G LTE network. Now The Un-Carrier® is covering nearly every American. And our new Extended Range LTE reaches twice as far and is four times better in buildings than before.

Really rude manager who does not know enough about what can be and can not be done at store.  Went there to  buy off a leased phone, paid it off but the manager did not mention anything about unlocking. 

When I went back and requested an unlock all I got was "we can't do that at store. You have to call customer service," when I tried to give feedback that this is a hassle to customers, all I got was "it's a policy." 

And it turns out they can actually put in a request to unlock the phone just like customer service can. I just confirmed that with t-mobile customer service. The guy just did not know/did not want to do it.  And behaved extremely rude refusing to help. 

Who does this? First time such a bad  experience at t-mobile store. Stay away from this store.







Eek is right!  I've had poor service before, but this is the first time in my life I've been ACCUSED OF FRAUD by a customer service rep who also refused to help me.

I have been an existing T-Mobile prepaid customer for 1.5 years.  I have a great unlocked phone that's still going strong, and I'm waiting for the next Nexus before signing on to a 2-yr contract.  

I came to this T-Mobile store to convert my existing plan to an international plan since I have some travel coming up.  (I had called the 1-800 #s from a landline, but was disconnected repeatedly).

There were 2 reps in the store.  One said he couldn't convert my account in time for my travel.  I said I had called online and they could do it today, but I kept getting disconnected during the activation process.  The rep said maybe they could do it from the service center, but the store couldn't.

I suspect this is just store policy, but I called from my T-Mobile phone.  Every time I reached a human, I asked for his/her direct line in case I was disconnected.  They would all give me the number for the dept.  I would provide my number, and ask to be called back.

They dropped me repeatedly, but yay!  after sharing far too much personal info, and being transferred between reps, I was approved for service.

So far, I have received no service from the store.  On my way out, I ask one rep: "Excuse me, do you have a rate table for making international calls on the Simple Choice plan?"

"No."

"Maybe you can show me where it is on the website?  I had trouble finding it."

"No.  You should be aware what you're doing is fraudulent."

"Excuse me?"

"You're going on a Simple Choice plan to go abroad and you're just going to cancel it after.  Isn't that fraudulent?"

"No.  I'm waiting for you to offer the Nexus before signing on to a contract.  But even if I were going to switch to another plan at some point, how is that fraudulent?  It's only fraudulent if I say I'm staying with this plan, and then I don't."

"I'm not saying you're fraudulent.  I'm just saying that's fraudulent."

So: No service from the store.  Free & false accusation of fraud thrown in.







Transferring from Sprint, messed up few steps, but Sean was stellar in getting things sorted for me.  Great service.







Amazing customer service, quick and very friendly. I decided to switch from AT&T to T mobile because they had great offers. You don't have to use your data to play pandora, Netflix and YouTube. The whole process was done so fast and easy, thanks T-mobile!
The employees at this location are so great and friendly and will answer all your questions.







Super good service. Very knowledgeable staff.  Highly recommend this location. The best wireless experience so far for me.







I came here for my first time to buy a new phone and the guys were so friendly and helpful, specially Xavier and Manuel, thank you guys for your help,
Also I wasted my money before with At&t, sprint, metro pcs, but T-mobile definitely makes me happy..







Wow brand new store in Mountain View really nice and clean store! Friendly staff! Since it's a new store there is literally NO wait! T-Mobile rocks!

Really rude manager who does not know enough about what can be and can not be done at store.  Went there to  buy off a leased phone, paid it off but the manager did not mention anything about unlocking. When I went back and requested an unlock all I got was "we can't do that at store. You have to call customer service," when I tried to give feedback that this is a hassle to customers, all I got was "it's a policy." And it turns out they can actually put in a request to unlock the phone just like customer service can. I just confirmed that with t-mobile customer service. The guy just did not know/did not want to do it.  And behaved extremely rude refusing to help. Who does this? First time such a bad  experience at t-mobile store. Stay away from this store.

Eek is right!  I've had poor service before, but this is the first time in my life I've been ACCUSED OF FRAUD by a customer service rep who also refused to help me.I have been an existing T-Mobile prepaid customer for 1.5 years.  I have a great unlocked phone that's still going strong, and I'm waiting for the next Nexus before signing on to a 2-yr contract.  I came to this T-Mobile store to convert my existing plan to an international plan since I have some travel coming up.  (I had called the 1-800 #s from a landline, but was disconnected repeatedly).There were 2 reps in the store.  One said he couldn't convert my account in time for my travel.  I said I had called online and they could do it today, but I kept getting disconnected during the activation process.  The rep said maybe they could do it from the service center, but the store couldn't.I suspect this is just store policy, but I called from my T-Mobile phone.  Every time I reached a human, I asked for his/her direct line in case I was disconnected.  They would all give me the number for the dept.  I would provide my number, and ask to be called back.They dropped me repeatedly, but yay!  after sharing far too much personal info, and being transferred between reps, I was approved for service.So far, I have received no service from the store.  On my way out, I ask one rep: "Excuse me, do you have a rate table for making international calls on the Simple Choice plan?""No.""Maybe you can show me where it is on the website?  I had trouble finding it.""No.  You should be aware what you're doing is fraudulent.""Excuse me?""You're going on a Simple Choice plan to go abroad and you're just going to cancel it after.  Isn't that fraudulent?""No.  I'm waiting for you to offer the Nexus before signing on to a contract.  But even if I were going to switch to another plan at some point, how is that fraudulent?  It's only fraudulent if I say I'm staying with this plan, and then I don't.""I'm not saying you're fraudulent.  I'm just saying that's fraudulent."So: No service from the store.  Free & false accusation of fraud thrown in.

Amazing customer service, quick and very friendly. I decided to switch from AT&T to T mobile because they had great offers. You don't have to use your data to play pandora, Netflix and YouTube. The whole process was done so fast and easy, thanks T-mobile!The employees at this location are so great and friendly and will answer all your questions.

Specialties

            We're not like other wireless carriers. We're breaking the old rules of wireless with no annual service contracts, no overages, and no data sharing on America's Fastest 4G LTE Network. This is a consumer revolution and we're just getting started. We're changing the wireless industry, one pain-point at a time. Stuck counting the days until your next phone upgrade? Not with T-Mobile® and JUMP! On Demand®. Get the phone you want, when you want up to three times per year. Mobile Without Borders brings you coverage in three countries for the price of one with unlimited calls, texts, and data in Mexico and Canada at no extra charge. And with Data Stash®, now your unused data rolls forward for up to 12 months and 20 GB. It's your data. Keep it®. So why wait? Make the switch to T-Mobile today. Coverage Think you know T-Mobile's coverage? Think again. In the last year we've doubled our 4G LTE network. Now The Un-Carrier® is covering nearly every American. And our new Extended Range LTE reaches twice as far and is four times better in buildings than before.

Transferring from Sprint, messed up few steps, but Sean was stellar in getting things sorted for me.  Great service.







I came here for my first time to buy a new phone and the guys were so friendly and helpful, specially Xavier and Manuel, thank you guys for your help,
Also I wasted my money before with At&t, sprint, metro pcs, but T-mobile definitely makes me happy..







Really rude manager who does not know enough about what can be and can not be done at store.  Went there to  buy off a leased phone, paid it off but the manager did not mention anything about unlocking. 

When I went back and requested an unlock all I got was "we can't do that at store. You have to call customer service," when I tried to give feedback that this is a hassle to customers, all I got was "it's a policy." 

And it turns out they can actually put in a request to unlock the phone just like customer service can. I just confirmed that with t-mobile customer service. The guy just did not know/did not want to do it.  And behaved extremely rude refusing to help. 

Who does this? First time such a bad  experience at t-mobile store. Stay away from this store.







Eek is right!  I've had poor service before, but this is the first time in my life I've been ACCUSED OF FRAUD by a customer service rep who also refused to help me.

I have been an existing T-Mobile prepaid customer for 1.5 years.  I have a great unlocked phone that's still going strong, and I'm waiting for the next Nexus before signing on to a 2-yr contract.  

I came to this T-Mobile store to convert my existing plan to an international plan since I have some travel coming up.  (I had called the 1-800 #s from a landline, but was disconnected repeatedly).

There were 2 reps in the store.  One said he couldn't convert my account in time for my travel.  I said I had called online and they could do it today, but I kept getting disconnected during the activation process.  The rep said maybe they could do it from the service center, but the store couldn't.

I suspect this is just store policy, but I called from my T-Mobile phone.  Every time I reached a human, I asked for his/her direct line in case I was disconnected.  They would all give me the number for the dept.  I would provide my number, and ask to be called back.

They dropped me repeatedly, but yay!  after sharing far too much personal info, and being transferred between reps, I was approved for service.

So far, I have received no service from the store.  On my way out, I ask one rep: "Excuse me, do you have a rate table for making international calls on the Simple Choice plan?"

"No."

"Maybe you can show me where it is on the website?  I had trouble finding it."

"No.  You should be aware what you're doing is fraudulent."

"Excuse me?"

"You're going on a Simple Choice plan to go abroad and you're just going to cancel it after.  Isn't that fraudulent?"

"No.  I'm waiting for you to offer the Nexus before signing on to a contract.  But even if I were going to switch to another plan at some point, how is that fraudulent?  It's only fraudulent if I say I'm staying with this plan, and then I don't."

"I'm not saying you're fraudulent.  I'm just saying that's fraudulent."

So: No service from the store.  Free & false accusation of fraud thrown in.







Amazing customer service, quick and very friendly. I decided to switch from AT&T to T mobile because they had great offers. You don't have to use your data to play pandora, Netflix and YouTube. The whole process was done so fast and easy, thanks T-mobile!
The employees at this location are so great and friendly and will answer all your questions.

Really rude manager who does not know enough about what can be and can not be done at store.  Went there to  buy off a leased phone, paid it off but the manager did not mention anything about unlocking. When I went back and requested an unlock all I got was "we can't do that at store. You have to call customer service," when I tried to give feedback that this is a hassle to customers, all I got was "it's a policy." And it turns out they can actually put in a request to unlock the phone just like customer service can. I just confirmed that with t-mobile customer service. The guy just did not know/did not want to do it.  And behaved extremely rude refusing to help. Who does this? First time such a bad  experience at t-mobile store. Stay away from this store.

Eek is right!  I've had poor service before, but this is the first time in my life I've been ACCUSED OF FRAUD by a customer service rep who also refused to help me.I have been an existing T-Mobile prepaid customer for 1.5 years.  I have a great unlocked phone that's still going strong, and I'm waiting for the next Nexus before signing on to a 2-yr contract.  I came to this T-Mobile store to convert my existing plan to an international plan since I have some travel coming up.  (I had called the 1-800 #s from a landline, but was disconnected repeatedly).There were 2 reps in the store.  One said he couldn't convert my account in time for my travel.  I said I had called online and they could do it today, but I kept getting disconnected during the activation process.  The rep said maybe they could do it from the service center, but the store couldn't.I suspect this is just store policy, but I called from my T-Mobile phone.  Every time I reached a human, I asked for his/her direct line in case I was disconnected.  They would all give me the number for the dept.  I would provide my number, and ask to be called back.They dropped me repeatedly, but yay!  after sharing far too much personal info, and being transferred between reps, I was approved for service.So far, I have received no service from the store.  On my way out, I ask one rep: "Excuse me, do you have a rate table for making international calls on the Simple Choice plan?""No.""Maybe you can show me where it is on the website?  I had trouble finding it.""No.  You should be aware what you're doing is fraudulent.""Excuse me?""You're going on a Simple Choice plan to go abroad and you're just going to cancel it after.  Isn't that fraudulent?""No.  I'm waiting for you to offer the Nexus before signing on to a contract.  But even if I were going to switch to another plan at some point, how is that fraudulent?  It's only fraudulent if I say I'm staying with this plan, and then I don't.""I'm not saying you're fraudulent.  I'm just saying that's fraudulent."So: No service from the store.  Free & false accusation of fraud thrown in.

From the business

Specialties

            We're not like other wireless carriers. We're breaking the old rules of wireless with no annual service contracts, no overages, and no data sharing on America's Fastest 4G LTE Network. This is a consumer revolution and we're just getting started. We're changing the wireless industry, one pain-point at a time. Stuck counting the days until your next phone upgrade? Not with T-Mobile® and JUMP! On Demand®. Get the phone you want, when you want up to three times per year. Mobile Without Borders brings you coverage in three countries for the price of one with unlimited calls, texts, and data in Mexico and Canada at no extra charge. And with Data Stash®, now your unused data rolls forward for up to 12 months and 20 GB. It's your data. Keep it®. So why wait? Make the switch to T-Mobile today. Coverage Think you know T-Mobile's coverage? Think again. In the last year we've doubled our 4G LTE network. Now The Un-Carrier® is covering nearly every American. And our new Extended Range LTE reaches twice as far and is four times better in buildings than before.

Really rude manager who does not know enough about what can be and can not be done at store.  Went there to  buy off a leased phone, paid it off but the manager did not mention anything about unlocking. 

When I went back and requested an unlock all I got was "we can't do that at store. You have to call customer service," when I tried to give feedback that this is a hassle to customers, all I got was "it's a policy." 

And it turns out they can actually put in a request to unlock the phone just like customer service can. I just confirmed that with t-mobile customer service. The guy just did not know/did not want to do it.  And behaved extremely rude refusing to help. 

Who does this? First time such a bad  experience at t-mobile store. Stay away from this store.







Transferring from Sprint, messed up few steps, but Sean was stellar in getting things sorted for me.  Great service.







I came here for my first time to buy a new phone and the guys were so friendly and helpful, specially Xavier and Manuel, thank you guys for your help,
Also I wasted my money before with At&t, sprint, metro pcs, but T-mobile definitely makes me happy..







Eek is right!  I've had poor service before, but this is the first time in my life I've been ACCUSED OF FRAUD by a customer service rep who also refused to help me.

I have been an existing T-Mobile prepaid customer for 1.5 years.  I have a great unlocked phone that's still going strong, and I'm waiting for the next Nexus before signing on to a 2-yr contract.  

I came to this T-Mobile store to convert my existing plan to an international plan since I have some travel coming up.  (I had called the 1-800 #s from a landline, but was disconnected repeatedly).

There were 2 reps in the store.  One said he couldn't convert my account in time for my travel.  I said I had called online and they could do it today, but I kept getting disconnected during the activation process.  The rep said maybe they could do it from the service center, but the store couldn't.

I suspect this is just store policy, but I called from my T-Mobile phone.  Every time I reached a human, I asked for his/her direct line in case I was disconnected.  They would all give me the number for the dept.  I would provide my number, and ask to be called back.

They dropped me repeatedly, but yay!  after sharing far too much personal info, and being transferred between reps, I was approved for service.

So far, I have received no service from the store.  On my way out, I ask one rep: "Excuse me, do you have a rate table for making international calls on the Simple Choice plan?"

"No."

"Maybe you can show me where it is on the website?  I had trouble finding it."

"No.  You should be aware what you're doing is fraudulent."

"Excuse me?"

"You're going on a Simple Choice plan to go abroad and you're just going to cancel it after.  Isn't that fraudulent?"

"No.  I'm waiting for you to offer the Nexus before signing on to a contract.  But even if I were going to switch to another plan at some point, how is that fraudulent?  It's only fraudulent if I say I'm staying with this plan, and then I don't."

"I'm not saying you're fraudulent.  I'm just saying that's fraudulent."

So: No service from the store.  Free & false accusation of fraud thrown in.

Amazing customer service, quick and very friendly. I decided to switch from AT&T to T mobile because they had great offers. You don't have to use your data to play pandora, Netflix and YouTube. The whole process was done so fast and easy, thanks T-mobile!
The employees at this location are so great and friendly and will answer all your questions.







Wow brand new store in Mountain View really nice and clean store! Friendly staff! Since it's a new store there is literally NO wait! T-Mobile rocks!







Super good service. Very knowledgeable staff.  Highly recommend this location. The best wireless experience so far for me.

From the business

Specialties

            We're not like other wireless carriers. We're breaking the old rules of wireless with no annual service contracts, no overages, and no data sharing on America's Fastest 4G LTE Network. This is a consumer revolution and we're just getting started. We're changing the wireless industry, one pain-point at a time. Stuck counting the days until your next phone upgrade? Not with T-Mobile® and JUMP! On Demand®. Get the phone you want, when you want up to three times per year. Mobile Without Borders brings you coverage in three countries for the price of one with unlimited calls, texts, and data in Mexico and Canada at no extra charge. And with Data Stash®, now your unused data rolls forward for up to 12 months and 20 GB. It's your data. Keep it®. So why wait? Make the switch to T-Mobile today. Coverage Think you know T-Mobile's coverage? Think again. In the last year we've doubled our 4G LTE network. Now The Un-Carrier® is covering nearly every American. And our new Extended Range LTE reaches twice as far and is four times better in buildings than before.

Eek is right!  I've had poor service before, but this is the first time in my life I've been ACCUSED OF FRAUD by a customer service rep who also refused to help me.

I have been an existing T-Mobile prepaid customer for 1.5 years.  I have a great unlocked phone that's still going strong, and I'm waiting for the next Nexus before signing on to a 2-yr contract.  

I came to this T-Mobile store to convert my existing plan to an international plan since I have some travel coming up.  (I had called the 1-800 #s from a landline, but was disconnected repeatedly).

There were 2 reps in the store.  One said he couldn't convert my account in time for my travel.  I said I had called online and they could do it today, but I kept getting disconnected during the activation process.  The rep said maybe they could do it from the service center, but the store couldn't.

I suspect this is just store policy, but I called from my T-Mobile phone.  Every time I reached a human, I asked for his/her direct line in case I was disconnected.  They would all give me the number for the dept.  I would provide my number, and ask to be called back.

They dropped me repeatedly, but yay!  after sharing far too much personal info, and being transferred between reps, I was approved for service.

So far, I have received no service from the store.  On my way out, I ask one rep: "Excuse me, do you have a rate table for making international calls on the Simple Choice plan?"

"No."

"Maybe you can show me where it is on the website?  I had trouble finding it."

"No.  You should be aware what you're doing is fraudulent."

"Excuse me?"

"You're going on a Simple Choice plan to go abroad and you're just going to cancel it after.  Isn't that fraudulent?"

"No.  I'm waiting for you to offer the Nexus before signing on to a contract.  But even if I were going to switch to another plan at some point, how is that fraudulent?  It's only fraudulent if I say I'm staying with this plan, and then I don't."

"I'm not saying you're fraudulent.  I'm just saying that's fraudulent."

So: No service from the store.  Free & false accusation of fraud thrown in.







Transferring from Sprint, messed up few steps, but Sean was stellar in getting things sorted for me.  Great service.







I came here for my first time to buy a new phone and the guys were so friendly and helpful, specially Xavier and Manuel, thank you guys for your help,
Also I wasted my money before with At&t, sprint, metro pcs, but T-mobile definitely makes me happy..

Really rude manager who does not know enough about what can be and can not be done at store.  Went there to  buy off a leased phone, paid it off but the manager did not mention anything about unlocking. 

When I went back and requested an unlock all I got was "we can't do that at store. You have to call customer service," when I tried to give feedback that this is a hassle to customers, all I got was "it's a policy." 

And it turns out they can actually put in a request to unlock the phone just like customer service can. I just confirmed that with t-mobile customer service. The guy just did not know/did not want to do it.  And behaved extremely rude refusing to help. 

Who does this? First time such a bad  experience at t-mobile store. Stay away from this store.







Amazing customer service, quick and very friendly. I decided to switch from AT&T to T mobile because they had great offers. You don't have to use your data to play pandora, Netflix and YouTube. The whole process was done so fast and easy, thanks T-mobile!
The employees at this location are so great and friendly and will answer all your questions.







Wow brand new store in Mountain View really nice and clean store! Friendly staff! Since it's a new store there is literally NO wait! T-Mobile rocks!







Super good service. Very knowledgeable staff.  Highly recommend this location. The best wireless experience so far for me.

            We're not like other wireless carriers. We're breaking the old rules of wireless with no annual service contracts, no overages, and no data sharing on America's Fastest 4G LTE Network. This is a consumer revolution and we're just getting started. We're changing the wireless industry, one pain-point at a time. Stuck counting the days until your next phone upgrade? Not with T-Mobile® and JUMP! On Demand®. Get the phone you want, when you want up to three times per year. Mobile Without Borders brings you coverage in three countries for the price of one with unlimited calls, texts, and data in Mexico and Canada at no extra charge. And with Data Stash®, now your unused data rolls forward for up to 12 months and 20 GB. It's your data. Keep it®. So why wait? Make the switch to T-Mobile today. Coverage Think you know T-Mobile's coverage? Think again. In the last year we've doubled our 4G LTE network. Now The Un-Carrier® is covering nearly every American. And our new Extended Range LTE reaches twice as far and is four times better in buildings than before.

Transferring from Sprint, messed up few steps, but Sean was stellar in getting things sorted for me.  Great service.







I came here for my first time to buy a new phone and the guys were so friendly and helpful, specially Xavier and Manuel, thank you guys for your help,
Also I wasted my money before with At&t, sprint, metro pcs, but T-mobile definitely makes me happy..







Eek is right!  I've had poor service before, but this is the first time in my life I've been ACCUSED OF FRAUD by a customer service rep who also refused to help me.

I have been an existing T-Mobile prepaid customer for 1.5 years.  I have a great unlocked phone that's still going strong, and I'm waiting for the next Nexus before signing on to a 2-yr contract.  

I came to this T-Mobile store to convert my existing plan to an international plan since I have some travel coming up.  (I had called the 1-800 #s from a landline, but was disconnected repeatedly).

There were 2 reps in the store.  One said he couldn't convert my account in time for my travel.  I said I had called online and they could do it today, but I kept getting disconnected during the activation process.  The rep said maybe they could do it from the service center, but the store couldn't.

I suspect this is just store policy, but I called from my T-Mobile phone.  Every time I reached a human, I asked for his/her direct line in case I was disconnected.  They would all give me the number for the dept.  I would provide my number, and ask to be called back.

They dropped me repeatedly, but yay!  after sharing far too much personal info, and being transferred between reps, I was approved for service.

So far, I have received no service from the store.  On my way out, I ask one rep: "Excuse me, do you have a rate table for making international calls on the Simple Choice plan?"

"No."

"Maybe you can show me where it is on the website?  I had trouble finding it."

"No.  You should be aware what you're doing is fraudulent."

"Excuse me?"

"You're going on a Simple Choice plan to go abroad and you're just going to cancel it after.  Isn't that fraudulent?"

"No.  I'm waiting for you to offer the Nexus before signing on to a contract.  But even if I were going to switch to another plan at some point, how is that fraudulent?  It's only fraudulent if I say I'm staying with this plan, and then I don't."

"I'm not saying you're fraudulent.  I'm just saying that's fraudulent."

So: No service from the store.  Free & false accusation of fraud thrown in.







Really rude manager who does not know enough about what can be and can not be done at store.  Went there to  buy off a leased phone, paid it off but the manager did not mention anything about unlocking. 

When I went back and requested an unlock all I got was "we can't do that at store. You have to call customer service," when I tried to give feedback that this is a hassle to customers, all I got was "it's a policy." 

And it turns out they can actually put in a request to unlock the phone just like customer service can. I just confirmed that with t-mobile customer service. The guy just did not know/did not want to do it.  And behaved extremely rude refusing to help. 

Who does this? First time such a bad  experience at t-mobile store. Stay away from this store.







Amazing customer service, quick and very friendly. I decided to switch from AT&T to T mobile because they had great offers. You don't have to use your data to play pandora, Netflix and YouTube. The whole process was done so fast and easy, thanks T-mobile!
The employees at this location are so great and friendly and will answer all your questions.







Wow brand new store in Mountain View really nice and clean store! Friendly staff! Since it's a new store there is literally NO wait! T-Mobile rocks!







Super good service. Very knowledgeable staff.  Highly recommend this location. The best wireless experience so far for me.

From the business

Specialties

            We're not like other wireless carriers. We're breaking the old rules of wireless with no annual service contracts, no overages, and no data sharing on America's Fastest 4G LTE Network. This is a consumer revolution and we're just getting started. We're changing the wireless industry, one pain-point at a time. Stuck counting the days until your next phone upgrade? Not with T-Mobile® and JUMP! On Demand®. Get the phone you want, when you want up to three times per year. Mobile Without Borders brings you coverage in three countries for the price of one with unlimited calls, texts, and data in Mexico and Canada at no extra charge. And with Data Stash®, now your unused data rolls forward for up to 12 months and 20 GB. It's your data. Keep it®. So why wait? Make the switch to T-Mobile today. Coverage Think you know T-Mobile's coverage? Think again. In the last year we've doubled our 4G LTE network. Now The Un-Carrier® is covering nearly every American. And our new Extended Range LTE reaches twice as far and is four times better in buildings than before.

Transferring from Sprint, messed up few steps, but Sean was stellar in getting things sorted for me.  Great service.







I came here for my first time to buy a new phone and the guys were so friendly and helpful, specially Xavier and Manuel, thank you guys for your help,
Also I wasted my money before with At&t, sprint, metro pcs, but T-mobile definitely makes me happy..







Eek is right!  I've had poor service before, but this is the first time in my life I've been ACCUSED OF FRAUD by a customer service rep who also refused to help me.

I have been an existing T-Mobile prepaid customer for 1.5 years.  I have a great unlocked phone that's still going strong, and I'm waiting for the next Nexus before signing on to a 2-yr contract.  

I came to this T-Mobile store to convert my existing plan to an international plan since I have some travel coming up.  (I had called the 1-800 #s from a landline, but was disconnected repeatedly).

There were 2 reps in the store.  One said he couldn't convert my account in time for my travel.  I said I had called online and they could do it today, but I kept getting disconnected during the activation process.  The rep said maybe they could do it from the service center, but the store couldn't.

I suspect this is just store policy, but I called from my T-Mobile phone.  Every time I reached a human, I asked for his/her direct line in case I was disconnected.  They would all give me the number for the dept.  I would provide my number, and ask to be called back.

They dropped me repeatedly, but yay!  after sharing far too much personal info, and being transferred between reps, I was approved for service.

So far, I have received no service from the store.  On my way out, I ask one rep: "Excuse me, do you have a rate table for making international calls on the Simple Choice plan?"

"No."

"Maybe you can show me where it is on the website?  I had trouble finding it."

"No.  You should be aware what you're doing is fraudulent."

"Excuse me?"

"You're going on a Simple Choice plan to go abroad and you're just going to cancel it after.  Isn't that fraudulent?"

"No.  I'm waiting for you to offer the Nexus before signing on to a contract.  But even if I were going to switch to another plan at some point, how is that fraudulent?  It's only fraudulent if I say I'm staying with this plan, and then I don't."

"I'm not saying you're fraudulent.  I'm just saying that's fraudulent."

So: No service from the store.  Free & false accusation of fraud thrown in.







Really rude manager who does not know enough about what can be and can not be done at store.  Went there to  buy off a leased phone, paid it off but the manager did not mention anything about unlocking. 

When I went back and requested an unlock all I got was "we can't do that at store. You have to call customer service," when I tried to give feedback that this is a hassle to customers, all I got was "it's a policy." 

And it turns out they can actually put in a request to unlock the phone just like customer service can. I just confirmed that with t-mobile customer service. The guy just did not know/did not want to do it.  And behaved extremely rude refusing to help. 

Who does this? First time such a bad  experience at t-mobile store. Stay away from this store.







Amazing customer service, quick and very friendly. I decided to switch from AT&T to T mobile because they had great offers. You don't have to use your data to play pandora, Netflix and YouTube. The whole process was done so fast and easy, thanks T-mobile!
The employees at this location are so great and friendly and will answer all your questions.







Wow brand new store in Mountain View really nice and clean store! Friendly staff! Since it's a new store there is literally NO wait! T-Mobile rocks!

Eek is right!  I've had poor service before, but this is the first time in my life I've been ACCUSED OF FRAUD by a customer service rep who also refused to help me.I have been an existing T-Mobile prepaid customer for 1.5 years.  I have a great unlocked phone that's still going strong, and I'm waiting for the next Nexus before signing on to a 2-yr contract.  I came to this T-Mobile store to convert my existing plan to an international plan since I have some travel coming up.  (I had called the 1-800 #s from a landline, but was disconnected repeatedly).There were 2 reps in the store.  One said he couldn't convert my account in time for my travel.  I said I had called online and they could do it today, but I kept getting disconnected during the activation process.  The rep said maybe they could do it from the service center, but the store couldn't.I suspect this is just store policy, but I called from my T-Mobile phone.  Every time I reached a human, I asked for his/her direct line in case I was disconnected.  They would all give me the number for the dept.  I would provide my number, and ask to be called back.They dropped me repeatedly, but yay!  after sharing far too much personal info, and being transferred between reps, I was approved for service.So far, I have received no service from the store.  On my way out, I ask one rep: "Excuse me, do you have a rate table for making international calls on the Simple Choice plan?""No.""Maybe you can show me where it is on the website?  I had trouble finding it.""No.  You should be aware what you're doing is fraudulent.""Excuse me?""You're going on a Simple Choice plan to go abroad and you're just going to cancel it after.  Isn't that fraudulent?""No.  I'm waiting for you to offer the Nexus before signing on to a contract.  But even if I were going to switch to another plan at some point, how is that fraudulent?  It's only fraudulent if I say I'm staying with this plan, and then I don't.""I'm not saying you're fraudulent.  I'm just saying that's fraudulent."So: No service from the store.  Free & false accusation of fraud thrown in.

Really rude manager who does not know enough about what can be and can not be done at store.  Went there to  buy off a leased phone, paid it off but the manager did not mention anything about unlocking. When I went back and requested an unlock all I got was "we can't do that at store. You have to call customer service," when I tried to give feedback that this is a hassle to customers, all I got was "it's a policy." And it turns out they can actually put in a request to unlock the phone just like customer service can. I just confirmed that with t-mobile customer service. The guy just did not know/did not want to do it.  And behaved extremely rude refusing to help. Who does this? First time such a bad  experience at t-mobile store. Stay away from this store.

Amazing customer service, quick and very friendly. I decided to switch from AT&T to T mobile because they had great offers. You don't have to use your data to play pandora, Netflix and YouTube. The whole process was done so fast and easy, thanks T-mobile!The employees at this location are so great and friendly and will answer all your questions.

From the business

Specialties

            We're not like other wireless carriers. We're breaking the old rules of wireless with no annual service contracts, no overages, and no data sharing on America's Fastest 4G LTE Network. This is a consumer revolution and we're just getting started. We're changing the wireless industry, one pain-point at a time. Stuck counting the days until your next phone upgrade? Not with T-Mobile® and JUMP! On Demand®. Get the phone you want, when you want up to three times per year. Mobile Without Borders brings you coverage in three countries for the price of one with unlimited calls, texts, and data in Mexico and Canada at no extra charge. And with Data Stash®, now your unused data rolls forward for up to 12 months and 20 GB. It's your data. Keep it®. So why wait? Make the switch to T-Mobile today. Coverage Think you know T-Mobile's coverage? Think again. In the last year we've doubled our 4G LTE network. Now The Un-Carrier® is covering nearly every American. And our new Extended Range LTE reaches twice as far and is four times better in buildings than before.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
