Leadership Team














Leadership Team



Doug Williams
Chief Executive Officer
Professional background
Doug Williams focuses on driving value for clients through continual advancements in solutions to the market and the internal capabilities of the organizations he’s led. He was CEO of iHealth Technologies when it was founded in 2001 and now carries on his leadership at the helm of Cotiviti. Doug also held strategic positions at Magellan Specialty Health, Vivra and CIGNA Healthcare.
In his own words
Cotiviti is an investment in the future we share with our clients. It affirms our ability to collaborate with healthcare payers and retailers to deliver solutions that maximize their profitability and operating performance. It also represents our ability to continue to grow, offer opportunities to our employees and deliver meaningful value to our clients – under one unified corporate brand name. I am proud to be part of the team at Cotiviti and look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues to ensure that we remain at the forefront of the industries we serve.

David Beaulieu
Chief Operations Officer
Professional background
Dave leads our operations and analytics teams as they carry out their commitment to deliver solutions and services to our clients. He joined our company in 2010, bringing a wealth of healthcare industry knowledge and experience. Dave held senior operational and reengineering positions at CIGNA Healthcare before moving on to other roles, including leading government business consulting at First Consulting Group. He also served as operations leader at Amisys-Synertech and headed business and solutions development at DST Health Solutions.
In his own words
Cotiviti is about driving performance and continuous improvement. Our team works diligently to increase the value we deliver to our clients. Client trust is a privilege we must constantly earn by executing well and delivering what we promise.

Steve Senneff
Chief Financial Officer
Professional background
With 20 years of experience, Steve is credited with driving top-line and bottom-line results for companies that operate on a global scale. Steve began his career at Abbott Laboratories before holding various leadership positions across Asia, Latin America and the U.S. for the Nielsen Company. At Cotiviti since 2012, Steve provides strategic and operational direction, employing his passion for results and collaborative leadership style to influence the direction of the company.
In his own words
It’s very rewarding to see the company hit one milestone after another after a successful merger. I’m committed to finding solutions to complex issues to ensure that Cotiviti delivers industry-leading services and business results for our clients.

Damien Creavin
Chief Information Officer
Professional background
Damien is the company’s principal technologist, bringing diverse experience from a career that spans three widely varied industries: Healthcare, Media and Electronics. He has held C-level positions at Emdeon, Primedia and Time Inc. He worked in software development and engineering, holding positions at global enterprises such as AIT (a Hitachi Chemical company), PCK Technology, General Electric and ICI in the UK.
In his own words
One of the benefits of having worked in three different industry domains is the opportunity to learn from the different ways they evolve: from explosive growth, to disintermediation and on to the possibilities for dramatic transformation.

Jon Olefson
Senior Vice President, General Counsel
Professional background
Jon oversees all legal, compliance, regulatory, risk management and corporate governance matters across Cotiviti. In addition, he leads the company’s corporate and government affairs efforts. Prior to joining our company, Jon spent nine years at Cognizant Technology Solutions as the general counsel for corporate governance and securities matters, corporate development, intellectual property and licensing. Before his time at Cognizant, Jon was an associate at a large international law firm. His experience has given him an appreciation for global business law and operations.
In his own words
I’ve been working with fast-moving and growing technology businesses since I graduated from law school. I love the unique environment and challenges that rapid growth presents, as well as the need to quickly provide practical advice. Much like Cotiviti clients, we don’t have time to sit and look at problems. Instead, we focus on quickly identifying and dealing with the core issues.

Dr. Richard Pozen
Executive Vice President, Chief Medical Officer
Professional background
A co-founder of iHealth Technologies with extensive experience on both the payer and provider sides of healthcare, Dr. Pozen oversees Cotiviti Healthcare’s clinical solutions. His medical career extends back more than 40 years, when he was a resident at Montefiore Hospital. He also trained at Georgetown University Hospital before joining the Department of Cardiology faculty at the University of Miami. After running a private practice for 14 years, Dr. Pozen went on to found Cardiology Network, Inc. to provide specialty management services to healthcare payers. He subsequently held leadership positions at Vivra Specialty Partners and Magellan Specialty Health.
In his own words
I like to come up with new solutions in response to the needs of our clients. The creation of Cotiviti has given me an opportunity to extend that interest in innovation through a broader scope of services and value that neither company could provide alone.

Mike Sick
Executive Vice President, Cotiviti Healthcare
Professional background
Mike Sick is responsible for the continuing development and growth of Cotiviti Healthcare. He is instrumental in helping our healthcare teams progress through new learning curves as we go about reshaping the way payment accuracy is achieved. Beginning his career in Johnson & Johnson‘s pharmaceutical sector, followed by director-level positions at Oxford Health Plans, Mike brings a wealth of experience in healthcare to his work at Cotiviti Healthcare.
In his own words
For the past 16 years, I’ve seen our company grow, change and adapt as our teams worked closely together to deliver value to our clients. Our company succeeds because we’re connected by a common, client-first culture of delivery and outperformance.

Michael Axt
Senior Vice President, Solutions Development, Marketing and Strategy
Professional background
Michael’s area of responsibilities at Cotiviti include enterprise strategy, as well as, solutions development and solutions marketing.  Michael’s broad experience across the entire healthcare value chain helps him understand relationships and interdependencies between industry stakeholders, including payers, providers and suppliers. For several years, he consulted in the healthcare practice at Bain & Company before joining Medtronic’s Spine and Biologics division. There, he held leadership roles in U.S. sales operations and strategic planning, as well as global commercial finance.  Throughout his career, Michael has focused on setting and executing the future direction and strategic priorities of healthcare companies.
In his own words
Cotiviti is in a great position to deliver value to our clients across the claims and payment continuum.  I am excited about the impact that I can have within Cotiviti to define that strategic and solution direction and prioritization to meet our clients’ critical needs.

Tad Kendall
Senior Vice President, Go-to-Market and Sales
Professional background
Tad’s career is focused on enhancing healthcare clients’ financial and operational performance through technology-based business solutions. He joined the Cotiviti team in August 2015, taking on responsibility for client relationships, customer satisfaction and sales growth. Prior to this, Tad held several senior management positions at CSC, building and managing go-to-market teams to spur worldwide growth in their healthcare business. He was also involved in healthcare-related strategic sales leadership work at HP Enterprise Services, the Marquam Group, Convansys and the Claremont Technology Group.
In his own words
Cotiviti gave me the opportunity to bring together my healthcare, client management and sales experience to help build a dynamic, fast-growing organization focused on unlocking value for our clients. My work puts me in a unique place to be the voice of our clients, deriving insight into their payment accuracy objectives and challenges. This unique viewpoint enables us to create value-based client partnerships that benefit from innovative solutions across the payment accuracy continuum.

Tony Massanelli
Senior Vice President, Global RetailPresident, Connolly Division
Professional background
As the leader of the Global Retail team at Connolly, the Cotiviti division dedicated to the retail industry, Tony focuses on strategic growth, relationship building and systems analysis. He joined the company in 1997 and has expertise in auditing and audit support across both retail and healthcare. Formerly a Regional Vice President, and most recently an initiative leader within the Program Management Office (PMO) function, Tony is thoroughly versed in all aspects of client services and operations.
In his own words
One thing about our approach that I really like is the way we tailor our delivery to the needs of our clients. Each audit is unique. When selecting a team, we look for experience in the same industry vertical, comparable retail characteristics and a similar degree of complexity. It’s that partnering aspect that helps our clients achieve profitable growth.

Valerie Usilton
Senior Vice President, Organizational Effectiveness
Professional background
Valerie plays a central role in Cotiviti’s collaborative culture. She is responsible for organizational effectiveness across the company, with a broad range of responsibilities including executive coaching, executive team effectiveness and organizational change management. Prior to joining Cotiviti, Valerie was the Group Director of Talent Management for The Coca Cola Company, following 13 years with Bank of America as an SVP of Human Resources.
In her own words
Increasing the effectiveness of our leaders leads to stronger employee engagement and a culture of high performance, all for the benefit of our clients. My experience in healthcare and leadership development helps me create a unique individual coaching and team experience, working with people I admire and respect.

Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include regional, national or global political, economic, business, competitive, market and regulatory conditions and the following: our inability to successfully leverage our existing client base by expanding the volume of claims reviewed and cross-selling additional solutions; improvements to healthcare claims and retail billing processes reducing the demand for our solutions or rendering our solutions unnecessary; healthcare spending fluctuations; our clients declining to renew their agreements with us or renewing at lower performance fee levels; inability to develop new clients; delays in implementing our solutions; system interruptions or failures, including cyber-security breaches, identity theft or other disruptions that could compromise our information; our failure to innovate and develop new solutions for our clients; our failure to comply with applicable privacy, security and data laws, regulations and standards; changes in regulations governing healthcare administration and policies, including governmental restrictions on the outsourcing of functions such as those that we provide; loss of a large client; consolidation among healthcare payers or retailers; slow development of the healthcare payment accuracy market; negative publicity concerning the healthcare payment industry or patient confidentiality and privacy; significant competition for our solutions; our inability to protect our intellectual property rights, proprietary technology, information, processes and know-how; compliance with current and future regulatory requirements; declines in contracts awarded through competitive bidding or our inability to re-procure contracts through the competitive bidding process; our failure to accurately estimate the factors upon which we base our contract pricing; our inability to manage our growth; our inability to successfully integrate and realize synergies from any future acquisitions or strategic partnerships including our acquisition of RowdMap; our failure to maintain or upgrade our operational platforms; our failure to re-procure our Medicare Recovery Audit Contractor program contract; litigation, regulatory or dispute resolution proceedings, including claims or proceedings related to intellectual property infringements; our inability to expand our retail business; our inability to manage our relationships with information suppliers, software vendors or utility providers; fluctuation in our results of operations; changes in tax rules; risks associated with international operations; our inability to realize the book value of intangible assets; our success in attracting and retaining qualified employees and key personnel; and general economic, political and market forces and dislocations beyond our control; risks related to our substantial indebtedness and holding company structure; volatility in bank and capital markets; our status as a controlled company and as an emerging growth company; and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Additional factors or events that could cause our actual performance to differ from these forward-looking statements may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of our assumptions prove incorrect, our actual financial condition, results of operations, future performance and business may vary in material respects from the performance projected in these forward-looking statements.
      
      
        Any forward-looking statement made by us in this press release speaks only as of the date on which it is made. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Cotiviti Announces Completion of RowdMap, Inc. Acquisition
ATLANTA--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
      Cotiviti Holdings Inc. (NYSE:COTV) (“Cotiviti”), a leading provider of
      analytics-driven payment accuracy solutions primarily focused on the
      healthcare industry, is pleased to announce that it has completed its

      of these shares are subject to performance-based vesting requirements.
      The other half are subject to continued employment with Cotiviti, with

    Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains
      forward-looking statements within the meaning of the “safe harbor”
      provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
      These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. All statements
      other than statements of historical fact or relating to present facts or
      current conditions included in this press release are forward-looking
      statements. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations and
      projections relating to our financial condition, results of operations,
      plans, objectives, future performance and business. You can identify
      forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly
      to historical or current facts. These statements may include words such
      as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “seek,” “plan,”
      “intend,” “believe,” “will,” “may,” “could,” “continue,” “likely,”
      “should,” and other words.
    
      The forward-looking statements contained in this press release are based
      on assumptions that we have made in light of our industry experience and
      our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected
      future developments and other factors that we believe are appropriate
      under the circumstances. These statements are not guarantees of
      performance or results. These assumptions and our future performance or
      results involve risks and uncertainties (many of which are beyond our
      control). Important factors that could cause actual results to differ
      materially from those in the forward-looking statements include
      regional, national or global political, economic, business, competitive,
      market and regulatory conditions and the following: our inability to
      successfully leverage our existing client base by expanding the volume
      of claims reviewed and cross-selling additional solutions; improvements
      to healthcare claims and retail billing processes reducing the demand
      for our solutions or rendering our solutions unnecessary; healthcare
      spending fluctuations; our clients declining to renew their agreements
      with us or renewing at lower performance fee levels; inability to
      develop new clients; delays in implementing our solutions; system
      interruptions or failures, including cyber-security breaches, identity
      theft or other disruptions that could compromise our information; our
      failure to innovate and develop new solutions for our clients; our
      failure to comply with applicable privacy, security and data laws,
      regulations and standards; changes in regulations governing healthcare
      administration and policies, including governmental restrictions on the
      outsourcing of functions such as those that we provide; loss of a large
      client; consolidation among healthcare payers or retailers; slow
      development of the healthcare payment accuracy market; negative
      publicity concerning the healthcare payment industry or patient
      confidentiality and privacy; significant competition for our solutions;
      our inability to protect our intellectual property rights, proprietary
      technology, information, processes and know-how; compliance with current
      and future regulatory requirements; declines in contracts awarded
      through competitive bidding or our inability to re-procure contracts
      through the competitive bidding process; our failure to accurately
      estimate the factors upon which we base our contract pricing; our
      inability to manage our growth; our inability to successfully integrate
      and realize synergies from any future acquisitions or strategic
      partnerships including our acquisition of RowdMap; our failure to
      maintain or upgrade our operational platforms; our failure to re-procure
      our Medicare Recovery Audit Contractor program contract; litigation,
      regulatory or dispute resolution proceedings, including claims or
      proceedings related to intellectual property infringements; our
      inability to expand our retail business; our inability to manage our
      relationships with information suppliers, software vendors or utility
      providers; fluctuation in our results of operations; changes in tax
      rules; risks associated with international operations; our inability to
      realize the book value of intangible assets; our success in attracting
      and retaining qualified employees and key personnel; and general
      economic, political and market forces and dislocations beyond our
      control; risks related to our substantial indebtedness and holding
      company structure; volatility in bank and capital markets; our status as
      a controlled company and as an emerging growth company; and provisions
      in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Additional
      factors or events that could cause our actual performance to differ from
      these forward-looking statements may emerge from time to time, and it is
      not possible for us to predict all of them. Should one or more of these
      risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of our assumptions
      prove incorrect, our actual financial condition, results of operations,
      future performance and business may vary in material respects from the
      performance projected in these forward-looking statements.
    
      Any forward-looking statement made by us in this press release speaks
      only as of the date on which it is made. We undertake no obligation to
      publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a
      result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as
      may be required by law.
