Diverse products, focused research
Macquarie Investment Management offers a wide variety of mutual funds to suit an array of investment needs. 
Macquarie Investment Management's structure of distinct investment teams allows for a style-specific research effort tailored for each asset class and, we believe, provides for a deeper understanding of each company we research. In short, we believe that distinct research teams add significant value to the investment management process — by reducing risk.
Whether you're considering investing in Delaware Fundssm by Macquarie, or whether you're checking on a current investment, this section can help you. Detailed fund information, such as holdings, performance, and manager information can be found in one convenient location.

Click here for an update on a bankruptcy litigation matter affecting a security held by certain Funds.

Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, charges, and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses and their summary prospectuses, which may be obtained by visiting delawarefunds.com/literature or calling 800 523-1918. Investors should read the prospectus and the summary prospectus carefully before investing.
Consult your financial intermediary (which may be your financial advisor or other financial entity) to determine if investing in a fund is appropriate for your investment goals and time frame. It is the responsibility of your financial intermediary to help you determine if it is appropriate for you to invest in a fund, including the most appropriate share class to invest in, and to communicate such determination to us.

Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal.
