			Brian A. McNamee, M.B.B.S., has served as a director of the Company since March 2010. Dr. McNamee previously served on the Board from the time of its September 2002 spin-off from Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. until May 2007. Dr. McNamee has served as the Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of CSL Ltd. ("CSL") since 1990. CSL is a leading international biopharmaceutical company with significant activities in human plasma and vaccines. Prior to joining CSL, Dr. McNamee was Managing Director of a start-up biotechnology company, Pacific Biotechnology Limited, in Sydney, Australia and General Manager of Faulding Product Divisions, F.H. Faulding & Co Limited in Adelaide, Australia. Dr. McNamee obtained his medical degree from the University of Melbourne. The Board believes that Dr. McNamee's formal education, medical expertise, international business success, including while serving as the Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of CSL, as well as his prior service on the Board provide Dr. McNamee with the appropriate attributes to serve on the Board and have enabled him to make valuable contributions to the Board and to the Company. 

 

On January 23, 2011, Dr. McNamee informed the Company that he would not stand for re-election at the Annual Meeting. Dr. McNamee, resident in Australia, indicated his decision was prompted by the demands on his time and schedule as Chief Executive Officer of CSL, the timing of the Company's Board meetings in 2011 and beyond, and the increasing potential for common or related issues to arise between the businesses of CSL and the Company.
