                         TEMPORARY FORBEARANCE AGREEMENT

         THIS TEMPORARY FORBEARANCE AGREEMENT (this "AGREEMENT"), dated as of
June 28, 2002, as amended March 3, 2003, among Ladenburg Thalmann Financial
Services Inc., a Florida corporation (the "COMPANY"), New Valley Capital
Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("NEW VALLEY"), Frost-Nevada Investments
Trust ("Frost-Nevada") a trust of which Frost-Nevada Limited Partnership
("Frost") is the sole beneficiary, and Berliner Effektengesellschaft AG, a
German corporation ("BERLINER", and together with New Valley and Frost-Nevada,
the "HOLDERS"). Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the
meanings specified in the Notes (as defined below).

         WHEREAS, on May 7, 2001, the Company issued an aggregate of $20,000,000
principal amount of Senior Convertible Promissory Notes due December 31, 2005
(collectively, as amended from time to time, the "Notes") to the Holders;

         WHEREAS, as of November 29, 2002, Frost transferred its Notes to
Frost-Nevada;

         WHEREAS, the Company has requested, and each of the Holders has agreed,
subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, for the period
commencing on June 28, 2002 and ending on the earlier of January 15, 2005 (the
"PAYMENT DATE") or the occurrence of a Termination Event (as defined in Section
3) (the "WAIVER PERIOD"), (i) to waive any Default or Event of Default existing
solely as a result of the failure of the Company to pay to such Holder its pro
rata share of all amounts due to such Holders on the interest payment dates of
the Notes commencing June 30, 2002 and continuing through and including December
31, 2004 (the "FORBEARANCE INTEREST PAYMENTS"), with such interest payments to
be made to the Holders on the Payment Date), and (ii) that it shall refrain from
exercising its rights and remedies against the Company in connection with the
Company's failure to pay such Holder its pro rata share of the Forbearance
Interest Payments prior to the Payment Date;

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
covenants and agreement of the parties hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto
hereby agree as follows:

         1. WAIVER OF DEFAULT. Each of the Holders hereby waives, until the
expiration of the Waiver Period, any Default or Event of Default existing solely
as a result of the Company's failure to pay to such Holder such Holder's pro
rata share of the Forbearance Interest Payments prior to the Payment Date. The
Company acknowledges that interest shall accrue at the rate of 9.0% per annum
with respect to Frost-Nevada and 8.0% per annum with respect to New Valley and
Berliner on each Forbearance Interest Payment from the date each such payment is
due pursuant to the Notes until all such amounts are paid in full in cash.

<PAGE>

         2. STANDSTILL. Each of the Holders hereby agrees that during the Waiver
Period it will not exercise any remedy under the Notes, at law or in equity,
which it hereafter may have in respect of any Default or Event of Default
resulting solely from the failure of the Company to pay to such Holder its pro
rata share of the Forbearance Interest Payments prior to the Payment Date.

         3. TERMINATION. This Agreement shall terminate upon the earlier of (i)
the payment in full to each Holder of its pro rata share of the Forbearance
Interest Payments, plus all amounts owing thereon pursuant to the Notes and
Section 1 hereof, (ii) the occurrence of an Event of Default (other than in
connection with the Forbearance Interest Payments) and (iii) any repurchase of
the Notes pursuant to Section 2 of the Notes; provided, that this Agreement
shall only terminate with respect to those Notes actually repurchased from the
Holders pursuant to such section (a "TERMINATION EVENT").

         4. ABSENCE OF WAIVER. The parties hereto agree that, except to the
extent expressly set forth herein, nothing contained herein shall be deemed to:

                  (a) be a consent to, or waiver of, any Default or Event of

                  (b) prejudice any right or remedy which any of the Holders may
         now have or may in the future have under the Notes or otherwise,
         including, without limitation, any right or remedy resulting from any
         Default or Event of Default.

         5. REPRESENTATIONS. Each party hereto hereby represents and warrants to

                  (c) this Agreement will be a legal, valid and binding
         obligation of such party, enforceable against it in accordance with its

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
