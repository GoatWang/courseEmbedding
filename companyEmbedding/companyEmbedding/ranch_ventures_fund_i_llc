DeclarationOur Modus Operandi Guiding BeliefsWe've all heard the "we invest in teams, first and foremost" ideology time and time again. While we believe that's true, at Ranch VC we like to take it a step further. We look to invest in HOW people think. In their decision-making abilities. Can they roll with the punches? Will they overcome the existential risk of building a breakthrough business? We immensely respect the determination, ambition and grit all our founders possess. Our hope is to nurture those relationships into something which extends beyond the standard investor/founder dynamic. We aim to be a voice of objective reason, a benchmark of trust and an arbiter of growth for all our entrepreneurs. We view the companies we invest in not as clients, but partners. Celebrating together in the spoils of victory while enduring all the trials and tribulations and doing whatever necessary to persevere.Investment Strategy Our goal for Fund I is to invest in strong teams with high intellectual horsepower across many sectors of industry that are looking to make a material impact on the world. Their breakthrough ideas must coexist within a burgeoning market, have sustainable business models as well as technical defensibility. We are a generalist fund with a sector agnostic thesis which reduces restrictions on visibility and creates a more opportunistic approach. Rather than trying to predict the unpredictable, we feel it's best to amass a portfolio composed of non-consensus, high upper bound impact opportunities that are right on the edge of the risk/reward curve. All this to help ensure diversification for our investors as well as enable the future with our portfolio companies.Our Unique AdvantageAs hyper-collaborators and entrepreneurs, we bring measurable value to the table for our portfolio companies. We have a vested interest in seeing our companies succeed and therefore compelled to bring forth novel ideas, pooled resources, global connections and strategic partnerships to maximize the probability of success. Our bespoke partnering model offers preeminent value creation for our portfolio companies across many aspects of business. We are not looking to run your company or vote on who the next CEO should be. Nor do we believe in coercion. We simply want to lend our unique perspective and deliver results on things we believe are in the best interest of our partners.   Connect With Us!We love talking to people. We love hearing new ideas. Email Howie@ranch.vcPhone 323-828-0700Angel List
