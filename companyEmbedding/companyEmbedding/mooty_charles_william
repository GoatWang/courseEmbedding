John W. Mooty










Mooty, John W.  Our Dad, John William Mooty, one of God's brightest stars, was taken to the heavenly realms on April 17, 2015. Dad reflected God's light, love and values with his family, friends and everyone else he met in the practice of law, business, and his community, civic and charitable endeavors. Dad was known for his integrity, intelligence, character, kindness, wisdom, creative problem-solving, sense of humor and respect for everyone. A product of the Great Depression, he had a phenomenal work ethic, a deep dedication to excellent service, a commitment to stewardship and a generous spirit. Despite all of his successes, Dad was incredibly humble and always valued people far more than things. Dad was born in Adrian, Minnesota on November 27, 1922, the oldest son of Genevieve Brown Mooty and John Wilson Mooty. His only sibling was his brother and long time law partner, Melvin Mooty, who died in 2012. Dad graduated from Worthington High School. He attended Worthington Junior College and then graduated from the University of Minnesota with his BSL degree in 1943. He graduated first in his class from the University of Minnesota Law School in 1944 where he served on the Editorial Staff of the Minnesota Law Review and was a recipient of the Order of the Coif award.  While Chairman of The Young Republicans, Dad met and married the Chairwoman of The Young Republicans, Virginia Mae "Ginny" Nelson on June 6, 1952 and they moved to Edina and had three sons David, Bruce and Charles. Ginny died in 1964 and Dad did a terrific job of raising three young boys. He coached the boys' baseball teams for several years and even had a couple of championship seasons. In 1972 he married Ginny's sister, Jane Nelson Glaser, whose first husband Ken Glaser, died in 1970. Jane and Ken's children Barbara Glaser and Chip Glaser became daughter and son in an expanded family that now includes seventeen grandchildren and thirteen great grandchildren. Family was Dad's highest priority and family trips and gatherings were treasured times for all. After graduating from law school, Dad joined the law firm now known as Gray, Plant, Mooty, Mooty & Bennett where he actively and continuously practiced corporate and merger and acquisition law for seventy years. He served as a Managing Officer of the firm for more than twenty years. He was a representative on the Uniform Laws Commission, co-authored the initial publication of "Minnesota Practice Methods" and was honored as a "Super Lawyer" for many years and noted as the oldest Super Lawyer in Minnesota. He worked on numerous business transactions involving National Car, International Dairy Queen, The Minnesota Vikings, Culligan, Schwan's, The Bureau of Engraving, Western Oil, Upper Mississippi Towing, and Riverway, among many others. He was known for developing practical, win-win solutions, and often received referrals from individuals on the other side of transactions.  In addition to being recognized as one of the best lawyers in the country, he had great business acumen. Dad was responsible for saving a near insolvent International Dairy Queen and served as the Chairman of the Board of Directors of IDQ from 1976 to 1997. He also served as a director on the boards of numerous other corporations. Dad was a general partner and driving force in the development of Rio Verde, Tonto Verde and Vista Verde, golfing retirement communities near Scottsdale, Arizona. He was a key investor and director in Faribault Woolen Mill and has been actively involved in family farm operations in Iowa and Minnesota. In 2003, he was inducted into the Minnesota Business Hall of Fame. Dad was a well respected community leader often sought after to chair significant civic and political endeavors. He was acting state chairman of the Minnesota Republican Party and state chairman for presidential, gubernatorial, senatorial and attorney general campaigns. He was a delegate to Republican Party National Conventions. He served as Co-chair of the Citizens League committee with a Democrat to resolve differences that precluded the adoption of a sales tax in Minnesota. Dad served as Chair of a Special Committee to resolve problems existing between members of the Minnesota High School League and as Chair of the Citizens League committee that provided the impetus for the Minnesota Zoo. He served as Chair of a Blue Ribbon Committee appointed by the Chairman of the Hennepin County Bar Association to review multiple problems relating to the Hennepin County District Court. All recommendations of the committee were adopted by the Court.  Dad was generous with his time, talents and resources to many charitable endeavors. He was Past President of the Minneapolis Rotary Club, the Citizens League, and St. John's Lutheran Church. He served as Chair for the Polio Plus Campaign for Minneapolis Rotary. He served as Co-chair with wife Ginny in a campaign to raise funds for a lake retreat property for St. John's Lutheran Church. He served as Co-chair with wife Jane to raise funds for the establishment of a church in Rio Verde, Arizona. He served as Chair of the Board of Friendship Village. He established a foundation that made significant donations to causes he believed had great impact in our community and adhered to the highest values. He was deeply committed to improving public education and served as Chairman of the Governor's Task Force on Education. He served as National President of the University of Minnesota Alumni Association and was honored with the Alumni Service Award. He served as Chair of the Capital Fund Campaign for the University of Minnesota Law School and later received the Outstanding Achievement Award and Regent Award from the University. In 1990, the Gray, Plant, Mooty, Mooty & Bennett Foundation Professorship in Honor of John W. Mooty was established at the University of Minnesota Law School. Dad is survived by his loving wife of 43 years, Jane; children David (Jeanne) Mooty of Eden Prairie, Bruce (Tracy) Mooty of Edina, Chuck (Liz) Mooty of Minneapolis, Barbara Glaser (Paul Zachos) of Saratoga Springs, New York and Chip (Janet) Glaser of Scottsdale, Arizona; grandchildren Gina (Perry) Rutter, Brianna Mooty (Nick Manderfeld), Alicia Mooty, Jason Mooty, Katie (James) Racine, Alison (John) Boone, Megan (Taylor) Judkins, John Mooty, Paige Mooty, Will Mooty, Kimara (Eric) Gustafson, Nick Zachos, Keri Glaser, Jonathan Glaser, Lindsay (Eric) Payne, KC Glaser and Stacy Glaser; sister-in-law Sally Mooty, nephew Paul (Jean) Mooty and niece Mary (Tom) Kileen. Dad, we have no doubt you will be greeted in heaven with "Well done thy good and faithful servant." Although no longer present on this earth, your presence, love and light will be guiding us forever. We love you always! We want to extend our heartfelt appreciation to NC Little Memorial Hospice and all of the staff and volunteers who lovingly cared and supported Dad since the beginning of this year.  In lieu of flowers, memorials may be directed to The University of Minnesota Law School, N.C. Little Memorial Hospice or Friendship Village of Bloomington Memorial Fund. Memorial Service Monday, April 27th, 11:00 a.m. at Colonial Church of Edina, 6200 Colonial Way, Edina, MN 55435. Private interment at Lakewood Cemetery. Visitation Sunday, April 26th from 2-6 p.m. at the Washburn-McReavy Edina Chapel, 5000 W. 50th Street & Highway 100, Edina, MN 55436. Washburn-McReavy.com Edina Chapel 952-920-3996
