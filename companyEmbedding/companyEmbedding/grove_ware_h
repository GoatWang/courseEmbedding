Grooved ware - Wikipedia





















 






Grooved ware

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search





A grooved ware shard from the excavation of the Durrington Wall site, the building settlement associated with Stonehenge.


Grooved ware is the name given to a pottery style of the British Neolithic. Its manufacturers are sometimes known as the Grooved ware people. Unlike the later Beaker ware, Grooved culture was not an import from the continent but seems to have developed in Orkney, early in the 3rd millennium BC, and was soon adopted in Britain and Ireland.[1]
The diagnostic shape for the style is a flat-bottomed pot with straight sides sloping outwards and grooved decoration around the top. Beyond this the pottery comes in many varieties, some with complex geometric decorations others with applique bands added. The latter has led some archaeologists to argue that the style is a skeuomorph and is derived from wicker basketry.
Grooved ware pots excavated at Balfarg in Fife have been chemically analysed to determine their contents. It appears that some of the vessels there may have been used to hold black henbane (Hyoscyamus niger) which is a poison and a powerful hallucinogen.
Since many Grooved ware pots have been found at henge sites and in burials, it is possible that they may have had a ritual purpose as well as a functional one. Grooved ware comes in many sizes, some vessels are extremely large, c. 30 gallons, and would be suitable for fermentation. The majority are smaller, ranging from jug- to cup-size, and could be used for serving and drinking. The theory that the first British farmers (c. 4000 BC) had the knowledge and ability to make ale from their crops with their pottery appears to be controversial and not yet widely discussed by the archaeological community.
The earliest examples have been found in Orkney and may have evolved from earlier Unstan ware bowls. The recent excavations at nearby Ness of Brodgar have revealed many sherds of finely decorated Grooved ware pottery, some of it representing very large pots. A large number of drinking vessels have also been identified. The style soon spread and it was used by the builders of the first phase of Stonehenge. Grooved ware pottery has been found in abundance in recent excavations at Durrington Walls and Marden Henge in Wiltshire. Here, the feasting would have involved drinking ale and eating pork. Smaller quantities of Grooved ware have been found at the nearby site of Figsbury Ring.
Grooved ware was previously referred to as Rinyo-Clacton ware, first identified by Stuart Piggott in the 1950s and named after sites where it was found. Rinyo is a neolithic settlement on the island of Rousay, Orkney. The site at Clacton now lies under the sea.
One way the tradition may have spread is through trade routes up the west coast of Britain. What seems unusual is that although they shared the same style of pottery, different regions still maintained vastly different traditions. Evidence at some early Henges (Mayburgh Henge, Ring of Brodgar, Arbor Low) suggests that there were staging and trading points on a national 'motorway' during the Neolithic and Bronze Age. This evidence perhaps explains how Cumbrian stone axes found their way to Orkney.
Unstan ware, a variation on grooved ware, emerged in Orkney. The people who used Unstan ware had totally different burial practices but managed to co-exist with their Grooved ware counterparts. Some hybrid chambered cairns have emerged in this region, containing architectural features of both the Maeshowe subclass and the Orkney-Cromarty stalled subclasses of cairn.

ABSTRACT
               "Patch Grove ware was thus named by Ward Perkins in a 1939
        Report and has since been employed in the literature. The ware has been
        examined at the macro level to test whether or not a homogeneous fabric
        exists. Sherds from two hundred sites in N.W. Kent were examined. A
        record of the sherd count, vessel form extent and intra and inter
        site differences has been noted. The research brought to light the
        existence of a hitherto unsuspected kiln site. The ware's dating and its
        role as a traded ware in the 1c to 3c AD in N.W. Kent is briefly
        discussed".

INTRODUCTION
           "The paucity of information concerning the vessel form
        extent
        of Patch Grove ware (Ward Perkins, 1939) has led to the view that the
        ware is found in the guise of large jars only. Moreover, the date for
        these jars is given as 1c and 2c AD. However, the evidence of recent
        research, particularly on newly excavated and unpublished material
        conflicts with this view. Evidence for an innovatory local ware industry
        has emerged spanning the 1c - 3c AD, producing a wide range of forms.
        These discoveries are of obvious local importance but also reflect a
        general trend in localised hand-made coarse ware production that has yet
        to be studied in detail in other parts of the province. This material,
        represented by a range of forms, is here designated PATCH GROVE WARE (PGW)
        and an analysis of its distribution and main characteristics
        forms the main content of this paper. Evidence is also presented as to
        the first discovery of a 'kiln site* for this ware.
           Note: Frog Farm, Otford, Kent. Some areas of this farm from
        the text refer to Twitton or Wickham. Farm names and some field names
        change in time.

        1.      POTTERY OF THE PATCH GROVE TYPE
        1.1    After excluding vessel types such as amphorae,
        tazza and fine wares such as Terra Nigra, Samian Ware and Colour-Coated
        Wares, only one Coarse Ware - named PATCH GROVE Ware (Ward Perkins,
        1939, P.178-9, 1944) is constantly listed in N. Kent archaeological
        reports. (In this paper the abbreviation P.G.W. is used).

        1.1.1   The basic problem is clear from all the literature.
        P.G.W. is described as such and/or as a type and/or as an allied ware as
        well. It is important therefore to test whether or not a P.G.W.
        homogeneous fabric does exist as archaeological workers repeatedly cite
        an orange coloured surface type. Should this prove to exist, then it may
        point to one or more places in N.W. Kent as being kiln sites. The
        existence of such a sub-regional industry, if proved, can help to expand
        knowledge in the area of pottery supply in N.W. Kent in the
        Romano-British period.

        1.1.2   The approach adopted in this research was to examine
        in the hand sherds from Romano-British find spots in N.W. Kent and its
        borders, aided by inspection using a X10 mag. hand lense. The aims
        were:-
              To research the vessel form extent.
              To elucidate the distribution of P.G.W.
        in N.W. Kent.
              To indicate the dating of P.G.W.
              To consider briefly P.G.W.'s role within
        the framework of pottery supply in N.W. Kent.

        1.2    Nomenclature
        The name of this ware was coined by Ward Perkins, it being no more than
        the place name of a "site" by 
        THE OLDBURY HILL FORT (WARD PERKINS, 1939, 1944).

        1.2.1   The name since has been contracted on occasion to
        PATCHGROVE WARE by a number of authors e.g.
           C.M. GREEN, P.33 (PALMER 1984).

        1.2.2   Further, the name has also been extended, on
        occasions, to cover other wares similar to P.G.W., 
           e.g. 'PATCHGROVE' fabric - Green P.39/Palmer 1984.
        Class 11M - includes the original 'PATCH GROVE' storage jar form (Ward
        Perkins 1944-, Fig.9) - Marsh/Tyers
          1978, P.564).
        Group B - 'PATCH GROVE AND RELATED WARES' - G. Clewley (Philp,
        1963, P.60-1). 

        The conclusion is disturbing. A named ware has had its original name
        used in various ways to also include other similar wares.

        1.3      P.G.W. fabric
        1.3.1   The first writer to place the fabric under a correct
        title "HAND-MADE GROG-TEMPERED POTTERY
           TYPES" was Green 1980, P.62 in Lamas No. 4.

        1.3.2    As a type it was included in the study of
        grog-tempered wares of South Eastern England (Thompson,
           1982). 
        This highlights another fundamental problem. Is there a P.G.W. fabric
        amongst a "sea" of grog-ware fabrics?

        1.4      P.G.W. fabric inclusions
        1.4.1   Reports have mentioned the minor presence of :-
                  shell (including
        fossil) - Marsh/Tyers 1978 Green, 1980, 1984
                  sand -
        Marsh/Tyers, 1978
                  burnt organics -
        Green, 1980
                  ? mudstone -
        Green, 1984
                  charcoal -
        Pollard, I982b,    Green, 1984
                  mica - Green,
        1980
                  quartz - Green
        1984
           besides the major inclusions of grog.
        This list adds to the uncertainty of a P.G.W. homogeneous fabric being
        in existence, (cf 1.3.2).

        1.5      P.G.W. recognition
        1.5.1   Within the scope of this paper, published references
        to P.G.W. (cf 1.1) without an 'in hand' inspection a
           moot point in terms of provenance value.

        1.5.2   What is clear is that archaeologists have followed
        Ward Perkins and isolated an easily recognisable fabric in its most
        common guise -an orange surfaced soapy ware in the form of a large jar
        with an horizontal row of jab decor high on the shoulder - (Fig
        1).

        1.5.3  An extensive literature search undertaken with 'in hand'
        examination revealed the existence of sufficiently sized rim/wall sherds
        and complete vessels, some of which may be attributed to styles
        current in the 2c and 3c AD.

        1.5.4  In the same period Ward Perkins (Fig. 1), jars have also
        been described as colour-surfaced black, brown and grey, found alongside
        the orange-surfaced type.

        1.6    P.G.W. terminology
        1.6.1 To describe the gross and minor morphological details of the
        Ward. Perkins jar (Fig. 1) as published, would serve no point. A short
        list emphasises some of the approaches taken over the last five
        decades:-
               Iron Age A finger-tip
        decoration 
               finger-tip decoration 
               finger-print decoration
               finger pressed decoration
               bases without rims
               club rims
               storage pots/jars/containers
               cooking pots/jars/containers
               cinerary urns/jets.

        1.6.2   Section 2 outlines, a proposed scheme for description
        based, on the examination of circa 10,000 sherds.

        Oldbury Hill, Ightham 1938
            









        1.7      P.G.W. history - what is in a name
        1.7.1   "PATTS GROVE" - Court Rolls of Ightham 1624
        - (Arch. Cant. 1937, P.78).
           PATCH GROVE - A wooded area in the parish of Ightham, Kent. In a field a
        swimming pool was constructed for the landowner Mr Hooker at the turn
        of this century. The construction work brought to light masses of
        pottery and a record of burnt layers.
            Excavations in the mid-twenties at Otford the
        Progress Roman Villa - brought to light a 1c AD kiln, firing flagons,
        bowls and other forms (incorrectly dated 3c AD - Pollard,
        1982b), correctly dated 1c - Swan, 1984. The products of this kiln were
        in a slipped sandy fabric. Two P.G.W. rims from this site were
        illustrated by Ward Perkins (Fig. 1) his No. 1 and 2 stored in Dartford
        Borough Museum.
           The excavator failed to mention exactly where this villa was (Pearce
        1927, 1930). This problem has been resolved (Mynott, 1971). A further
        report on this villa was issued (Sevenoaks, 1955).
           Assisting Mr Pearce had been Dr G. Ward and Mr Godwin, who themselves
        undertook excavations at Frog Farm, Otford in 1929 and 1930. Next to
        Frog Farm, in the grounds of the isolation hospital came reports of
        pottery (Arch. Cant. 1929) including & mention of "layers of
        pottery and charcoal".
           An Arch. Cant. 1930 report by Mr. F. Godwin provided further Frog Farm,
        Wickham Field and Hospital Field finds made by him, Dr Gordon Ward and
        Mr M. Hoverden. Mentioned were large quantities of debris and burnt
        material found on the surface or close below ground level. Rough
        pavements of flints occurred in numerous places, one to one-and-a-half
        feet below the surface.

           Dr. Gordon Ward's Notebook survives and the trial holes and
        trenches are shown in (Fig. 2). Mr John
        Pyke kindly drew the writer's attention to the existence or this
        Notebook and Dr. Gordon Ward's plan.
           Dr Gordon Ward, F. Godwin and M. Hoverden were amongst
        those who assisted Ward Perkins at the Oldbury Hill Port excavations in
        1938 and his knowledge probably prompted Ward Perkins to test dig at
        Hooker's swimming pool field in PATCH GROVE.
           Ward Perkins Site Notebook survives, with the finds, in
        Maidstone Museum. His test dig campaign was four boxes (by the swimming
        pool) (Fig. 3 and two further sets of boxes
        marked PG 42 and 43 series (elsewhere in the swimming pool field). The
        other wares in each layer of each PG 40 box, found with orange
        surface coloured P.G.W. date from c. 70 AD to c. 25O AD. This situation
        was no different for the box 42/43 layer series.
           The Eldridge finds from the St. Mary Cray and Orpington
        area - find spots noted in pencil with dates on the sherds - were
        donated to the Orpington Museum. (Fig. I. No. 3 and  4 were
        traced).
           Ward Perkins dating for P.G.W. as immediate pre/immediate
        post Claudian Conquest to the end of the first century AD on this site's
        intra-specific sequence is not valid. In fact there is no valid
        secure dating by association for P.G.W. at PATCH GROVE and no evidence
        whatsoever that PATCH GROVE was a P.G.W. kiln site. The finds suggest a
        ?Romano-British farmstead still awaiting discovery in the immediate
        area.

        Specimens from PATCH GROVE area selected to show characteristics of the
        PATCH GROVE TYPE of pottery. The site by Patch Grove is a dump of
        wasters and may not accurately represent the quality to be met
        elsewhere.

        A.   The PASTE shoes grey mottling on lighter grey. It
        is VERY soft and often contains white specks.

        B.   The PASTE has a rough fracture and often contains
        flint, iron concentrations etc.

        C.   The SLIP is normally orange red and has been
        applied to the paste before firing. It covers inside, outside,
                 and base.

        D.   Brush marks show one of the ways in which the SLIP
        was applied. It is very soft.

        E.   The SLIP when under-fired has a soapy feel and
        dirty grey colour.

        F.   RIMS are very variable but mostly are on section,
        club or quarter circle in shape.

        G.   BASES are usually flat.

        H.   The visual DECORATION consists of rows of
        horizontal stab marks made with a stick, on the shoulder and
                  body only.

        J.   DECORATION with knife stabs and cuts occurs but
        not on the rim.

        K.   DECORATION with waves etc is exceptional and may
        involve the body or the slip only.

1.7.1 (cont'd)
         Dr. Gordon Ward however, saw PATCH GROVE as the kiln site and
      took ten of Ward Perkins'  P.G.W. sherds and marked them
      in white and black ink for a display (long ago withdrawn) at Maidstone
      Museum (Fig 4). He remained convinced of this
      attribution (Sevenoaks, privately printed P.92-6) and at least one
      archaeologist followed this school of thought (Parsons, 1966).
         Chemically this A - K marking by Dr. Gordon Ward has severely
      contaminated approximately 20% of all the Ward Perkins excavated
      P.G.W.
         Ward Perkins excavated material from the Oldbury Hill Fort
      contains much Romano British fabrics ranging from the first to the fourth
      century AD which throws revealing light on his mention of two mortaria
      being found (1944). Some of this material is listed in (Fig.
              5).

      1.7.2   Ward Perkins (1939, 1944) cited A.W.G. Lowther for the
      Surrey distribution. The significance of this is that the reported Surrey
      find spots lie on the line of the Pilgrims Way, the road adjacent to Frog
      Farm, Otford and a barn (the Charne Site, Meates, 1954) opposite Frog
      Farm.

      1.7.3   Six of the PATCH GROVE site P.G.W. sherds not mentioned
      nor illustrated in either the 1939 or 1944 reports are of interest. (Fig.
      6).

      1.7.4   Since the ware found at PATCH GROVE was too fragmentary
      for illustration, four rims from other N.W. Kent sites were used. The omission
      of the other vessel forms was unfortunate and has had lasting effect.

      1.7.5   The P.G.W. at PATCH GROVE, Oldbury Hill Fort and the
      four rims (1 - 4 in Fig. 1) have ail been
      examined and all are homogeneous. Had Dr. Gordon Ward concentrated on Frog
      Farm, this could have been the ware's nomenclature, but posterity has
      proved otherwise.


      2.     P.G.W. SCHEMA
      2.1   In good light at the sorting table P.G.W. was isolated and
      quantified by sherd type count. The basic count achieved per type was:-
Fabric 1 - orange surfaced coloured
                    
      rims
                    
      rim/wall - plain
                    
      rim/wall - jab
                    
      rims - reserved black slipped area
                    
      bases - flat
                    
      body sherds - plain
                    
      handles
                    
      body sherds - incised decors
                    
      body sherds - cut - to form lids/covers
                    
      graffito
                    
      body sherds - with luted on knobs
                    
      wasters
                    
      bases - not flat
                    
      rubbers - ? tools

Fabric 1A - black, brown, grey surfaced coloured Repeat as Fabric
      1.

      2.2.1   In quantitative terms P.G.W. Fabric 1 always exceeds P.G.W.
      Fabric 1A.

      2.2.2   In vessel size terms P.G.W. Fabric 1 always exceeds P.G.W.
      Fabric 1A in height and girth.

      2.2.3   In general terms in the period circa 70-120 AD the
      co-occurrence of Fabric 1 and Fabric 1A alters to the extent that post 120
      AD Fabric 1A virtually disappears. Fabric 1A reappears towards the end of
      the 2c especially in the guise of the flanged rim bowl.

      2.3.      Fabric - a handmade,
      soapy feel, grog ware. Bluish-grey core, mottled with black to dark grey
      irregular sized grog. A pencil thin margin and orange surfaces
      rough fracture at a fresh break.

      2.3.1    Colour - firing conditions, not understood,
      aimed to achieve and maintain a constant result, that of an orange
      surfaced product. Why this was not maintained for Fabric 1A is also not
      understood at present*

      2.3.2    Fabric source - presumed to be gault grey,
      tempered with re-cycled waste.

      2.3.3    No other tempering was deliberately employed.
      Repeated checks reveal that flint, vegetable matter, shell, fossil shell,
      sand and (mica never seen) will occasionally occur, often at the
      numerical level of one or two grains only.

      2.3.4    Slipping and wheel-throwing were never employed.

      2.3.5    Decoration on some closed forms was
      confined to executing horizontal rows by Jabbing with a "tool".
      All other techniques are uncommon.

      2.3.6    Bases are flat, exceptional types however are
      known.

      2.3.7   On a inter-site basis, only one site was recognised to
      contain wasters, to have P.G.W. at a factor of 10 to 100 more than any
      other site, a form series not only spanning but exceeding all the
      other sites combined. The site was Frog Farm, Otford, Kent.

                 Form 1 Jab Form 2.

3.      FORMS/DATING
      - THE LITERATURE
      3.1    In just under a decade (Ward Perkins 1939,
      1944) the � dating and form extent of P.G.W. was rapidly revised.
      At Lullingstone (Meates, 1950, 1952) and at Joydens Wood (Caiger/Tester,
      1954) two further Jar forms were reported (see Appendix
                1) and P.G.W.
      reported in secure Antonine/late 2c context. Further, Meates reported the
      Ward Perkins type (Fig. 1) in a 3c well. Whether this third century
      attribution is correct can only be gauged when the Lullingstone Vol. II
      appears (Meates, Vol. II, ?July, 198?).

      No. 6 and Fig. A.26 No. 2 (Cunliffe, 1975) a bowl/Jar Aylesford-Swarling
      style shows that the earliest Jar form is Joydens Wood Fig.3 No. 6 & 7
      appearing circa 65.AD in Fabric 1 in N.W. Kent. Ward Perkins Fig.17 1-4
      are 2c forms, characterised by the horizontal row of jabbing invariably in
fringing into or just on the final row of cordons at the shoulder.

      3.1.3    Other forms in P.G.W. appeared in the 1960's and
      1970's e.g.
      Rye Lane, Otford (Pyke, 1974) - incipient flanged rim bowl (Fig.4 No. 6
      described as a jar). 
      Cray Valley - (Ward Perkins 1-4) with acute lattice incised decor
      (Parsons, 1966).
      A further example of the large narrow mouth jar was illustrated in the
      Greenhithe Report (Detsicas, 1966) and several from the Darent Valley area
      (Philp, 1973).

      3.2       Unpublished
      An extensive search through stores held in museums and by groups in N.W.
      Kent brought to light lids, bowls, jars and a ?loom-weight.

      4.         FROG FARM, OTFORD.
      KENT
      4.1       Excavations and collecting field
      surface finds produced a huge amount of finds (Young, May and November
      1966) especially from two areas (Fig. 8).
         Fifty-seven pits were cleared - described as rubbish pits.
      The P.G.W. percentage of each pit fill varies between fifty-five to a
      hundred per cent in an ash matrix. This is the only site to have produced
      wasters and a selection of forms at 1:1 scale is given in (Appendix 
      1). Several thousand more P.G.W. sherds including wasters were collected
      from the ploughed soil surface.
         This evidence points to the fact that the site was a P.G.W.
      kiln field - a full report is to be published elsewhere (John Pyke etc.
      forthcoming). No other site in N.W. Kent has yielded a waster nor can
      approach numerically the sherd count or form series or range of
      "uncommon" decor styles. Material thought to be daub, some not
      unlike P.G.W., is now considered to be fragments of kiln walls. Over
      twenty sherds are recorded with smooth edges and are considered to be
      potters tools used to execute the horizontal burnishing. One tool has a
      cut triangle in relief and may have been used to execute the horizontal
      Jab row.

      4.2      In brief, a ditch and bank runs from the
      Pilgrims Way (A) towards the Twitton Brook. This late Iron Age ditch and
      bank turns at (B) and then runs down slope to turn in and disappear at
      (X). At Point (D) a graveyard was discovered (mainly P.G.W. jars used to
      contain the cremated remains).
      This is the largest group of P.G.W. "cinerary urns" known in
      Kent. Most likely the local potters graveyard. At point (D) a mausoleum
      was discovered and its full plan recorded. At point (F), now under a
      housing development, was a barn (Meates, 1954).

4.3    At
      point (B) in heavy woodland fifty-seven pits were cleared (Fig.
      9). At
      point (C), the ploughed part of the kiln field, surface finds were
      collected (Fig, 10). At the point (?G) on place name evidence - TILE
      FIELD - again under an housing estate, may prove in the future to be the
      area of the Romano-British dwelling(s).
         Point (C) today still shows dark circles all over the surface. Such
      ploughed-out pits showed clearly in a 1958 aerial photograph (personal
      information - John Pyke).
         The area adjoining Lampe Field is the same ground investigated by Dr.
      Gordon Ward et al in the 1920�s and 1930's.
         Banking Mead field contains two earth works, both hitherto unrecorded. The
      first is a bank (now spread by plough action) running from the Pilgrims
      Way on the 200m contour line parallel with the River Darent. The other is
      a rectangular enclosure with a single entrance facing the River Darent.
         The flint pavements noted by Dr. Gordon Ward and team may represent floors
      or minor structures, the precise nature and dating of which is not
      presently known.
         It is striking that the kiln field was confined to a corner of what
      appears to be a mixed economic unit embracing farming, stock-holding and
      pottery production. It is not surprising, therefore, that this site's main
      product - the Ward Perkins 1 and 2 type Jar - should have reached the
      Progress Villa on the opposite bank - "and of some large yellowish
      stone vessels with two or
      more bands of stick made marks for ornament" (Pearce, 1927, P.154).

      4.4     Frog Farm's position for pottery production was ideal. Ample supplies of
      gault clay, wood and water are in the immediate area. Its place for
      communication was ideal, products being moved up or down the Pilgrims Way,
      the River Darent and minor roads/tracks running up or down the Darent
      Valley.

      5.      LISTING
      5.1    Over one hundred and thirty-five find spots for P.G.W.
      Fabric 1 have been noted. These are arranged in linear blocks for N.W.
      Kent (Appendix 2).

      6. Note to Appendix. 3 provides a comparison with Frog Farm's sherd count with two
      Cray and Darent Valley sites. Poverest Road had twelve of the form series,
      the highest total known. Dartford was chosen since this villa farmstead
      was built post AD 140 and Form I (Appendix I) is totally absent.

      7.     ANALYSIS
      7.1   Carbon as a filler for P.G.W. has been suggested (Pollard,
      19S2b). A fellow member of the D.D.A.G. Mr Ian Gerrard took three P.G.W.
      sherds from Ash Villa One site and mechanically crushed them. He reported
      as follows:-
             Kiln set at 24 hrs. at 1000�
      C. 
             new crucible one      
      -    carbon
            
                

new crucible two      
      -    crushed P.G.W.
      sherd               
      - 31
            
                

new crucible three    
      -    hand picked black "grog" fraction - 32
            
                

new crucible four      
      -    hand picked grey "grog" fraction  
      - 33

         Results:- After being let to cool, crucible one had a slight
      black stain - the carbon had evaporated. Crucibles two to four contained a
      homogeneous bright red brick dust.
         Carbon, as a deliberately chosen filler, would call for a
      regular supply - an added complication to the process of making pots. Its
      presence as a filler has never been noted (Satterwaite, 1994-). A void in
      the paste, due to occasional burnt out organics, Would not be surprising
      for a whole range of ceramic material from the Bronze Age onwards.

      7.2    At the point (X) in Farther Marsh field, Frog Farm,
      Otford, Kent a P.G.W. plain body sherd was obtained in January, 1987. It
      was slightly abraded (weathering, ploughing episodes) and came from a
      recently fertilized field surface (blood, fish and bone).

NOTE: At each of these sites P.G.W. Fabric
      1, and in come cases also 1A has been found in either the same context or
      sealed layer. No evidence has been found for P.G.W. being in a Claudian or
      Nero era context. This confirmed, it is suggested, an observer that P.G.W.
      had never been noted in a secure Claudian context (Pollard 1982b).

         From the 1978/79 Dartford Villa (D.D.A.G. 1986) excavations a
      P.G.W, base sherd, with a unique decor scheme (not unlike a modem quiche
      dish) was removed and a sample taken.
         Both samples had been washed in tap water and dried. Both
      were Irradiated for a neutron activation analysis at North East London
      Polytechnic in March, 1987 (Fig. 11).
         The presence of manganese in the Dartford sample may be due
      to sampling error as this is a trace element in gault clay. Allowing for
      the fact that this sampling is not typical, that the neutron activation
      analysis neutron flux was low, this is a striking match.
         P.G.W. has been found on twenty-eight sites in the Dartford
      area (cf Appendix 2 - 2.1 - Dartford Block).

      8.      DATING
      8.1    The association of P.G.W. Fabric 1 in layers on a
      number of N.W. Kent sites for the period circa 65 - 100 AD with a number
      of known forms and fabrics is striking (Fig. 12). Pollard's suggestion
      that P.G.W. achieved a recognisable form in the later 1c AD (Pollard,
      1982a) is considered here correct in the precise sense of an orange
      surfaced product.

      8.2    The presence of everted rim jars, Jars bearing
      reserved zone acute lattice decor (a B.B.2 mimic) and flanged rim bowls
      and dishes, points to production at Frog Farm into the first quarter of
      the 3c.

      8.3    This is not the place to discuss in detail the
      dating evidence of each open and closed form. However, (Appendix
            3) offers
      an insight of Form 2 reaching Cray end Darent Valley sites whereas the
      kiln site has a low Form 2 body sherd count compared to Form 1.

      9.      Industry
      9.1    As a ware, P.G.W. arose out of a Southern England,
      pre-conquest Belgic grog ware tradition. Fabric 1 appears circa 60 AD and
      fell from the record in the troubled times of the early third century.

      9.2    The main output (44 pits out of 57) was Form
      2.

      9.3    This form monopolised the market in N.W. Kent in the
      supply of a large storage Jar. For the period 60 - 140 it had only one
      rival, marketed from the Thames-side industry. This was the shell-tempered
      storage jar (Form 11K Marsh/Tyers, 1978) (Fig. 13).
      This has bean noted in the course of this research on thirty-five N.W.
      Kent sites. It was first illustrated in a report alongside P.G.W, at
      Joydens Wood (Caiger/Tester, 1954).

      9.4    The Frog Farm potters also engaged in a volume
      production of a second closed form - the bead rim jar - in the later part
      of 1c/early 2c. It would seem that it was traded only a few miles from the
      site. All other forms were not volume produced and the uncommon decors may
      well reflect kiln site experiments.

      10.     CONCLUSIONS
      10.1   Much of what has been said has necessarily been one of
      opinion. The prime aim of the research has been achieved - that there is a
      homogeneous fabric - that the fabric appears confined to N.W. Kent in the
      main and embraced a long term output of an open and closed form series.
      The recognition that Frog Farm is the kiln site was an unexpected result
      in the face of the fact that a grog ware producer - by recycling waste -
      would leave virtually no trace of pottery activity.

      10.2    This work is a ground work survey, opening up to a
      marked degree the extent of P.G.W.'s distribution. Most of the sherds seen
      in the hand were derived from antiquarian collections, stray field surface
      assemblages and amateur rescue excavations. The value of these finds would
      have been severely limited had not the distinctive nature of the P.G.W.
      fabric been so evident. Finds from the bulk of these find spots have never
      been published, even at the interim report level.
         This has been a major drawback in that it has cast doubt on
      the size and relative importance of P.G.W. in its role of supply to the
      N.W. Kent market.

10.3    Future progress on
      the distribution of the ware rests on the future publications of
      excavations, both major such as Springhead and Rochester, and minor such
      as the Dartford Tour acre site (Philp, 1972), the Keston Warbank site
      complex (Philp) and the Gravesend Town Centre site (Philp). Unfortunately
      non-publication has thus far been the general rule in N. Kent pottery
      research (Monaghan, 1986).

      10.4    Considerable scope exists to add in blank areas of
      the distribution, to increase the form parallels and extend the fore
      series and refine the dating. 

      10.5    Modern developments pose a considerable threat in
      that the Poverest Road site is currently threatened with building schemes.
      Area (B)  Fig. 8 of the Frog Farm site has been sold off as
      recreation plots and the Springhead complex remains under the plough.

      10.6    A considered sampling policy and analytical
      programme to understand the nature of P.G.W.'s fabric is needed as is a
      modern open plan excavation at Frog Farm in an attempt to deduce the type
      of kiln technology.

      It is hoped that future researchers may find this study of some help in
      their work and it remains for me to thank all those contributors in Kent's
      museums and groups who gave their help, in particular Mr John Pyke of the
      Otford Group for allowing the use of copies of his 1:1 scale master
      drawings of some of the Frog Farm pits material and for other kindnesses.

Preface to Appendix 1  
              P.G.W. Forms

Bases of closed
                forms; Drawings one and two
      illustrate the types encountered at Frog Farm.
                   Jar base A is the most common encountered on sites in North West Kent.
                   Jar base C is common in the same area, especially in the second century.
                   Jar base E a reserved burnished zone can occur on A or B.
                   Type 24 strainer bases have been noted on a number of sites and
      there is only one example of a pre-fired base
                      at Frog Farm.  All
      others had the holes drilled post-fired.
         The incipient pedestal base is a later first century variant and the fully developed pedestal base is represented by
                      one example at
      Frog Farm.

This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.
