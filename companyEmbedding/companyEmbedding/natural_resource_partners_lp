In the case of Natural Resources Partners L.P., the RSI reading has hit 29.9 � by comparison, the universe of metals and mining stocks covered by Metals Channel currently has an average RSI of 46.7, the RSI of Spot Gold is at 52.8, and the RSI of Spot Silver is presently 49.1.


A bullish investor could look at NRP's 29.9 reading as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.


Looking at a chart of one year performance (below), NRP's low point in its 52 week range is $11.0601 per share, with $45.60 as the 52 week high point � that compares with a last trade of $28.40.  Natural Resources Partners L.P. shares are currently trading down about 2.8% on the day.

Volume 18, Issue 3, Fall 2000
Illinois Department of Natural Resources: Partners in Action
By Acker, Elaine








By Elaine Acker

Throughout its history, BCI has been privileged to work with many conservation-minded state agencies in the U.S. The Illinois Department of Natural Resources (DNR) Division of Natural Heritage has been one of the most active and has been a BCI partner in conservation initiatives for more than a decade.

Joe Kath, endangered species project manager with the DNR, has made bat conservation priority for the agency. We've had an opportunity to identify critical habitat areas in Illinois, said Kath. Many of the goals I'd set as career goals have already been reached, and much of our success is due to partnerships with other organizations, private individuals and industry. We've been fortunate because we've had an opportunity to work with great people.

When Kath reviewed Illinois' list of critical hibernation caves and mines, Unimin Specialty Minerals Corporation became an important partner. In collaboration with BCI, the first gate was installed at Unimin's Magazine Mine in 1996 when only 100 bats were present. In February 1999, volunteers from the DNR, the U.S. Forest Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and Unimin Corp. joined in the effort to map and once again survey the mine. It took two full days, said Kath. We discovered approximately 12,000 bats of five different species hibernating in the mine. About 75 percent of those were Indiana bats (Myotis sodalis), making this mine the largest Indiana bat hibernation site ever documented in the state of Illinois. I added the numbers over and over, because I couldn't believe what I was seeing. The Illinois DNR is now participating in BCI's long-term study of Indiana bat sites, monitoring temperature and humidity at the Magazine Mine in hope that this success story can be duplicated at other critical roosts.

The Illinois DNR's next challenge will be to gate a second entrance at Magazine Mine. This is a silica sand mine, which is very fragile, said Kath. Without intervention, the main entrance will eventually collapse on itself. It might be five years from now, or it might be 50 years, but it will happen. Engineers have designed solid steel arches, such as those used in coal mines, to reinforce the entrance, but the design will cost up to $100,000. Kath hopes to meet his fundraising goals in time to start gating by early summer 2001. 

Illinois' conservation efforts also include partnerships with private landowners. According to Kath, almost 99 percent of the Illinois landscape is privately owned. One cave on private property had been identified as a critical Indiana bat hibernation site, said Kath. However, no one had pursued conservation because of the landowner's reputation as difficult'. As it turns out, that reputation was undeserved, and the landowner is one of the nicest, most cooperative people in the state. Kath and his associates visited with the property owner, who shared the cave's history, as well as his concerns about liability and trespassing. When I offered to install a bat-friendly gate that would reduce his liability and keep trespassers out, he jumped at the opportunity, said Kath. The cave was permanently protected in September 1999, and the population that had slowly decreased due to vandalism now has a chance to recover. 

Kath also volunteers as chair of the Northeastern Bat Working Group. The group's members, representatives from 22 states, are developing conservation priorities for the region's bats. He also serves on the executive steering committee for the North American Bat Conservation Partnership, which develops conservation strategies at a continent-wide level. In these groups, biologists, cave enthusiasts, educators, government agencies and conservation organizations are working together to share information and resources. We still have a lot of work to do for bat conservation, said Kath. But the progress we've made shows us just how far we can come in a short period of time if we work as partners.




Unimin's Magazine Mine houses Illinois' largest known population of endangered Indiana bats. The photo above was taken prior to installation of a bat-friendly gate in 1996.

The Illinois Department of Natural Resources worked with Ray Smith from the U.S. Forest Service, Sheryl Ducummon from BCI, and Siebert Crowley from Unimin, to install this gate at Magazine Mine.

BATS Magazine Article: Illinois Department of Natural Resources: Partners in Action




















Volume 18, Issue 3, Fall 2000
Illinois Department of Natural Resources: Partners in Action
By Acker, Elaine








By Elaine Acker

Throughout its history, BCI has been privileged to work with many conservation-minded state agencies in the U.S. The Illinois Department of Natural Resources (DNR) Division of Natural Heritage has been one of the most active and has been a BCI partner in conservation initiatives for more than a decade.

Joe Kath, endangered species project manager with the DNR, has made bat conservation priority for the agency. We've had an opportunity to identify critical habitat areas in Illinois, said Kath. Many of the goals I'd set as career goals have already been reached, and much of our success is due to partnerships with other organizations, private individuals and industry. We've been fortunate because we've had an opportunity to work with great people.

When Kath reviewed Illinois' list of critical hibernation caves and mines, Unimin Specialty Minerals Corporation became an important partner. In collaboration with BCI, the first gate was installed at Unimin's Magazine Mine in 1996 when only 100 bats were present. In February 1999, volunteers from the DNR, the U.S. Forest Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and Unimin Corp. joined in the effort to map and once again survey the mine. It took two full days, said Kath. We discovered approximately 12,000 bats of five different species hibernating in the mine. About 75 percent of those were Indiana bats (Myotis sodalis), making this mine the largest Indiana bat hibernation site ever documented in the state of Illinois. I added the numbers over and over, because I couldn't believe what I was seeing. The Illinois DNR is now participating in BCI's long-term study of Indiana bat sites, monitoring temperature and humidity at the Magazine Mine in hope that this success story can be duplicated at other critical roosts.

The Illinois DNR's next challenge will be to gate a second entrance at Magazine Mine. This is a silica sand mine, which is very fragile, said Kath. Without intervention, the main entrance will eventually collapse on itself. It might be five years from now, or it might be 50 years, but it will happen. Engineers have designed solid steel arches, such as those used in coal mines, to reinforce the entrance, but the design will cost up to $100,000. Kath hopes to meet his fundraising goals in time to start gating by early summer 2001. 

Illinois' conservation efforts also include partnerships with private landowners. According to Kath, almost 99 percent of the Illinois landscape is privately owned. One cave on private property had been identified as a critical Indiana bat hibernation site, said Kath. However, no one had pursued conservation because of the landowner's reputation as difficult'. As it turns out, that reputation was undeserved, and the landowner is one of the nicest, most cooperative people in the state. Kath and his associates visited with the property owner, who shared the cave's history, as well as his concerns about liability and trespassing. When I offered to install a bat-friendly gate that would reduce his liability and keep trespassers out, he jumped at the opportunity, said Kath. The cave was permanently protected in September 1999, and the population that had slowly decreased due to vandalism now has a chance to recover. 

Kath also volunteers as chair of the Northeastern Bat Working Group. The group's members, representatives from 22 states, are developing conservation priorities for the region's bats. He also serves on the executive steering committee for the North American Bat Conservation Partnership, which develops conservation strategies at a continent-wide level. In these groups, biologists, cave enthusiasts, educators, government agencies and conservation organizations are working together to share information and resources. We still have a lot of work to do for bat conservation, said Kath. But the progress we've made shows us just how far we can come in a short period of time if we work as partners.




Unimin's Magazine Mine houses Illinois' largest known population of endangered Indiana bats. The photo above was taken prior to installation of a bat-friendly gate in 1996.

The Illinois Department of Natural Resources worked with Ray Smith from the U.S. Forest Service, Sheryl Ducummon from BCI, and Siebert Crowley from Unimin, to install this gate at Magazine Mine.

The aggregates are used in the construction of most of the country’s infrastructure, including residential, commercial, and public works projects. The minerals are mined and processed for a range of industrial and commercial applications.



Quick Facts

Top 25 aggregates producer in U.S.
Controlled 400 million tons at 12/31/16
VantaCore operations/revenues in 7 states




NRP reinforced our strategy to diversify the partnership’s assets with the 2014 acquisition of VantaCore, one of the top 25 aggregates producers in the United States. VantaCore was formed in 2006 to acquire profitable, well-managed, and competitively advantaged mid-sized aggregates companies. It operates four hard rock quarries, one under ground limestone mine, six sand and gravel plants, two asphalt plants, and two marine terminals. At December 31, 2016, VantaCore controlled approximately 400 million tons of estimated aggregate reserves.
With VantaCore as a wholly owned subsidiary, NRP has significantly enhanced our platform for growth in the construction aggregates business. Beyond that, it further strengthens our footprint in the Marcellus and Utica shales, where VantaCore supplies limestone and base material to oil and gas companies operating in the region.
VantaCore operates in three regions of the country:
Laurel Aggregates, based in Lake Lynn, Pennsylvania, operates both a surface and a underground mine that supplies aggregates to customers located in southwestern Pennsylvania, northeastern West Virginia and eastern Ohio.
Winn Materials/McIntosh Construction/Grand Rivers is located in and around Clarksville, Tennessee, located approximately 45 miles northwest of Nashville. Winn Materials operates two crushed stone quarries and a river terminal, while McIntosh is a complementary asphalt producer and paving company. These companies supply products to customers in the Clarksville area, a growing region for Tennessee and to Fort Campbell, one of the largest Army bases in the United States.
Southern Aggregates is located approximately 25 miles northeast of Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Southern operates six sand and gravel operations and supplies customers in the cities of Baton Rouge, Lafayette and New Orleans.

Coal & Hard Minerals Royalties
Natural Resource Partners L.P. (NRP) owned more than 1.7 billion tons of coal reserves at December 31, 2016 and collects royalties, overriding royalties, wheelage fees, and coal-related processing and transportation fees. Our reserves are geographically diverse and cover a broad range of heat and sulfur content, making them highly desirable to customers in multiple markets across the country. In addition to coal, NRP also owns hard minerals reserves and collects royalties similar to the coal business.



Quick Facts

Owns 1.7 billion tons of coal reserves
28% of reserves are metallurgical
83% of reserves are underground



 












Coal - Illinois Basin
Natural Resource Partners has a diverse range of assets in the Illinois Basin, a 400-mile producing region that covers most of Illinois, the southwestern part of Indiana, and western Kentucky.
We began to increase our exposure in the area in 2005 and today own and lease approximately 300 million tons of steam coal reserves. Because of convenient access to shipping infrastructure, this high-heat coal can be efficiently delivered to domestic utilities or for export. Additionally, we also own load-out and other transportation assets located at our properties in the basin.
















Coal - Appalachia
Natural Resource Partners has a significant presence in the Northern, Central, and Southern Appalachia regions. Spanning eight states, our interests in Appalachia include mineral and royalty interests on approximately 1.4 billion tons of coal reserves.
We offer both metallurgical and steam coal in the region. This makes our reserves marketable to a diverse customer base and enables our lessees to adjust to changing markets. Additionally, by having reserves in different geographic areas of Appalachia with various types of coal reserves, our lessees can serve a broader number of markets and take advantage of changing customer preferences.
















Coal - Northern Powder River Basin
Natural Resource Partners owns 35 million tons of low-sulfur surface reserves in the Northern Powder River Basin in southeastern Montana.
The Powder River Basin, which also includes northeast Wyoming, is the largest source of coal mined in the United States. Coal from the region is considered to have significant appeal because of its low sulfur and fly ash content.
















Coal - Gulf Coast
Natural Resource Partners owns about 95,000 net mineral acres of coal rights in the Gulf Coast region. Of this, approximately 4,800 acres are leased in Louisiana, Alabama and Texas.
















Hard Minerals Royalties & Other
In addition to NRP’s aggregate operations, we also own approximately 250 million tons of aggregates reserves located in a number of states across the country. We lease a portion of these reserves to third parties in exchange for royalty payments. These reserves, located from coast to coast, generate either royalty revenues or overriding royalty revenues on items such as sand and gravel, frac sand, silica sand, limestone and other aggregates.

Is There Life After a 75% Dividend Cut for Natural Resource Partners LP?
After a drastic dividend cut, this company may finally be on the way to a sustainable future.











                Reuben Gregg Brewer
            

                (TMFReubenGBrewer)



            
            Apr 27, 2015 at 11:06AM
            
            





Natural Resource Partners LP (NYSE:NRP) just eviscerated its distribution, cutting the payout 75%. That's painful and investors reacted in predictable fashion, sending the units sharply lower. But step back for one moment. Now that the damage is done, is this partnership finally ready to grow?
A changing coreIn 2012, just a couple of years ago, Natural Resource Partners' business was all about coal. In fact, roughly 94% of its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or EBITDA, came from coal related operations. Coal has been a rough business, and Natural Resource Partners was keenly aware of this fact. So it started to diversify.

NRP was built on coal, but its future rests elsewhere. Source: Amcyrus2012, via Wikimedia Commons.

The effort to move away from coal has had a big impact. At the end of 2014, the partnership's non-coal business went from 6% of EBITDA to 37% or so. And this year that number is expected to be between 40%-50%. While a drop in coal revenues is partly responsible for this shift, several acquisitions in oil and gas and the aggregates space were bigger contributors.
Building off of coalThe basic idea of the shift was to use coal to build a broader portfolio of assets. In theory that's a smart move. In fact, CONSOL Energy (NYSE:CNX) basically did the same thing, shifting from coal to natural gas. CONSOL started the process much earlier, however, and exited its least desirable coal operations in late 2013. That changed the company from a coal miner with gas assets to a gas company with some relatively well-positioned coal assets.
Late start aside, Natural Resource Partners' efforts to diversify relied on a drastic increase in its debt load. Putting numbers on that, it started 2012 with around $840 million in debt on the balance sheet. At the end of last year that number had ballooned to nearly $1.4 billion. Explained another way, debt is 67% higher than it was just a few years ago. It's too bad that coal prices didn't cooperate and the expansion into oil and gas has come at a time when those commodities are facing downward pressure, too.





Retrenching for the futureSo at a time when the partnership's interest payments have increased nearly 50%, the new businesses acquired have only increased the top line around 6% or so over 2012 levels. Something had to give eventually, and since coal, oil, and natural gas don't seem ready to rebound, it was the distribution that took the hit (twice, this is actually the second distribution cut in the last 18 months).
With that damage done, what does the future look like for the company? For starters, based on Natural Resource Partners' projections for the year, the current distribution is covered four times over. So, yes, the current payout should hold and a third cut seems highly unlikely.
But, what's the company doing with the $130 million it's saving by cutting the distribution? CEO Corbin Robertson summed it up nicely: "After several years of accelerated growth and diversification through acquisitions, we need to focus our attention on reducing our debt and improving our balance sheet." And it looks like acquisitions are off the table too, with the company noting that, "... organic growth of its aggregates, industrial minerals and oil and natural gas assets," is how it will continue to diversify.
That's a lot more positive than it sounds. Historically, Natural Resource Partners has focused on owning assets that it leases to others. However, its most recent acquisition in the aggregates space, VantaCore Partners, actually operates mines. Since Natural Resource Partners has a whole bunch of aggregates properties that aren't currently being worked, all it needs to do is let VantaCore have at them. So growth potential could easily be rosier than it at first appears.





Investor takeawayWhat does that mean for you? Natural Resource Partners isn't a materially different company than it was before the dividend cut. In fact, it's likely to get more diversified and financially stronger over the next few years. These things will just happen slowly. If you are looking for tax losses, this could be a good candidate. You should have plenty of time to buy back in after 30 days or so. That said, if you are looking for a company that invests in natural resources and is expanding its reach into new areas, now, after the dividend cut sell off, could be a good time.

FlashRatings - All research for my stocks!

The most comprehensive equity research coverage available online.


          Never miss a single piece of research, upgrade, downgrade or target price change by any analyst firm on any stock!
          
          Equity research by professional analysts - especially their rationales more than their forecasts - contains far more interesting and important information about the actual fundamentals of the traded companies than can be gathered from conventional news reports.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
