Federated Global Investment Management Corp. Key Developments

Federated Global Investment Management Corp. Settles Charges with the SEC
May 30 16
Federated Global Investment Management Corp. has settled charges with the SEC regarding alleged violation of the Advisers Act. The company has agreed to be censured and to pay a penalty of $1.5 million to the SEC. The SEC said the company acted as sub-adviser to Federated Kaufmann Funds from 2001 to 2010. During that period, the company used the services of a consultant who was a director on the boards of four publicly traded biotechnology companies whose securities were traded by the funds. The consultant worked with the company's investment management professionals and provided recommendations on pharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks. The SEC alleged that the company failed to maintain procedures for identifying outside consultants who should be subject to oversight by the compliance department. The company was unaware that the consultant possessed confidential information regarding the companies and failed to prevent the misuse of confidential information. The SEC noted that the company terminated the consulting agreement in May 2010 after it became aware that the consultant was serving on the boards of the companies and has adopted procedures to prevent future violations.

History[edit]
Federated Investors was founded in 1955 by high school classmates John F. Donahue, Richard B. Fisher, and Thomas J. Donnelly.[3]
Aetna acquired a majority ownership stake in Federated Investors in 1982; at the time Federated had nearly $30 billion in assets under management.[4] In 1989, Federated management bought out Aetna for $345 million, reestablishing majority control of the company.[5] In 1996, Federated management paid $100 million to acquire the remaining 25% stock ownership still held by Aetna.[6] Federated completed an initial public offering on the NYSE on May 14, 1998.[7]
In 1991 Federated established Federated International Management Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary in Dublin, Ireland, becoming the first U.S. company whose registered money market funds were approved for distribution to the European community. In 1998, Federated launched a venture with Frankfurt insurer LVM-Versicherungen to offer Federated funds in Germany and other German-speaking countries.[8]
In April 2012 Federated Investors, Inc. completed its acquisition of Prime Rate Capital Management LLP (PRCM), a London, United Kingdom-based provider of institutional liquidity and fixed income products, from Matrix Group Limited they did not purchase this company. Federated Prime Rate Capital Management's AAA-rated liquidity funds, known as Qualifying Money Market Funds, serve the corporate and institutional market. The funds, totaling approximately $4.0 billion USD (GBP 2.5 billion) in assets, are rated AAA by both Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings.[9]
In September 2012, Federated Investors announced that it had bought around $4.4 billion in assets from Fifth Third Asset Management Inc.[10]

History[edit]
Federated Investors was founded in 1955 by high school classmates John F. Donahue, Richard B. Fisher, and Thomas J. Donnelly.[3]
Aetna acquired a majority ownership stake in Federated Investors in 1982; at the time Federated had nearly $30 billion in assets under management.[4] In 1989, Federated management bought out Aetna for $345 million, reestablishing majority control of the company.[5] In 1996, Federated management paid $100 million to acquire the remaining 25% stock ownership still held by Aetna.[6] Federated completed an initial public offering on the NYSE on May 14, 1998.[7]
In 1991 Federated established Federated International Management Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary in Dublin, Ireland, becoming the first U.S. company whose registered money market funds were approved for distribution to the European community. In 1998, Federated launched a venture with Frankfurt insurer LVM-Versicherungen to offer Federated funds in Germany and other German-speaking countries.[8]
In April 2012 Federated Investors, Inc. completed its acquisition of Prime Rate Capital Management LLP (PRCM), a London, United Kingdom-based provider of institutional liquidity and fixed income products, from Matrix Group Limited they did not purchase this company. Federated Prime Rate Capital Management's AAA-rated liquidity funds, known as Qualifying Money Market Funds, serve the corporate and institutional market. The funds, totaling approximately $4.0 billion USD (GBP 2.5 billion) in assets, are rated AAA by both Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings.[9]
In September 2012, Federated Investors announced that it had bought around $4.4 billion in assets from Fifth Third Asset Management Inc.[10]

With #funds rate just north of 1%, don’t call #FedHikes tightening. Less accommodating, maybe.

History[edit]
Federated Investors was founded in 1955 by high school classmates John F. Donahue, Richard B. Fisher, and Thomas J. Donnelly.[3]
Aetna acquired a majority ownership stake in Federated Investors in 1982; at the time Federated had nearly $30 billion in assets under management.[4] In 1989, Federated management bought out Aetna for $345 million, reestablishing majority control of the company.[5] In 1996, Federated management paid $100 million to acquire the remaining 25% stock ownership still held by Aetna.[6] Federated completed an initial public offering on the NYSE on May 14, 1998.[7]
In 1991 Federated established Federated International Management Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary in Dublin, Ireland, becoming the first U.S. company whose registered money market funds were approved for distribution to the European community. In 1998, Federated launched a venture with Frankfurt insurer LVM-Versicherungen to offer Federated funds in Germany and other German-speaking countries.[8]
In April 2012 Federated Investors, Inc. completed its acquisition of Prime Rate Capital Management LLP (PRCM), a London, United Kingdom-based provider of institutional liquidity and fixed income products, from Matrix Group Limited they did not purchase this company. Federated Prime Rate Capital Management's AAA-rated liquidity funds, known as Qualifying Money Market Funds, serve the corporate and institutional market. The funds, totaling approximately $4.0 billion USD (GBP 2.5 billion) in assets, are rated AAA by both Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings.[9]
In September 2012, Federated Investors announced that it had bought around $4.4 billion in assets from Fifth Third Asset Management Inc.[10]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
