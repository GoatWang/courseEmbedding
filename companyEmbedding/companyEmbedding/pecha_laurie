"This poem is an ode to every hard working artist who knows the joy of struggle from which their art comes."In&nbsp;Learning to Speak: Poetry as Pursuit of Truth&nbsp;from&nbsp;PechaKucha Night San Antonio&nbsp;Vol. 20,&nbsp;poet laureate,&nbsp;Laurie Ann Guerrero&nbsp;looks back at her ancestors&rsquo; history of labor and struggle as art, a legacy of poets, musicians and painters whose artistry was a way to map and ultimately transcend the world. Art, she says, is a pursuit of truth. It was her ancestor&rsquo;s many generations of that pursuit that ultimately gave her the privilege and position of being asked to make art: the maker, not the object. Through poetry, Guerrero invites us to share in that space of openness, vulnerability and ultimately grace.

“I’m a bio media artist. And what that means is I work self-reflexively, with the tools and technologies of the life sciences.” 
In Complicating Things: Experimenting with Authority from PechaKucha Buffalo vol. 17, Professor of Art at the University at Buffalo, Paul Vanouse, provides an overview of his work as a bio media artist. As Director of the newly created Coalesce Center for Biological Art at the University at Buffalo, Vanouse works with artists and philosophers and people who wouldn’t normally have a direct connection to do create work in a life sciences laboratory, and is actively engaged with Coalesce’s artist residency program. Vanouse’s own work has recently focused on DNA fingerprinting, removing the inherent layers of authority from DNA with an interest in the very visual representation of DNA. His recent projects, Latent Figure Protocol and Ocular Revision use molecular biology techniques to challenge “genome-hype” and to confront issues surrounding DNA fingerprinting.
