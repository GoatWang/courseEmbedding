Company Overview[edit]
Founded in 1925,[2] GPC is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia and consists of multiple subsidiaries that distribute automotive replacement parts, industrial replacement parts, office products and electrical/electronic materials. The Company has paid a cash dividend to shareholders every year since going public in 1948.[1] The company moved into its new headquarters building in the Wildwood area of Cobb County, GA in June 2016.[3]
Automotive Parts[edit]
The Automotive Parts Group, the largest division of GPC, distributes approximately 475,000 automotive replacement parts, accessory items and service items throughout North America, Australia and New Zealand. In North America, parts are sold primarily under the NAPA brand name. GPC also uses the UAP brand in Canada and AutoTodo in Mexico. The Company’s GPC Asia Pacific business serves the Australasian markets primarily under the brand name Repco. [4]
Industrial Parts[edit]
The Industrial Parts Group, which operates under the name Motion Industries, offers access to more than 6.5 million industrial replacement parts and related supplies and serves over 150,000 MRO and OEM customers throughout North America and in all types of industries. These include the food and beverage, forest products, primary metal, pulp and paper, mining, automotive, oil and gas, petrochemical and pharmaceutical industries.[5]

The Office Products Group, which operates under the name S. P. Richards Company, distributes more than 62,000 items to over 6,300 resellers and distributors throughout the United States and Canada from a network of 45 distribution centers.

History[edit]
In 1925, Carlyle Fraser founded GPC with the purchase of Motor Parts Depot in Atlanta, Georgia for $40,000. He renamed the parts store Genuine Parts Company. The original Genuine Parts Company store had annual sales of just $75,000, and six employees.
For the next 50+ years, GPC, in relationship with NAPA, the National Automotive Parts Association, grew rapidly as independent garages for car repair emerged to meet the needs of the nation's growing number of motor vehicles. In the last 35+ years, GPC has continued to grow through the acquisition of other companies in the automotive industry, as well as in the industrial, office and electrical industries.
Today GPC is a leading parts distributor with over 2,600 operations and approximately 39,000 employees.[8]

History[edit]
In 1925, Carlyle Fraser founded GPC with the purchase of Motor Parts Depot in Atlanta, Georgia for $40,000. He renamed the parts store Genuine Parts Company. The original Genuine Parts Company store had annual sales of just $75,000, and six employees.
For the next 50+ years, GPC, in relationship with NAPA, the National Automotive Parts Association, grew rapidly as independent garages for car repair emerged to meet the needs of the nation's growing number of motor vehicles. In the last 35+ years, GPC has continued to grow through the acquisition of other companies in the automotive industry, as well as in the industrial, office and electrical industries.
Today GPC is a leading parts distributor with over 2,600 operations and approximately 39,000 employees.[8]

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

ATLANTA, Feb. 3, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Genuine Parts Company (NYSE:   GPC) announced today three acquisitions for its Industrial, Electrical/Electronic and Office Groups. 
(Logo:  http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20081002/CLTH108LOGO)
Effective January 31, 2014, Motion Industries (Canada), Inc. ("Motion Canada"), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company's Industrial Group, Motion Industries ("Motion"), completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Commercial Solutions Inc. ("CSI"), as previously announced on December 2, 2013.  CSI (TSX: CSA), headquartered in Edmonton, Alberta, is one of Canada's leading independent national distributors of industrial supplies, including bearings and power transmission products, complete solutions for drilling rigs and industrial and safety supplies.  Its customers represent a broad cross-section of industries and are served from 22 locations across Canada and one in the U.S.  The Company expects the acquired business to generate approximately $100 million in annual revenues. 
Effective February 1, 2014, EIS, the Company's Electrical/Electronic Material Group, closed on the acquisition of the assets of Electro-Wire, Inc. ("Electro-Wire").  Headquartered in Schaumburg, Illinois, Electro-Wire is a leading North American distributor and contract manufacturer of specialty wire and cable products with four locations in the United States and primarily serving the telecom and transit markets.  The Company expects the acquired business to generate annual revenues of approximately $100 million.
Finally, S. P. Richards, the Company's Office Products Group, has acquired the assets of Garland C. Norris Company, Inc. ("GCN"), also effective February 1, 2014.  Headquartered in Apex, North Carolina, GCN is a regional wholesale distributor of Food Service Disposables and Janitorial and Cleaning supplies.  The Company expects the acquired business to generate approximately $35 million in annual revenues. 
Tom Gallagher, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Genuine Parts Company, stated, "We are pleased to have closed on the acquisition of CSI, as we believe they provide Motion with significant growth opportunities across Canada.  Likewise, the addition of Electro-Wire and GCN better positions EIS and S. P. Richards, respectively, for future growth.  Electro-Wire strengthens the specialty wire and cable capabilities at EIS, and GCN serves to further diversify S. P. Richards' product offering into complementary, adjacent markets.  We want to welcome these fine organizations to the GPC family and we look forward to the contributions they will make to our Company in the years ahead."
Forward Looking Statements
Some statements in this report, as well as in other materials we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or otherwise release to the public and in materials that we make available on our website, constitute forward-looking statements that are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Senior officers may also make verbal statements to analysts, investors, the media and others that are forward-looking.  Forward-looking statements may relate, for example, to future operations, prospects, strategies, financial condition, economic performance (including growth and earnings), industry conditions and demand for our products and services.  The Company cautions that its forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, and while we believe that our expectations for the future are reasonable in view of currently available information, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements.  Actual results or events may differ materially from those indicated as a result of various important factors.  Such factors may include, among other things, slowing demand for the Company's products, changes in general economic conditions, including, unemployment, inflation or deflation, high energy costs, uncertain credit markets and other macro-economic conditions, the ability to maintain favorable vendor arrangements and relationships, disruptions in our vendors' operations, competitive product, service and pricing pressures, the Company's ability to successfully implement its business initiatives in each of its four business segments, the Company's ability to successfully integrate its acquired businesses, the uncertainties and costs of litigation, as well as other risks and uncertainties discussed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2012 and from time to time in the Company's subsequent filings with the SEC. 
Forward-looking statements are only as of the date they are made, and the Company undertakes no duty to update its forward-looking statements except as required by law.  You are advised, however, to review any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our subsequent Forms 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K and other reports to the SEC.
