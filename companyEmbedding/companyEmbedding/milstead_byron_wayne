3. Each Restricted Stock Unit (RSU) represents a right to receive one share of the Issuers common shares without payment of specific consideration.
4. This grant of Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) vest as follows: 25% of the RSUs will vest upon the one-year anniversary of the grant date and an additional 6.25% of the RSUs vest each three months thereafter until 100% of the RSU grant is vested.
