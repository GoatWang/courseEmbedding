GTI's David Carroll Assumes Presidency of International Gas Union

Page Content DataGTI's David Carroll Assumes Presidency of IGU
 
06/05/15 Des Plaines, IL
 
Today, David C. Carroll, Gas Technology Institute (GTI) President and CEO, assumed the additional role of President of the International Gas Union (IGU) for a three-year term at the closing ceremony of the World Gas Conference (WGC) in Paris. With members from 91 countries representing 97% of the world's natural gas industry, IGU’s mission is to advocate for gas as an integral part of a sustainable global energy system, and to promote the political, technical and economic progress of the gas industry. The organization's home office, or Secretariat, is based in Oslo, Norway. 
 
The American Gas Association (AGA) is the U.S. charter member of IGU and will also play a key role in leading the 2015-2018 triennium. Dave McCurdy, President and CEO of AGA, is serving as the Chairman of the WGC 2018 National Organizing Committee. Mel Ydreos, Executive Director of EnergyVantage, is serving as Chairman of the IGU Coordination Committee, and Jay Copan is serving as Executive Director of WGC2018 and Special Advisor to the President.
 
"I am honored to have been selected by the IGU membership to lead this prestigious organization, and our team looks forward to closely working with the Secretary General and the IGU members," says Carroll. "Given the leading role natural gas is playing in the U.S. to meet energy needs, we are in an ideal position to promote the economic and environmental benefits of natural gas on the international stage." 
 
Carroll joined GTI in 2001 as Vice President of Business Development and assumed his current position as President and CEO in 2006. He oversees the company's operations and directs its programs for developing technologies, products, and services for customers in the natural gas and related industries.

David Carroll
President and CEO
Gas Technology Institute (GTI)

David Carroll is President and CEO of Gas Technology Institute
(GTI). In this role, he directs programs for developing and commercializing
natural-gas-related technologies, products, and services, with a focus
on finding and implementing solutions that create exceptional value for GTI
customers. He is also responsible for all facets of GTI’s business operations,
providing direction for its divisions that address Research and Development,
Corporate Technology and Development, and Corporate Support.
Carroll joined GTI in 2001 as Vice President of Business Development.
In that role, he led the effort to expand GTI’s customer base and increase
revenues from technology-based product and service offerings. He helped
to triple GTI’s rate of new business acquisition over a three-year period,
doubling market share in the core natural gas segment as well as penetrating
new markets. Carroll also served as president of Operations Technology
Development, NFP and Utilization Technology Development, NFP, two
Illinois-based not-for-profit companies sponsoring collaborative gas industry
research. In addition, Carroll’s duties included management of GTI’s
Education Division, which trains thousands of energy professionals annually
around the globe.


Carroll is experienced in building and leading profitable, high-performance
business units. From 1996 to 2001, he worked for Praxair, Inc., a global
provider of atmospheric, process and specialty gases. At Praxair, he served
as Director of Business Development from 1999 to 2001, and was general
manager of a strategic business unit from 1997 to 1999, accountable for
sales, marketing, engineering, financial and technical service functions.
Prior to that, Carroll held positions of increasing responsibility with Liquid
Carbonic Industries, a subsidiary of Chicago Bridge & Iron (1994-1996),
where he directed the company’s energy supply effort, and Air Products
and Chemicals, Inc. (1980-1994), where he held numerous technical and
commercial management positions.


Carroll earned a bachelor of science degree in chemical engineering from the
University of Pittsburgh, a master’s degree in business administration from
Lehigh University, and has completed the Stanford Executive Program
(SEP) at Stanford University’s Graduate School of Business. He is a
member of the Society of Gas Lighting, and serves on the Board of Directors
of Versa Power Systems, a developer, manufacturer, and distributor of solid
oxide fuel cell (SOFC) systems. He also serves on the Board of Directors
of Changing World Technologies, Inc. (CWT), the developer of the Thermo-
Depolymerization Process (TDP). TDP uses temperature, pressure and time
in a completely enclosed process to reform organic material into gas, oil,
and carbon. He is a steering committee member for the 16th International
Conference and Exhibition on Liquefied Natural Gas, as well as a member
of the Executives’ Club of Chicago—a forum for thought leadership, education
and best business practices. Carroll formerly served on the Board of Directors
of WestStart/CALSTART, an organization dedicated to developing advanced
transportation and clean energy technologies.

Co-Chairing the symposium on Natural Gas.
