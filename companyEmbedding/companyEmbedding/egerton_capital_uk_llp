 Career History



Partner/Chairman of ECL

                                    2005 - ?                


Egerton Capital (UK) LLP


                  Egerton is an active, research-intensive, benchmark agnostic manager which follows a long/short investment approach to invest in liquid, large-cap equities, diversifying across geographies and sectors. The firm employs a bottom-up strategy to identify undervalued equities with significant upside potential, constructing eclectic and uncorrelated portfolios. They employ little or no leverage and typically avoid companies which cannot grow through their own free cashflow on a sustainable basis. Their in-house fundamental research, which includes company visits, is complemented by external sources.                




Founding Partner & Chief Investment Officer

                                    Prior                


Beaumont Financial Partners LLC


                  Beaumont Financial Partners (BFP) believes that asset allocation is the single most important factor in achieving strong long-term performance. After determining the appropriate allocation of assets, they implement sector decisions and individual actions designed to generate performance results that will achieve or surpass the goals of their clients. The firm also believes that a top down asset allocation driven investment approach with superior global macroeconomic insight leads to top tier risk-adjusted investment results. BFP seeks to identify and select specific investments that will benefit from these value-creating themes and construct customized portfolios to meet each client’s unique objectives. BFP's investment approach begins with a consideration of all asset classes from a global macroeconomic standpoint to determine themes they think offer the best prospects on a risk/reward basis. Screening factors include historical market data, global demographic analysis, balance of trade and national debt comparisons, budget/deficit calculations, currency purchasing power parity analysis, global interest rates; and general supply/demand analytics across a wide array of commodities and materials. This process generates the themes/sectors BFP believes present the best investment opportunities for their clients and shape their rigorous asset allocation modeling. Once the themes/sectors are identified, BFP conducts additional fundamental, bottom up research and analysis on the specific investments (i.e., individual securities, mutual funds, ETFs, hedge funds, etc.). For the core equity component of client portfolios, BFP tends to focus on companies that have a history of generating significant free cash flow and sharing that cash flow with investors via their dividends. They prefer companies that have a long history of increasing their dividend annually and have a modest dividend payout ratio. In sectors in which they are more speculative, BFP’s analysis might focus on the value of a company’s assets and the discount these assets are valued at relative to the company’s stock price. Other value catalysts they look for include management changes, stock buyback plans, sectors that are consolidating, mispriced stocks due to market overreactions, and improving business models.BFP uses a method of categorizing the diverse investment universe which is referred to as the Dominant Benefit Theory of Investing. The Dominant Benefit Theory defines all investments into one of five categories based on the dominant characteristic of each investment. The categories are: safety, income, equity income, growth and aggressive growth.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60)

 Educational Background



Graduate 
Class of 1981 


University of Cambridge

                  The University of Cambridge (informally known as Cambridge University or Cambridge) is a public research university located in Cambridge, United Kingdom. It is the second-oldest university in the English-speaking world (after the University of Oxford), and the seventh-oldest in the world.                




Graduate Degree 
Class of 1977 


Eton College - England

                  Eton College, often informally referred to simply as Eton, is an English single-sex boys' independent boarding school located in Eton, Berkshire, near Windsor. It educates over 1,300 pupils, aged 13 to 18 years.

 Career History



Co-Founder

                                    1994 - Current                


Egerton Capital (UK) LLP


                  Egerton is an active, research-intensive, benchmark agnostic manager which follows a long/short investment approach to invest in liquid, large-cap equities, diversifying across geographies and sectors. The firm employs a bottom-up strategy to identify undervalued equities with significant upside potential, constructing eclectic and uncorrelated portfolios. They employ little or no leverage and typically avoid companies which cannot grow through their own free cashflow on a sustainable basis. Their in-house fundamental research, which includes company visits, is complemented by external sources.                




Professional

                                    1984 - 1987                


Tiger Consumer Management LP


                  Tiger Consumer Management's (TCM) investment objectives seek to preserve and grow capital over the long-term primarily through a combination of long and short investments in the equity and debt securities of various public issuers in the consumer sector. The firm's investment process is driven by intensive, fundamental bottom up research. TCM does not attempt to time the markets. Their approach involves developing an intrinsic value for each stock in their universe and comparing daily stock prices to estimates of intrinsic value so that they can determine potential long positions in issuers that they believe are discounted by the market and potential short positions in issuers that are traded at premium valuations. TCM may also take long or short positions in issuers that it believes are more accurately valued by the market to hedge other positions as part of its overall relative value approach.                




Head of European Research

                                    1981 - 1994                


Morgan Grenfell & Co. Ltd.


                  Part of Deutsche Bank AG, Morgan Grenfell & Co. Ltd. is a British company located in London. The firm manages private investments. It was founded by Robert McCarthy.                




Oil Services Analyst

                                    1980 - Prior                


Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC


                  Goldman, Sachs & Co. (GS&Co.), a limited partnership registered as a U.S. broker-dealer and futures commission merchant, together with its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, the firm), is an indirectly wholly owned subsidiary of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
