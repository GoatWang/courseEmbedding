About Us > Management > Vik Verma

Vik Verma

Chief Executive Officer
Vik Verma loves to take complex technology and translate it into products and services that create value for customers the world over. For his early work at Savi on RFID and the Internet of Things—which revolutionized worldwide container tracking and security—the World Economic Forum in Davos named him one of 2003’s top 40 “Technology Pioneers” in the world. Now Vik focuses on revolutionizing enterprise communications everywhere, with 8x8’s ground-breaking unified communications and contact center technology.
Vik previously served as Savi Technology’s Engineering VP before becoming its COO and later its president and CEO. And as President for Strategic Venture Development for Lockheed Martin, he focused on turning Lockheed Martin’s military technologies and programs into global commercial ventures ranging from seabed mining to nanomaterials. He earned engineering degrees from Florida Institute of Technology, the University of Michigan, and Stanford University. He’s also completed the trifecta of top-notch management schools, earning graduate executive credentials from Stanford, Harvard and the University of California at Berkeley. His motto? “Use technology to solve real-world problems cost effectively. The rest takes care of itself.”

8x8, Inc. Appoints Vikram Verma as Chief Executive Officer


Move Strengthens Management Depth and Positions the Company for

      Global Expansion;Bryan Martin Named Chief Technology

      Officer and Remains Chairman of the Board;Conference Call

      Today at 5:00 PM EDT



 SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

      As it enters its next phase of growth, 8x8, Inc. (NASDAQ: EGHT) today

      announced the appointment of Vikram Verma, an accomplished global

      business executive and member of the 8x8 Board of Directors, as Chief

      Executive Officer, effective immediately. Former CEO Bryan Martin will

      assume the role of Chief Technology Officer and will continue as

      Chairman of the Board of Directors.

    


      "8x8 has been an innovator in the industry and today is the leading

      provider of Unified Communications as a Service solutions," said 8x8

      Chairman of the Board and CTO Bryan Martin "Our next frontier is to

      scale domestically and globally to better serve our current

      multi-national customers as well as to bring our cloud communications

      services into new markets worldwide."

    


      "I'm looking forward to working with Vik and the rest of the management

      team to achieve these goals," added Martin. "With a solid foundation in

      place, we now have a real opportunity to capture the growing mid-size

      and international market for our services. The expertise Vik brings in

      guiding growth technology companies on a global basis is what 8x8 needs

      to accelerate this plan."

    


      8x8 Lead Board Director Major General (Ret.) Guy Hecker said, "After

      working closely with Vik for the past year and a half on the Board of

      Directors, the Board unanimously believes he brings the management,

      operational and international expertise to lead the Company through this

      next stage. Combined with Bryan's technological vision and deep

      knowledge of the industry, 8x8 will be well equipped to aggressively

      pursue its strategic business objectives."

    

Mr. Verma, who has served on 8x8's Board of Directors since being

      recruited by Mr. Martin and General Hecker in January 2012, brings over

      23 years of diverse executive experience to 8x8, including President of

      Strategic Venture Development at Lockheed Martin and Chairman of the

      Board and CEO of Savi Technology. As a member of the 8x8 Board, Mr.

      Verma has been instrumental in working with management to define the

      Company's strategic plan for continued profitable growth through

      increased mid-market penetration, global expansion and ongoing

      investment in innovative unified and mobile communications services.

    


      "I am honored to join the senior management team of 8x8 at this exciting

      time in the Company's growth," said Verma. "8x8 is well positioned to

      take advantage of the significant global market opportunity that exists

      for cloud-based unified communications, a market that in the U.S. alone

      is only about 10% penetrated. I look forward to working closely with

      Bryan, the Board of Directors, our senior leadership team, and the

      employees at 8x8 to build on the Company's current success and position

      the Company for continued growth across multiple domestic and

      international markets."

    

Mr. Verma was President of Strategic Venture Development for Lockheed

      Martin from October 2008 through August 2013. In that role, he

      successfully identified and executed opportunities for monetizing

      existing Lockheed Martin technologies and programs in new global

      commercial markets through collaborative technology incubators,

      intellectual property portfolio licensing and strategic partnerships

      with international corporations. From 2006-2008, Mr. Verma was the

      President of the IS&GS Savi Group, a Lockheed Martin technology and

      information services division providing real-time supply chain

      management and security solutions for government and commercial markets

      worldwide. Previously, he was Chairman of the Board and CEO of Savi

      Technology, Inc. (Savi), a leader in RFID-based tracking and security

      solutions and a pioneer in cloud-based managed service offerings. Savi

      was acquired by Lockheed Martin in 2006.

    

Mr. Verma began his career in 1990 at Savi as a Design Engineer, joining

      while it was pre-revenue. By 1994, he had been promoted to Chief

      Operating Officer, and in 1995 he helped negotiate the acquisition of

      Savi by Texas Instruments, which subsequently sold the business to

      Raytheon Company. Mr. Verma became President and CEO of Savi in 1997. In

      partnership with venture capitalists from Silicon Valley and Asia, he

      led the management buyout of Savi from Raytheon Company in May 1999.

      Over the next seven years, he engineered the transformation of the

      business through organic growth, expansion into the UK and continental

      Europe, the acquisition and integration of an Asia-based high technology

      company and the launch of a global joint venture with Hutchison Ports (a

      subsidiary of Hutchison Whampoa) to track and secure cargo containers

      worldwide via wireless and cellular networks.

    

Mr. Verma holds a B.S.E.E. degree from the Florida Institute of

      Technology, an M.S.E.degree from the University of Michigan in

      electrical engineering, and the graduate degree of Engineer in

      Electrical Engineering from Stanford University. He has been granted

      eight patents and has won numerous accolades, including being named one

      of 40 "Technology Pioneers" by the World Economic Forum, in Davos,

      Switzerland in 2003.
