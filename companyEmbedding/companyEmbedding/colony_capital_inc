History[edit]
Colony purchased Raffles International on July 18, 2005. This included the 41 hotels and resorts operated under the Raffles Hotel and Swissotel brand names. There are plans to expand the chains, particularly in Asia.[citation needed]
On January 30, 2006, it acquired Fairmont Hotels and Resorts of Toronto, Ontario with Kingdom Hotels International as a joint partner for US$3.24 billion.[citation needed]
On April 10, 2006, it acquired French professional football team Paris Saint-Germain.[citation needed]
On February 25, 2007, it signed a definitive agreement to take Station Casinos private in a 75%/25% split with members of the founding Fertitta family for US$5.5 billion, or US$90/share. The subsequent economic downturn caused Station Casinos to declare bankruptcy in 2009, and when it emerged in 2011 Colony Capital owned a much smaller portion after providing more cash.[4][5][6] Founder, Chairman, and CEO Thomas Barrack said it "could have been the worst investment ever" in terms of timing.[7]
On November 11, 2008, Michael Jackson transferred the title of his 2,700 acre[2] estate Neverland Ranch to Sycamore Valley Ranch Company LLC, a joint venture between Jackson (represented by attorney, L. Londell McMillan) and an affiliate of Colony Capital.[8][9][10][11] It is still unclear whether Colony Capital has a part in the property.[12] Jackson earned a total of US$35 million when he agreed to the joint venture between himself and Colony Capital.[13][14]
In March 2010, Colony arranged a financing and marketing package for Annie Leibovitz. The New York celebrity photographer had been in financial difficulty and in danger of losing to her previous lender, ArtCapital, the rights to her photographs and negatives and her three Greenwich Village townhouses. ArtCapital's credit was for $24 million.[2]
In December 2010, Colony purchased Miramax from Disney with Qatar Investment Authority, Tutor-Saliba Corporation and The Weinstein Company as part of a joint venture called Filmyard Holdings for $663 million.[15][16]
In January 2017, Colony NorthStar, Inc. (NYSE: CLNS) was formed through a tri-party merger between Colony Capital, Inc. (NYSE:CLNY), NorthStar Asset Management Group Inc. (NYSE:NSAM) and NorthStar Realty Finance Corp. (NYSE:NRF).

History[edit]
Colony purchased Raffles International on July 18, 2005. This included the 41 hotels and resorts operated under the Raffles Hotel and Swissotel brand names. There are plans to expand the chains, particularly in Asia.[citation needed]
On January 30, 2006, it acquired Fairmont Hotels and Resorts of Toronto, Ontario with Kingdom Hotels International as a joint partner for US$3.24 billion.[citation needed]
On April 10, 2006, it acquired French professional football team Paris Saint-Germain.[citation needed]
On February 25, 2007, it signed a definitive agreement to take Station Casinos private in a 75%/25% split with members of the founding Fertitta family for US$5.5 billion, or US$90/share. The subsequent economic downturn caused Station Casinos to declare bankruptcy in 2009, and when it emerged in 2011 Colony Capital owned a much smaller portion after providing more cash.[4][5][6] Founder, Chairman, and CEO Thomas Barrack said it "could have been the worst investment ever" in terms of timing.[7]
On November 11, 2008, Michael Jackson transferred the title of his 2,700 acre[2] estate Neverland Ranch to Sycamore Valley Ranch Company LLC, a joint venture between Jackson (represented by attorney, L. Londell McMillan) and an affiliate of Colony Capital.[8][9][10][11] It is still unclear whether Colony Capital has a part in the property.[12] Jackson earned a total of US$35 million when he agreed to the joint venture between himself and Colony Capital.[13][14]
In March 2010, Colony arranged a financing and marketing package for Annie Leibovitz. The New York celebrity photographer had been in financial difficulty and in danger of losing to her previous lender, ArtCapital, the rights to her photographs and negatives and her three Greenwich Village townhouses. ArtCapital's credit was for $24 million.[2]
In December 2010, Colony purchased Miramax from Disney with Qatar Investment Authority, Tutor-Saliba Corporation and The Weinstein Company as part of a joint venture called Filmyard Holdings for $663 million.[15][16]
In January 2017, Colony NorthStar, Inc. (NYSE: CLNS) was formed through a tri-party merger between Colony Capital, Inc. (NYSE:CLNY), NorthStar Asset Management Group Inc. (NYSE:NSAM) and NorthStar Realty Finance Corp. (NYSE:NRF).

Atlantic City Hilton
Las Vegas Hilton
Bally's Casino Tunica



Colony was also involved in investing in luxury hotels and resorts in Asia and North America:
