Annie Henry and the Mysterious Stranger – Book 3 (Susan Olasky) Author: Susan Olasky $7.99 $6.25

Annie Henry is finding out that being the governor’s daughter in colonial Virginia comes with its own set of problems! Annie’s father, the great American patriot Patrick Henry, has been elected governor of Virginia. And that means 12-year old Annie has a new home – the governor’s mansion in Williamsburg. Most girls would be thrilled, but to Annie, it seems like more trouble than it’s worth.
There’s a scary stranger who keeps bothering her, simply because her dad is “important.” And people in the capital city expect a politician’s daughter to act a certain way. Even her new school is very different. All in all, these changes are a little frightening to Annie. Especially when she realizes that as she’s changing, she’s growing apart from her father and feeling more and more like God is far away too. Should she tell anyone about what’s going on? Or does “growing up” mean handling problems by herself?

Research


research overview   

    
	
    	The research in Susan Henry’s laboratory focuses on regulation of membrane lipid metabolism in yeast and its coordination with membrane trafficking and signal transduction (Jesch et al., 2006; Gaspar et al., 2006; Gaspar et al., 2008; Nunez et al., 2008; Gaspar et al, 2010; Villa et al, 2010). We have shown that signals arising from lipid metabolism in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plasma membrane influence major transcriptional networks in the cell (Gaspar et al., 2006a; Jesch et al., 2006; Jesch et al., 2005; Loewen et al., 2004,Jesch et al, 2010). This metabolism influences, and is influenced by, several major signal transduction pathways including the unfolded protein response pathway (Chang et al., 2004; Chang et al., 2002) and the protein-kinase (PKC) pathway (Sreenivas et al., 2001, Nunez et al., 2008, Jesch et al.2010) and the glucose response pathway (Shirra et al., 2001).

Our work has focused on the relationship of transcriptional and metabolic responses to the phospholipid precursor, inositol.  The transcription patterns of over 700 genes are altered within two hours (equivalent to about one doubling time) following introduction of inositol. Statistical analysis identified at least six distinct expression responses (Jesch et al., 2005, 2006) including repression of phospholipid biosynthetic genes regulated by Opi1p, as well as genes regulated by the UPR pathway and transient induction of lipid remodeling genes regulated by Mga2p. These three categories of genes are known to respond to signals arising in the ER and the kinetics of the changes in their transcript abundance were rapid, occurring within the first 15 to 30 minutes following introduction of inositol. Analysis of changes in lipid metabolism over the same time frame revealed rapid consumption of phosphatidic acid (PA) which was shown to interact with Opi1p and to be required for its retention in the ER (Loewen et al., 2004). Consumption of PA results in translocation of Opi1p to the nucleus and repression of phospholipid biosynthetic genes including INO1.

Cells defective in Protein Kinase C (PKC) signaling proved to be unable to adapt to growth in the absence of inositol.  Wild type cells shifted to inositol-free medium activate PKC signaling via the Mpk1p protein kinase and the Rlm1p transcription factor, upregulating a number of Rlm1p target genes.  Cells defective in PKC signaling are unable to mount this transcription response to inositol deficiency and also exhibit major changes in lipid metabolism (Nunez et al., 2008). Interruption of inositol sphingolipid synthesis was shown to trigger PKC signaling (Jesch et al, 2010)

Cells defective in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to Golgi trafficking such as the temperature sensitive sec13-1 mutant were shown to exhibit major changes in lipid metabolism upon shift to their restrictive temperature.  Specifically, these cells exhibited a rapid decrease in synthesis of phosphatidylinositol (PI), while PI synthesis in wild type cells increased at higher temperatures.  Simultaneously, sec13-1 cells increased synthesis of triacylglycerols (TAG) and other neutral lipids and accumulated lipid droplets upon shift to the restrictive temperature.  Sec13-1 cells in which structural genes for the major TAG synthases were deleted exhibited decreases in their restrictive temperatures, indicating that synthesis of TAG under conditions in which ER to Golgi trafficking is impaired is physiologically relevant (Gaspar et al., 2008).

Sourcing the best from nature for beautiful hair 
                                    Susan drew inspiration for her Natural Color Process by visiting the redwood forest of California. After returning home she began experimenting with herbs and natural ingredients to find the perfect mix for an ammonia-free color derived from nature.

For Susan Henry, one Beverly Hills’ and Hollywood’s top colorists, a walk through California’s Redwood forests with her daughter was a welcome respite as she recovered from the debilitating effects of ammonia poisoning. For Susan, the very tools and environment that allowed her to make the “who’s who of Hollywood” beautiful…had dramatically affected her health and brought her career to a screeching halt. Crippled with debilitating rashes, eye infections, upper respiratory infections and chronic bronchitis, life became a struggle.
 
As fate would have it, Susan’s daughter was studying botany at Humboldt State and convinced her to visit and tour the nearby redwoods forest. It was there amongst mother nature’s most impressive display of wonder that Susan was inspired to seek a natural alternative for permanent color that would last as long (if not longer) than a formula filled with ammonia and chemicals. After researching and conducting countless experiments at home in her kitchen, Susan had a breakthrough and finally achieved her goal for a “Natural Color Process”. An all-naturally derived, 100% ammonia free permanent and long lasting color with the lowest amount of PPD in the darker colors available on the market at 0.05%.
 
Today, Susan Henry’s story and color has touched the lives of tens of thousands of women who have desperately sought alternatives during pregnancy, recovering from cancer and for those who wish to achieve Beauty Without Consequence.
