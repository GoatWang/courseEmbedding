"It is like we had sought and found each other. Although the monastery Wessobrunn is based only 7 km in the head quarter's South. I have not thought about the possibility that this wonderful building with its extraordinary cultural and historical background could be up for sale once. My passion for historical buildings and my search for traditional salve receipts often led me to monasteries. I hardly could believe that this special location will be our new company's office"; Martina Gebhardt says.
