History[edit]
Company founder Samuel A. Markel formed the Mutual Casualty Association and established the Mutual Casualty Company in Norfolk, Virginia. The company headquarters later moved to Richmond, Virginia.[4] Sam Markel’s four sons, Lewis, Irvin, Stanley, and Milton, joined the growing business in the 1930s, and Markel Service, Inc. was created.[5] During this time, Markel was actively involved in efforts to develop safety and other standards aimed at legitimizing the growing bus and trucking industries. Markel also assisted in passing the National Motor Carrier Act of 1935.[4]
By the 1940s, Markel Service, Inc. earned a national following and developed a reputation for industry-leading claims adjusting and safety engineering. American Fidelity & Casualty, a sister company covering fleets of trucks and buses, also became the largest insurer of these risks in the USA.[4] In 1980, the company became an insurance carrier when Essex Insurance Company was incorporated and licensed to write excess and surplus lines business.[6] In 1986, the Markel Corporation was listed on the NASDAQ exchange, with an IPO offered at $8.33 per share. The company’s trading was moved to the NYSE in 1997.[7] Markel gained access to specialty international markets in 2000, when Terra Nova Holdings, Ltd. was acquired and the [London] office opened.[8] Branch offices later opened in the UK, Europe, Asia Pacific, and Canada. With a “permanent capital” investing approach, Markel Ventures acquired AMF Bakery Systems in 2005 and continued to acquire other varied and scalable businesses.[4] With the $3.1 billion acquisition of Alterra Capital Holdings Limited, Markel added two additional insurance divisions, Markel Global and Markel Reinsurance.[9] In 2015, Markel acquired Bermuda-based CATCo, a specialist investment management business; and Markel Ventures announced a majority interest in CapTech.[10]
Today, the company is led by Executive Chairman Alan I. Kirshner,[11] who is one of the authors of the Markel Style.

History[edit]
Company founder Samuel A. Markel formed the Mutual Casualty Association and established the Mutual Casualty Company in Norfolk, Virginia. The company headquarters later moved to Richmond, Virginia.[4] Sam Markel’s four sons, Lewis, Irvin, Stanley, and Milton, joined the growing business in the 1930s, and Markel Service, Inc. was created.[5] During this time, Markel was actively involved in efforts to develop safety and other standards aimed at legitimizing the growing bus and trucking industries. Markel also assisted in passing the National Motor Carrier Act of 1935.[4]
By the 1940s, Markel Service, Inc. earned a national following and developed a reputation for industry-leading claims adjusting and safety engineering. American Fidelity & Casualty, a sister company covering fleets of trucks and buses, also became the largest insurer of these risks in the USA.[4] In 1980, the company became an insurance carrier when Essex Insurance Company was incorporated and licensed to write excess and surplus lines business.[6] In 1986, the Markel Corporation was listed on the NASDAQ exchange, with an IPO offered at $8.33 per share. The company’s trading was moved to the NYSE in 1997.[7] Markel gained access to specialty international markets in 2000, when Terra Nova Holdings, Ltd. was acquired and the [London] office opened.[8] Branch offices later opened in the UK, Europe, Asia Pacific, and Canada. With a “permanent capital” investing approach, Markel Ventures acquired AMF Bakery Systems in 2005 and continued to acquire other varied and scalable businesses.[4] With the $3.1 billion acquisition of Alterra Capital Holdings Limited, Markel added two additional insurance divisions, Markel Global and Markel Reinsurance.[9] In 2015, Markel acquired Bermuda-based CATCo, a specialist investment management business; and Markel Ventures announced a majority interest in CapTech.[10]
Today, the company is led by Executive Chairman Alan I. Kirshner,[11] who is one of the authors of the Markel Style.
Timeline[edit]
Beginning in 1930, Markel established Markel Service, a separate company to handle direct and reinsurance of AF&C.[4]
In 1951, the company expanded into Canada by founding Markel Service Canada, Ltd., headquartered in Toronto, Ontario.[4]
In 1959, the national claims division of AF&C became National Claims Service, an independent adjuster that could be contracted by other insurance firms. The Safety Engineering Division also began offering services to other firms.[4]
The company later expanded beyond truck and bus companies, led by the third generation of Markels: Anthony (Vice Chairman), Steve, and Gary.[4]
In 1980, the company founded Essex Insurance Company in Delaware. Essex began as a property insurance company in White Bear Lake, Minnesota, but later moved to Richmond, Virginia.[4]
In 1985, Prem Watsa took control of Markel Financial Holdings, a Canadian-based trucking insurance company. Near bankruptcy, Watsa determined it needed a capital injection.[4]
In December 1986, Markel Corp. held its first IPO at $8.33 per share, valuing the company at $15 million. Shares traded on the NASDAQ.[7]
In 1987, Markel reorganized Markel Financial Holdings (Canada) and renamed it Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd., short for "fair, friendly acquisitions."[4]
In December 1987, Markel Corp. acquired half of Shand Morahan & Company, an underwriter in Deerfield, Illinois.[12]
In December 1990, Markel completed its acquisition of Shand. As part of the Shand acquisition, Markel Corp. also acquired American Underwriting Managers, an insurance underwriter in Pewaukee, Wisconsin specializing in personal boat and motorcycle insurance.[12]
In 1989, Markel Corp. acquired the Rhulen Agency of Monticello, New York. Rhulen is a specialty insurer for children's summer camps and youth organizations. Rhulen was later moved to Richmond, Virginia, and renamed Markel Insurance Company.[4]
In the Spring of 1997, Markel Corp. trading moved to the NYSE.[7]
In January 2000, Markel Corp. founded Markel Southwest Underwriters in Scottsdale, Arizona after buying the Arizona policies of Acceptance Insurance Company.[13]
In March 2000, Markel Corp. completed the acquisition of Terra Nova (Bermuda) Holdings Ltd.[8]
In October 2009, Elliott Special Risks LP (ESR) was purchased by Markel International, a London-based specialty property and casualty insurer that runs the international operations of Markel Corp.[14]
On May 10, 2010, at the Markel Corp. Annual Meeting, it was reported there would be a new management structure approved by the Board. Alan I. Kirshner would remain Chairman and Chief Executive Officer while Anthony F. Markel and Steven A. Markel would still serve as Vice Chairman. Reporting to them would be a three-member Office of the President. Thomas S. Gayner became President and Chief Investment Officer, while Richard R. Whitt, III and F. Michael Crowley became President and Co-Chief Operating Officers.[15]
In July 2010, Markel Corp. acquired Aspen Holdings, Inc. of Omaha, Nebraska.[16]
In April 2011, Markel (UK) Limited launched Markel Direct, an online direct to customer distribution channel for specialist insurance.[17]
On January 4, 2012, Markel Corp. completed the acquisition of Thompson Insurance Enterprises, a privately held program administrator underwriting multi-line, industry-focused insurance programs.[18]
In February 2012, Markel's Camp Insurance Program joined forces with CampDoc.com, an electronic health record system for camps, to help summer camps reduce risk and liability and to ensure the health and safety of kids while at camp.[19]
In June 2012, Markel Direct expanded product range into charity and community group risks.
In October 2012, Markel purchased Essentia Insurance Company.[20]
On May 1, 2013, Markel Corporation completed its acquisition of Alterra Capital Holdings Limited.[21]
On December 17, 2013, the Essentia Insurance Company (Essentia) was rated as "A2" by Moody’s Investor Service.[22]
In June 2016, it was announced that Markel had joined the Fortune 500 for the first time.[23]

Markel operates in Excess and Surplus Lines, Specialty Admitted, and London markets. Sam Markel launched Markel in 1930. Markel Service was formed to be a separate, nationwide service organization to take care of both the direct and reinsured business of American Fidelity & Casualty. Nowadays, with $1.98 Billion in gross written premiums and  $105 Million yearly in net income, it's one of the biggest companies in the property & casualty insurance industry. Markel is investing its float in the stock market just like Warren Buffett’s Berkshire.  Thomas Gayner has been the head of Markel Gayner Asset Management (Markel’s investment division) since 1990. He has been also chief investment officer of Markel since 2004. Gayner graduated from the University of Virginia Mcintire School of commerce in 1983. Gayner follows the value investing principles of Warren Buffett and Benjamin Graham. Gayner stated in an interview with Morningstar that the businesses he seeks should have:  A demonstrated record of profitability and good returns on total capital; High measures of talent and integrity in management; Favorable reinvestment dynamics over time; and A purchase price that is fair or better.  Markel's equity portfolio returned 11.1% annually between 2000 and 2009. One of the longest term investments of Markel is American Express (NYSE:AXP).  In the last 18 years, AXP has gained 908% vs. SPY's gain of 318%.

During the last quarter of 2010, he bought 23 new stocks and sold out only three positions, Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), Enterprise GP Holdings (NYSE:EPE), Nestle ADR (OTCPK:NSRGY).  Here are the 10 largest new stock picks:

His two best performing positions are DIS and KMX. KMX is one of the Roberto’s Mignone’s new stock picks during the last quarter of 2010. The biggest drag on Tom Gayner’s recent performance is the decline in UBSH.   Top Ten Long Term   Holdings in Last 3 Years   Stock Value in Millions   (USD)             As of Dec 31, 2010 Return             Since Feb 15, 2008   Carmax (KMX) 166.4 89.88%   Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd (OTCPK:FRFHF) 114.5 28.55%   Berkshire Hathaway, Inc.

Gayner’s largest investment over the last three years is Carmax. Carmax has returned almost 90% since February 2008, beating the market by a large margin. Thomas Steyer's Farallon and Richard Perry's Perry Capital recently initiated large positions in Home Depot. Gayner’s largest long term holdings have gained 25.06% since February 2010. Considering SPY’s 4.72% return, Gayner's long term picks are extremely successful. This underlines Gayners talent in picking long term winners.

Analysis of Guru Companies - Tom Gayner, Markel Corp


April 11, 2014, 07:05:31 PM EDT
By Chris Mydlo, GuruFocus

Of the guru companies discussed,
Tom Gayner

of Markel (
MKL

) is the last one of the series. Previously I have written about
Warren Buffett

(
Trades

, Portfolio)'s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A), Carl Icahn (Trades,
Portfolio)'s Icahn Enterprises (
IEP

), Ian Cumming (Trades, Portfolio)'s Leucadia National (
LUK

), Prem Watsa (Trades, Portfolio)'s Fairfax Financial (TSX:FFH)(
FRFHF

), and Jim Tisch's Loews Corp (
L

).



The Guru




Tom Gayner (Trades, Portfolio) is the executive vice president and
chief investment officer of Markel Corp. He has been president
since 2010 and CIO since 2001. He has also been the president of
the investment subsidiary Markel Gayner Asset Management Corp.
since 1990.

He started out as a CPA at Price Waterhouse after graduating from
the University of Virginia. As he got into accounting, he realized
that he was more interested in dollars than numbers. He later
became a 
stock
broker

at a local investment firm called Davenport and Company of
Virginia. As a research analyst, he covered local companies in
Virginia and North Carolina. Gayner met Steve Markel while covering
his company from 1986 to 1990. Steve Markel was managing the
investments himself and decided that he would like to have Gayner
help him out. Gayner has been helping out ever since.




When it comes to books that influenced him, at the top of the list
is Graham and Dodd's "Security Analysis" and Graham's "The
Intelligent Investor." His next tier of books is what he calls
human nature books. What makes people tick? Why do people do things
they do? His favorite author is Mark Twain. He says that you should
read it with the sense that Mark Twain was broke and rich, and
broke and rich, several times in his life, so there's a subtext of
money, finance, investing and behavior that underlies Mark Twain's
work.




In Markel's 2005 letter to shareholders, Gayner gave the following
statement on his investment philosophy:




"We have invested for many years following a four-part though
process to select and manage our equity positions. Namely, we look
for profitable businesses with good returns on capital, management
teams with equal measures of talent and integrity, reinvestment
opportunities and capital discipline, and reasonable prices."




You can read GuruFocus' interview with Tom Gayner at GuruFocus.



The Company




Markel Corporation (
MKL

) was founded in 1930 by Samuel A Markel. He had two sets of twin
brothers that join him in the venture. Currently the company
underwrites customized insurance products. The insurance segments
include Markel Wholesale, Global Insurance, Markel Specialty,
Global Reinsurance and Markel International. In 2013 Markel nearly
doubled the size of its insurance operations by acquiring Alterra.
Markel insurance business had a combined ratio of 97 percent,
including 8 points of underwriting loss from Alterra in 2013. The
industry average was 98 percent for 2013. A combined ratio of less
than 100 percent indicates an underwriting profit. The combined
ratio is of big importance to Markel. If it is below 100, the float
essentially becomes an interest free loan to invest with.




The subsidiary, Markel Ventures, makes strategic investments in
companies outside of the insurance marketplace. It currently
includes 14 different businesses in the sectors of manufacturing,
consumer, healthcare, business services, and financial services.
These companies are all private.




The company currently has a $2 billion insurance float. According
to GuruFocus' interview with Gayner in 2012, Markel does not invest
as much of its float into equities as Berkshire Hathaway does. Tom
Gayner (Trades, Portfolio) gave the following comment:




"Berkshire has a much bigger balance sheet than Markel and a much
bigger base of equity compared to its insurance liabilities than we
do. As such, they can allocate more of the investment portfolio
towards equities. Over time, if we continue to grow and build up
our equity capital we should be able to move in the same direction
as Berkshire."

      shares










Conclusion




Of the guru companies, Markel seems to be the most similar to
Berkshire Hathaway in structure. Markel has a market cap of only
$8.6 billion and has much more room to grow than Berkshire with a
market cap of $302 billion. Since Markel's IPO in 1986 it has grown
its book value at a faster rate than Berkshire. Berkshire said the
following in its most recent 10-K:




"Because of the large size of our capital base (shareholders'
equity of approximately $222 billion as of December 31, 2013), our
book value per share will very likely
not

increase in the future at a rate even close to its past rate."




While Markel book value per share is increasing at a high rate, the
stock is still trading at a 6.5 percent discount to Berkshire
Hathaway's price-to-book value. Historically Markel has traded at a
median P/B of 1.7. Over the past 10 years its median P/B has been
slightly higher than 1.5. The P/B is currently at 1.30. The stock
would be valued at $728.80 if it traded at it 10-year median P/B.
The stock closed at $606.53 today, April 11, 2014. Therefore, the
stock is undervalued by 16.8 percent.

Michael Crowley, PresidentWebsitewww.markelcorp.comMarkel Corporation (NYSE – MKL) is a holding company for insurance, reinsurance, and investment operations around the world.[1] Headquartered in Richmond, Virginia and founded in 1930, Markel reports its ongoing underwriting operations in three segments, and products originate from four insurance divisions and one reinsurance division.[2] Through Markel Ventures, they allocate capital to invest in opportunities outside of insurance.[3]Contents1 History1.1 Timeline2 Markel Lines of Business2.1 Insurance2.1.1 Markel Specialty2.1.2 Markel Global2.1.3 Markel Wholesale2.1.4 Markel International2.2 Reinsurance2.2.1 Markel Global Reinsurance2.3 ILS Management2.3.1 Markel CATCo2.4 Non-Insurance Businesses2.4.1 Markel Ventures2.4.2 Abbey Protection PLC - United Kingdom3 Office Locations4 Companies5 Markel-Gayner Asset Management Corp6 Further reading7 References8 Regulatory FilingsHistoryCompany founder Samuel A. Markel formed the Mutual Casualty Association and established the Mutual Casualty Company in Norfolk, Virginia. The company headquarters later moved to Richmond, Virginia.[4] Sam Markel’s four sons, Lewis, Irvin, Stanley, and Milton, joined the growing business in the 1930s, and Markel Service, Inc. was created.[5] During this time, Markel was actively involved in efforts to develop safety and other standards aimed at legitimizing the growing bus and trucking industries. Markel also assisted in passing the National Motor Carrier Act of 1935.[4]By the 1940s, Markel Service, Inc. earned a national following and developed a reputation for industry-leading claims adjusting and safety engineering. American Fidelity & Casualty, a sister company covering fleets of trucks and buses, also became the largest insurer of these risks in the USA.[4] In 1980, the company became an insurance carrier when Essex Insurance Company was incorporated and licensed to write excess and surplus lines business.[6] In 1986, the Markel Corporation was listed on the NASDAQ exchange, with an IPO offered at $8.33 per share. The company’s trading was moved to the NYSE in 1997.[7] Markel gained access to specialty international markets in 2000, when Terra Nova Holdings, Ltd. was acquired and the [London] office opened.[8] Branch offices later opened in the UK, Europe, Asia Pacific, and Canada. With a “permanent capital” investing approach, Markel Ventures acquired AMF Bakery Systems in 2005 and continued to acquire other varied and scalable businesses.[4] With the $3.1 billion acquisition of Alterra Capital Holdings Limited, Markel added two additional insurance divisions, Markel Global and Markel Reinsurance.[9] In 2015, Markel acquired Bermuda-based CATCo, a specialist investment management business; and Markel Ventures announced a majority interest in CapTech.[10]Today, the company is led by Executive Chairman Alan I. Kirshner,[11] who is one of the authors of the Markel Style.TimelineBeginning in 1930, Markel established Markel Service, a separate company to handle direct and reinsurance of AF&C.[4]In 1951, the company expanded into Canada by founding Markel Service Canada, Ltd., headquartered in Toronto, Ontario.[4]In 1959, the national claims division of AF&C became National Claims Service, an independent adjuster that could be contracted by other insurance firms. The Safety Engineering Division also began offering services to other firms.[4]The company later expanded beyond truck and bus companies, led by the third generation of Markels: Anthony (Vice Chairman), Steve, and Gary.[4]In 1980, the company founded Essex Insurance Company in Delaware. Essex began as a property insurance company in White Bear Lake, Minnesota, but later moved to Richmond, Virginia.[4]In 1985, Prem Watsa took control of Markel Financial Holdings, a Canadian-based trucking insurance company. Near bankruptcy, Watsa determined it needed a capital injection.[4]In December 1986, Markel Corp. held its first IPO at $8.33 per share, valuing the company at $15 million. Shares traded on the NASDAQ.[7]In 1987, Markel reorganized Markel Financial Holdings (Canada) and renamed it Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd., short for "fair, friendly acquisitions."[4]In December 1987, Markel Corp. acquired half of Shand Morahan & Company, an underwriter in Deerfield, Illinois.[12]In December 1990, Markel completed its acquisition of Shand. As part of the Shand acquisition, Markel Corp. also acquired American Underwriting Managers, an insurance underwriter in Pewaukee, Wisconsin specializing in personal boat and motorcycle insurance.[12]In 1989, Markel Corp. acquired the Rhulen Agency of Monticello, New York. Rhulen is a specialty insurer for children's summer camps and youth organizations. Rhulen was later moved to Richmond, Virginia, and renamed Markel Insurance Company.[4]In the Spring of 1997, Markel Corp. trading moved to the NYSE.[7]In January 2000, Markel Corp. founded Markel Southwest Underwriters in Scottsdale, Arizona after buying the Arizona policies of Acceptance Insurance Company.[13]In March 2000, Markel Corp. completed the acquisition of Terra Nova (Bermuda) Holdings Ltd.[8]In October 2009, Elliott Special Risks LP (ESR) was purchased by Markel International, a London-based specialty property and casualty insurer that runs the international operations of Markel Corp.[14]On May 10, 2010, at the Markel Corp. Annual Meeting, it was reported there would be a new management structure approved by the Board. Alan I. Kirshner would remain Chairman and Chief Executive Officer while Anthony F.
