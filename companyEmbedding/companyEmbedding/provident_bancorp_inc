AMESBURY, Mass., Jan. 26, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Provident Bancorp, Inc. (Nasdaq Capital Market: PVBC) (the "Company") today announced that its Board of Directors has adopted a stock repurchase program.  Under the repurchase program, the Company may repurchase up to 625,015 shares of its common stock, or approximately 6.6% of the current outstanding shares.  This amount represents the number of shares authorized for issuance pursuant to grants of stock options and restricted stock under the Company's recent adopted equity incentive plan.








Repurchases will be made no sooner than the termination of the Company's regular quarterly trading blackout after the Company publicly releases its results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016, and consistent with the Company's trading policies. 
The repurchase program was adopted following the receipt of non-objection from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, and in compliance with applicable state and federal regulations.  As noted in the Company's prospectus for its stock offering completed in 2015, Massachusetts regulations restrict stock repurchases during the first three years following the completion of the stock offering except to fund stock benefit plans, or except in amounts not greater than 5% of the outstanding shares of common stock where compelling and valid business reasons are established to the satisfaction of the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks.
The repurchase program permits shares to be repurchased in open market or private transactions, through block trades, and pursuant to any trading plan that may be adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Repurchases will be made at management's discretion at prices management considers to be attractive and in the best interests of both the Company and its stockholders, subject to the availability of stock, general market conditions, the trading price of the stock, alternative uses for capital, and the Company's financial performance.  Open market purchases will be conducted in accordance with the limitations set forth in Rule 10b-18 of the Securities and Exchange Commission and other applicable legal requirements. 
The repurchase program may be suspended, terminated or modified at any time for any reason, including market conditions, the cost of repurchasing shares, the availability of alternative investment opportunities, liquidity, and other factors deemed appropriate. These factors may also affect the timing and amount of share repurchases.  The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to purchase any particular number of shares.

AMESBURY, Mass., Oct. 20, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Provident Bancorp, Inc. (the "Company") (NasdaqCM: PVBC), the holding company for The Provident Bank (the "Bank"), reported net income attributable to common shareholders for the three months ended September 30, 2016 of $1.8 million, or $.19 per share, compared to $86,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Net income attributable to common shareholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $4.6 million, or $.50 per share, compared to $2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Provident Bancorp, Inc. started publicly trading on July 15, 2015 and, as a result, earnings per share are not applicable for the 2015 periods presented.








David P. Mansfield, Chief Executive Officer, said, "This earnings report reflects our continued focus on being an innovative commercial bank leader.  We are committed to strengthening the economic development of the regions we serve, by working closely with our small-to medium sized business customers and delivering superior customized solutions, products and services to meet their banking needs; and by establishing and supporting valuable partnerships with economic drivers in our markets."
Net interest income before provision for loan losses increased by $832,000, or 14.1%, compared to the third quarter of 2015 and increased by $2.2 million, or 13.0%, compared to the nine months ending September 30, 2015. The growth in net interest income this quarter over the prior year's third quarter is primarily the result of an increase in our average interest earning assets of $54.8 million or 8.2% and an increase in net interest margin of 19 basis points to 3.72% for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The growth in net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended in the same period 2015 is primarily the result of an increase in average interest earning assets of $65.4 million or 10.2% and an increase of the net interest margin of 9 basis points to 3.64% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.
Provision for loan losses of $163,000 were booked for the third quarter of 2016 compared to $174,000 for the same period 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 $484,000 of provisions were recognized compared to $645,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The provisions were primarily due to an increase in our loan portfolio as we apply historical loss ratios to newly originated loans, which, absent other factors, results in an increase in the allowance for loan losses as the loan portfolio increases. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.40% as of September 30, 2016 compared to 1.46% as of September 30, 2015. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of non-performing loans was 590.56% as of September 30, 2016 compared to 249.97% as of September 30, 2015. Non-performing assets were $1.4 million or 0.18% to total assets as of September 30, 2016 compared to $3.1 million or 0.44% to total asset for the same period 2015. 
Non-interest income increased $203,000, or 17.5% to $1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, non-interest income increased $422,000, or 14.8%, to $3.3 million. The primary reasons for the increases in both periods presented are due to the increased gains on sales of securities and income from our bank owned life insurance policies (BOLI). Additional purchases of BOLI were made during the second half of 2015. 
Non-interest expense decreased $1.7 million, or 24.1% to $5.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, non-interest expense decreased $1.0 million or 6.2% to $15.2 million. The primary reason for the decrease is the $2.2 million funding of the Bank's charitable foundation in the third quarter of 2015.  The decrease was partially offset by increases in salary expense and professional fees. Increases in salary and employee benefits were $203,000 or 6.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and $819,000 or 9.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Increases in professional fees were $81,000 or 37.3% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and $214,000 or 32.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.
As of September 30, 2016 total assets have increased $24.8 million, or 3.34% to $768.2 million compared to $743.4 million at December 31, 2015. The primary reason for the increase is due to net loans with an increase of $34.4 million or 6.2%. The increase in loans is offset by a net decrease in investments of $10.1 million or 8.1%. On May 31, 2016 the Company transferred all of its held-to-maturity securities to available-for-sale. The cost basis transferred was $44.2 million with an unrealized net gain of $2.2 million. The reason for the transfer was for liquidity management. Deposits were $610.3 million as of September 30, 2016 representing an increase of $33.1 million or 5.7% compared to December 31, 2015. Borrowings decreased $16.0 million or 27.8% to $41.5 million as of September 30, 2016.
As of September 30, 2016, shareholders' equity was $108.3 million compared to $101.4 million at December 31, 2015 representing an increase of $6.9 million, or 6.8%. The increases are primarily due to year-to-date net income of $4.6 million and an increase in other comprehensive income of $2.1 million, which includes the $1.3 million net unrealized gain from transferring the securities.

Zacks Rank:



 




Style Scores:



NA Value | NA Growth | NA Momentum | NA VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Including the Zacks Rank, Zacks Industry Rank, Style Scores, the Price, Consensus & Surprise chart, graphical estimate analysis and how a stocks stacks up to its peers.
The detailed multi-page Analyst report does an even deeper dive on the company's vital statistics. In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
