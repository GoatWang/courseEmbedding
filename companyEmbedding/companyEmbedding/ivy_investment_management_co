Market Perspectives

 
How to strike the right balance in high yield bonds

 




05.22.17 
















Strong 2016 performance and a sharp rally in credit spreads have prompted some investors to
take a cautious view of high yield bonds. However, we believe this asset class remains attractive as part of
a fixed income allocation, particularly as the US Federal Reserve looks to raise interest rates. The key is to
	approach the asset class thoughtfully.
The Market is changing
The surprise election of Donald Trump was a
game changer. While many details of this new
administration are still uncertain, the general
direction is clear. The positives of pro-growth tax
cuts, regulatory rollback, and infrastructure spending
have to be weighed against a deleterious impact on
global trade. Monetary policy remains generally
accommodative. However, a shift in the Fed’s “dot
plots” and more hawkish rhetoric from many Federal
Open Market Committee (FOMC) members could
indicate a path to higher Treasury rates that is not
	as far off as recently thought.





Why consider high yield?
As the Fed plans to embark on its next interest
rate tightening cycle, investors in traditional fixed
income assets are bracing for a prolonged period of
underperformance. Zero-interest-rate policy over the last
several years has left many core fixed income portfolios
with little yield cushion to absorb rising benchmark rates.
Duration risk for bellwether core benchmarks, such as the
Bloomberg Barclays US Aggregate Index, has also drifted
steadily higher. The result is that portfolios overexposed
to highly interest-rate-sensitive segments, such as U.S.
Treasuries, U.S. agency bonds, and mortgage-backed
securities, may be even more vulnerable to principal
	losses than they were during past rate hike cycles.
As cycle change, risks change
To help diversify portfolio duration risk and strengthen
yield curve positioning, investors may consider a high yield
bond allocation. Credit spreads are still more than double
those of investment-grade corporates and mortgage-backed
securities, with far less interest rate sensitivity than either of
	these segments.1 Moreover, earnings estimates among the
high yield issuer base are indicating marked improvement in
2017 as companies get a double benefit from the improving
domestic economy and the potential boost of the domesticfocused
fiscal policy of the new administration. Further,
high yield default rates should begin to fall aggressively in
the second half of 2017 to a more typical 3% – 4% range,
	due to an improved backdrop for commodity-related credits.
However, solid fundamentals are largely reflected in
valuations across all asset classes. While default rates are
forecasted to trend lower, valuations leave little cushion to
absorb periods of heightened volatility. Given the policy
uncertainty related to the new Trump administration, a
busy 2017 election calendar in Europe, and the prospect
		of a more active Fed, some vigilance is warranted.
High Yield Bond Spreads Have Tended
	to Absorb Most Treasury Increases

12/31/2016. For illustrative purposes only. We are not soliciting or recommending any action based on this
material. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Any views represent the opinion of the manager
and are subject to change.
High yield bonds have prevailed in past rate hike cycles
To illustrate the impact of U.S. Treasury yield increases on
high-yield bonds, consider how the asset class has performed
during previous periods when five-year U.S. Treasury
yields increased 70 basis points or more in three months.
We examined each of these occurrences over the past 25
years. High yield bond spreads absorbed 80% – 100% of
the U.S. Treasury yield increase, with returns moderately
affected during the period of interest rate volatility. Positive
returns resumed as rate volatility typically abated over
the subsequent three-month period. Consider the fourth
quarter of 2016, when the yield-to-maturity on the five-year
Treasury note rose from 1.15% to 1.92%, a difference of 77
basis points. During this period, high yield absorbed this
Treasury move as spreads rallied 71 basis points, which
	provided for a total return of 1.75%.
Higher Rated High Yield Credits
Have Delivered Better Risk-Adjusted Returns

Sharpe Ratio: a measure that indicates the average return minus the risk-free return divided by the
standard deviation of return on an investment. Standard deviation: a measure of the degree to which a
fund’s return varies from its previous returns or from the average of all similar funds, generally expressed
as a percentage. The larger the standard deviation, the greater the likelihood (and risk) that a security’s
performance will fluctuate from the average return. The larger the standard deviation, the greater the
likelihood (and risk) that a security’s performance will fluctuate from the average return. Ratings shown
are the middle ratings of Moody’s, Fitch and S&P combined, as compiled by Bloomberg Barclays.
Why manager style and size have become increasingly important
As rates begin to normalize over the next several years, we
expect security selection and alpha to play a much greater
role in high yield bond portfolio returns than sector rotation
and beta. The added gains and downside protection a
skilled manager can deliver can be considerable, in terms
of capturing both opportunistic capital appreciation and
greater compounding opportunities through consistently
	higher income generation.
To help assess an investment manager’s ability to deliver
	stable alpha and limit default loss, investors can evaluate:
Whether the investment process is disciplined and
repeatable. Securing steady outperformance in high yield
requires a consistent investment process that properly
balances risk and return. Managers should have consistent
track records of being appropriately compensated for the
	portfolio’s credit risk.
The manager’s experience across full credit cycles.
Understanding when and how to shift portfolio risk as the
credit cycle evolves can be crucial. Managers should have
proven experience navigating both favorable and difficult
	past markets.
Overall, we believe the case for including high yield bonds
in a fixed income portfolio remains compelling due to better
	resilience in the face of rising interest rates.

Past performance is not a guarantee of future results. The opinions expressed are those of Ivy Investment Management Company and PineBridge Investments and are not meant as investment advice or to predict or
	project the future performance of any investment product. The opinions are current through May 2017, are subject to change at any time based on market and other current conditions, and no forecasts can be guaranteed.
Risk factors: The value of the Fund’s shares will change, and you could lose money on your investment. An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fixed income securities are subject to interest rate risk and, as such, the net asset value of the Fund may fall as interest rates rise. Investing in below investment
grade securities may carry a greater risk of nonpayment of interest or principal than higher-rated bonds. International investing involves additional risks including currency fluctuations, political or economic conditions
	affecting the foreign country, and differences in accounting standards and foreign regulations. These risks are magnified in emerging markets. These and other risks are more fully described in the Fund’s prospectus.
Alpha is defined as the excess returns of a fund relative to the return of a benchmark index. Beta is defined as the measure of volatility of an investment in comparison to the market as a whole.
The Fund is managed by Ivy Investment Management Company (IICO) and subadvised by PineBridge Investments. IICO oversees the Fund’s investments and its business operations. PineBridge chooses the Fund’s
	investments and provides related advisory services.
The Bloomberg Barclays US Aggregate Bond Index is a broad-based flagship benchmark that measures the investment grade, US dollar-denominated, fixed-rate taxable bond market. The index includes Treasuries,
government-related and corporate securities, MBS (agency fixed-rate and hybrid ARM pass-throughs), ABS and CMBS (agency and non-agency). The Bloomberg Barclays US Corporate High Yield Bond Index measures the
USD-denominated, high yield, fixed-rate corporate bond market. Securities are classified as high yield if the middle rating of Moody’s, Fitch and S&P is Ba1/BB+/BB+ or below. Bonds from issuers with an emerging markets
	country of risk, based on Barclays EM country definition, are excluded. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.

in a fixed income portfolio remains compelling due to better

Risk factors: The value of the Fund’s shares will change, and you could lose money on your investment. An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fixed income securities are subject to interest rate risk and, as such, the net asset value of the Fund may fall as interest rates rise. Investing in below investment
grade securities may carry a greater risk of nonpayment of interest or principal than higher-rated bonds. International investing involves additional risks including currency fluctuations, political or economic conditions
	affecting the foreign country, and differences in accounting standards and foreign regulations. These risks are magnified in emerging markets. These and other risks are more fully described in the Fund’s prospectus.
Alpha is defined as the excess returns of a fund relative to the return of a benchmark index. Beta is defined as the measure of volatility of an investment in comparison to the market as a whole.

USD-denominated, high yield, fixed-rate corporate bond market. Securities are classified as high yield if the middle rating of Moody’s, Fitch and S&P is Ba1/BB+/BB+ or below. Bonds from issuers with an emerging markets
	country of risk, based on Barclays EM country definition, are excluded. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.

A new particle accelerator unveiled at CERN, the European physics research center, is expected to spawn portable accelerators that could help doctors treat cancer patients and experts analyze artwork, according to Reuters.
CERN is gradually upgrading its hardware to get more data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), its 27-km (17-mile) circular accelerator that smashes protons together at almost the speed of light to probe basic questions about the universe.
Its latest upgrade, resembling a 90-meter oil pipeline hooked up to a life support machine, replaces the 39-year-old injector that produces the flow of particles for the LHC. CERN miniaturized the previous technology and saw many potential uses.
“It’s a brave new world of applications,” said project leader Maurizio Vretenar.
CERN has already built a version to treat tumors with particle beams and licensed the patent to ADAM, a CERN spin-off owned by Advanced Oncotherapy. Another medical use is to create isotopes for diagnosing cancers. Since isotopes decay rapidly, they normally have to be rushed to patients just in time to be used.
“With our portable technology, isotopes could be made inside the hospital already,” Vretenar said.
The next goal is a one-meter prototype weighing about 100 kgs, with which museums could analyze paintings and jewelry. The bulk of funding for the project came in a few weeks ago.
“We are building something portable. We already have a collaboration with the Louvre, and with the Italians at Florence at the Italian institute for conservation of artworks,” said Vretenar.
The Louvre in Paris is the only museum in the world that already has an accelerator, and when it is closed on Tuesdays, artifacts are taken down to the basement for analysis.

 Generation Edge enters the workplace

         GenLink, Traditionalist, Baby Boomer, Generation X, Millennial, Generation Edge    



Over the past decade, educators, employers, researchers and marketers have spent significant time
and resources dissecting the Millennial mindset. But the generational limelight is beginning to
shift as members of the youngest generation, Generation Edge, start trickling into the workplace.
Meet Generation Edge (also known as Generation Z): Born after 1995, they are true digital natives
and look to be just as — if not more — influential than their Millennial predecessors. As members
	of this up-and-coming generation enter their formative years, explore what makes them unique.
Their parents
While Millennials were mostly raised by idealistic
Boomer parents during the self-esteem movement,
many Edgers are parented by a very different
	generation — Generation X.
Generation X came of age during the emergence of
24-hour media and tabloid journalism. In adulthood,
Xers were in the wrong place at the wrong time. They
entered the job market as the dot-com bubble burst
	and purchased houses just before the Great Recession.
Gen Xers have been through a lot, and are
determined to make sure their kids are better off.
Xers are encouraging independent thinking and
competition in their Edger children. Consequently,
Edgers are showing themselves to be a realistic and
	practical generation.
Gen Edge influencers (thus far)
If you think Millennials are tech-savvy… well, just
wait. Edgers are vastly more adept in the digital
world. While Millennials grew up with clunky gaming
systems and pixelated graphics, most Edgers can’t
recall a time without touch-screens and motionsensing
gaming. Millennials remember dial-up
internet; Edgers grew up with ubiquitous WiFi, have
high expectations around technology and will expect
the world to keep up. Technology, however, is only the
	beginning of the Edger story.
For such a young generation, Gen Edgers have seen
their fair share of tragedy. They watched as the
country was rocked by terrorism. They worried as
their parents fought to keep their homes during the
Great Recession. They’ve developed a tough shell to
protect themselves from cyberbullying. Social media
is teaching them that they can’t trust politicians or
even law enforcement. And the first election in which
Gen Edgers were eligible to vote? Clinton v. Trump —
a race that will go down in history as one of the most
	contentious and divisive elections ever.
Gen Edgers witnessed some truly dire events, but have
also looked on as we’ve made some inspiring changes
in the fabric of our culture. They’ve watched as Barack
Obama became the first African-American president,
seen same-sex marriage legalized, and have followed
along (if not participated) as the fight for women’s
rights marches on. All of which are astonishing
	changes from the status quo of previous generations.
The Edger persona
Dollars and Cents — Understandably, 46% of
Edgers are concerned about college debt1, but
instead of worrying about it, they’re saving for it.
Edgers prefer to save money rather than spend it
immediately. While Millennials try to be careful
with their money, Edgers take frugality even further.
They care about more than just the price tag and
a coupon. They want to get the best value for their
money; they want to know about additional services
that might come with their purchases. These
qualities, at such a young age, hint to a financially-conscious
generation, which isn’t altogether
surprising considering the financial hardships their
Xer parents survived. Since Xers didn’t experience
the American Dream like Boomers did, Xer parents
are giving their children the practical and savvy
	tools to be successful in an unfair world.
Adulting as Teens — While the oldest Edgers
have graduated college, this is mostly a teenage
generation — albeit one that’s already thinking a
lot about their lives as adults. Sixty-one percent of
Edgers have already begun saving for their future2,
and many of today’s students are concerned about
finding a job once they graduate college.3 Still, they
remain optimistic about their careers; 32% aspire
to be in their dream job in 10 years.4 These highreaching
Edgers want to dive into opportunities
for career growth as soon as possible. Gen Edgers
expect professional development in their first jobs.
If companies play their cards right, they can avoid
the job-hopping phenomenon so prevalent among
Millennials by offering Edgers continual training
and providing ample professional development.
These types of engagement will be important for
		retaining Edgers.
All-Knowing — Edgers have grown up with
unlimited, instantaneous access to information.
They expect to have a constant connection to their
peers and families across multiple platforms, they
can and will fact-check anything — and they’re more
than willing to research companies and people.
They already know whether or not a new line of
skin-care products is truly “all natural,” they’re
proud of their favorite clothing brand’s nonprofit
engagements, and they read all about prominent
business scandals. While this can be intimidating,
don’t let it be. For an Edger, it’s a breath of fresh air
when a company has easily-accessible information
		that isn’t trying to hide anything.What this might mean for the workforce
Many Gen Edgers are still in their formative years,
but we can already guess some of the traits they
might bring with them to the workplace. They are
technologically fluent, self-reliant and pragmatic.
They’ll be the first to master a new web technology
and start seamlessly integrating it into their daily
routines… but probably won’t want to be viewed as
the new in-house IT and digital specialists (if it’s not
	in their job description).
Having picked up a thing or two from their
Xer parents, Edgers will lean more towards
independence and self-reliance than Millennials.
They won’t jump at opportunities to collaborate
because they’ll be too busy worrying about getting
their work done. When they do collaborate, they’ll
rely on virtual tools that don’t require being in the
	same room as their colleagues.
Gen Edgers will also be practical about goals
and limitations and determined to see projects
through to completion in the most efficient way
possible. They’ll try to stay on top of their workloads
through multitasking and smart use of processes
and technology, and they’ll bring a realistic and
	disciplined perspective to the workforce.
While Generation Edgers are still defining their generational identity, you can plan on seeing
some stark differences to Millennials. Their entry to the working world will stir up the generational
workplace and might cause some clashes at times with a Millennial-dominated environment.
Through all this speculation, one thing remains unarguably true — Gen Edge will usher in a whole
new set of skills, values, and perspectives. They’ll add a fresh dollop of generational diversity, and
	present a challenge, but also an opportunity, to those who are tuned in for the changes on the horizon.

 Generation Edge enters the workplace

         GenLink, Traditionalist, Baby Boomer, Generation X, Millennial, Generation Edge    



Over the past decade, educators, employers, researchers and marketers have spent significant time
and resources dissecting the Millennial mindset. But the generational limelight is beginning to
shift as members of the youngest generation, Generation Edge, start trickling into the workplace.
Meet Generation Edge (also known as Generation Z): Born after 1995, they are true digital natives
and look to be just as — if not more — influential than their Millennial predecessors. As members
	of this up-and-coming generation enter their formative years, explore what makes them unique.
Their parents
While Millennials were mostly raised by idealistic
Boomer parents during the self-esteem movement,
many Edgers are parented by a very different
	generation — Generation X.
Generation X came of age during the emergence of
24-hour media and tabloid journalism. In adulthood,
Xers were in the wrong place at the wrong time. They
entered the job market as the dot-com bubble burst
	and purchased houses just before the Great Recession.
Gen Xers have been through a lot, and are
determined to make sure their kids are better off.
Xers are encouraging independent thinking and
competition in their Edger children. Consequently,
Edgers are showing themselves to be a realistic and
	practical generation.
Gen Edge influencers (thus far)
If you think Millennials are tech-savvy… well, just
wait. Edgers are vastly more adept in the digital
world. While Millennials grew up with clunky gaming
systems and pixelated graphics, most Edgers can’t
recall a time without touch-screens and motionsensing
gaming. Millennials remember dial-up
internet; Edgers grew up with ubiquitous WiFi, have
high expectations around technology and will expect
the world to keep up. Technology, however, is only the
	beginning of the Edger story.
For such a young generation, Gen Edgers have seen
their fair share of tragedy. They watched as the
country was rocked by terrorism. They worried as
their parents fought to keep their homes during the
Great Recession. They’ve developed a tough shell to
protect themselves from cyberbullying. Social media
is teaching them that they can’t trust politicians or
even law enforcement. And the first election in which
Gen Edgers were eligible to vote? Clinton v. Trump —
a race that will go down in history as one of the most
	contentious and divisive elections ever.
Gen Edgers witnessed some truly dire events, but have
also looked on as we’ve made some inspiring changes
in the fabric of our culture. They’ve watched as Barack
Obama became the first African-American president,
seen same-sex marriage legalized, and have followed
along (if not participated) as the fight for women’s
rights marches on. All of which are astonishing
	changes from the status quo of previous generations.
The Edger persona
Dollars and Cents — Understandably, 46% of
Edgers are concerned about college debt1, but
instead of worrying about it, they’re saving for it.
Edgers prefer to save money rather than spend it
immediately. While Millennials try to be careful
with their money, Edgers take frugality even further.
They care about more than just the price tag and
a coupon. They want to get the best value for their
money; they want to know about additional services
that might come with their purchases. These
qualities, at such a young age, hint to a financially-conscious
generation, which isn’t altogether
surprising considering the financial hardships their
Xer parents survived. Since Xers didn’t experience
the American Dream like Boomers did, Xer parents
are giving their children the practical and savvy
	tools to be successful in an unfair world.
Adulting as Teens — While the oldest Edgers
have graduated college, this is mostly a teenage
generation — albeit one that’s already thinking a
lot about their lives as adults. Sixty-one percent of
Edgers have already begun saving for their future2,
and many of today’s students are concerned about
finding a job once they graduate college.3 Still, they
remain optimistic about their careers; 32% aspire
to be in their dream job in 10 years.4 These highreaching
Edgers want to dive into opportunities
for career growth as soon as possible. Gen Edgers
expect professional development in their first jobs.
If companies play their cards right, they can avoid
the job-hopping phenomenon so prevalent among
Millennials by offering Edgers continual training
and providing ample professional development.
These types of engagement will be important for
		retaining Edgers.
All-Knowing — Edgers have grown up with
unlimited, instantaneous access to information.
They expect to have a constant connection to their
peers and families across multiple platforms, they
can and will fact-check anything — and they’re more
than willing to research companies and people.
They already know whether or not a new line of
skin-care products is truly “all natural,” they’re
proud of their favorite clothing brand’s nonprofit
engagements, and they read all about prominent
business scandals. While this can be intimidating,
don’t let it be. For an Edger, it’s a breath of fresh air
when a company has easily-accessible information
		that isn’t trying to hide anything.What this might mean for the workforce
Many Gen Edgers are still in their formative years,
but we can already guess some of the traits they
might bring with them to the workplace. They are
technologically fluent, self-reliant and pragmatic.
They’ll be the first to master a new web technology
and start seamlessly integrating it into their daily
routines… but probably won’t want to be viewed as
the new in-house IT and digital specialists (if it’s not
	in their job description).
Having picked up a thing or two from their
Xer parents, Edgers will lean more towards
independence and self-reliance than Millennials.
They won’t jump at opportunities to collaborate
because they’ll be too busy worrying about getting
their work done. When they do collaborate, they’ll
rely on virtual tools that don’t require being in the
	same room as their colleagues.
Gen Edgers will also be practical about goals
and limitations and determined to see projects
through to completion in the most efficient way
possible. They’ll try to stay on top of their workloads
through multitasking and smart use of processes
and technology, and they’ll bring a realistic and
	disciplined perspective to the workforce.
While Generation Edgers are still defining their generational identity, you can plan on seeing
some stark differences to Millennials. Their entry to the working world will stir up the generational
workplace and might cause some clashes at times with a Millennial-dominated environment.
Through all this speculation, one thing remains unarguably true — Gen Edge will usher in a whole
new set of skills, values, and perspectives. They’ll add a fresh dollop of generational diversity, and
	present a challenge, but also an opportunity, to those who are tuned in for the changes on the horizon.

Market Perspectives

 
Geopolitical uncertainty shadows improving economic growth

 




04.27.17 
















Despite some early political setbacks for the Trump Administration, we
believe global economic growth is set to improve this year as higher commodity
prices, reasonable inventory levels and an increasing appetite for capital spending
are likely to drive the continued recovery. At the same time, political uncertainty
	could be rising across the globe.
Better economic growth
The U.S. economy was weaker than expected in the first
quarter of 2017. However, we believe the weakness is
due to some factors that will likely reverse in the second
quarter. After growing at more than 3% during the
last year, consumer spending looks to have increased
by less than 2% in the first quarter. But income growth
accelerated, which we think will lead to a recovery in
consumer spending going forward. In addition, companies
have recently indicated that capital spending plans are
improving. Based on these and other factors, we continue
to forecast U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) growth will
	average 2.5% in 2017.
The Federal Reserve (Fed) hiked the federal funds rate
by 0.25 percentage point in March. While we think the
potential for four hikes has increased, we still believe the
Fed will hike interest rates three times this year with a
pause at the December meeting. At that point, we think
the Fed is likely to cease its reinvestment of maturing
securities and allow its balance sheet to gradually shrink
	over time.
Economic data in the eurozone has been relatively robust
to start the year, driven by improving global trade coupled
with very accommodative monetary policy. We think this
backdrop is likely to continue over the course of this year,
with the European Central Bank (ECB) leaving policy
unchanged until 2018. We forecast eurozone GDP growth
will average just less than 2% in 2017. In the U.K., Prime
Minister Theresa May recently invoked Article 50 and
officially started the two-year negotiation process to leave the
European Union (EU). In an attempt to extend her party’s
parliamentary majority, May also has called for new elections
to take place in June. While we were wrong about the Brexit
vote leading to a recession in the U.K., we continue to believe
that economic growth will slow going forward. With a lack of
clarity on the final relationship between the U.K. and the EU,
companies there have no incentive to dramatically increase
capital spending or employment. In addition, the weakness
in the British pound after the Brexit vote is likely to result in
higher inflation over the course of 2017, putting pressure on
	the spending power of households.
Similar to the eurozone, economic data in Japan has
improved on the back of better global growth and easy
monetary policy, accompanied by an increase in fiscal
spending. We believe the Bank of Japan is likely to stay
extremely accommodative this year as inflation continues
	to underwhelm.
With the improvement in global trade and higher
commodity prices, we project that economic growth in
emerging markets should continue to improve. Countries
that experienced deep recessions last year, such as Brazil
and Russia, seem to be bottoming. India appears to be
recovering from the shock of demonetization, which
temporarily reduced the amount of currency in circulation.
In China, we believe better exports coupled with continued
government spending and improving corporate profits
is likely to result in sustained economic growth in the
	6.5 – 7.0% range.
Political uncertainty rising
Much has been made recently about the failure of
healthcare reform legislation in the U.S. that was
intended to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act
(“Obamacare”). Despite holding a majority in both the
House of Representatives and the Senate, the Republican
Party was unable to garner enough votes, which we found
disappointing. We think the Republican leadership will
continue to work on healthcare, but the path to success
	remains challenging.
President Donald Trump and other leaders have indicated
that tax reform will come next. While we believe the
	healthcare outcome makes tax reform less likely, Republicans must realize that failure on two major initiatives would be
devastating to their mid-term election chances in 2018. Thus,
we expect tax reform will happen in some form. We also expect
an increase in infrastructure spending in 2018, but we would
not rule out some progress on this initiative in 2017 in a bid to
“get something done.”
Elections in Europe have been a focus during the last few months.
In the Netherlands, the nationalist party failed to win enough
votes in March to gain control of the government. Elections are
	scheduled later this year in Germany and possibly Italy.
However, the main focus has been on presidential elections
in France, where candidate Marine Le Pen has continued to
campaign on a platform based around a referendum to leave
the EU. The first-round vote in France took place on April 23.
Centrist candidate Emmanual Macron and Le Pen advanced to
the second round of voting, which is scheduled for May 7. The
latest polls show Macron as the likely winner by a comfortable
margin. Given Macron’s reformist agenda, such a result is likely
to be seen as market friendly, especially if follow-up elections in
	June produce a reform-minded parliament.
We also are increasingly worried about the geopolitical
environment. Trump has recently become outspoken about
North Korea’s pursuit of its nuclear weapons program, and has
said the U.S. could act unilaterally if that country continues its
development. Any military action would be a significant concern
	for financial markets.
In addition, the recent action in Syria has resulted in an increased
probability of further problems between the U.S. and Russia. The
growing “lone wolf” terrorist attacks in Europe also could put a
	dent in confidence and economic growth.
Finally, trade and immigration policy will be watched carefully
going forward, as Trump has sounded hawkish on these issues
in the past. Any move toward trade barriers or restrictions
on immigration flows could be harmful to U.S. and global
	economic growth.
While we are optimistic on the direction of global economic
	growth in general, we will be watching these issues closely.

Market Perspectives

 
Fallen angels offer opportunity in credit market

 




04.03.17 
















In most credit cycles, the market hits a point when credit rating downgrades far exceed upgrades. This
ratings migration process can significantly impact the valuations of securities, particularly when credits are
downgraded from a rating of investment grade to high yield. Companies that go through such a downgrade
often are referred to as "fallen angels." The price dislocation that occurs as companies and sectors transition
from investment grade to high yield can present significant opportunity for experienced investors in what is
	termed a "crossover market."
Crossover market opportunity
There are several reasons the crossover market and
fallen angels have offered investors willing to accept the
additional risks the potential for excess returns. But the
forced selling that often results from these credit
	downgrades is the primary driver.

With fallen angels, many investment managers who
focus on investment grade securities have mandates
with limits based on credit ratings. In general, the
higher the credit rating, the larger the position size can
be in a specific credit. When a credit gets downgraded
to high yield, a manager invested in that security often
must reduce the position to get within the mandate’s
	limits — and that means forced selling.

In addition, the investment grade market is
approximately five times larger than the high yield
market. Forced selling thus often occurs into the much
smaller market and the resulting price often adjusts
lower as the ratings transition happens. Fallen angels
also tend to be much larger companies with more debt
outstanding when compared to companies rated high
yield, which adds to the transition challenges from a
larger to a smaller market. In general, the more
downgrades that occur over a short period of time, the
more attractive the potential opportunities become on a
		risk-reward basis.
Market factors at work now
In latter 2015 and early 2016, commodity-based sectors
(particularly energy and metals) experienced significant
pressure downward in both the equity and debt markets.
As a result, many commodity-based companies were
downgraded in 1Q2016. This resulted in the majority of
the energy and metals sectors in both investment-grade
and high yield markets experiencing extreme price
volatility. This downward pressure on bond prices was
exaggerated by the forced selling that occurred, as many
former investment-grade companies were downgraded to
	high yield (fallen angels).

To illustrate the price volatility that occurred during this
time, the average price of high yield bonds in the energy
sector according to Bloomberg Barclay indexes for the
investment-grade and high yield categories was $60 at
the end of February 2016. The investment-grade market
experienced similar pain with average price on bonds in
the energy sector at $91 per the Bloomberg Barclays
indexes. One year late at February 2017 month-end, the
same average prices were at $99 and $106 in the
Bloomberg Barclays High Yield and Bloomberg Barclays
Investment Grade indexes, respectively. It is important
to note that these prices were average prices for the
indexes; many individual names in the cross-over market
experienced more severe pricing action. Total return for
the high yield energy sector was 80% and investment grade
was 29% over the past 12 months ending February 2017.

Attractive risk-reward opportunities similar to what
occurred in the crossover energy sector over the past year
present themselves in various sectors and individual
names over the course of credit cycles. In times when
risk-reward opportunities are limited, it is generally a
prudent strategy to invest in the higher credit quality
(BBB rated credits) parts of the crossover market. In
other times, as was the case in early 2016, it definitely
	paid to be more aggressive.
Historical returns offer a guide
Although the crossover market is not widely discussed
as a distinct market, it has been recognized with its
own returns and statistics for more than 20 years. The
total return history of the crossover market compares
favorably to both higher- and lower-quality credit
	during that time.

For example, the annualized return for the crossover
market was 6.14% in 2011-2016, compared with 6.96% for high yield and 4.59% for investment grade.1 In 2009,
the last time crossover downgrades were material relative
to upgrades, the annualized return was 48.05%.2 Although
it may be unrealistic to expect a repeat of 2009’s total
return, we think the magnitude of expected downgrades in
2017 is comparable. On a risk-adjusted return basis for the
period 2011-2016 using the Sharpe Ratio, the crossover
result of 2.05 was slightly less than high yield at 2.66, but
exceeded investment grade at 0.63.3
Low correlation with interest rate moves
One way to examine the relationship between securities or
among factors is through “correlation” — a statistical
measure of how two securities move in relation to each
other. A correlation of +1 indicates the securities moved in
	lockstep through a specific time period.

Securities in the crossover market historically have
not been highly correlated to interest rate changes, as
typically has been the case with investment grade credit.
In fact, the correlation between U.S. Treasuries and
crossovers is only 0.13 since 1984, compared with 0.79
		for investment grade.

Based on this historical relationship, we believe
crossovers are not likely to be materially affected as
interest rates rise. In each of the eight years since the
onset of the global financial crisis, crossovers have not
had a single year in which they underperformed both
investment grade and high yield, based on returns in the
			Bloomberg Barclays indexes.
Pursuing the potential now
In our view, investments in the crossover market offer
the potential for higher risk-adjusted returns versus the
high yield market, without the high correlation to interest
rate changes of investment grade credit. That’s an
important consideration in the current environment,
since the U.S. Federal Reserve has begun moves taking
	interest rates higher.

History also shows that the crossover market has been
most attractive at the end of a credit cycle, when rating
dislocations were at their peak. For these reasons, we
think 2017-2018 offers a potential opportunity in the
	crossover credit market.

3The Sharpe Ratio is a measure of risk-adjusted returns used to characterize how well the return of an asset compensates the investor for the risk taken. A positive Sharpe Ratio in a fund means the returns have
	compensated investors for the risk they have taken.

Risk factors: Investment return and principal value will fluctuate and it is possible to lose money by investing. Fixed-income securities are subject to interest rate risk and, as such, the value of fixed-income securities
may fall as interest rates rise. Investing in below-investment-grade securities may carry a greater risk of nonpayment of interest or principal than higher-rated bonds. An investment in a mutual fund is not a bank
deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. These and other risks are more fully described in a fund’s prospectus. Not all funds or fund
	classes may be offered at all broker/dealers.

Highlights- Interest rates are expected to continue to rise, with as many as two more expected in 2017.- As bond markets spreads tighten, the crossover market can offer opportunity.- A “crossover credit” strategy is designed to provide exposure to both investment grade and non-investment grade fixed income securities.- By focusing on “fallen angels” and “rising stars”, the strategy looks to provide total return through a combination of high current income and capital appreciation.DownloadsFallen angels offer opportunity in credit market

In most credit cycles, the market hits a point when credit rating downgrades far exceed upgrades. This
ratings migration process can significantly impact the valuations of securities, particularly when credits are
downgraded from a rating of investment grade to high yield. Companies that go through such a downgrade
often are referred to as "fallen angels." The price dislocation that occurs as companies and sectors transition

Crossover market opportunity
There are several reasons the crossover market and
fallen angels have offered investors willing to accept the
additional risks the potential for excess returns. But the
forced selling that often results from these credit
	downgrades is the primary driver.

With fallen angels, many investment managers who
focus on investment grade securities have mandates
with limits based on credit ratings. In general, the
higher the credit rating, the larger the position size can
be in a specific credit. When a credit gets downgraded
to high yield, a manager invested in that security often
must reduce the position to get within the mandate’s
	limits — and that means forced selling.

In addition, the investment grade market is
approximately five times larger than the high yield
market. Forced selling thus often occurs into the much
smaller market and the resulting price often adjusts
lower as the ratings transition happens. Fallen angels
also tend to be much larger companies with more debt
outstanding when compared to companies rated high
yield, which adds to the transition challenges from a
larger to a smaller market. In general, the more
downgrades that occur over a short period of time, the
more attractive the potential opportunities become on a
		risk-reward basis.
Market factors at work now
In latter 2015 and early 2016, commodity-based sectors
(particularly energy and metals) experienced significant
pressure downward in both the equity and debt markets.
As a result, many commodity-based companies were
downgraded in 1Q2016. This resulted in the majority of
the energy and metals sectors in both investment-grade
and high yield markets experiencing extreme price
volatility. This downward pressure on bond prices was
exaggerated by the forced selling that occurred, as many
former investment-grade companies were downgraded to
	high yield (fallen angels).

To illustrate the price volatility that occurred during this
time, the average price of high yield bonds in the energy
sector according to Bloomberg Barclay indexes for the
investment-grade and high yield categories was $60 at
the end of February 2016. The investment-grade market
experienced similar pain with average price on bonds in
the energy sector at $91 per the Bloomberg Barclays
indexes. One year late at February 2017 month-end, the
same average prices were at $99 and $106 in the
Bloomberg Barclays High Yield and Bloomberg Barclays
Investment Grade indexes, respectively. It is important
to note that these prices were average prices for the
indexes; many individual names in the cross-over market
experienced more severe pricing action. Total return for
the high yield energy sector was 80% and investment grade
was 29% over the past 12 months ending February 2017.

Attractive risk-reward opportunities similar to what
occurred in the crossover energy sector over the past year
present themselves in various sectors and individual
names over the course of credit cycles. In times when
risk-reward opportunities are limited, it is generally a

Global Rebalancing

 
An Australian Amazon?

 




06.01.17 
















Amazon is preparing to bring its full retail offering to Australia, according to the Wall Street Journal, signaling a major competitive threat to the country’s retailers and an important new beachhead for its global distribution network.
Australia’s more favorable regulatory climate is also likely to offer Amazon opportunities to test deliveries via autonomous drones and road vehicles, a person familiar with the matter said. Australia last year rolled out new rules for remote-operated drones, and government officials are looking to develop national guidelines for autonomous-vehicle trials.
Amazon, which announced its Australia intentions in April, hasn’t said when the full retail offering will roll out. Some analysts say the offering could come next year.
Australians can already order products from Amazon overseas, but they typically face higher shipping fees and longer delivery times than shoppers in other Amazon markets with domestic operations. This has constrained Amazon’s challenge to online competitors such as eBay Inc. in Australia, as well as traditional retailers, which have until now been somewhat insulated from the demise of brick-and-mortar stores rippling across the U.S.

Class T shares were launched on July 5, 2017.
Fee Waiver and/or Expense Reimbursement: Through July 31, 2018, Ivy Investment Management Company (IICO), the Fund's investment manager, Ivy Distributors, Inc. (IDI), the Fund's distributor, and/or Waddell & Reed Services Company, doing business as WI Services Company (WISC), the Fund's transfer agent, have contractually agreed to reimburse sufficient management fees, 12b-1 fees and/or shareholder servicing fees to cap the total annual ordinary fund operating expenses (which would exclude interest, taxes, brokerage commissions, acquired fund fees and expenses and extraordinary expenses, if any) as follows: Class E shares at 1.28%.

Fee Waiver and/or Expense Reimbursement: Through July 31, 2018, IDI and/or WISC have contractually agreed to reimburse sufficient 12b-1 and/or shareholder servicing fees to ensure that the total annual ordinary fund operating expenses of the Class Y shares do not exceed the total annual ordinary fund operating expenses of the Class A shares, as calculated at the end of each month. Prior to that date, the expense limitation may not be terminated without the consent of the Board.
Pricing: All prices and year-to-date returns are based on closing quotes unless noted, as supplied to the NASDAQ by 6:00 p.m. Eastern time. YTD Prices can be updated 3 to 4 hours after the Daily Pricing information which can result in mismatching data.
Style Analysis: The Morningstar Style Box reveals a fund's investment style. For equity funds the vertical axis shows the market capitalization of the stocks owned and the horizontal axis shows investment style (value, blend, or growth). For fixed-income funds, the vertical axis shows the credit quality of the bonds owned and the horizontal axis shows interest rate sensitivity as measured by a bond's effective duration. Morningstar seeks credit rating information from fund companies on a periodic basis (e.g., quarterly). In compiling credit rating information, Morningstar instructs fund companies to only use ratings that have been assigned by the following Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSROs): Moody's, Standard & Poor's, Fitch, and Egan-Jones. If two NRSROs have rated a security, fund companies are to report the lowest rating; if three or more NRSROs have rated the same security differently, fund companies are to report the rating that is in the middle. For example, if NRSRO X rates a security AA-, NRSRO Y rates the same security an A and NRSRO Z rates it a BBB+, the fund company should use the credit rating of 'A' in its reporting to Morningstar. PLEASE NOTE: Morningstar, Inc. is not itself an NRSRO nor does it issue a credit rating on the fund. An NRSRO rating on a fixed-income security can change from time-to-time. For credit quality, Morningstar combines the credit rating information provided by the fund companies with an average default rate calculation to come up with a weighted-average credit quality. The weighted-average credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a leading NRSRO. Bond funds are assigned a style box placement of "low", "medium", or "high" based on their average credit quality. Funds with a low credit quality are those whose weighted-average credit quality is determined to be less than "BBB-"; medium are those less than "AA-", but greater or equal to "BBB-"; and high are those with a weighted-average credit quality of "AA-" or higher. When classifying a bond portfolio, Morningstar first maps the NRSRO credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates (as determined by Morningstar's analysis of actual historical default rates). Morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund. Finally, Morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve. For interest-rate sensitivity, Morningstar obtains from fund companies the average effective duration. Generally, Morningstar classifies a fixed-income fund's interest-rate sensitivity based on the effective duration of the Morningstar Core Bond Index (MCBI), which is currently three years. The classification of Limited will be assigned to those funds whose average effective duration is between 25% to 75% of MCBI's average effective duration; funds whose average effective duration is between 75% to 125% of the MCBI will be classified as Moderate; and those that are at 125% or greater of the average effective duration of the MCBI will be classified as Extensive. For municipal bond funds, Morningstar also obtains from fund companies the average effective duration. In these cases static breakpoints are utilized. These breakpoints are as follows: (i) Limited: 4.5 years or less; (ii) Moderate: more than 4.5 years but less than 7 years; and (iii) Extensive: more than 7 years. In addition, for non-US taxable and non-US domiciled fixed income funds static duration breakpoints are used: (i) Limited: less than or equal to 3.5 years; (ii) Moderate: greater than 3.5 and less than equal to 6 years; (iii) Extensive: greater than 6 years.
Unsubsidized yields reflect what the yield would have been without the effect of reimbursements and waivers. The adviser and its affiliates have or may voluntarily waive a portion of their fees (including, but not limited to, distribution and service (12b-1) fees) and reimburse certain expenses. There is no guarantee that the fund will avoid a negative yield. Such undertaking may be amended or withdrawn at any time. 
12-Month Trailing Distribution Yield: at NAV refers to the 12-month historical cash flow paid over the past 12 months in dividends, divided by the past months ending NAV. 
Alpha, Beta, R-Squared, Standard Deviation, Sharpe Ratio and Capture Ratio are 5 year statistics. Alpha is a measure of a fund's actual returns and expected performance, given its level of risk (as measured by beta). Beta reflects the sensitivity of the fund's return to fluctuations in the market index. R-squared indicates how much of a fund's fluctuations were attributable to movements in the fund's benchmark. Standard deviation is a measure of how volatile a fund's returns are. Sharpe ratio is a measure of a fund's risk-adjusted performance. Capture ratio reflects the annualized product of fund vs. index returns for all months in which the index had a positive return (upside capture) or negative return (downside capture).
The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance, and does not include the effects of sales charges. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.  © 2017 Morningstar, Inc.

Ivy Investment Management Company to Adopt Selector Management Funds From EMG | Business Wire
























































Ivy Investment Management Company to Adopt Selector Management Funds 
      From EMG






June 02, 2014 07:59 AM Eastern Daylight Time



OVERLAND PARK, Kan.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Ivy Investment Management Company (“Ivy”) announced that it has executed 
      a fund adoption transaction agreement with Emerging Managers Group 
      (“EMG”) through which Ivy will take over responsibility as investment 
      adviser and distributor of the Selector Management Fund SICAV, an 
      umbrella UCITS fund range domiciled in Luxembourg.
    


      Following the closing of the fund adoption, expected on or around June 
      30, 2014, the UCITS funds will be distributed internationally by Ivy 
      Funds Distributor, Inc., and will be managed by Ivy (its affiliate 
      Waddell & Reed Investment Management Company previously served as 
      subadvisor to the funds). Both Ivy entities are subsidiaries of Waddell 
      & Reed Financial, Inc.
    

      Ivy Funds intends to create a new subsidiary of Ivy Funds Distributor, 
      Inc., to be called Ivy Global Investors, Inc., that will be responsible 
      for the distribution of the UCITS fund range. It also is intended that 
      the SICAV be re-named Ivy Global Investors, with that name attaching to 
      each of the sub-funds within the SICAV (e.g., Ivy Global Investors Asset 
      Strategy Fund).
    

      “This transaction enables us both to serve the non-resident customer 
      market through national broker/dealer firms in the United States and to 
      establish greater international distribution of Ivy’s investment 
      management capabilities,” said Thomas W. Butch, president and CEO of Ivy 
      Funds Distributor, Inc. “It expands our distribution network as well as 
      the range of investors that can access the investment management 
      expertise offered through the Ivy Funds.”
    

      Sub-funds of the SICAV included in the fund adoption transaction are EMG 
      Ivy Asset Strategy Fund and EMG Ivy High Income Fund, which have 
      combined assets under management of approximately $247 million. Three 
      other sub-funds of the SICAV . are under review in Luxembourg: EMG Ivy 
      US Mid Cap Growth Fund, EMG Ivy US Large Cap Growth Fund and EMG Ivy 
      Science and Technology Fund.
    

      As part of the transaction, Ivy Funds expects to hire approximately 
      eight former EMG employees, principally involved in sales and marketing.
    

      Going forward, EMG will partner with Ivy through the distribution of the 
      Ivy products in numerous offshore jurisdictions in Italy, Brazil, and 
      certain Middle Eastern markets, as well as through an EMG SICAV, 
      currently in the process of formation, in the management of a 
      fund-of-funds UCITS that invests in various offshore active funds, 
      including Ivy-managed sub-funds, “smart beta” funds and ETFs.
    

      "We are very pleased to be able to continue to work closely with EMG as 
      they help distribute Ivy products in a number of important global 
      markets and include Ivy in their planned fund-of-funds products," said 
      Butch. "We have worked together effectively, and expect this will 
      continue and even be enhanced as we go forward."
    

      Through its subsidiaries, Waddell & Reed Financial, Inc. (NYSE: WDR) 
      provides investment management and financial planning services to 
      clients throughout the U.S. The firm had approximately $131 billion in 
      total assets under management at March 31, 2014. Ivy Investment 
      Management Company serves as investment advisor to the Ivy Funds, while 
      Ivy Funds Distributor, Inc. serves as principal underwriter and 
      distributor to the Ivy Funds.

      recommendation or investment advice with respect to the purchase of the

Ivy, long recognized for its inventive, actively managed strategies, partnered with ProShare Advisors LLC to create the index funds.Managed by IICO and sub-advised by ProShares, the advisor to the ProShares ETF lineup, the funds became effective April 20, 2017. They are offered by Ivy Distributors, Inc. and will be available through an advisory platform offered by Waddell & Reed, Inc., as well as through unaffiliated distribution.“Offering active and passive investment styles helps financial advisors bring strategic flexibility to the planning process when building client portfolios. These new products allow us to pair a highly experienced index fund manager with our skilled in-house Ivy investment management team, whose focus of course is on active management,” said Thomas W. Butch, CEO of Ivy Distributors, Inc. “ProShares has long been known as a leader within the ETF space and we are pleased to partner with them.”Three of the five funds share their strategies with existing ProShares ETFs. While it has become common to see mutual funds migrated to the ETF wrapper, it is far more unusual to see the reverse—successful ETF strategies made available as mutual funds. For investors in retirement plans or advisory platforms that typically are limited to mutual funds, these Ivy ProShares Funds offer access to innovative index strategies from one of the industry’s premier providers of ETFs.“With their strong reputation and substantial distribution network, Ivy Investments is a natural partner to help us introduce these innovative strategies to mutual fund investors for the first time,” said Michael L. Sapir, co-founder and CEO of ProShare Advisors LLC, the advisor to ProShares.“We chose these five categories precisely because they complement our active product lineup, and they are differentiated styles, outside of what we believe are more commoditized passive asset classes commonly available elsewhere,” Butch added. “For example, the Ivy ProShares S&P 500 Bond Index Fund, tracking bonds of its index’s companies, will be the first mutual fund with this strategy to this point.”Following is a snapshot of the lineup:  PRODUCT           INVESTMENT FOCUS           BENCHMARK      Ivy ProShares S&P 500Dividend Aristocrats Index Fund            Invests in S&P 500 companies with at least 25 years of consecutive dividend growth           S&P 500® Dividend Aristocrats® Index      Ivy ProShares Russell 2000Dividend Growers Index Fund            Invests in small cap companies that have increased dividend payments for at least 10 consecutive years           Russell 2000® Dividend Growth Index      Ivy ProShares MSCI ACWIIndex Fund            Seeking to track MSCI ACWI performance           MSCI All Country World Index      Ivy ProShares S&P 500 BondIndex Fund            Designed to track index of corporate bonds issued by S&P 500 companies           S&P 500®/MarketAxess® Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index      Ivy ProShares Interest RateHedged High Yield Index Fund             Invests in a diversified portfolio of high yield bonds with an interest-rate hedge using short Treasury futures to minimize the effects of rising rates.            Citi High Yield (Treasury Rate-Hedged) Index                          Index funds typically are a cost-effective way for investors to track a benchmark index, meaning returns to index funds, over time, generally should mirror returns of their tracking index, minus any fund expenses. The divergence between the net returns of an index fund and its tracking index is referred to as “tracking error.” IICO and ProShares intend to monitor continually the performance and tracking error of the Ivy ProShares Funds to seek to ensure investors' expectations are properly addressed, according to Ivy executives.About ProSharesProShares has been at the forefront of the ETF revolution since 2006. ProShares now offers one of the largest lineups of ETFs, with more than $27 billion in assets. The company is the leader in strategies such as dividend growth, alternative and geared (leveraged and inverse). ProShares continues to innovate with products that provide strategic and tactical opportunities for investors to manage risk and enhance returns.About Ivy InvestmentsIvy Investments® is a global organization recognized for inventive, actively-managed investing strategies that help investors best meet their long-term goals.

While the Funds attempt to track the performance of their stated indexes, there is no guarantee or assurance that the methodology used to create the index will result in the Funds achieving high, or even positive, returns. The Index may underperform, and the Funds could lose value, while other indexes or measures of market performance increase in value. Funds that have an emphasis on dividend-paying stocks involve the risk that such stocks may fall out of favor with investors and underperform non-dividend paying stocks and the market as a whole over any period of time. In addition, there is no guarantee that the companies in which the Funds invest will declare dividends in the future or that dividends, if declared, will remain at current levels or increase over time. The amount of any dividends the companies may pay may fluctuate significantly. In addition, the value of dividend-paying common stocks can decline when interest rates rise as fixed-income investments become more attractive to investors. This risk may be greater due to the current period of historically low interest rates. International investing involves additional risks, including currency fluctuations, political or economic conditions affecting the foreign country, and differences in accounting standards and foreign regulations. These risks are magnified in emerging markets. Fixed-income securities are subject to interest-rate risk and, as such, the net asset value of the Fund may fall as interest rates rise. Investing in high-income securities may carry a greater risk of nonpayment of interest or principal than higher-rated bonds. These and other risks are more fully described in the Funds’ prospectus. Not all funds or fund classes may be offered at all broker/dealers.Before investing, investors should consider carefully the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of a mutual fund. This and other important information is contained in the prospectus and summary prospectus, which may be obtained at www.ivyinvestments.com or from a financial advisor.

It has been a publicly traded company since 1998, and has its headquarters in Overland Park, Kansas. It operates asset management and distribution subsidiaries, including Ivy Investment Management Company and Waddell & Reed Investment Management Company.[1]
