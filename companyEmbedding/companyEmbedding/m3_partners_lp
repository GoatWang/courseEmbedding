M3 helps leading specialized real estate companies and institutional investors meet their strategic, capital and investment objectives.




Private Equity Capital Raising More >

	M3 enables real estate companies to access the most appropriate sources of capital and helps institutional investors make real estate investments alongside expert operators, globally, in joint ventures, investment clubs and multi-investor funds.


	M3 has a dedicated team of capital specialists and advisory professionals with local expertise in multiple markets across the globe. It applies an in-depth understanding of real estate investments and global capital flows to structure customized investment opportunities, in both core and alternative sectors, that are attractive to real estate companies and investors alike. 

	Additionally, M3’s intimate understanding of the global real estate investor universe enables it to assist real estate companies seeking fund or portfolio recapitalization solutions, as well as investors undertaking secondary trades in unlisted real estate private equity vehicles or seeking customized real estate investment products more generally. We have executed recapitalizations of existing stabilized asset portfolios and structured complex acquisition and development transactions.

	Underpinning these abilities is a sustained and focused dialogue with some of the world’s most active investors in real estate private equity, which leads to a deep understanding of the investment characteristics desired by the international investor community. M3 has strong relationships with institutional real estate investors in North America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Australia, including public and corporate pension plans, insurance companies, endowments, foundations, sovereign wealth funds, funds of funds, investment managers and family trusts.
 


Strategic Financial Advisory More >

	M3 advises on mergers and acquisitions, portfolio optimization, restructuring and recapitalization, and manages secondary LP unit sale processes.


	M3 has developed enduring relationships with real estate companies over the 25 years of its existence, positioning it to provide a broad range of strategic financial advisory services. The firm is frequently engaged to execute asset- or entity-level transactions, or to provide advice at the asset or corporate level.

	M3’s multi-disciplinary team includes professionals from investment (direct property and private equity), corporate and structured finance, investment banking and accountancy backgrounds, enabling the firm to provide a wide range of value-added services which include property and entity-level underwriting, valuation and financial analysis, and buy- and sell-side mergers and acquisitions.
 


Atrium Finance GmbH More >

	In 2014 M3 founded and capitalized Atrium Finance GmbH, a real estate financing business in Germany that specializes in mezzanine and whole loans on real estate acquisitions, developments and refinancings.


	In forming Atrium Finance GmbH, M3 assembled a local management team which combines direct real estate and financing expertise. Based in Munich, the Atrium Finance GmbH team has over 16 years’ experience in lending on, investing in, developing and asset managing real estate in Germany. As a result, Atrium Finance GmbH has a deep, local knowledge of the German real estate market, as well as financing practices and legislation. Our management team has originated over €3 billion of real estate loans without credit or trading losses, and invested over €1.3 billion of equity in German real estate.

Security Capital  More >



	In 1991, we began operations as Security Capital Markets Group, an affiliate of Security Capital Group, a U.S.-listed international real estate research, investment and operating management company. Security Capital Markets Group was a specialist real estate advisory firm that provided innovative capital solutions to public and private companies within the ownership of the Security Capital organization. Security Capital Markets Group played an integral role in creating and supporting the growth of several of the world’s leading Real Estate Investment Trusts and operating companies. In 1998, the firm opened its European headquarters in London to provide similar services to Security Capital Group affiliates in Europe.

Macquarie Capital Partners  More >



	In January 2001, Security Capital Group, Macquarie Bank Limited and the management of Security Capital Markets Group formed a strategic partnership, Macquarie Capital Partners, to extend Security Capital Markets Group’s service provision to other specialist real estate companies beyond those owned by Security Capital Group. When Security Capital Group was acquired by GE Capital Corporation in 2002, Macquarie Capital Partners became a joint venture between its management and Macquarie Bank Limited.





	Scaled advisory business 
	in the U.S., Europe, 
	Middle East and Australia


 

 
 
 

M3 Capital Partners and Evergreen Investment Advisors  More >



	In March 2005, we initiated our principal investment program with the creation of Evergreen Investment Advisors, a wholly owned subsidiary of our firm, which leveraged our property market, structuring and corporate finance expertise. The program was initially capitalized with $500 million of institutional equity.

	In January 2007, the firm’s management bought Macquarie Bank’s interest and renamed the firm M3 Capital Partners. We are now wholly owned by our management team.

	In October 2008, the firm opened its Hong Kong office to facilitate its existing North and South American, European and Middle Eastern real estate operator and investor clients’ activities in the region and to develop and deepen relationships with existing and emerging Asian institutional investors and real estate operators.

	In May 2012, we opened our São Paulo office, to expand our business activities and relationships in Brazil and South America.

	Today, we operate as a fully integrated real estate investment and advisory firm with a coordinated global origination and execution platform. Since 2005, we have substantially grown our principal investment business and currently we manage $4.1 billion of institutional equity. To date we have invested in 13 real estate businesses in the U.S., Europe, Asia, Australia and South America, which we manage on an ongoing basis.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60)

      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.

Company Profile
First United Corporation is a bank holding company. The Company’s primary business is serving as the parent company of First United Bank & Trust (the Bank), First United Statutory Trust I, First United Statutory Trust II and First United Statutory Trust III. The Bank is an independent community bank providing a range of retail and commercial banking services to businesses and individuals in its market areas.

Form 13G is used when the filer owns between 5% and 20% of the company and plans to hold it only as a passive investor. If the filler intend to exert control and if the stake’s size exceeds 20%, then a 13D must be filed. Therefore, activist investors and practices such as: hostile takeovers, company breakups, and other “change of control” events, are not permitted by 13G filers.
