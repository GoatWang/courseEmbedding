Supporters cover a farm's yearly operating budget by purchasing a share of the season's harvest. CSA members make a commitment to support the farm throughout the season, and assume the costs, risks and bounty of growing food along with the farmer or grower. Members help pay for seeds, fertilizer, water, equipment maintenance, labor, etc. In return, the farm provides, to the best of its ability, a healthy supply of seasonal fresh produce throughout the growing season.-Becoming a member creates a responsible relationship between people and the food they eat, the land on which it is grown and those who grow it. This mutually supportive relationship between local farmers, growers and community members helps create an economically stable farm operation in which members are assured the highest quality produce at a fair price. In return, farmers and growers are guaranteed a reliable market for a diverse selection of crops. CSA reflects an innovative and resourceful strategy to connect local farmers with local consumers; develop a regional food supply and strong local economy; maintain a sense of community; encourage land stewardship; and honor the knowledge and experience of growers and producers working with small to medium farms. We are located in Northern Colorado and deliver throughout the state as well as Southern Wyoming. To learn how you can become a member visit our web site, http://grantfarms.com or call us at (970) 568-7654.

I've loved tailoring our week's menu to the food we receive and the responses I get to any questions or concerns is so quick and so thorough ...a level of customer service I don't see in many companies anymore.”— Chris KochCSA Member 2012, Boulder

Grant Farms CSA - A healthy & sustainable alternative to fundraising
We want to provide you with fresh, sustainably grown Colorado produce, while helping your school raise money!
What is a CSA?
CSA stands for Community Supported Agriculture. Here at Grant Farms CSA, we provide our members with Colorado produce for 26 weeks from mid-June to mid-December. Our members pay us in advance to get their share of the farm, and we use that funding to provide for all of our farming expenses including seed, labor, maintenance, and equipment. When CSA members make the commitment to our farm, they agree to share in the bounty and risks associated with farming. It gives us as a farm a solid customer base for the growing season, and it gives our members a chance to enjoy high quality fresh farm produce delivered to a nearby pick-up site for 6 months of the Colorado growing season. Vegetable shares offer boxes of produce that vary with the season and include 5-10 different items each week (depending on your share size). We also offer a variety of shares from Colorado, including fruit, mushrooms, eggs, cheese, yoghurt, and more. Once you become a member, you also have the opportunity to purchase pasture raised meats from our farm. This is a mutually beneficial relationship for our farm and for your community!
How can this fundraiser benefit your school?
We support education in our local communities, which is why we want to bring this program to your school. By donating part of our CSA shares to schools, we aim to support local schools, advance the local food movement, and raise environmental awareness and stewardship among students and parents. Our goal is to create a partnership between schools to provide them with educational opportunities, as well as 5% of CSA shares that your families participate in.
How does it work?
For every CSA Share that is purchased through your school using the Coupon Code included in the brochure you received or using your school as a pick up site, the school will earn 5% of that share. For example, if $10,000 in CSA shares is sold, your school will get $500 to support their educational mission.
Your Part
We ask that you help spread the word about our CSA by passing out flyers and brochures to your faculty and students. If you would like your school to be a pick up location, then once the CSA begins, we will need a central location to deliver the boxes of produce to your school. We ask that you work with us to formulate a plan for distribution of the boxes (people walk in to pick up, a parent volunteers to pass them out (for a reduced CSA price), or students take responsibility for picking them up and walking them out.
Our Part
We will provide you with flyers, stickers, brochures, and information to pass along to families. Participants can sign up on our website using the coupon code provided in the brochures we give you, or using your school as a pick up location. They can also call us at 970-568-7654 or e-mail howdy@grantfarms.com. You will not be responsible for handling sign ups or money from interested members. We will deliver the CSA shares to your school or a nearby pick up location once a week from mid-June to mid-December for 26 weeks. We will write you a check for 5% of the shares purchased for your school at the end of the season. We aim to make this as easy on the school and participating families as possible. We can also offer field trips and educational opportunities for your students.

More »Member Reviews“I have a newfound love of beets. It's amazing how tasty fresh local produce is. The process couldn't be easier and my drop-off location is very near my home. I feel good about supporting local farmers and have a great respect for the work that everyone does and the care they take at GFF.”— Pattylocalharvest.org  

Home » Community » InternshipsInternshipsGrant Farms CSA, located northwest of Fort Collins, Colorado, is a Certified Organic farm that grows over 100 varieties of vegetables and fruit in addition to raising chickens, pigs, turkeys, ducks, and geese.  The farm, family-owned and approximately 22 acres, supports a large Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) program and is an avid promoter of local food systems that are environmentally, socially and economically sustainable.  Our goal is to continue our own diversification and to grow the CSA culture in our region so that even more consumers and farmers can reap the health, economic and social rewards of a deep connection to where their food comes from or goes to.
An intern who commits to Grant Farms CSA has the opportunity to learn a variety of skills and be offered a window onto the changing United States food system and the effort it takes to make those changes.  We believe strongly that education is a key to fundamentally changing attitudes about food and farming in the United States.  We also believe in the necessity of training and encouraging a new generation of farmers, as well as environmentally and socially aware consumers. So, while we’ll expect interns to work hard and conscientiously, we also expect ourselves to provide a valuable and enjoyable chance to expand one’s experience and perspective.
Internship positions will last 8-9 months, April-December.  We have 2-4 internship opportunities for 2016. Interns will rotate between different farm duties every 1-2 months, so they will get a strong understanding of all areas of the farm.  We will have interns work in the following areas:

Gardening (prep, design, planting)
Agriculture (irrigation, soil preparation & conservation, harvesting)
Orchard and vineyard care and maintenance (pruning FEB, irrigation APRIL, harvesting SEPT)
Animal care (feeding chickens, hens, pigs, goats, sheep; collecting, washing, & packing eggs)
CSA packing (preparation & packing of produce, herbs, and products; packing shed management)
CSA distribution (distribution of produce boxes and other products to customers)
Customized projects (patios, gazebos, 2017 Solar Project)
Community organization & leadership

All positions are work-based educational opportunities that adhere to the philosophy that the best way to learn is by doing. What follows is an approximation of the areas you should expect to work in. We want interns to experience the variety of work and develop the skills necessary for operating a farm. Butthis is a farm that exists in reality and you should also expect your experience to be fluid rather than strictly regimented.  Flexibility is a key attribute of any successful intern.
Education
In addition to field work, interns will participate in classroom sessions two mornings a month during their term. These sessions may have to do with permaculture principles, community living, specific topics raised in the field, or general group discussions around issues of sustainable agriculture.
Details

Length of Internship: It is required that you stay through the entire season, including the planting and harvest seasons (starting mid-April), and the CSA season (June -December).
Housing: Living on the farm is available and encouraged.  However, this is not required.
Hours per Week: 40-50 during April-October (5.5 days per/week); 30-40 during the winter
Stipend: $600/month (plus room and partial board) for those living on the farm; $800.00/month for those living off farm
Produce: All interns will receive produce from the farm.
Trial Period: All interns are subject to a two week trial period and review.

Requirements
While some previous farm experience is preferred, it is not required. However, all applicants should be committed to the farming ethic and its demands to rise early, be on time, and ready to work in all types of weather, including wind, rain, snow, and summer heat that can reach 90-100 degrees. Part of farming is that some days will be longer and the work heavier than others.  Again, flexibility is important as is having a great deal of energy and drive.
Interns should possess the physical ability to work daily with hands, wrist and back, and be able to lift 50 pounds regularly. Excellent people skills and initiative are essential as you will interact with a variety of people each day. Knowing Spanish is a plus, as we have many Spanish-speaking workers.
Grant Farms CSA, like many farms, has a culture unto itself that operates within the larger framework of the farming ethic. Thus, in addition to working hard for long hours we also like to have fun by getting together to cook and eat amazing food, share ideas, and discover what makes and keeps us connected. Finding a good match between what our farm offers and the needs and expectations of an intern are paramount.  To that end we ask that if you have interest in an internship position with Grant Farms CSA you e-mail Melissa at Melissa@grantfarms.com to request an application.  When you have completed the application, please e-mail it, along with a resume and 2-3 employer references to Melissa@grantfarms.com.  Following a review of applications we will set up interviews. Please submit your application no later than March 1, 2016.

Home » Community

Grant Farms CSACommunityWe believe strongly that healthy community is built when vibrant healthy food is celebrated and shared with enthusiasm! We have a small community garden plot rich with a variety of vegetables.
We invite you to participate, help care for the garden, and in turn share a meal or two, or three!
For more information on involvement in our garden, or regarding volunteer or educational opportunities with the farm please email Cassandra at cassandra @grantfarms.com.
Feeding the Community
In 2011, the farm donated 330,712 pounds of produce directly to the Larimer County Food bank.

From 2007 to 2010, the farm donated more than 800,000 pounds of produce to Colorado and Wyoming Food Banks. The farm organizes several gleaning projects each year; they also recruit CSA members and volunteers to help plant fields of potatoes grown specifically to be donated to the Larimer County Food Bank. They also support several local events with share donations.
The farm's referral program encourages CSA members to build the CSA program with new members. For each new member, the farm donates a total of 40 lbs of produce to the members' local food bank, resulting in a larger distribution of food to local food banks throughout Wyoming and Colorado.
