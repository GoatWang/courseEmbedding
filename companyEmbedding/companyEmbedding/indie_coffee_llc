Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Learn how it works

 













"Indiegogo challenges the top-down model by affording artists the opportunity to make their case directly to the public. It's profoundly empowering."
Tanya Shaffer
CAMPAIGNER








"I've contributed to more than 80 film campaigns on Indiegogo because real creativity comes from smaller, independent productions and crowdfunding gives me the opportunity to be involved."
Tobias Fleischer
CONTRIBUTOR








"My dream in life is to make the world a better place. Enabling people to raise capital using Indiegogo is my way of fulfilling that dream."
Ali Jabini
INDIEGOGO INSIGHTS TEAM









Together








Founded to Revolutionize Funding
When creative people work together, amazing things happen. Danae Ringelmann grew up seeing her parents struggle to get small business loans. In his spare time, Eric Schell attempted to help a Chicago theater company get funding. Slava Rubin fundraised for a cure for Myeloma, the disease that killed his father. They came together because they found a fundamental flaw in the system: for centuries, access to funding had been controlled by a select few. Your crazy, cool, genius ideas were getting stuck.
Danae, Eric, and Slava founded Indiegogo in 2008 to shift the power into your hands—to empower creative, entrepreneurial people everywhere to bring their ideas to life. We can’t wait to see what you create next.

    The Java Shack
  





Our first retail location and indie coffee shop, “Arlington’s Original Coffee House” has been a fixture in the Courthouse area of North Arlington for the past twenty years. Ranked in 2016 as “Best Coffee Shop” in the D.C. region by Washington City Paper, “The Shack” has been featured for numerous awards in The Washington Post, The Washington Times, Washingtonian Magazine, and other publications. It’s always focused on sustainably-sourced, locally-roasted coffee and offering a gathering place for all ages and walks of life.
In 2015, we bought The Java Shack to integrate coffee roasting and brewing, and build on a tradition of outstanding customer service. Ask for a “Dale Special,” named after original owner Dale Roberts, or a “Korinator,” named after a long-time barista.

The Democratsâ Better Way: Positive Messaging or Pandering to Trump Voters Who Are Never Coming Back?



George Washington law professor and economist praises Democrats for coming up with a message that preserves the partyâs commitment to social justice issues, rather than attempting to woo Trump voters by appealing to what Trump appealed to.

Frequently Asked Questions


How do I know if my project is right for Indiegogo?
We know we’re a bit biased, but: we bet you’ll feel right at home around here! Art, architecture, technology, films, DIY—if it’s a creative, entrepreneurial project it’s probably a great fit. Whether you’re just getting started with an idea or are looking for a marketplace solution, there’s a home for your project on Indiegogo.
What goes into a successful campaign?
Having seen hundreds of thousands of campaigns, we know what works – our Campaign Strategists compiled all the tips, tricks, and best practices for a great crowdfunding experience: see the Essential Guide to Crowdfunding.
Do you offer discounts for nonprofits and social causes?
Yes. In fact, we built Generosity by Indiegogo with you in mind! Nonprofits and socially minded campaigns enjoy a 0% platform fee on Generosity. If your project aims to improve lives at any scale, we think you should be able to keep more of the funds you raise.


Does Indiegogo offer more than crowdfunding?
You bet! Crowdfunding is still the backbone of Indiegogo—as you’re reading this, thousands of successful campaigns are live around the world. But we also support you through the entire process of bringing new ideas to market. We’re your all-in-one launch platform.
Why do you offer both fixed and flexible funding?
Freedom. It’s a good thing! Choose the style that fits your own idea and goals: Flexible Funding means you keep all the money you raise, regardless of your goal; Fixed Funding means you have a specific funding goal that must be met, which can be a good choice for projects that require set funding to enter production.
My product wasn’t crowdfunded —can I still use Indiegogo’s marketplace?
Yes! We’re interested in hearing from you and learning about your product, whether or not you’ve ran a crowdfunding campaign.








Fundraising with heart—and 0% fees
Raising funds for a nonprofit or a social cause? Check out Generosity by Indiegogo, our fee-free platform for causes large and small.
