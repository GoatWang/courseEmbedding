* This undertaking does not affect any limits Section 102(a) of the National Securities Markets
Improvement Act of 1996 ("NSMIA") [Pub. L. No. 104-290, 110 Stat. 3416 (Oct. 11, 1996)] imposes on the ability of States to
require information. As a result, if the securities that are the subject of this Form D are "covered securities" for purposes
of NSMIA, whether in all instances or due to the nature of the offering that is the subject of this Form D, States cannot
routinely require offering materials under this undertaking or otherwise and can require offering materials only to the
extent NSMIA permits them to do so under NSMIA's preservation of their anti-fraud authority.

He remained here for the next thirteen years. In 1997, he joined Paine Webber Inc.

Mr. Rosenbach graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Accounting and Economics from Regis University in 1976.







INVESTMENT STRATEGY




The overall objective of the Fund is to provide capital appreciation to investors in each Series. The Fund seeks to achieve its objective by investing in the common stock of closed-end management investment companies (“Portfolio Funds”)  elected by the Investment Advisor that invest significantly in equity or income-producing securities. Portfolio Funds generally focus on equity or income-producing securities, sectors or strategies, such as dividend strategies, covered call option strategies, total return strategies, balanced strategies, general equities (including both dividend and non- dividend paying equities), limited duration strategies, convertible securities, preferred securities, high yield securities and real estate, energy, utility and other equity or income-oriented strategies. Shares of Portfolio Funds in which the Fund invests will be traded on a national securities exchange.
The primary objective of KGR SERIES II (“Series II”) is superior capital appreciation as compared to the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) Emerging Markets Index. The business of Series II is buying and selling U.S. and non-U.S. securities, especially those of closed-end funds, and other instruments, including global equity related securities, exchange traded indices, corporate and government bonds and other fixed income instruments, swaps, equities, and over-the-counter options on all the foregoing, related to “emerging markets.” An emerging market refers to any nation, region, or foreign market that is in the process of developing or is exhibiting rapid growth and industrialization in its social or business activity, as determined by the Investment Advisor in its sole discretion.
