ConnellyKyle G. ratedMr. Connelly represented me in a DV case in 2009. I can attest to his punctuality, professionalism, attention to detail, and his willingness to answer any and all questions via phone or email  during my dealings with him. He responded to my myriad of questions usually within an hour or two... exceptional for any attorney.  His office staff is courterious and professional. He is serious and diligent in handling cases. Although the DA would not budge for any type of reduced sentence, I feel he did the best he could under the circumstances.  The outcome of the case was not entirely favorable to me as I had two bad options to decide upon. Looking back, I would have explained the details of "what happened" differently. I feel like I blabbered on too much by disclosing to him some personally damaging information thereby not giving him many options to deny what my ex reported to the police. He is a very scrupulous person (again, not a common trait for attorneys). Being totally honest with him was not in my best interest and feel things would have gone differently had he argued and questioned the validity and proof of my ex-wifes accusations more fervently. It was my word against hers, and sadly the judges do tend to lean more to the wife's side of the story...even without any proof.  The fact that I had been punched, scatched, and kicked by my ex several times during our marriage, were never even brought before the judge. Thankfully, she and I have developed a decent rapport as the years went by.  Just be cautious and prudent in what you disclose to him that could negatively affect your case.  But I can tell you that things could have turned out much worse without his representation as he is a well known and respected attorney in the Charlotte area. The DA would not allow us any options for a lesser charge and she was unwilling to compromise.  In my case, the sentencing resulted in a reduction to a (PJC).  But even this created many personal and professional difficulties (e.g. Being refused employment on one occasion due to a background check)  He's a great guy and will work hard for you, but in the end, it's the judges and the DAs who ultimately call the shots.  I would still recommend him.  He is honest and he takes all his cases very seriously. The 4 stars is simply because he was unable to have the case dismissed or at least reduced to a lesser offense which is obviously what people are looking for when they retain counsel.  He did manage to attain a PJC for the final disposition, and I remain grateful for his efforts in doing so.Law Office of Christopher A. Connellymikemiller240 ratedThere is no strong lawyer in all of the Charlotte area than Attorney Chris Connelly!!! If you are trying to find the best lawyer possible to help you with a case and at a very reasonable price, look no further. After getting my 2nd DUI in 7 years, I was scared to death and determined to find the best lawyer that I can find to represent me. I went in person to interview several lawyers to determine who I felt would have the experience and knowledge to best find a way to get me out of this mess.  The moment I went to see Chris Connelly, I immediately knew he was good. My case got continued several times before going to trial and every time Mr Connelly entered the courtroom, you could see the level of respect other attorneys gave him because it was very clear that he was the real deal. Chris Connelly put in countless hours of study into my personal case to gather all the facts and presented many different and creative strategies in which we could attack our case. Because of his high level of expertise, it almost seemed as if no one was brave enough to stand up against him. As a result, the state kept asking for continuences totaling nearly two years. Finally, when the day of judgement finally came, the trial took nearly no time at all and the judge made the ruling to dismiss the case. I was astonished to see how quickly Chris Connelly won our case for us. If you are looking for the best lawyer money can buy.  Rest assured that Chris Connelly is THE BEST!!! If you are unsure if you can afford such a highly skilled lawyer, you would be surprised at how reasonable his rates are. If you care about your future like I did, hiring Attorney Chris Connelly will be the best decision you can make.Law Office of Christopher A. Connellychris.cat1 ratedChris has done it again, 3rd time is charm.  The first time I used Chris he got me off of reckless driving and speeding.  I contacted him on Friday evening and got a email back from him Saturday.  Monday morning he called me at like 10am and informed me the charges were dropped.2nd - incident -  Caught on hwy 77 doing 115mph in my corvette.  Again charges dropped.3rd screw up and definitely my last.  I ran from the police on my street bike.  Charged with Felony eluding, confiscated my bike, 133mph, failure to stop, and about 5 other tickets.  I spent the night In jail and as soon as I got out I contacted Chris's office.  within an hour he called me back and said to come in and talk.  From there on I didn't have to do anything but show up at court.  Anytime I had a question and emailed Chris I had a response within a couple of hours. In court the man is awesome, he got in front of the judge and made me sound like a medal of honor war hero (I'm a veteran).  I guess it helped because when it was all said and done; my felony was reduced to a misdemeanor, speeding was dropped and the only thing I got was reckless driving.  Which is very fair considering I was passing state troopers well over 150mph inches from their mirrors.  One occasion I went through two of them. So I totally deserve a reckless driving charge.  Last but certainly not least I got my bike back!!! woohooo!!!  I can't drive it for a year but that's probably for the best.  Thanks again Chris!!  Here's another * for this review.Law Office of Christopher A. ConnellyScott C. ratedI applied for my CCW permit in June of 2016. I was notified in October of that same year that my permit was denied due to some information shared by my medical provider. First, the sheriff took more time than what is legally allowed to review my permit. Second, and more importantly, I was wrongfully and subjectively categorized as being ineligible to have a CCW permit based on North Carolina's mental health law. I contacted Chris Connelly and explained to him my case. I could see during our introductory meeting that he was very passionate about defending me as he had heard far too many other cases of honest, hard-working, law-abiding citizens being denied their Second Amendment rights based on the subjective thinking of Mecklenburg County's liberal activist sheriff.I followed Chris's instructions to the letter, providing him all necessary documentation and referral letters in a timely manner. By March of 2017, I was notified that Chris had won our appeal and my legal right to possess a CCW was upheld.I cannot thank Chris Connelly enough and would highly recommend anyone faced with a similar case to contact him immediately. DO NOT take this challenge on alone. You only have one chance at a CCW appeal. Make it count. Hire Chris Connelly.Law Office of Stephen M Corbykenneth54 ratedIf you are looking for lawyer, please take the time to at least read what I have to say about this incredible lawyer. I am almost 60 years old, have hired many attorneys,  but not one that does this great of a job.  He listens to what you have to say,  has a courtroom demeanor that makes you feel like you are being protected and defended in the best possible manner.  His fees are fair and well-deserved.  He reviews all aspects and studies your case like it is the only one,  although he has very many others. He is extremely intelligent and knows the law and when to apply it spontaneously and correctly.  You can trust what he says and what he does.  He KEEPS HIS WORD.  If you google this attorney,  you will find the complete experience that I had with Mr. Corby.  It is worth the time to review.  IT APPEARS THAT Mr. Corby has saved me about $70,000.00 in alleged estate debt.  Do you know anyone else that can do that!  This attorney is both great to work with and a wonderful person.  He is not arrogant and condescending, but caring and attentive.  Hire him quick before your opposition does.  Once you hire him, you will understand why I said that!Law Office of Christopher A. ConnellyAdam  W. ratedI highly recommend Mr. Connell...I highly recommend Mr. Connelly.  I was charged with a DUI a couple years ago and hired a different Law Firm.  The case was continued for almost a year (which was fine by me) but every time I appeared for court, there was a different attorney from the firm to whom I had to explain the details of my case.  I understand that I am not a high profile politician or celebrity but I felt as if they could not have cared less about my situation.  About a year later, I was pulled over and arrested for DWLR and decided to hire Mr. Connelly based on a few recommendations from others who had similar situations.  When you hire Chris, you will deal with Chris.  I much prefer this approach and felt as if he gave a damn about me and my situation.  This was a pretty serious situation considering the DWLR was a result of a DUI charge and jail time was a real possibility.  Ultimately Mr. Connelly, was able to get the charge completely dismissed.  This could have had a major impact on my career (especially if it resulted in any jail time) and I could not be more appreciative of the job that Mr. Connelly did.Law Office of Christopher A. ConnellyTait A. ratedRecent international tragedies and violent crimes prompted me to seek a handgun permit that would allow me to take responsibility for my family’s protection. So, when my permit request was denied, I was dismayed and didn’t know what to do. Fortunately, I was referred to Christopher Connelly, an attorney who fervently believes in and was willing to fight for my 2nd Amendment rights.  Mr. Connelly and his entire staff were professionals in every sense of the word.  Christopher’s counsel was excellent.  His approach was personable, professional, and legally sound.  Within a few months, my permit was approved and my rights were restored.I firmly believe Christopher Connelly is the greatest and most qualified 2nd Amendment attorney in Charlotte, NC.  I assure you, he is on your side and will do everything in his power to receive a judgment in your favor. I recommend him in the highest regard and I’m forever grateful to him and his staff.Passenant & Shearin LawKristen S. ratedStrong, honest and hard working attorneysI was shocked and did not know where to turn when my Divorce began. The Passenant & Shearin Law firm was recommended by a friend and I am so thankful. They addressed my case swiftly and walked me through the process that is very confusing to a layperson. My concerns around false allegations, custody, and property (among many others) were all handled aggressively, professionally, and with my rights being protected. I have had the opportunity to work with several members of the firm because they work as a "team". I am especially thankful to Shelia Passenant for my initial consultation and hearing along with Brione Pattison who has walked me through the often difficult process of Divorce with custody issues. I would highly recommend Passenant and Shearin Law to anyone who wants strong, honest, and hard working Attorneys fighting for your rights.Bankruptcy Attorney - Law Offices of Terry DuncanSusan S. ratedTerry Duncan is fantastic! If you're in need of a bankruptcy lawyer, he's the one to see. He takes the time to totally explain absolutely everything there is to know about bankruptcy from the bottom to the top in terms anyone can understand. Besides that he is a true gentleman, extremely polite, caring and down to earth with all his clients. He treats you like a friend. He even gives you a print out of the Court building so you don't go to the wrong Court!! When a group of his clients went to Court to see the Trustee, Terry took us all into a side room to let us know exactly what type of questions we would be asked and the best way to answer. I didn't see any other lawyer do that for their clients!! The office staff is great also!! If you unfortunately need to file a bankruptcy....TERRY DUNCAN is the lawyer to see. He will be able to put your mind at ease!!Jesson & Rains, LLPJennifer E. ratedEven though Kelly could not take my case, she returned my call and not only was respectful enough to personally inform me that she would not be able take my case, but actually took the time to listen to a synopsis of my case and then give me advice based upon my circumstances! I have had to deal with multiple attorneys the past few years, and even the attorneys I hired were not as conscientious, thoughtful, caring or involved as Kelly was. Having not paid her a dime or hired her, she STILL took the time to advise and give me guidance with my case and even offered to help me find an attorney who COULD take my case. I sincerely WISH that Kelly could take my case, as I am certain that she would be 100% devoted to helping me achieve the outcome I desire. I would HIGHLY recommend contacting Kelly Jesson for your legal needs!Did You Know?Types of AttorneysThe legal profession is vast, with each attorney having his or her specialties. Here are some of the most common attorneys individuals seek out when they require legal aid:Criminal Lawyer
A criminal defense lawyer is probably the attorney the average person imagines. Criminal attorneys are the men and women who defend individuals accused of a crime. The lawyer may work pro bono - for the public good - so the accused is certain to have representation, even if he or she cannot afford an attorney.Criminal lawyers are experts in the criminal justice system. They help their clients decide how to plead when first charged by the police and guide them through trial procedures. Defense lawyers must use every bit of their knowledge and resources to get their clients the fairest results from criminal proceedings.Business Lawyer
If you are a small business owner or the head of a larger corporation, you may come into contact with a business lawyer. Many big companies keep a legal staff on payroll to deal with the daily operations of running and maintaining a large enterprise. Business lawyers may have more specific specialties like copyright law, product liability and mergers and acquisitions.Business attorneys may focus their practices on certain industries. There are entertainment lawyers to guide artists through royalties and media contracts, while hospitals employ malpractice attorneys to protect doctors from aggressive litigation.Employment Lawyer
When you work for a company, you may find yourself in need of an employment lawyer - especially if the relationship between you and your employer sours. An employment attorney prevents people from losing their jobs due to unfair reasons. Workers' compensation lawyers help maintain safe employment conditions and ensure workers receive fair compensation after workplace injury or discrimination.Finance Lawyer
A personal finance attorney can protect and manage your investments and securities. You may use a finance lawyer to help you prepare your taxes, but you might be better off working with an accountant. A tax attorney is more commonly contacted after a business or individual runs into trouble with the IRS or state regulators.Real Estate Lawyer
Your family may keep a lawyer on retainer to guide you through the major expenses that come up in life. When buying a home, you could work with a real estate lawyer to make sure you get the best deal and won't get taken advantage of by tricky mortgage agreements or unfair landlords. An estate attorney can help you plan for the worst by creating a will and preparing your finances for after your death.Bankruptcy Lawyer
A bankruptcy lawyer is essential to help you resolve your financial difficulties when they start to spin out of control. Certain attorneys help create strategies to bring you out of debt and speak to your creditors. A lawyer can advise you on which type of bankruptcy you should file for.Civil Lawyer
If you are suing someone or being sued, you need a civil lawyer. Civil attorneys - and criminal lawyers - are the legal representatives who argue on your behalf in a courtroom setting. Civil lawyers may represent you on matters of business, finance or a wide variety of other specialized needs.One of the most common types of civil attorneys is a personal injury lawyer. When you're hurt by an outside party and you would like to hold them legally responsible, a personal injury attorney conducts litigation and negotiates settlements to compensate for your pain and suffering. Sometimes many wronged people will join together with a single civil lawyer or law office to form a class action lawsuit.Family/Divorce Lawyer
Most people will turn to a lawyer during a divorce to navigate the emotionally charged legal proceedings. A divorce attorney can assist in determining grounds for separation, division of property and custody of children.Family attorneys deal with much more personal matters. If you're getting married, a family lawyer can help you prepare a prenuptial agreement or other family planning paperwork such as adoption or inheritance documents.Questions One Should Ask a Lawyer Before Hiring ThemTo ensure you find a competent attorney who won't abuse your trust or drain your finances, you have to make the proper inquiries. There are several questions you should ask, but the majority will fall under three general topics:Training and Experience Questions
One of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorney's history. When you first step into a lawyer's office, you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.Once you inquire about the broad details of their legal career, you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue. You should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases.Financial Questions
You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant.Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Whatever the payment plan, make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Lawyer/Client Relationship Questions
When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship. The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier, such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle. The more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs, the better.Top Reasons to Hire a LawyerYou may keep a lawyer on retainer or you could turn to an attorney during specific situations. Here are some common reasons people begin seeking legal representation or advice:You Know Your Limitations
If you sign documents and you come across a word you don't recognize, you need assistance. You may need a third party to help you navigate important employment or real estate paperwork. It's essential you fully understand the terms of any legally binding documentation or activity you become a part of. If you are not an expert in a given field, you'll want to hire an attorney who is.A lawyer may find legal implications or opportunities you might miss. If you find yourself in a civil or criminal matter, a proper attorney ensures you don't receive a harsh punishment for a small mistake.You're Facing an Important Event/Decision
When making decisions critical to your financial stability or personal life, you may want a lawyer with expertise in your situation to make sure you do everything you can to arrive at the proper resolution. This is especially true when you become involved in a criminal case and your freedom is on the line.It's not just a matter of legal knowledge; lawyer's have access to numerous resources you do not. They have staff ready to work around the clock and experts in a variety of fields to give your important issues the attention they deserve.You Can't Be Impartial
During times when personal matters intersect with legal proceedings, you may need to have an advocate to prevent your emotions from getting in the way of level-headed thinking. For example, divorce lawyers can mediate a heated argument and help both partners get on with their lives.Emotional investment could be subtle. You may want to have a lawyer look over an investment opportunity that looks too good to be true or investigate the merits of a possible civil suit when you feel wronged.You're Out of Options
Many people turn to lawyers when they are in trouble. If you've been accused of a crime or are in a terrible financial situation, you can find an attorney who will work with what you have available to assist you as you deal with your problems.Personal injury lawyers find solutions for people who can no longer work under their own power and bankruptcy attorneys prevent people from giving in to debt. If you find yourself in a situation where you can't find a solution, a lawyer may be able to offer the counsel you need.How to Choose a LawyerWhen it comes time to choose a lawyer, you should start by searching close to home. While you probably don't want the conflict of interest that comes from being represented by a family member, friends and loved ones can recommend lawyers who served them well in the past. If you do have attorneys you are familiar with, ask who they believe would be best for you.After going through personal references - especially from individuals who had similar needs - you should broaden your search through public information resources. You can call your area's attorney referral service or check legal organizations like Martindale-Hubbell. There are other resources available online. You should check websites for client reviews and other third-party forms of approval.When you build a list of possible candidates, perform a background check on each one. See if you can find information on their history and success record. Once you find a possible lawyer, you should call to arrange a consultation so you can ask your important questions in person.By performing the necessary research and taking every available precaution, you can narrow your search to the attorney most suited to your needs.

Our Story
"The best tequila in the world"





Tequila has been around for generations, but it wasn't until Patrón launched in 1989 that the world was introduced to ultra-premium tequila.
Patrón (Spanish for "the good boss") is the brainchild of two entrepreneurs, John Paul DeJoria and Martin Crowley, whose love of tequila and desire to create the best tequila in the world led them to the Highlands of Jalisco, Mexico. There they found tequila industry veteran Francisco Alcaraz and asked him to produce the most extraordinary, highest-quality 100 percent agave tequila possible. From that fortuitous meeting, Patrón Tequila was born.
Patrón's success is due in no small part to its founders' hunch early on that consumers were ready for an ultra-premium luxury tequila, a spirits category which at the time didn't exist. Few exported tequilas back then were created from 100 percent agave - from the beginning, Francisco's handcrafted method for Patrón included not only 100 percent Weber Blue Agave, but also a centuries-old technique called the tahona process, where agave fibers are slowly crushed by a large volcanic stone wheel, and then the agave juice is fermented and distilled with the agave fiber. Francisco created tequila from this process, and tequila from the more modern roller mill process, and blended them together to become Patrón.

Patrón's success is due in no small part to its founders' hunch early on that consumers were ready for an ultra-premium luxury tequila

But to successfully market Patrón as a sophisticated drink, Patrón's founders first needed to change the public's perception of tequila. Early adopters who first tried the product and then told others about it discovered that Patrón's smooth taste, extraordinarily refined flavors, and high-quality set it apart from other tequilas. This was a tequila very different from people's notion of tequila.
The company's first tequilas were Patrón Silver and Patrón Añejo, which were followed in 1992 with the introduction of Patrón Reposado. Also launching that year was Patrón XO Cafe, a distinct coffee liqueur, characterized by its uniquely dry - not sweet - taste (and in 2012, a chocolate coffee liqueur extension called Patrón XO Cafe Dark Cocoa was launched, and in 2014 the brand introduced a chile chocolate liqueur called Patrón XO Cafe Incendio). Patrón Citrónge, an extra-fine orange liqueur, was also created in 1992, offering Patrón lovers the ultimate ingredient for a perfect margarita. Today, that line has expanded to also include Patrón Citrónge Lime liqueur and Patrón Citrónge Mango liqueur.
In 2004, the year when Patrón became the first spirit ever to receive the Five-Star Diamond Award from the American Academy of Hospitality Sciences, Patrón Spirits debuted its Gran Patrón Platinum Tequila. This "super ultra-premium" spirit is created from only the finest agave from the harvest, triple-distilled for extraordinary smoothness, and then packaged in an etched crystal bottle inside an elegant black display case. Joining Gran Patrón Platinum in 2007 was Gran Patrón Burdeos, a beautifully packaged limited-production añejo that is aged for a minimum of 12 months in used American oak barrels, distilled again and aged in new French oak before it’s then finished in vintage French Bordeaux barrels. Extending the Gran Patrón line, in 2013 Gran Patrón Piedra was introduced, marking Patrón's first extra añejo tequila (aged for more than three years.)
One of the most significant new product launches for the company came in 2014 when Patrón introduced Roca Patrón, a line of artisanal tequilas created entirely from the ancient tahona process. These tequilas (Silver, Reposado and Añejo) are finished at their own specific proof levels to ensure the best flavor profile for balance and complexity.

Aside from tequila, the Patrón Spirits portfolio also includes Pyrat (launched in 1996) and Ultimat vodka (a brand the company acquired in 2007). Pyrat is blended and bottled in the Caribbean, and Ultimat is an ultra-premium Polish vodka created from a uniquely balanced combination of potato, wheat and rye.
Patrón Tequilas and liqueurs, Pyrat, and Ultimat vodka are today now available in more than 100 countries and islands across the world, and sold in global duty free outlets (with a history of solid success in the U.S., Patrón Spirits began developing and growing its international distribution in 2005.) But though Patrón Tequila continues to grow, it is still produced in the same way, in the same small batch process that Francisco perfected those years ago.

Patrón is also dedicated to limiting the environmental impact of its production. Several years ago at the distillery, a multi-million dollar reverse osmosis plant - the first of its kind in the tequila industry - was completed to reclaim up to 70 percent of wastewater and turn it into clean water for cooling towers and cleaning processes. Also, leftover agave remnants are turned into organic compost, which is donated to community gardens and given to local farmers to spread in their agave fields. The Hacienda Patrón distillery has earned ISO 14001 certification and a clean industry certification from PROFEPA (the Mexican Federal Environmental Protection Agency) for these efforts to reduce waste, lessen emissions, and sustain the environment. The Hacienda Patrón distillery is also now connected directly to a natural gas pipeline, significantly reducing harmful air emissions.
In addition to community and environmental efforts in Mexico, Patrón has also given generously over the years to numerous local, national and global charitable organizations that help feed the hungry, care for the environment, and rebuild people's lives.

Patrón Spirits International continues to evolve with its products. Under the direction of president and CEO Ed Brown, in tandem with master distiller Francisco Alcaraz and cofounder John Paul DeJoria (who is also the cofounder, chairman and CEO of the highly successful John Paul Mitchell Systems hair care company), the company has experienced industry-leading sales growth year after year, and today Patrón remains one of the world's fastest-growing global spirits brands.

Once homeless, he has struggled against the odds to achieve success, launching multiple global enterprises, while always supporting his motto, "Success Unshared is Failure."

John Paul DeJoria's rags-to-riches biography exemplifies the American dream

In 1980, John Paul and hairstylist Paul Mitchell converted a partially borrowed $700 into what is today a thriving salon hair care line called John Paul Mitchell Systems. DeJoria and Mitchell had a vision to start a company that would provide tools of success for hair care professionals, their salons, and the entire beauty industry. This vision holds true today—despite lucrative offers from public corporations, John Paul refuses to sell because of the vow he took to stand by the professional beauty industry.
John Paul's love of tequila brought him to Mexico—in 1989, he founded Patrón, now one of the world’s fastest growing ultra-premium tequilas. Patrón Spirits International produced 1,000 cases of Patrón in its first year, and has grown that to over 2 million cases today. In addition to Patrón Tequilas and liqueurs, the company's portfolio includes Pyrat and Ultimat vodka.

John Paul went on to co-found John Paul Pet & JP Selects—like his previous ventures, both are privately held companies with high ethical standards and reputations for integrity. JP Selects' e-commerce platform offers consumers a variety of the world's best and most dynamic products that are also socially responsible, while John Paul Pet is a line of pH balanced pet grooming and hygiene products developed from John Paul's expertise in hair care. His latest revolutionary venture, ROK Mobile, is a nationwide mobile carrier and music streaming service. 
Throughout the length of his success, John Paul has made philanthropy paramount. In 2011, he signed Bill Gates and Warren Buffett's "The Giving Pledge" as a formal promise to continue giving back. The same year, he established JP's Peace, Love & Happiness Foundation as a hub for his charitable investments, which span the core values of his companies, sustainability, social responsibility and animal-friendliness.

Throughout the length of his success, John Paul has made philanthropy paramount

In 2009, JP launched Grow Appalachia—based on the concept, give a man a fish, feed him for a day, teach a man to fish, feed him for a lifetime, the organization aims to empower hunger-stricken people of Appalachia by providing skills and resources to grow organic, nutritious food and teach them how to prepare and preserve it in a healthy way.
John Paul's charitable work spans worldwide through his work with global organizations, renowned world leaders, and A-list personalities. He has aligned with Nelson Mandela and 46664 to help raise awareness of the global HIV/AIDS epidemic, supports Robert Kennedy, Jr. and his clean water efforts via Waterkeeper Alliance, and rainforest conservation and reforestation projects in Peru and Guatemala through a recent alliance with Reforest Action. John Paul has been profiled for his corporate and philanthropic initiatives across a multitude of media outlets including 20/20, CNN, Forbes, Fortune, Inc., and Fox Business News, and recently appeared as a mentor for budding entrepreneurs via a guest shark appearance on Shark Tank.





Edward M. Brown
President and CEO of Patrón Spirits International AG
President and CEO of The Patrón Spirits Company





President and chief executive officer of Patrón Edward M. Brown believes that success is in the details. True to the advertising motto of his flagship product, "Simply Perfect," the former Seagram executive brings not only 20 years of liquor sales and marketing expertise to his post but also the determination of a professional race car driver.

President and chief executive officer of Patrón Edward M. Brown believes that success is in the details

Brown was recruited from Seagram in 2000, spending six months as managing director of sales and marketing, then becoming executive vice president of sales and marketing before attaining his current position in April 2003 as the President and CEO of The Patrón Spirits Company. During his decade-long tenure with Seagram, Brown earned a reputation as an effective leader and brand manager in the United States and overseas. Before joining Patrón, Brown was responsible for over $5 billion in revenue as executive vice president of sales and marketing for Seagram Asia Pacific. Brown segued from the United States to Singapore, where he served in several different positions in sales and marketing. At Seagram, Brown was recognized with numerous honors including the Seagram Values Award, the company's highest accolade.
Since becoming Patrón's president and CEO, Brown watched the creation of Patrón's distillery and Hacienda in Jalisco, Mexico, witnessing the number of employees at the facility grow from two to over 1,200. Brown has also developed the industry's finest sales and marketing team, for which he recruited a number of his managers from top companies in the industry. Patrón's sales and marketing team has grown from six people in 2001 to over 90 today.
In 2006, Advertising Age's annual "Marketing 50," which highlights top-marketed brands and the people who have made them successful, honored Patrón and Brown with the distinction of being the only spirits company and spirits executive on the prestigious list of innovative marketers.
In 2007, Patrón acquired an ultra-premium Polish vodka, Ultimat, with plans to support and grow this brand in much the same way as his company's namesake Patrón Tequila.

Brown and his team have grown Patrón into an industry phenomenon, going from 118,000 cases sold in 2001 to more than 2 million cases sold today - an increase of almost 2,000 percent.

Under Brown's leadership, he and his team have also tremendously grown the company's other brands, Patrón XO Cafe and Patrón Citrónge liqueurs, Ultimat vodka, and Pyrat.
Outside the office, Brown is an avid golfer, having spent his early years playing tournaments on professional tours. He's also a professional race car driver competing with the Extreme Speed Motorsports team throughout the world.
Brown began his career in the liquor industry in Denver after undergraduate studies at the University of Texas.

TrenchMaster
"We have used several other brands of trenchers in our three rental stores and had problems with the drive mechanisms, bearings, and frames cracking. In the time we've had the TrenchMaster, I don't think we have had a single breakdown that stopped a customer. The TrenchMaster's belt drive system eliminates sheared engine drive shafts which were a common problem with direct drive systems."

David McClellan, Rent Mart Stores — South Dakota 


 
 


  







BedEdger
"I recently purchased a Brown BedEdger Model F990H after renting them for several years. It has increased my productivity and allows me to
                    earn more money. It has eliminated the need to hire additional workers, thus increasing my profits. This is a great trencher, easy to use, doesn't damage nice lawns, and the versatility allows me to perform other landscaping work."

Mark Murray, Murray's Irrigation — Newton, Alabama 


 
 


  







EdgeMaster
"A recent demonstration for a state agency in Florida consisted of edging five miles of street curb. The curb had not been edged in about 8 months. The grass was so overgrown that, after edging, it had to be removed from the curb with a shovel. The EdgeMaster finished the job in about three hours and was the only edger to complete the trial. The agency has since purchased two EdgeMasters. They use them to edge the highways in 5 mile sections at a time, and are running them continuously in 10 hour shifts."

Mike Gail, AIA Small Engines — Florida
