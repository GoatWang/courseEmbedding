                              hazard posed by metal contamination. This study examined the sedimentary partitioning of copper and cadmium with the goal
                              of predicting the environmental fate of these metals in estuaries. Five solid phases: synthetic hydrous oxides of iron and
                              manganese, montmorillonite clay, a synthetic aluminosilicate gel, and estuarine humic substances (EHS) extracted from a natural
                              sediment were chosen to simulate components responsible for trace metal binding in oxidized sediments. The uptake of copper
                              and cadmium by these model phases in artificial seawater was measured as a function of pH and salinity. Affinity of the model
                              phases for cadmium as measured by K[subscript p], the slope of the linear adsorption isotherm, was in the following order:
                              manganese> iron> EHS> aluminosilicates> montmorillonite. Copper binding affinities were much higher than those of cadmium
                              but the relative order of affinity of the phases was similar except for copper binding by EHS for which K[subscript p] was
                              relatively higher (exceeding that of iron). Metal binding was not influenced by interactions involved in three types of phase
                              complex: iron-clay, iron-humic and clay-iron-humic suggesting that experiments with isolated phases are adequate to predict
                              partitioning. The measured K[subscript p] values were used to calibrate a simple model for predicting partitioning and total
                              metal uptake by sediments. This model which is analogous to speciation in a solution of competing ligands, predicts that cadmium
                              uptake by estuarine sediments is dominated by iron while both iron and organics are important for copper. Results of selective
                              extraction studies and studies of cadmium uptake by natural estuarine sediments are in semiquantitative agreement with these
                              predictions. In anaerobic sediments thermodynamic calculations suggest that copper and cadmium concentrations are determined
                              by equilibria involving solid sulphides and bisulphide and polysulphide complexes. It is expected that the results of this
                              investigation will aid in assessing the environmental significance of metal-contaminated estuaries

                              Trace metals in the aquatic environment are generally concentrated on the surface of solid geochemical phases which eventually
                                 become incorporated into estuarine and marine sediments. The mechanism of trace metal concentration is believed to be adsorption
                                 with various geochemical phases such as hydrous metal oxides, clays, and organic matter. Metals in estuarine or marine sediments
                                 can thus be expected to be partitioned between different phases, depending on the concentration of the phase and the strength
                                 of the adsorption bond. The bioavailability of sediment-bound metals to deposit-feeding organisms will depend on trace metal
                                 partitioning and the kinetics of biological metal uptake from each geochemical phase. The present study was undertaken to
                                 develop models for trace metal partitioning and bioavailability in marine sediments. An equilibrium adsorption model was developed
                                 that can be used to predict the partitioning of trace metals between different geochemical phases in aquatic sediments from
                                 laboratory studies. The model uses conditional equilibrium constants determined from the linear portion of an adsorption isotherm.
                                 Conditional equilibrium constants deterit mined for the adsorption of Cu and Cd on bentonite clay, Fe(OH)₃, Mn0₂, and humic
                                 acid in seawater show that the model is applicable for trace metal concentrations existing in the natural environment. Based
                                 on the laboratory results, the model predicts that the clay fraction may be a major sink for Cu and Cd in marine sediments.
                                 A kinetic bioavailability model was then developed which can be used to estimate the relative bioavailability of trace metals
                                 from both different sediment phases and seawater under short-term laboratory conditions. This model was used to determine
                                 the bioavailability of Cu and Cd from several sediment phases (bentonite clay, humic acid, Fe(OH)₃) and seawater to the deposit-feeding
                                 polychaete worm, Abarenicola pacifica. The results suggest that, under natural conditions similar to those used in this study,
                                 the bioavailability of sediment-bound Cu and Cd to A. pacifica can be much more significant than that of seawater

                                 The topics include chemodynamics, toxicology, modeling and information systems. Due to the wealth of information on this topic,
                                 the texts of T. Kassim (ed.): Environmental Impact Assessment are published in three separate volumes: vol. 1: Concepts, Methodology
                                 and Chemical Analysis; vol. 2: Risk Analysis and vol. 3: Engineering Modeling and Sustainability. The book serves as a practical
                                 conceptual guide for those who have professional responsibility for the monitoring, design, management, or conduct of environmental
                                 impact assessment. It is believed that the book will prove useful to the reader who, regardless of disciplinary background,
                                 wants to examine in greater detail the kinds of interdisciplinary contributions to contemporary decision-making processes
