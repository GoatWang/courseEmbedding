Certain portions of Concourse’s website may contain a discussion of, and/or provide access to, Concourse’s positions and/or recommendations as of a specific prior date.

Moreover, no client or prospective client should assume that any such discussion serves as the receipt of, or a substitute for, personalized advice from Concourse or from any other investment professional.
Investing involves risks which may lead to losses, including loss of principal. Different types of investments involve varying degrees of risk and there can be no assurance that any specific investment will be profitable. Furthermore, past performance is not a predictor of future results. Concourse does not make any representation that any of its investments on behalf of clients will or are likely to achieve returns similar to those shown in the performance results presented.
Concourse is neither an attorney nor an accountant, and no portion of the website content should be interpreted as legal, accounting, or tax advice.

Each client and prospective client agrees as a condition precedent to his/her/its access to Concourse’s website, to release and hold harmless Concourse, its officers, directors, owners, employees and agents from any and all adverse consequences resulting from any of his/her/its actions and/or omissions which are independent of his/her/its receipt of personalized individual advice from Concourse.

Current regulations require financial institutions (including investment funds) to provide their investors with an initial and annual privacy policy notice describing the institution’s policies regarding the sharing of information about their investors. In connection with this requirement, we are providing this Privacy Policy Notice to each of our investors.
We do not disclose nonpublic personal information about our investors or former investors to third parties other than as described below. We collect information about you (such as name, address, social security number, assets and income) from our discussions with you, from documents that you may deliver to us (such as subscription documents) and in the course of providing services to you. In order to service your account and effect your transactions, we may provide your personal information to our affiliates and to firms that assist us in servicing your account and have a need for such information, such as our prime broker, legal counsel, fund administrator, auditors, or accountants. Because this information is essential to Fund operations, you cannot opt out of our sharing of this information. We do not otherwise provide information about you to outside firms, organizations or individuals except as required or permitted by law. Any party that receives this information will use it only for the services required and as allowed by applicable law or regulation, and is not permitted to share or use this information for any other purpose.
Except in those limited situations, we will not make any disclosures of information to other companies who may want to sell their products or services to you without your consent. We hope that the use of your information will result in improved service and responsiveness, access to new service offerings and detection of unusual behavior to help prevent unauthorized transactions or fraud within your account. We reserve the right to change this privacy policy. The examples contained within this privacy policy are illustrations and they are not intended to be exclusive. This notice complies with Federal law and regulations adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding privacy.

What are analysts saying about Dollar General Corporation stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Dollar General Corporation stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Dollar General remains committed toward better price management, merchandise initiatives and cost containment.  The company’s recent deal to acquire 322 stores from a small multi-price point retailer is also encouraging. We believe that the company’s strategic endeavors have helped it to deliver better-than-expected results for the second straight quarter, as it posted first-quarter fiscal 2017 financial numbers. Upbeat performance and the news of recent store buyout deal, prompted management to raise its sales outlook. As a result the stock has outperformed the industry in the past three months. Meanwhile, Trump’s suggestion of reducing food stamps program by $193 billion, which is nearly 25% of the budget for the program, will have a detrimental effect. Cut in SNAP benefit will hamper the company’s performance as people with low income will have less money to spend and could restrict their spending to low margin products." (6/21/2017)
2. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "Shares ended up despite the downward guidance as investors took comfort in mgmt. comments on pricing. GM% was better than expected and mgmt. noted it was in a solid price position. The underlying message is that competition has eased up for now. We highlighted this in our Jan. note as we saw WMT avg. basket pricing increase in several markets (dollar store price survey) as its price investments were more significant in our grocery studies." (3/17/2017)
3. Guggenheim analysts commented, "Lowering Estimates and PT on Largely One-Time Labor Investments'Remain Buy-Rated. DG is proactively investing in its business to drive secular share gains but doing so in a manner that is more sustainable, less destabilizing, and more likely to earn a reasonable return. Rather than simply cut prices, the company is spending $70M to upgrade the talent and performance of its 13,000 store managers. This can have a direct, positive impact on in-stock conditions, customer service, and shrink and does not feed the price war narrative. We are lowering our 2017-2019 estimates to reflect these investments (and rebasing of EBIT margin) and our PT to $85 from $90 but remain Buy-rated." (3/17/2017)

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year
