About | Two Sigma














































About
More than 1,100 people who believe the scientific method is the best way to approach investing. Ideas backed up with information. And improved by iteration. That’s Two Sigma.
We’re not your typical investment manager. We follow principles of technology and innovation as much as principles of investment management. Fields like machine learning and distributed computing guide us. Since 2001, we’ve searched for ways that these kinds of technologies can make us better at what we do. We never stop researching and developing.
In the process, we work to help real people. Through our investors, we support the retirements of millions around the world. And we help fund breakthrough research, education and a wide range of charities and foundations.

Co-Chairmen


        
          David Siegel and John Overdeck are recognized pioneers in the fields of technology and investment management. They have more than 40 years of experience in the development of computer-driven, model-based trading systems. Together, David and John run the company.  They work together to drive the mission and strategy for Two Sigma, nurture talent and shape the company’s unique culture.
        




David Siegel, Co-Chairman
Prior to co-founding Two Sigma, David was Chief Technology Officer and Managing Director at Tudor Investment Corporation. After earning his doctorate, David joined D. E. Shaw & Co. and rose to become the company's first chief information officer. While at D. E. Shaw & Co., he founded and served as president of FarSight Financial Services, the world's first integrated personal financial services website, which was acquired by Merrill Lynch. A graduate of Princeton University, David received a PhD in computer science from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he studied at its Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. David has had a lifelong interest in building intelligent computational systems and continues to actively pursue this mission at Two Sigma today.
He currently sits on the Board of Directors of the Hamilton Insurance Group, the Scratch Foundation, NYC FIRST and NAF. In addition, David is a trustee of Carnegie Hall, an Executive Advisory Committee Member of the NSF/MIT Center for Brains, Minds & Machines and an advisory board member of Stanford’s Center on Philanthropy and Civil Society.
David is also a member of the Cornell Tech Board of Overseers and a member of the Corporation Visiting Committee for the MIT Media Laboratory.



John Overdeck, Co-Chairman
John began his career at D.E. Shaw & Co, where he rose to Managing Director. While at D. E. Shaw, he directed the firm’s Japanese equity and equity-linked investments and supervised the firm’s London investment management affiliate.  Following D.E. Shaw and before starting Two Sigma, John spent two years at Amazon.com, first serving as Vice President and technical assistant to Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos. He went on to lead customer relationship management at Amazon.com, directing Amazon’s renowned personalization, community, and targeted marketing features and technology.  He also led critical efforts to make Amazon’s customer technology more scalable.
A lifelong math enthusiast, John won a silver medal for the United States in the 27th International Mathematics Olympiad. He earned a B.S. in Mathematics (with distinction) and a M.S. in Statistics from Stanford University. John currently serves on the Board of Directors of the Hamilton Insurance Group. In addition to his family’s charitable activities, John also serves on the boards of the Robin Hood Foundation, the Institute for Advanced Study and is the acting Chair of the National Museum of Mathematics. 



Founders
Two Sigma Investments was founded in 2001 by David Siegel, John Overdeck and Mark Pickard. They shared the belief that innovative technology and data science could help discover value in the world's data to consistently deliver value for clients.
It is this belief that drives Two Sigma's ongoing development of new technologies that synthesize and integrate vast amounts of data, yielding results that seek to drive smarter investing and more consistent returns.

Benefits
We take care of our people. We offer an extremely competitive benefits package, including medical, dental and disability insurance, and flexible healthcare and commuter spending accounts. We also offer a 401(K) plan with partial company match.

People do their best work when their mind and body are in harmony. So our New York campus has three on-site gyms, each with locker rooms, showers and same-day laundry service. We also have free weekly well-being classes including fitness boot camp, yoga and meditation.

Spark

Spark
Many TS-ers have ideas for new projects, but limited ways to explore them. Others have valuable insight to bring to projects, but might not know about all that's going on across the company. Enter Spark. It’s our internal open-source platform where people can share and collaborate on ideas. It all comes together in Spark Day, where selected ideas are presented to the entire firm. Starting this year, the people behind the audience favorite will win sabbatical time to bring their vision to life.

Open Source
At Two Sigma, we use Open Source Software, and we’re passionate about giving back to the programming community.

We think of Beaker as the Universal Translator for Data Scientists. We hope you enjoy it as much as we do. You’ll find more information on it here.

Gaming
It’s needless to say we love games, but it's worth repeating. There are games to play all over our offices, from ping pong, to shuffleboard, to Connect 6 to everything in between. Of course there’s also chess, and we’ve had a fair share of chess champions come visit us. And we host a lot of gaming events, including game nights where we play Agricola, Dominion, Roborally, Solarquest, and much more. We pride ourselves on being competitive but not combative.

We want to help everyone here grow and get better. And as our company gets bigger, the opportunities for growth multiply. To make sure everyone finds the work that’s best for them, we’ve created an Internal Opportunities site. It lets people find new openings in the company and follow-up on the ones they like. And if you’d like to pursue another opportunity, but aren’t sure where to start, our recruitment team is always here to help.

Our music studio is a great place to step away, whether you’re a musician or a fan, and we've got many of both. We have a drum kit; percussion kit; keyboard; electric and acoustic guitars and other string instruments; amps; speakers; mixers; production software; and a karaoke machine. We've even got two turntables and some microphones. Want to come and just jam? Far out. Want to record and mix your own tracks? Have at it. Want to just gather around the piano and sing carols?

Teaching and learning are woven into everything we do. We encourage everyone to contribute – by teaching classes, leading study groups or brown-bag lunch talks, writing for our internal blog, screening movies, or sharing their knowledge another way. We frequently host guest speakers who are world leaders in their field. And we even have a team, called Organizational & People Development, whose mission is to identify learning needs in our company and develop programs that meet them.

Good times
We throw great parties – because we like to celebrate our successes, and well, because we just like parties. Our annual summer outing, where TS-ers and their families spend a day soaking up the sun at some secret location, is a perennial favorite. Another is our annual holiday party, whose venues have included space shuttles and submarines. Other fiestas include New Sigma, where we welcome all new hires, and Birthday Snacks Day, when dessert is served to everyone to honor that month’s birthdays.
