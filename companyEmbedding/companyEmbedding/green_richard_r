WE DO … ROBOTS



RG2 Gripper
The RG2 gripper is a flexible electric gripper specially designed for robots from Universal Robots. The long stroke allows the gripper to handle a variety of object sizes. Adjusting the gripping force allows the gripper to handle both delicate and heavy object. The standard fingers can be used with many different object. It is also possible to fit custom fingers. The installation complexity is minimal as the cable attaches directly onto any robot from Universal Robots. All configurations of the gripper is controlled from the Universal Robots software.



WE DO … SENSORS


The QM42VT Vibration and Temperature Sensor
The QM42VT Vibration and Temperature Sensor makes it easy to monitor a machine’s health. It measures RMS velocity and temperature so that problems can be detected before they become too severe and cause additional damage or result in unplanned downtime. Paired with a Banner wireless Node, it can provide local indication, wirelessly send the signal to a central location, and send the vibration and temperature data to the Gateway for collection and trending.



Easily monitor machine health by sending info wirelessly to wherever you need it
Avoid machine failures and delays by detecting problems early
Reduce downtime and plan maintenance more efficiently
Monitor a variety of machines to suit your needs: motors, pumps, compressors, fans, blowers, gear boxes



 
WE DO … AUTOMATION

 
Parker’s new PAC Terminal (PT) Thin-client HMI

Parker is excited to announce the release of the PAC Terminal. The PAC Terminal (PT) is a thin client HMI developed to work seamlessly with the Parker Automation Controller (PAC). With the PAC handling the control and HMI logic, the PT is responsible for displaying the embedded HMI as well as sending touch screen input from the user back to the PAC. As a thin client, the PT significantly reduces the overall system costs when compared to a traditional HMI—especially if it is desired for multiple PTs to connect to a single PAC.





WE DO … SAFETY


OS32C Safety Laser Scanner
The OS32C Safety Laser Scanner is the world’s most compact Type 3 safety laser scanner. It’s now available with selectable 30, 40, 50 and 70 mm resolutions, and EtherNet/IP capabilities. This makes the OS32C an ideal safeguarding solution covering a wider array of area and machine safety application.


WE DO … HEAT & CONTROL


WATCONNECT® CONTROL PANELS
WATCONNECT® standard control panels that are quickly configured to your specific application requirements and delivered within two weeks. WATCONNECT panels integrate Watlow’s high-quality heater, sensor, temperature controller and power controller products for a complete thermal solution. Normally, competitive custom panels require significantly longer lead times. The broad range of standard features allow customers to quickly configure panels that usually would be considered custom for delivery within two weeks.
Watlow’s customers will be impressed with the speed and ease of specifying, selecting, pricing, ordering and delivery. WATCONNECT panels are flexible and scalable; there are thousands of configurable, pre-engineered panel solutions available.

Stunning speaker systems


            
                Richard Grant (UK): +44 ( 0) 7802 987 147     
  Grammy nominated Professional musician & Producer “Adam Wakeman” reviewed a pair of “rgproduct” speakers during a mastering session: “…clarity and depth…beautiful, innovative designs…amazing stereo imagery…”  read more…   

    Quite simply an awesome object in a beautiful natural aged stone finish. The Medallion can be finished in bespoke colours and a Gold finish option shown below: The latest technology in drive units is incorporated in the Medallion mount. Features dynamic 55 Hz to 16 KHz fatigue free listening response; utilising pure drive unit technology has no extraneous circuitry to hinder audio performance. Enclosure material is a tough Polymer “cold ceramic” offering minimal audio colouration or distortion as well as high weather resistance. I Recommend using High Fidelity Amplification providing minimum 50 to 100w/channel. Connect using discrete banana type socket connection; Easy fix Banana plugs provided with each unit.           Pricing & Finish options (per single unit): 
  Aged Stone/matching medallion:£2,750.00 (approx $4,400)       Aged Stone/Contrast  medallion:£2,995.00 (approx $4,800)     
   An heirloom quality speaker Designed and hand made in England featuring Luxury soft Gold finish with contrast Natural Raffia detail. The latest technology in drive units is incorporated in the 3rd Eye position of enlightenment. Features dynamic 55 Hz to 16 KHz fatigue free listening response; utilising pure drive unit technology has no extraneous circuitry to hinder audio performance.  Enclosure material is a tough Polymer “cold ceramic” offering minimal audio colouration or distortion. Amplification requirements, technical and shipping as per rgproduct:Olympian. 
     Pricing & Finish options (per single unit):                            Aged Stone/Natural Raffia:   £2,750.00 (approx 4,400 USD)       Antique Gold/Colour Raffia: £2,995.00 ( approx 4,800 USD)
Raffia detail and finish colour can be amended to suit your thematic and design needs (cost option). Please email me with your requirements.     

           I recommend an intentionally  miss-matched pair or quad arrangement to really enliven your home with art works both beautiful and practical. Imagine Four stunning sculpture pieces, each historic and rare. One in each corner of your viewing room providing your surround system audio. Or a selection of ancient architectural detritus, each filling your interior or exterior environment with music. 
   

One-off designs in pairs or batches to suit corporate branding, interior design and Restaurant/Retail environments or any marketing concept.
