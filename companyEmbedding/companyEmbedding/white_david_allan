Product Story
"Geiger Levels is a smart and intuitive way for technology-based workers to access power and data, and to organize their project-oriented workflows using separate working planes and lower stacking surfaces. Today's multi-generational workforce is reshaping conventional ideas about how and where work is done. Levels is furniture that supports this evolution," says Levels designer David Allan Pesso. Its trimmer scale gives Levels modern appeal and resolves the challenge of smaller office footprints.



Product Story
Built-in value engineering meets the cost requisite for mid-manager offices, in furniture crafted using the same material and finish standards of other Geiger casegoods. With GREENGUARD certification and FSC-certified materials, Levels can contribute to healthier workplaces and provides a lasting platform protected by Geiger's 12-year warranty.

    An Open Letter
    to the priests of the Campos diocese










By Dr. David Allen White, PhD
Dr. Allen White is the author of the renowned book, The 
Mouth of the Lion 

[available from the Angelus Press], which 
details the resistance of Catholic Tradition (led by the late 


Bishop de Castro Mayer and his faithful priests) 
against Modernism in the diocese of Campos, Brazil.
In addition to his book, Dr. Allen White is a professor of 
literature at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, MD and also gives 
occasional lectures at St. Thomas Aquinas Seminary in Winona, MN, many of 
which have been recorded are available via 

www.stasaudio.org.








My Brothers in Christ and My Friends,
With great sorrow I read today that you are now "considered perfectly 
    inserted in the Holy Roman Catholic Apostolic Church." I never knew you 
    left. During those memorable days when I visited you in 1991 while doing 
    research for my book on your great and honored Bishop Antonio de Castro 
    Mayer, I had the privilege of witnessing the Catholic life of your diocese, 
    the most perfect embodiment of the Catholic life in a contemporary setting 
    which I have ever witnessed and so much more than I could ever imagine. What 
    a blessing you have been granted! What extraordinary graces you have 
    received, undoubtedly through the prayers and sacrifices and work of the 
    unique bishop who tended the flock of Campos as shepherd for so many 
    decades. In what way were you not then Catholic? In what way were you 
    separated from the Church?
Your announcement that the Holy Father has 
    signed a "letter of entrance," welcoming you "in full ecclesial 
    communion" along with "the Catholic faithful (you) assist" 
    suggests that there had been some separation with Rome, that you were in 
    fact in some sort of schism. Had not the Catholic Faith been handed down 
    intact and in perfect fullness from Our Lord Jesus Christ through His 
    Apostles and through the bishops of His Church until it came to be passed 
    throughout the Diocese of Campos in our time by the fully Catholic Bishop 
    Antonio de Castro Mayer? What did he teach you which was not Catholic? Where 
    did he lead you that left you separated from Rome and thus needing to 
    "return"?
The sad fact is clear, even 
    though the details are not yet fully revealed. You have signed an agreement 
    with Modernist Rome and thereby turned your back on the great legacy of your 
    great and beloved bishop who left you in April of 1991, left you because God 
    called him home, left you secure and Catholic and well provided for. His 
    legacy has now been compromised through the compromise which must have been 
    made with the current power players in Modernist and Progressive Rome, 
    distinct and separate itself from Eternal Rome. To affect a compromise, one 
    must assume leaving ones position and moving toward a middle ground. The 
    position you must leave is the fullness of the Tradition of the Catholic 
    Faith; the new position you must reach is closer to the outskirts of the New 
    Rome, the Rome of bureaucrats and ambiguous talk and ecumenism and 
    collegiality and religious liberty, all the temptations and errors against 
    which your good pastor so courageously and so comprehensively warned and 
    instructed you.
Alexander Solzhenitsyn in his memorable and 
    insightful address at the Harvard commencement ceremonies in 1978 stated 
    that "a decline in courage may be the most striking feature which an 
    outsider observer notices in the West in our days." For many years the 
    name of the Diocese of Campos has brought to Catholic souls battling error 
    and decay in their own parishes, the clear and resounding call to Catholic 
    courage. In our apostate times, perseverance becomes an act of courage. The 
    colossal moral and spiritual stature of the small human man who was your 
    bishop stood as a model for Catholic courage. Do you now cut his memory and 
    legacy down to merely human size? Will the name of Campos no longer loudly 
    ring with courage but echo distantly with compromise?
Who can doubt your discomfort or not sympathize 
    with the loneliness you must have felt over the years? A small group of 
    priests, organized together as the Priestly Society of St. Jean Marie Vianney, carrying on the work of Mother Church in isolation, unnoticed, 
    ignored, except when vilified by the voices of those who long ago made their 
    compromises. But what could be more indicative of your true role as alter 
    Christi if not your work in loneliness and sorrow, with those mocking 
    and derisive voices assailing you? To imagine yourselves now "inserted in 
    the Holy Roman Catholic Apostolic Church" is no solution. You may have a 
    few moments in bonhomie with red and scarlet and purple in the cool marble 
    palaces of the Eternal City, but will Tradition continue in the Diocese of 
    Campos after the compromising and celebrating? How have all other 
    traditional groups fared once they have put themselves under the sway of 
    Modernist Rome? I will not give you the litany of loss and change for you 
    are already aware of it; I will just ask you where is the traditional bishop 
    promised to the Fraternity of St. Peter fourteen years ago? Are the 
    prelates in Modernist Rome to be trusted? Will they deliver to you on the 
    promises they have made? I quote the wise Solzhenitsyn again, "Should one 
    point out that from ancient times decline in courage has been considered the 
    beginning of the end?"
You have announced that in a solemn ceremony to 
    be held in the Cathedral of the Most Holy Savior by His Eminence, Cardinal 
    Dario Castrillon, Prefect of the Holy Congregation for the Clergy, in 
    the name of the Holy Father, the pope, on the 18th January, there 
    will be a reading of documents and the singing of the Te Deum. The 
    18th of January also begins the "Week of Prayer for Christian 
    Unity" decreed by Rome which will culminate in the Day of Prayer for 
    Peace in Assisi on January 24th, the second such ecumenical 
    outrage in recent years, a kind of gathering condemned, as you well know, by 
    earlier popes. Bishop Antonio de Castro Mayer in a joint statement with 
    Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre spoke with the voice of Roman Catholic Tradition 
    in condemning the gathering of religions at Assisi in October of 1987 [sic; 
    the event actually occurred in 1986], the 
    first such outrageous ecumenical prayer venture. Have you forgotten his wise 
    and proscriptive words? Will you now join your hands in prayer with 
    Modernist Rome as it openly violates the First Commandment of God and prays 
    with Lutherans and Anglicans and Muslims and Deists and animists in defiance 
    of Catholic Tradition and then will you pretend still to be traditionalists? 
    Have you forgotten your own words when in your public Profession of Faith in 
    1982 you rejected "the ecumenism that makes the Faith grow cold and makes 
    us forget our Catholic identity, seeking to negate the antagonism between 
    light and darkness, between Christ and Belial..." ?
You may protest that you will maintain 
    Traditionalism in your diocese, that you will still celebrate the Mass of 
    All Time and teach the old catechisms and carry on in the traditional ways. 
    But do you not understand that in compromising you accept an absurd 
    contradiction, an illogical proposition that any sane mind must condemn - that Mother Church in Her Divine Authority can teach contradictory ideas at 
    different times and pretend they are both true. How can your Traditionalism 
    co-exist with Modernism? How can the Mass of All Time be equivalent with the 
    newfangled human contrivance? How can Catholics be forbidden from ecumenical 
    prayer at one time and then encouraged in such actions at a later time? As 
    Hamlet says, when staring at the skull of Yorick, the "gorge rises at 
    it." Such a stark and deadly affront to reason is horrifying. Are you 
    now willing to play this absurd Modernist game with Modernist Rome? Many 
    weary and troubled Catholics will feel the weight of your decision. Already 
    the remarks are circulating that you have "sold out" and "caved in" and 
    "given up". The truth is you have abandoned reason. May I remind you of the 
    words of a prayer you have often prayed? "...Sicut erat in principio et 
    nunc et semper et in saecula saeculorum..."  As it was in the beginning 
    is now and ever shall be, world without end.
In his courageous statement of June 30, 1988, in Econe, on the occasion of the consecration of 
    traditional bishops by 
    Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, your courageous Bishop Antonio de Castro Mayer 
    in his message of support and unity spoke the following words:  

It is sorrowful to see the 
      lamentable blindness of so many confreres in the Episcopacy and the 
      priesthood, who do not see, or who do not wish to see, the present crisis 
      in order to be faithful to the mission which God has confided to us, to 
      resist the modernism at present ruling.

You no longer "wish to see the present 
    crisis"; you no longer wish "to resist the modernism at present 
    ruling." By your action of compromise with the "modernism at present 
    ruling," you have increased the sorrow of your great bishop; you have 
    increased the sorrow of your devoted friends. Our Lord in His agony in the 
    garden certainly suffered from the hatred of His enemies, but such suffering 
    was nothing compared to the certain knowledge that He would be betrayed and 
    denied by His friends and disciples.  
Be assured of my prayers.





In Christ,
David Allen White

Dostoevsky and the Mystery of Russia
by David Allen White - Fall
              2001
The novel is the baby of the major  
    literary forms. The lyric poem stretches back to the Homeric Hymns and the 
    Psalms, the epic to Homer; drama prizes were being distributed in Athens in 
    the fifth century B.C. and the short story is as old as the myth, the fables 
    of Aesop and the parables of Our Lord Jesus Christ, not surprisingly a master 
    of the short narrative given His larger creation. The novel, however, rises 
    out of a potent combination of the printing press, the dawn of the Industrial 
    Revolution, the rise of the middle class and an increase in leisure time. 
    The new reader with some time on his hands and some pocket money quite reasonably 
    wanted to read about what he knew best ­ himself. The novel thus is born in 
    realism and becomes the place where the writer captures or recreates the details 
    of recognizable worlds. The first acclaimed and successful popular novel, 
    and perhaps still the greatest, is Cervantes Don 
    Quixote (1605). The dusty roads, the inns, the mountains, the cheese 
    and the bread and the rusty armor, all are rooted in a reality new to literature.
Cervantes great novel established 
    another significant defining element of the novel at its inception. The early 
    novels were comic in nature. Examining a real world, they of necessity were 
    social. Many of the early novels depicted the usual social dance of love and 
    marriage, work and play, gain and loss. Even the hugely popular Robinson Crusoe 
    (1720) looked at the attempt to build a little world 
    of ones own on a desert island. Comedys central concern is the tension between 
    individuals and the society in which they attempt to live and such tensions 
    rooted the novel in a recognizable, but artistically shaped, real social order.
Not until the eighteenth century 
    in France did the novel take a turn down more shadowy lanes. Perhaps because 
    the French knew in their deepest being the dark possibilities of social disruption, 
    their novelists turned the comic dance of the novel into a more solemn walk. 
    Novels such as Manon Lescaut (1731) and 
    Les 
    Liaisons Dangereuses (1782) begin to 
    direct the movement of the novel down darker and more haunted paths.
The nineteenth century saw 
    the haunted darkness expand in the gothic novel and the novel of unfulfilled 
    romance. The novel seemed capable of exploring all possibilities of human 
    experience and new perspectives opened up, most importantly, the perspective 
    of the tragic.
Tragedy is the rara avis among literary forms. The grandest and most powerful 
    of visions, tragedy is the most difficult to capture. Greece in the fifth 
    century B.C., England at the turn of the seventeenth century, France in the 
    latter part of the seventeenth century all produced tragedy, but the nineteenth 
    century saw tragedy move into new forms, the opera or music drama and the 
    novel. America produced one great tragic novel, Melvilles Moby Dick (1851). When the last golden arch falls into the dust 
    and the last video or computer screen goes blank, America will be remembered 
    for two astonishing accomplishments ­ the placing of a man on the moon, the 
    result of our great science and engineering skills and our great wealth, and 
    a novel about a mad sea captain and a white whale, the product of our troubled 
    spiritual foundations.
Tragedy in the novel reached 
    its apotheosis in the nineteenth century in Russia in the works of those
    two  giants of the long fiction form, Count Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoevsky.
    
    Tolstoy certainly possessed great genius and his accomplishments are remarkable.
     His influence cannot necessarily be called beneficial, however. His great
    
    epic/tragic novel War And Peace serves up 
    a vision of history firmly in line with contemporary philosophical thought.
     Tolstoys view of history denies the great man theory of history and,
     operating  in line with Hegelian principles, presents history as an inevitable
     flow of 
    events. The great man in the novel, Napoleon, by trying to impose his own
     will on events is crushed by the forces of inevitable movement, while the
    
    wise old Russian general, Kutuzov, observes the pattern of the sweep of change
     and accommodates himself to it, thus securing victory. The greatness of
    Tolstoys 
    vision lies not in his illustration of recent theories but in his creation
     of the world of Russia in the Napoleonic wars, the soirees, the battles,
    the 
    landscape, the first love of Natasha, the courage of Andrei, the questions
     of Pierre. 
Tolstoys greatest tragic vision 
    lies in Anna Karenina, a profound 
    moral tragedy. This masterwork also provides insight into Tolstoys Christian 
    vision. He believed himself a Christian and spoke the language of Christianity, 
    but with a restricted vocabulary. Tolstoys Christianity is grounded in forgiveness, 
    charity, virtue, brotherhood and peace. It is a vision stripped of the supernatural. 
    This is the reason that Tolstoy became so important to the peace movements 
    of the mid-twentieth century. His views strongly influenced men such as Gandhi 
    and Martin Luther King, Jr. The crux of this vision of action attaches man 
    only to earth; no transcendent spirituality or drama of eternal salvation 
    informs the work.
Dostoevskys works bubble over 
    with life-and-death struggles of suffering and loss, salvation and damnation. 
    Born in 1821, he did not come as did most other major Russian writers of the 
    century from the landed gentry. His father, an authoritarian figure, worked 
    as a doctor in a small town. His mother, a devout woman, had an enormous influence 
    on her children. In his later days he stated, I came from a pious Russian 
    family. In our family we knew the Gospel almost from the cradle.1 His mother read him the Gospels as well as the lives 
    of the saints. The tales permeated his imagination from his earliest years.
A single episode from his childhood 
    provided another defining moment in his faith. The family would leave the 
    small town where his father worked to vacation in the countryside. On one 
    such vacation, the young Dostoevsky was walking in the woods when he heard 
    voices shouting that a wolf was loose in the area. The young boy, terrified, 
    began trying to retrace his steps but found himself lost in the woods. He 
    saw a peasant plowing a field in the distance and ran toward him. The man 
    smiled and comforted the boy, pointed him toward home and reassured him by 
    saying his eye would remain on the youngster all the way to the boys home. 
    The peasant then said, Now, Christ be with you, now, go! and he made the 
    sign of the cross over the child, afterward crossing himself. Dostoevsky remembered 
    that he returned home with a feeling of complete security. 
He went to study at a military-engineering 
    school, even though from his earliest days he hoped to be a writer. His father 
    insisted that he receive a science-based education and the young man complied 
    with his fathers wishes. He proved to be an adequate student in a curriculum 
    that along with the science and engineering studies included religion, history, 
    architecture, Russian language and literature, French language and literature, 
    German language and literature, portrait drawing and art history.
He immersed himself in the 
    popular ideas of the day and read heavily in the great romantic writers ­ 
    Schiller, Hugo, Balzac, his first publication being a translation of Balzacs 
    Eugenie Grandet. He absorbed a theory of German philosopher and romantic 
    aesthetician Friedrich Schelling who taught him that art is a means of metaphysical 
    cognition, the means by which the highest transcendent truths are revealed 
    to mankind.2 He imagined himself as an artist with 
    a high calling and saw his art as possessing a high mission for the good of 
    the Russian people.
He served his time in the military 
    and then decided to pursue his lifes ambition to become a writer. His first 
    novel Poor Folk (1846) received 
    very positive reviews as it powerfully stirred up compassion for the disadvantaged, 
    being in line with the social concerns of the day. By 1848 he had begun to 
    associate himself with the Petrashevski group in St. Petersburg, young intellectuals 
    devoted to the study and implementation of the ideas of the French utopian 
    socialists. The socialist movement in St. Petersburg consisted of two separate 
    wings: those who based their ideas on Christian principles of assisting the 
    poor and downtrodden, and the atheist faction who abandoned any mention of 
    Christianity, claiming its adherents had done nothing over the centuries to 
    improve social conditions. Dostoevsky felt himself torn between the two groups, 
    longing to be intellectually radical but possessed of a heart shaped by the 
    Gospel reading and saints lives from his childhood.
In 1849 the group was arrested 
    and charged with having read banned material and setting up a printing press 
    to distribute controversial and forbidden material. Dostoevsky was condemned 
    to death with the others. The morning of the execution, wearing the hoods 
    on their heads and hearing the guns cocked, they learned that their sentences 
    had been commuted to exile and imprisonment in Siberia.
The arrival at the prison in 
    Siberia returned his thoughts to his childhood. Outside the walls, women who 
    had followed their husbands into exile waited and watched. They pleaded with 
    the officers to free the new prisoners and when their requests were refused, 
    the women handed copies of the New Testament to the prisoners and, making 
    the sign of the cross in the direction of the inmates, called out blessings 
    on them.
Dostoevsky absorbed the New 
    Testament in prison. He also learned an important life lesson. Earlier, in 
    a letter to his brother Mikhail, he had written, Man is an enigma. This enigma 
    must be solved. And if you spend all your life at it, dont say you have wasted 
    your time; I occupy myself with this enigma because I wish to be a man.3 Part of the enigma clarified for him during his prison 
    years. He discovered that not all the underprivileged were high-minded or 
    good. Many were degenerate scum. He rejected the noble peasant idea found 
    in most of Tolstoys writing and realized men must be judged one by one, on 
    their individual merits. Social class could not be used as a key to defining 
    character.
He also learned from experience 
    something about the savage nature of human beings. Through observation of 
    his fellow prisoners he saw that we are disordered creatures, subject to outbursts 
    of irrational passions and destructive action. The more the individual personality 
    was confined and controlled, the more subject it became to these frenetic 
    explosions of willfulness. Part of this turbulence could be defined as a desire 
    of the individual will to express its own freedom. Human freedom had a compulsive 
    need to demonstrate its own existence. Dostoevskys great biographer Joseph 
    Frank puts the idea this way, To fulfill this drive, men will sacrifice all 
    other goods and values; and if they are unable to satisfy it in any way, the 
    results can be disastrous.4
Dostoevsky himself proved this 
    disastrous freedom by making a bad marriage in 1858 and giving in to his 
    temptation for gambling, a vice that haunted him for his entire life but did 
    produce his brilliant dissection of the addiction, The Gambler. He also came to be afflicted with epilepsy. He distanced 
    himself from his old friends as his political views became more and more conservative. 
    He saw clearly that man does not above all need material well being in this 
    world, but rather spiritual redemption. What Christ taught mankind, he now 
    knew, was that salvation can come only through suffering. Man must be ready 
    to share the sufferings of Christ in order to find salvation. In a world increasingly 
    absorbed with progress and utopias and comfort, Dostoevsky shouts, No! Christ 
    lives and what He teaches us is that we must suffer.
Such belief could be neither 
    easy nor constant in the modern world.    I will tell you that I am a child
    of the century, a child of disbelief and doubt. I will remain so until the
    grave. How much terrible torture
    this thirst for faith has cost me and costs me even now which is all the
    stronger in my soul the more arguments I can find against it. And yet God
    sends me
    sometimes instants when I am completely calm. At those instants I love and
    feel loved by others and it is at those instants that 
    I have shaped for myself a Credo where everything is clear and sacred to
    me. This credo is very simple. Here it is: To believe that nothing is more
    beautiful,
    profound, sympathetic, reasonable, manly, and perfect than Christ. And I
    tell myself with a jealous love that not only is there nothing more but there
    can
    be nothing more. Even more, if someone proved to me that Christ is outside
    the truth and that in reality the truth were outside of Christ, then I should
    prefer to remain with Christ rather than with the truth.5
 Joseph Frank summarizes Dostoevskys view 
    of modern man in this way, Not to believe in Christ and immortality is to 
    be condemned to live in a senseless universe and the characters in his great 
    novels who reach this level of self-awareness inevitably destroy themselves 
    because by refusing to endure the torment of living without hope they have 
    become monsters in their misery.6 
    This great struggle between belief and disbelief informs all the great novels 
    from Notes From Underground 
    through The Brothers Karamazov. 
    After nursing his wife through her fatal illness and then losing his beloved 
    brother Mikhail, Dostoevsky was granted the grace of a devoted second wife, 
    Anna Grigoryevna Snitkina. Hired to be his secretary, she became his spiritual 
    consolation. He dictated to her the vast fictional canvases on which an array 
    of recognizable human souls struggle with grand passions and high ideas. Dmitri 
    Karamazov says God and the devil are fighting and the battlefield is the heart 
    of man. The novels of Dostoevsky come closer to the core of the modern dilemma 
    than any other body of modern literature and his knowledge of human beings 
    is the keenest in art since Shakespeare. 
But some great artists may 
    also be graced by God with another gift. Some artists have oracular flashes, 
    offering up profound prophetic pronouncements. Such instances stretch from 
    the vision of Vergil in his Fourth Eclogue (37 B.C.) which suggests the coming 
    of Our Lord as a child who will bring a reign of peace to a troubled world 
    to the chilling example of the Japanese man in Strindbergs play The Great Highway 
    (1909) who announces that he is named 
    for his native town Hiroshima just before he steps into a furnace and is incinerated. 
    No artist ever set down more accurate prophetic pronouncements than Dostoevsky. 
    In his great novel about the revolutionary movement, Demons (1872), Dostoevsky accurately predicted not only the 
    coming of socialism to Holy Mother Russia, as he termed his country, but also 
    the devastating consequences. At more than one point in the novel, he has 
    characters pronounce the cold fact that the revolution will triumph by radically 
    lopping off a hundred million heads.7 Shigalyov, the 
    character presenting the plan, admits a problem, for [s]tarting from unlimited 
    freedom, I conclude with unlimited despotism.8 Dostoevsky seemed to witness the abyss into which his 
    country would descend in the twentieth century. He combines his vision of 
    the nightmare looming over Russia with the incident of the Gadarene swine 
    from the Gospel of Luke, a passage he uses as one of the epigraphs for the 
    novel. He again quotes the passage from Luke when a character in the novel, 
    Sofya Matveevna Ulitin, a woman who travels from town to town passing out 
    Gospels, reads the words at the request of the dying liberal professor, Stepan 
    Trofimovich Verkhovensky, the man whose soft socialist teaching has unleashed 
    the demons in the next generation. After hearing the passage, the dying 
    professor says:



Terribly many thoughts occur to me now: you see,
                its 
          exactly like our Russia. These demons who come out of a sick man and enter 
          into the swine ­ its all the sores, all the miasmas, all the uncleanness, 
          all the big and little demons accumulated in our great and sick man, in our 
          Russia, for centuries, for centuries! Oui, cette Russie que jaimais toujours. 
          But a great will and a great thought will descend to her from on high, as 
          upon that insane demoniac, and out will come all these demons, all the uncleanness, 
          all the abomination that is festering on the surfaceand they will beg of 
          themselves to enter into swine. And perhaps they already have! It is us, us 
          and them, and Petrushaet les autres avec lui, and I, perhaps, first, at the 
          head, and we will rush, insane and raging, from the cliff down into the sea, 
          and all be drowned, and good riddance to us, because thats the most were
          fit for. 9 



Russia is presented as a possessed madman, out 
        of whom demons will rush, infect others and push multitudes of those so possessed 
        into destruction. The connection with Our Ladys message to the shepherd children 
        at Fatima on the eve of the Russian revolution is unmistakable: Russia will 
        spread her errors throughout the world.
Dostoevsky makes many Catholic 
        readers uncomfortable. In many of his novels he rails against the Catholic 
        Church. His knowledge of the Catholic Church, however, came largely from the 
        French socialists who had such a profound influence on him in his youth. Dostoevsky 
        viewed the Catholic Church as an institution that had abandoned its spiritual 
        beliefs in a quest to give mankind earthly happiness. He has the Catholic 
        Grand Inquisitor state to Christ in The Brothers Karamazov, You promised them heavenly bread, but, I repeat again, 
        can it compare with earthly bread in the eyes of the weak, eternally depraved, 
        and eternally ignoble human race?10
Dostoevsky related his sense 
        of how the Catholic social preoccupation worked. The Catholic priest searches 
        out some miserable workers family and gains their confidence. He feeds them 
        all, gives them clothes, provides heating, looks after the sick, buys medicine, 
        becomes the friend of the family and converts them to Catholicism.11 This sense of the socially obsessed Catholic Church 
        which places earthly comfort before redemptive suffering and peace on earth 
        before peace of soul must make any post-Vatican II Catholic uncomfortable 
        in its precision. The only error when applied to the Novus Ordo Church is 
        that the priest would no longer attempt to convert the family. The sentimental 
        socialism of the nineteenth-century French intellectuals whom Dostoevsky came 
        to despise found a happy home in the post-conciliar Church.
With his insistence on suffering 
        and salvation, the supernatural and sacrifice, Dostoevsky echoes many of the 
        teachings of the Catholic Church. With his prophetic vision of a possessed 
        Russia unleashing her demons into the world, he echoes the prophecies of Fatima, 
        and not only those prophecies that already come to fruition. The above quoted 
        words from the deathbed of Stepan Trofimovich Verkhovensky in Demons conclude with the following remarks:
 

But the sick man will be healed and sit at the feet 
          of Jesusand everyone will look in amazement. Dear, vous comprenez
          apres,
          but it excites me very much now. Vous comprenez 
          apres. Nous comprendrons ensemble.10



Russia will be healed; Russia will
        sit at the  feet of Our Savior and the whole world will be amazed. In the
        end my Immaculate  Heart will triumph, Russia will be converted and a period
        of peace will be 
        granted to mankind. Heaven granted this man, a modernist, a tormented doubter,
         a gambler and epileptic, a foe of socialistic Catholicism, a novelist, a
        glimpse 
        of the Fatima prophecies before heaven chose to reveal them to the world,
         a fact that presents us with mysteries as to the nature of art and the will
        
    of God. In his final novel, The 
        Brothers Karamazov , Dostoevsky has the wise elder Father Zossima on 
        the brink of the grave say, This star [the image of Christ] will shine forth
         from the East. The same promise has been given us by Our Lady and we who
          suffer here in the maelstrom of the modern atheistic, materialistic world
         
    still await that glorious moment.
