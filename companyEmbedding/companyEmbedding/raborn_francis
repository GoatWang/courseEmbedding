			Until his retirement in 2005, Mr. Raborn, age 73, served as Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of United Defense Industries, Inc. from its formation in 1994, and as a director since 1997. Mr. Raborn joined FMC Corporation, the predecessor of United Defense Industries, Inc., in 1977 and held a variety of financial and accounting positions, including Controller of the Defense Systems Group from 1985 to 1993, and Controller of the Special Products Group from 1979 to 1985. He also had international operating responsibilities as a result of being on the Boards of United Defense's Swedish subsidiary and Turkish joint venture. Prior to his tenure at FMC Corporation, Mr. Raborn worked for Chemetron Corporation and Ford Motor Company. Mr. Raborn currently serves on the board of directors of Spirit AeroSystems, Inc.
 
Our Board has concluded that Mr. Raborn should serve as a director because he brings with him significant experience in finance, accounting, defense, production and manufacturing as a result of his senior financial and accounting positions at FMC Corporation and United Defense Industries, Inc., or United Defense, and his position as the Chairman of Spirit AeroSystems, Inc.'s audit committee. Mr. Raborn also brings to our Board international operating experience as a result of his service on the boards of directors of United Defense's Swedish subsidiary and Turkish joint venture and valuable knowledge of corporate governance, compensation programs, and operations of other companies gained from his previous service on the board of directors of other public and private companies.
