Gershwind continued, "I would also like to extend my appreciation to Jeff Kaczka for his steadfast commitment, focus and effective leadership role during his tenure as CFO of the company. We recognize him for his many contributions to MSC's success and wish him the very best in his retirement," Gershwind said.

Ansell (ASX:ANN) is on the hunt for a new CFO following the resignation of longstanding finance chief, Rustom Jilla.Jilla has been with the industrial rubber glove, suit and condom manufacturer since 2002 as CFO, and is leaving to take up another position. Ansell said a transition schedule will be confirmed in coming weeks, and a global search is underway to find his successor. Jilla will depart after working out a month's notice.In the interim, current head of finance and business development for Ansell’s Industrial GBU, Francois Le Jeune, will act as CFO until a replacement is found.“Rustom has been a terrific leader and has guided Ansell through many challenges and to many success over the last 11 years,” Ansell CEO, Magnus Nicolin, said. “I have greatly appreciated Rustom’s support over the last three years, and we all wish him well in his next endeavour.”Ansell has had a busy 12 months, acquiring Comasec, Preferred Surgical Products and its Guangzhou distribution in the first half of the 2012/2013 financial year, followed by Brazilian clothing and Fall Production leader, Hercules, in January.
The company reported sales of US$648.1m in the six months to 31 December 2012, up six per cent year-on-year. However, EBIT was down eight per cent to US$68.8m and profit attributable to shareholders dropped 14 per cent to US$57.1m.Ansell blamed the figures on flat organic sales due to economic conditions particularly in Europe, but expected a strong second half thanks to new product releases, seasonality and the contribution from recent acquisitions.Follow CFO World Australia on Twitter: @CFOworld_AU, or take part in the CFO World conversation on LinkedIn: CFO World.
