	SUBJECT TO COMPLETION, DATED OCTOBER 22, 2012






	Prospectus



























	$100,000,000

	of

	Common Stock

	Offered by the Company






	500,000 Shares

	of

	Common Stock

	Offered by the Selling Stockholders



















	        This prospectus relates to common stock that we may sell from time to time in one or more offerings up to a total public offering price of
	$100,000,000 on terms to be determined at the time of sale. In addition, selling stockholders to be named in a prospectus supplement may, from time to time in one or more offerings, offer and sell up
	to 500,000 shares of our common stock. In the prospectus supplement relating to any sales by the selling stockholders, we will, among other things, identify the number of shares of our common stock
	that each of the selling stockholders will be selling. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of our common stock by selling stockholders, but we may pay certain registration and offering fees
	and expenses.




	        The
	prospectus provides a general description of the securities we or the selling stockholders may offer. We will provide the specific terms of the securities offered in one or more
	supplements to this prospectus. We may also authorize one or more free writing prospectuses to be provided to you in connection with these offerings. The prospectus supplement and any related free
	writing prospectus may add, update or change information contained in this prospectus. You should carefully read this prospectus, the applicable prospectus supplement and any related free writing
	prospectus, as well as the documents incorporated by reference herein or therein before you invest in any of our securities. This prospectus may not be used to offer and sell securities unless
	accompanied by a prospectus supplement.




	        We
	may offer and sell these securities to or through one or more underwriters, dealers and agents, or directly to purchasers, on a continuous or delayed basis. In addition, certain
	selling stockholders may offer and sell our securities from time to time, together or separately. If we or the selling stockholders use underwriters, dealers or agents to sell the securities, we will
	name them and describe their compensation in a prospectus supplement. The price to the public of those securities and the net proceeds we or any selling stockholders expect to receive from that sale
	will also be set forth in a prospectus supplement.




	        Our
	common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol "VRTU." On October 18, 2012, the last reported sales price of our common stock was $17.35 per share.
















	        



	Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should review carefully the risks and uncertainties described under the heading
	"Risk Factors" contained in this prospectus beginning on page 4 and any applicable prospectus supplement, and under similar headings in the other documents that are incorporated by reference
	into this prospectus.

















	        



	Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved of these
	securities or determined if this prospectus is truthful or complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.








	   




	The
	date of this prospectus is        , 2012.

	an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities other than the securities described in the prospectus or such accompanying prospectus supplement or an offer to sell or the
	solicitation of an offer to buy such securities in any circumstances in which such offer or solicitation is unlawful. You should assume that the information appearing in this prospectus, any

	ABOUT THIS PROSPECTUS






	        This prospectus is part of a registration statement that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, using a
	"shelf" registration process. Under this shelf process, we may sell the securities described in this prospectus up to a total public offering price of $100,000,000 (or its equivalent in foreign or
	composite currencies), and the selling stockholders to be named in a prospectus supplement to this prospectus may sell up to an aggregate amount of 500,000 shares of our common stock in one or more
	offerings.




	        This
	prospectus provides you with a general description of the securities offered by us or the selling stockholders. Each time we or the selling stockholders sell securities, we will
	provide a prospectus supplement that will contain specific information about the terms of that offering. We may also authorize one or more free writing prospectuses to be provided to you that may
	contain material information about the terms of that offering. The prospectus supplement and any related free writing prospectus that we may authorize to be provided to you may also add to, update or
	change information contained in the prospectus or in any documents that we have incorporated by reference into this prospectus, and, accordingly, to the extent inconsistent, information in this
	prospectus is superseded by the information in the prospectus supplement or the related free writing prospectus.




	        Unless
	the context otherwise requires, all references to "we," "us," "our company" or "the company" in this prospectus refer collectively to Virtusa Corporation and its subsidiaries.















	CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS






	        This prospectus and documents incorporated by reference into this prospectus and any prospectus supplement or free writing prospectus
	include forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. All statements
	other than statements of historical facts contained in this prospectus and documents incorporated by reference into this prospectus and any prospectus supplement or free writing prospectus, including
	statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, business strategy and plans and our objectives for future operations, are forward-looking statements. The words "believe,"
	"may," "will," "estimate," "continue," "anticipate," "intend," "expect" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements
	largely on our estimates of our financial results and our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of
	operations, business strategy, short term and long-term business operations and objectives, and financial needs. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks,
	uncertainties and assumptions, including those described in the section entitled "Risk Factors" in this prospectus and any accompanying prospectus supplement or free writing prospectus or in our most
	recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and in our other filings with the SEC that are incorporated by reference in this
	prospectus or any accompanying prospectus supplement. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our
	management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially
	from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make.




	        You
	should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable,
	we cannot guarantee that the future results, levels of activity, performance or events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur. Moreover, neither we nor
	any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of the forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason
	to conform

	RISK FACTORS






	        Investing in our securities involves risk. The prospectus supplement applicable to the securities we offer will contain a discussion of
	the risks applicable to an investment in
	our company and to the securities that we are offering under that prospectus supplement. Prior to making a decision about investing in our securities, you should carefully consider the specific
	factors discussed under the heading "Risk Factors" in the applicable prospectus supplement, together with all of the other information contained or incorporated by reference in the prospectus
	supplement or appearing or incorporated by reference in this prospectus. You should also consider the risks, uncertainties and assumptions discussed under the heading "Risk Factors" included in our
	most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, as revised or supplemented by our most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, each of which are on file with the SEC and
	are incorporated herein by reference, and which may be amended, supplemented or superseded from time to time by other reports we file with the SEC in the future. The risks and uncertainties described
	in the documents incorporated by reference herein are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know about or that we currently believe are not material
	may also adversely affect our business. If any of these risks and uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected in a material
	way. This could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, perhaps significantly, and you may lose part or all of your investment.















	USE OF PROCEEDS






	        Except as described in the applicable prospectus supplement, we anticipate using the net proceeds from the sale of the securities for
	general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and other business opportunities, capital expenditures and working capital. While we have no current plans for any specific acquisitions at this
	time, we believe opportunities may exist from time to time to expand our current business through acquisitions of other companies, products or technologies, or strategic alliances with other
	companies. Working capital and other general corporate purposes may include sales and marketing expenditures, research and development expenditures, capital expenditures and any other purposes that we
	may specify in any prospectus supplement. Our plans to use the estimated net proceeds from the sale of these securities may change, and if they do, we will update this information in a prospectus
	supplement.




	        We
	will not receive any of the proceeds from sales of securities by selling stockholders, if any, pursuant to this prospectus, although we may pay the expenses, other than any
	underwriting discounts and commissions, associated with the registration and sale of those securities.

	SELLING STOCKHOLDERS






	        This prospectus also relates to the possible resale by certain of our stockholders, who we refer to in this prospectus as the "selling
	stockholders," of up to 500,000 shares of our common stock that were issued and outstanding, or that are issuable upon exercise of options to acquire common stock that were issued and outstanding,
	prior to the original date of filing of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part. The selling stockholders originally acquired (or, in the case of issued and outstanding
	options or restricted stock units, will acquire) the shares of our common stock included in this prospectus through (i) issuances by us of shares of our common stock in private placements
	during the years from 1996 through 2006, (ii) the exercise of stock options granted under our Amended and Restated 2000 Stock Option Plan during the years from 2001 through 2007 to the adoption
	of our 2007 Stock Option and Incentive Plan in May 2007, (iii) the exercise of stock options granted during the years from 2007 through 2012 under our 2007 Stock Option and Incentive Plan prior
	to the original date of filing of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part and (iv) the vesting of restricted stock awards granted during the years from 2008
	through 2012 under our 2007 Stock Option and Incentive Plan prior to the original date of filing of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part.




	        Information
	about the selling stockholders, where applicable, including their identities, the amount of shares of common stock owned by each selling stockholder prior to the offering,
	the number of shares of our common stock to be offered by each selling stockholder and the amount of common stock to be owned by each selling stockholder after completion of the offering, will be set
	forth in an applicable prospectus supplement, documents incorporated by reference or in a free writing prospectus we file with the SEC. The applicable prospectus supplement will also disclose whether
	any of the selling stockholders has held any position or office with, has been employed by or otherwise has had a material relationship with us during the three years prior to the date of the
	prospectus supplement.




	        The
	selling stockholders may not sell any shares of our common stock pursuant to this prospectus until we have identified such selling stockholders and the shares being offered for
	resale by such selling stockholders in a subsequent prospectus supplement. However, the selling stockholders may sell or transfer all or a portion of their shares of our common stock pursuant to any
	available exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act.

	Table of Contents
















	PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION






	        We or the selling stockholders, and their pledgees, donees, transferees or other successors in interest, may offer and sell the shares
	of common stock from time to time pursuant to underwritten public offerings, negotiated transactions, block trades or a combination of these methods, to or through underwriters or dealers, through
	agents and/or directly to one or more purchasers. The securities may be distributed from time to time in one or more transactions:






	




	at a fixed price or prices, which may be changed;








	




	at market prices prevailing at the time of sale;








	




	at prices related to such prevailing market prices;








	




	at varying prices determined at the time of sale; or








	




	at negotiated prices.






	        The
	selling stockholders may also sell their shares of common stock in accordance with Rule 144 under the Securities Act, or any other available exemption, rather than by use of
	this prospectus.




	        Each
	time that we sell shares of common stock covered by this prospectus, we will provide a prospectus supplement or supplements that will describe the method of distribution and state
	the manner and terms of the offering of the shares of common stock, including:






	




	the offering terms, including the name or names of any underwriters, dealers or agents;








	




	the offering price of the shares and the net proceeds to be received by us and/or the selling stockholders, if applicable,
	from the sale;








	




	any underwriting discounts or agency fees and other items constituting underwriters' or agents' compensation; and








	




	any discounts or concessions allowed or reallowed or paid to dealers.






	        We
	or the selling stockholders may sell the offered shares to one or more purchasers directly, in which case no underwriters or agents would be involved. If indicated in an applicable
	prospectus supplement, we or the selling stockholders may sell shares of common stock through agents from time to time. The applicable prospectus supplement will name any agent involved in the offer
	or sale of the shares.




	        If
	a dealer is utilized in the sale of the securities being offered by this prospectus, the securities will be sold to the dealer, as principal. The dealer may then resell the securities
	to the public at varying prices to be determined by the dealer at the time of resale.




	        If
	an underwriter is utilized in the sale of the securities being offered by this prospectus, an underwriting agreement will be executed with the underwriter at the time of sale and the
	name of any underwriter will be provided in the prospectus supplement that the underwriter will use to make resales of the securities to the public. Generally, the underwriters' obligations to
	purchase the shares will be subject to certain conditions precedent. If an offering is on a firm-commitment basis, the underwriters will be obligated to purchase all of the shares if they
	purchase any of the shares. In connection with the sale of the securities, we, or selling stockholders, or the purchasers of securities for whom the underwriter may act as agent, may compensate the
	underwriter in the form of underwriting discounts or commissions. The underwriter may sell the securities to or through dealers, and those dealers may receive compensation in the form of discounts,
	concessions or commissions from the underwriters and/or commissions from the purchasers for which they may act as agent. Unless otherwise indicated in a prospectus supplement, an agent will be acting
	on a best efforts basis and a dealer will purchase

	Table of Contents





	securities
	as a principal, and may then resell the securities at varying prices to be determined by the dealer.




	        Any
	compensation paid to underwriters, dealers or agents in connection with the offering of the securities, and any discounts, concessions or commissions allowed by underwriters to
	participating dealers will be provided in the applicable prospectus supplement. The selling stockholders and any underwriters, dealers and agents that participate in the distribution of the shares of
	common stock may be deemed to be "underwriters" within the meaning of the Securities Act, and any discounts, concessions, commissions or fees received by them and any profit on the resale of the
	shares sold by them may be deemed to be underwriting discounts and commissions. Neither the delivery of any prospectus, or any prospectus supplement, nor any other action taken by a selling
	stockholder or any purchaser relating to the sale of shares under this prospectus shall be treated as an admission that any of them is an "underwriter" within the meaning of the Securities Act
	relating to the sale of any shares. We and the selling stockholders may agree to indemnify any agent, underwriter or other third party that participates in transactions involving sales of the shares
	against certain liabilities, including
	liabilities arising under the Securities Act, or to contribution with respect to payments which the agent, underwriter or other third party may be required to make in respect thereof.




	        Underwriters
	may engage in stabilizing and syndicate covering transactions in accordance with Rule 104 of Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Rule 104 of
	Regulation M permits stabilizing bids to purchase the shares being offered as long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Underwriters may over-allot the offered
	shares in connection with the offering, thus creating a short position in their account. Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of the offered shares by underwriters in the open market
	after the distribution has been completed in order to cover syndicate short positions. Stabilizing and syndicate covering transactions may cause the price of the offered shares to be higher than it
	would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time.




	        We
	may engage in at the market offerings in accordance with Rule 415(a)(4) under the Securities Act. In addition, we may enter into derivative transactions with third parties, or
	sell securities not covered by this prospectus to third parties in privately negotiated transactions. If the applicable prospectus supplement so indicates, in connection with those derivatives, the
	third parties may sell securities covered by this prospectus and the applicable prospectus supplement, including in short sale transactions. If so, the third party may use securities pledged by us or
	borrowed from us or others to settle those sales or to close out any related open borrowings of stock, and may use securities received from us in settlement of those derivatives to close out any
	related open borrowings of stock. The third party in such sale transactions will be an underwriter and, if not identified in this prospectus, will be named in the applicable prospectus supplement (or
	a post-effective amendment).In addition, we or any selling stockholder may enter into option, share lending or other types of transactions that require us or such selling stockholder to
	deliver shares of our common stock to a financial institution or other third party that, in turn, may sell or transfer the shares using this prospectus and an applicable prospectus supplement. We or
	any selling stockholder may enter into hedging transactions with respect to our shares of common stock. For example, we or such selling stockholder
	may:






	




	enter into transactions involving short sales of shares by financial institutions or other third parties;








	




	sell shares short and deliver the shares to close out short positions;








	




	enter into option or other types of transactions that require us to deliver the shares to a financial institution or other
	third party, who may then resell or transfer the shares under this prospectus and an applicable prospectus supplement; or






	7











	Table of Contents







	




	loan or pledge the shares to a financial institution or other third party, who may sell the loaned shares or, in the event
	of default, sell the pledged shares.






	        We
	or any selling stockholder may authorize underwriters, dealers or agents to solicit offers by certain purchasers to purchase securities at the public offering price set forth in the
	applicable prospectus supplement pursuant to delayed delivery contracts providing for payment and delivery on a specified date in the future. These purchasers may include, among others, commercial and
	savings banks, insurance companies, pension funds, investment companies and educational and charitable institutions. The delayed delivery contracts will be subject only to those conditions set forth
	in the applicable prospectus supplement, and the applicable prospectus supplement will set forth any commissions we or any selling stockholders pay for solicitation of these delayed delivery
	contracts.




	        Our
	common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol "VRTU." Shares of our common stock issued and sold by us under this prospectus will be listed on the NASDAQ Global
	Market, upon official notice of issuance. Any underwriters to whom shares are sold by us for public offering and sale may make a market in the securities, but such underwriters will not be obligated
	to do so and may discontinue any market making at any time without notice.




	        The
	specific terms of any lock-up provisions in respect of any given offering will be described in the applicable prospectus supplement.




	        The
	aggregate maximum discount, commission or agency fees or other items constituting underwriting compensation to be received by any Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA")
	member or independent broker-dealer will be in compliance with the guidelines of FINRA with respect to any offering pursuant to this prospectus and any applicable prospectus supplement or pricing
	supplement, as the case may be.




	        The
	underwriters, dealers and agents may engage in transactions with us, or perform services for us or any selling stockholder, in the ordinary course of business for which they receive
	compensation.




	        There
	can be no assurance that we or the selling stockholders will sell all or any of the shares of common stock offered by this prospectus.

	Item 15.    Indemnification of Directors and Officers.






	        Section 145(a) of the Delaware General Corporation Law provides, in general, that a corporation may indemnify any person who was
	or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by
	or in the right of the corporation), because he or she is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director,
	officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement
	actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding, if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not
	opposed to the best interests of the corporation and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful.




	        Section 145(b)
	of the Delaware General Corporation Law provides, in general, that a corporation may indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party
	to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor because the person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of
	the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against
	expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner
	he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, except that no indemnification shall be made with respect to any claim, issue or matter as to which he
	or she shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or other adjudicating court determines that, despite the adjudication of
	liability but in view of all of the circumstances of the case, he or she is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or other adjudicating court shall
	deem proper.




	        Section 145(e)
	of the Delaware General Corporation Law provides that expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by an officer or director in defending any civil, criminal,
	administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding may be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on
	behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation as authorized by Section 145
	of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Section 145(e) of the Delaware General Corporation Law further provides that such




	II-1











	Table of Contents





	expenses
	(including attorneys' fees) incurred by former directors and officers or other employees or agents of the corporation may be so paid upon such terms and conditions as the corporation deems
	appropriate.




	        Section 145(g)
	of the Delaware General Corporation Law provides, in general, that a corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a
	director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint
	venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the
	corporation would have the power to indemnify the person against such liability under Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law.




	        As
	permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, our seventh amended and restated certificate of incorporation, provides that no director of our company shall be personally liable
	to us or our stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability (1) for any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to us or our
	stockholders, (2) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (3) in respect of unlawful dividend payments or stock
	redemptions or repurchases, or (4) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. In addition, our certificate of incorporation provides that if the Delaware
	General Corporation Law is amended to authorize the further elimination or limitation of the liability of directors, then the liability of a director of our company shall be eliminated or limited to
	the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as so amended.




	        Our
	certificate of incorporation further provides that any repeal or modification of such article by our stockholders or an amendment to the Delaware General Corporation Law will not
	adversely affect any right or protection existing at the time of such repeal or modification with respect to any acts or omissions occurring before such repeal or modification of a director serving at
	the time of such repeal or modification.




	        As
	permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated by-laws, or by-laws, provide that we will indemnify each of our directors and
	officers and, in the discretion of our board of directors, certain employees, to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law as the same may be amended (except that in the
	case of an amendment, only to the extent that the amendment permits us to provide broader indemnification rights than the Delaware General Corporation Law permitted us to provide prior to such the
	amendment) against any and all expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts reasonably paid in settlement that are incurred by the director, officer or such employee or on the director's,
	officer's or employee's behalf in connection with any threatened, pending or completed proceeding or any claim, issue or matter therein, to which he or she is or is threatened to be made a party
	because he or she is or was serving as a director, officer or employee of our company, or at our request as a director, partner, trustee, officer, employee or agent of another corporation,
	partnership, joint venture,
	trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of our company and, with
	respect to any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. Article V of the by-laws further provides for the advancement of expenses to
	each of our directors and, in the discretion of the board of directors, to certain officers and employees.




	        In
	addition, our by-laws provides that the right of each of our directors and officers to indemnification and advancement of expenses shall be a contract right and shall not
	be exclusive of any other right now possessed or hereafter acquired under any statute, provision of the certificate of incorporation or by-laws, agreement, vote of stockholders or
	otherwise. Furthermore, our by-laws




	II-2











	Table of Contents





	authorize
	us to provide insurance for our directors, officers and employees, against any liability, whether or not we would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability under the
	Delaware General Corporation Law or the by-laws.




	        We
	have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and our executive officers. These agreements provide that we will indemnify each of our directors and such
	officers to the fullest extent permitted by law and the certificate of incorporation and by-laws.




	        We
	also maintain a general liability insurance policy which covers certain liabilities of directors and officers of our company arising out of claims based on acts or omissions in their
	capacities as directors or officers.




	        In
	any underwriting agreement we enter into in connection with the sale of securities being registered hereby, the underwriters will agree to indemnify, under certain conditions, us, our
	directors, our officers and persons who control us, within the meaning of the Securities Act, against certain liabilities.














	Item 16.    Exhibits.






	        A list of exhibits filed with this registration statement on Form S-3 is set forth on the Exhibit Index and is
	incorporated herein by reference.














	Item 17.    Undertakings.






	        The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes:





	        (1)   To
	file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this Registration Statement:





	          (i)  To
	include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933;




	         (ii)  To
	reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment
	thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in
	volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of the securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of estimated maximum offering
	range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than 20 percent
	change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the "Calculation of Registration Fee" table in the effective registration statement;




	        (iii)  To
	include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such
	information in the registration statement;






	provided



	,



	however



	, that paragraphs(1)(i), (1)(ii) and (1)(iii) do not apply if the information required
	to be included in a post-effective amendment by those paragraphs is contained in reports filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission by the registrant pursuant to
	Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that are incorporated by reference in the registration statement, or is contained in a form of prospectus filed
	pursuant to Rule 424(b) that is part of the registration statement.




	        (2)   That,
	for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new
	registration statement relating to the





	II-3











	Table of Contents






	securities
	offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial



	bona fide



	offering thereof.




	        (3)   To
	remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the
	offering.




	        (4)   That,
	for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser:





	          (i)  Each
	prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3) shall be deemed to be part of the registration statement as of the date the filed prospectus
	was deemed part of and included in the registration statement; and




	         (ii)  Each
	prospectus required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2), (b)(5), or (b)(7) as part of a registration statement in reliance on Rule 430B relating
	to an offering made pursuant to Rule 415(a)(1)(i), (vii), or (x) for the purpose of providing the information required by Section 10(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 shall be
	deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the earlier of the date such form of prospectus is first used after effectiveness or the date of the first contract of sale of
	securities in the offering described in the prospectus. As provided in Rule 430B, for liability purposes of the issuer and any person that is at that date an underwriter, such date shall be
	deemed to be a new effective date of the registration statement relating to the securities in the registration statement to which that prospectus relates, and the offering of such securities at that
	time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof;



	provided



	,



	however



	, that no statement
	made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or
	prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such effective date, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the
	registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such effective date;





	        (5)   That,
	for the purpose of determining liability of the registrant under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities, the
	undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the
	securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and
	will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser:





	          (i)  Any
	preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424;




	         (ii)  Any
	free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned Registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned registrant;




	        (iii)  The
	portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned registrant or its securities provided
	by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and




	        (iv)  Any
	other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser.





	        (6)   That,
	for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each filing of the registrant's annual report pursuant to Section 13(a) or
	Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (and, where applicable, each filing of an employee benefit plan's annual report pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange
	Act of 1934) that is incorporated by





	II-4











	Table of Contents






	reference
	in this registration statement shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed
	to be the initial



	bona fide



	offering thereof.





	        Insofar
	as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the
	provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the registrant or resolutions of the registrant's board of directors adopted pursuant thereto, or
	otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933, and
	is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or
	controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being
	registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such
	indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

	2000 West Park Drive

	Westborough, MA 01581




	        Re:



	Common Stock Being Registered under Registration Statement on Form S-3





	Ladies
	and Gentlemen:




	        We
	have acted as counsel to you in connection with your filing of a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (as amended or supplemented, the "Registration Statement")
	pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), relating to the registration of up to $100,000,000 in aggregate offering price of shares (the "Primary Shares") of common
	stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Common Stock"), of Virtusa Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company") to be sold by the Company at a future date or dates, and up to 500,000 shares of
	the Company's common stock (the "Selling Stockholder Shares"), which were issued and outstanding (or will be issued upon exercise or vesting of securities that were issued and outstanding) prior to
	the initial filing of the Registration Statement, for sale by certain stockholders of the Company from time to time. The Registration Statement provides that shares of Common Stock may be offered in
	amounts, at prices and on terms to be set forth in one or more prospectus supplements (each a "Prospectus Supplement") to the prospectus contained in the Registration Statement.




	        We
	have reviewed such documents and made such examination of law as we have deemed appropriate to give the opinion set forth below. We have relied, without independent verification, on
	certificates of public officials and, as to matters of fact material to the opinion set forth below, on certificates of officers of the Company.




	        The
	opinion set forth below is limited to the Delaware General Corporation Law (which includes reported judicial decisions interpreting the Delaware General Corporation Law), and the
	federal law of the United States. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, we express no opinion with respect to (i) state securities or "blue sky" laws, or (ii) state or
	federal antitrust laws.




	        For
	purposes of the opinion set forth below, without limiting any other exceptions or qualifications set forth herein, we have assumed that after the issuance of any Primary Shares
	offered pursuant to the Registration Statement, the total number of issued shares of Common Stock, together with the total number of shares of such stock reserved for issuance upon the exercise,
	exchange, conversion or settlement, as the case may be, of any exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security, as the case may be, then outstanding, will not exceed the total number of authorized
	shares of Common Stock under the Company's certificate of incorporation, as then in effect (the "Charter").




	        For
	purposes of the opinion set forth below, we refer to (a) the authorization by the Company of the amount, terms and issuance of the Primary Shares (the "Authorization") and
	(b) the issuance of the Primary Shares in accordance with the Authorization therefor upon the receipt by the Company of the consideration (which is not less than the par value of such shares)
	to be paid therefor in accordance with the Authorization as the "Future Authorization and Issuance" of the Primary Shares.








	Virtusa
	Corporation

	October 22, 2012

	Page 2




	        Based
	on the foregoing, we are of the opinion that, upon the Future Authorization and Issuance of the Primary Shares, such Primary Shares will be validly issued, fully paid and
	non-assessable, and that the Selling Stockholder Shares have been duly authorized and are (or, in the case of Selling Stockholder Shares to be issued upon exercise or vesting of
	outstanding securities, upon issuance in accordance with the terms of such securities, will be) validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.




	        This
	opinion letter and the opinion it contains shall be interpreted in accordance with the Legal Opinion Principles issued by the Committee on Legal Opinions of the American Bar
	Association's Business Law Section as published in 53 Business Lawyer 831 (May 1998).




	        We
	hereby consent to the inclusion of this opinion as Exhibit 5.1 to the Registration Statement and to the references to our firm under the caption "Legal Matters" in the
	Registration Statement. In giving our consent, we do not admit that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act or the rules and
	regulations thereunder.






















	 




	 




	Very truly yours,

IT Consulting Outsourcing and Agile Software Development - Virtusa









  





We are reverting to the use of Virtusa to represent a single, consistent brand of Virtusa Corporation, including those of its wholly and partly owned subsidiaries.
On March 3, 2016, Virtusa acquired a majority interest in Polaris Consulting & Services Limited (“Polaris”) to leverage the market presence and deep relationship that Polaris already built in the financial services space. During the integration period, we created a new market facing brand, VirtusaPolaris to represent the combined strengths of Virtusa and Polaris, including our strong software engineering heritage, deep domain expertise and focus on applying innovation to solving critical core business issues for clients. Having successfully completed the integration, we are now moving to the parent brand of Virtusa.

IT Consulting Outsourcing and Agile Software Development - Virtusa









  





We are reverting to the use of Virtusa to represent a single, consistent brand of Virtusa Corporation, including those of its wholly and partly owned subsidiaries.
On March 3, 2016, Virtusa acquired a majority interest in Polaris Consulting & Services Limited (“Polaris”) to leverage the market presence and deep relationship that Polaris already built in the financial services space. During the integration period, we created a new market facing brand, VirtusaPolaris to represent the combined strengths of Virtusa and Polaris, including our strong software engineering heritage, deep domain expertise and focus on applying innovation to solving critical core business issues for clients. Having successfully completed the integration, we are now moving to the parent brand of Virtusa.

Virtusa Corp. Is Completing Its Bottom, Now It Could Break Out - Virtusa Corporation (NASDAQ:VRTU) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Virtusa Corp. Is Completing Its Bottom, Now It Could Break OutJul.21.17 | About: Virtusa Corporation (VRTU) John Longsworth Momentum, long/short equity, ETF investing, biotechJohn Longsworth WritingSummaryVirtusa is a technology consulting company that services global businesses.Its stock has risen out of a bottom but is stuck in a sideways pattern.Virtusa’s revenues have grown steadily over the past five quarters, but income has lagged.The company’s revenue growth will likely slow this year, while income is set to climb thanks to lower costs.Virtusa is worth considering as an investment later this year, once it moves past the highs of the current sideways action.Several technology stocks have been on a tear lately. Many are over-speculated and near all-time highs. Some, however, are just coming out of bottoms and are ripe for an intermediate to long-term trade. Virtusa (VRTU) could be one of those companies. Virtusa Is An IT Services Company Virtusa provides IT consulting services around the globe. It services a diverse set of industries including banking, financial services, insurance, healthcare, telecom, and media. The company offers a wide range of business services including ERP solutions and cloud services. It’s poised to capitalize on the growing technology needs of global companies. Virtusa Moved Out Of Its Bottom And Is Moving Sideways A monthly chart of VRTU shows that it completed an intermediate-term bottom last year. It’s been stuck in a sideways pattern right at the bottom completion level though. The monthly chart also shows that VRTU’s all-time high is at $58.56. So it has plenty of room to move up from its current position. 

 Figure 1: Monthly Chart of VRTU. Chart provided by FreeStockCharts.com. The weekly chart of VRTU gives us a closer look at the current sideways pattern. The stock has moved sideways for almost all of 2017. Notably, there are some large black candles where High-Frequency Traders (HFT) jumped in to drive the stock down. The trend was also slowly slipping down over the past few months. But VRTU’s price has recently stabilized.
 White candles have started to dominate as buyers drive the stock back up. Green volume has dominated overall, with the exception of a few spikes of red volume caused by the HFTs. HFTs tried to drive the price down a few times, but failed to move it beyond the lows of the current range. Overall, the pattern shows that buyers have been in control during this recent sideways action. 

 Figure 2: Weekly Chart of VRTU. Chart provided by FreeStockCharts.com. We should also check the daily chart to see what the stock is currently up to. Right now, the stock is trending back up to the highs of the sideways pattern. The candles look stronger and lack indecisive wicks or tails. We can also see that HFTs tried to sell the stock down on 5/15/17 but couldn't drive it down very far. So some large investment firm’s buy zone is likely nearby. Overall the current volume is low, with mostly green bars and a few red spikes. Green volume has dominated more over the past couple of weeks though. Overall, the patterns in the charts show that some buyers are carefully moving into this stock, but there’s not a lot of momentum in it right now. 

 Figure 3: Daily Chart of VRTU. Chart provided by FreeStockCharts.com. Virtusa Has Grown Strongly Over The Past Year The charts show that there could be some potential for this stock. But do the company’s fundamentals back up what we see in the charts? We can find out by checking the company's financials. Firstly, the income statement shows that Virtusa’s revenues have grown strongly over the past year. In fact, revenues have increased over the past 5 quarters. And that revenue growth is accelerating. Net income hasn’t grown as consistently, however.
 Income fell badly in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. The drop was largely due to the acquisition of Polaris Consulting and the resulting restructuring of the company. Since then, however, income has steadily climbed over the last three quarters. Costs are rising in tandem with revenues but at a much slower pace. Overall, it looks like Virtusa is making an effort to control its costs, and its financials look very strong. 

 Figure 4: Income statement for VRTU. Data provided by Google Finance. Virtusa has a moderate amount of long-term debt. That debt slowly declined over that past 5 quarters though, so the company is controlling its debt load. Its current ratio is 3.82 however, which is a little on the high side. So the company may not be using its assets efficiently. 

 Figure 5: Balance sheet for VRTU. Data provided by Google Finance. Institutional holdings of VRTU is at 91%, which is very high. The data from Nasdaq.com shows that more institutions have sold or lowered their holdings though. 

 Figure 6: Institutional Activity for VRTU But three of the top holders for VRTU are giant funds, including one giant bank. These funds are adding to or maintaining their positions in VRTU. A quick glance at this data shows that’s likely just smaller and less experienced funds moving out of this stock. The larger and more experienced funds seem to expect this stock to continue upwards.
 

 Figure 7: Institutional Holders for VRTU. Virtusa’s Last Earnings Report Shows Slower Growth So far Virtusa’s financials look promising. But can it continue to grow at this pace? Let’s look at the last earnings report and find out. The management commentary was very positive and aggressive in the fourth quarter fiscal year 2017 report. Chief Financial Officer Ranjan Kalia stated: “We delivered strong sequential revenue growth and operating margin accretion in the fourth quarter. Our Q4 non-GAAP EPS was below the midpoint of our guidance range primarily due to a shift forward of certain expenses in our cost of sales. Looking to fiscal 2018, we expect to deliver above-industry revenue growth as well as continued margin accretion even after absorbing INR headwinds of approximately 45 basis points.” The company’s expectations for the next quarter, however, are lackluster. Virtusa expects revenues of $222.5 to $227.5 million. According to EarningsWhispers.com, analysts expect revenues closer to $224.47 million. That’s pretty flat compared to last quarter’s $225.96 million. The company also expects earnings per share of just $0.07 to $0.13. Analysts expect slightly higher earnings per share of $0.16. But both estimates are significantly lower than last quarter’s earnings per share of $0.35. Virtusa is expected to report around August 15th, so we’ll see then how the company fared in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. Virtusa expects better results for the full fiscal year 2018 though. Annual revenues are expected to be in the range of $920 to $950 million. Analysts expect the company to hit above the midpoint of its guidance at $937.2 million. This would be a 9% increase over last year. It doesn't match the strong revenue growth the company experienced last year, but it’s still respectable.
 Annual earnings per share are expected in the range of $1.42 to 1.66, but analysts expect Virtusa to hit above this range at $1.87. But even the company’s lower estimates represent a nice jump over last year’s earnings per share of $0.39. So it looks like Virtusa expects to keep costs down and grow its earnings throughout fiscal year 2018. Conclusion VRTU moved up nicely out of its recent bottom on strongly improving revenues. It’s stuck in a sideways range right now though. Its fiscal year 2017 financials were strong overall, although earnings lagged due to restructuring costs related to an acquisition. It looks like revenues won’t climb as strongly this year, although income should greatly improve due to lower costs. Revenues and earnings look like they’ll both dip in the fiscal first quarter, however. So if this stock is of interest, consider waiting to enter until later in the year. Also, hold off on entering the stock until it moves beyond the highs of its sideways range at 34.92. Overall, this stock shows some promise thanks to its interesting product offerings and a growing market.

Also, hold off on entering the stock until it moves beyond the highs of its sideways range at 34.92. Overall, this stock shows some promise thanks to its interesting product offerings and a growing market.
