Gibbs energy of dilution and mixing
Summary of key concepts
Concept map



In this unit we introduce a new thermodynamic function, the free energy, which turns out to be the single most useful criterion for predicting the direction of a chemical reaction and the composition of the system at equilibrium.
As we will explain near the bottom of this page, the term "free energy", although still widely used, is rather misleading, so we will ofen refer to it as the "Gibbs function" or "Gibbs energy"


 
In the previous lesson we saw that it is the sum of the entropy changes of the system and surroundings that determines whether a process will occur spontaneously. In chemical thermodynamics we prefer to focus our attention on the system rather than the surroundings, and would like to avoid having to calculate the entropy change of the surroundings explicity. The free energy  enables us to do this for changes that occur at a constant temperature and pressure (the Gibbs free energy) or constant temperature and volume (the Helmholtz free energy.) 
[image source]
We will deal only with the Gibbs free energy in this course. The Helmholtz free energy is of interest mainly to chemical engineers (whose industrial-scale processes are often confined to tanks and reactors of fixed volume) and some geochemists whose interest is centered on the chemistry that occurs deep within the earth's surface. 

1 Free energy: the Gibbs function
The Gibbs  [free] energy (also known as the Gibbs function) is defined as
 G = H – T S(4-1)
in which S refers to the entropy of the system. Since H, T and S are all state functions, so is G. Thus for any change in state, we can write the extremely important relation 
ΔG = ΔH – T ΔS(4-2) Must know this!
How does this simple equation encompass the entropy change of the world ΔStotal, which we already know is the sole criterion for spontaneous change? Starting with the definition
 ΔStotal =  ΔSsurr +  ΔSsys(4-3)
we would first like to get rid of ΔSsurr. How can a chemical reaction (a change in the system) affect the entropy of the surroundings? Because most reactions are either exothermic or endothermic, they are accompanied by a flow of heat qp across the system boundary. The enthalpy change of the reaction ΔH is defined as the flow of heat into the system from the surroundings when the reaction is carried out at constant pressure, so the heat withdrawn from the surroundings will be –qp which will cause the entropy of the surroundings to change by –qp / T = –ΔH/T. We can therefore rewrite Eq 4-3 as
ΔStotal = (– ΔH/T) + ΔSsys (4-4)
Multiplying through by T , we obtain 
–T ΔStotal =  ΔH – T ΔSsys(4-5)
which expresses the entropy change of the world in terms of thermodynamic properties of the system exclusively. If TΔStotal is denoted by ΔG, then we have Eq. 4-2 which defines the Gibbs [free] energy change for the process.
Some textbooks and teachers say that the free energy, and thus the spontaniety of a reaction, depends on both the enthalpy and entropy changes of a reaction, and they sometimes even refer to reactions as "energy driven" or "entropy driven" depending on whether ΔH or the TΔS  term dominates.This is technically correct but misleading because it disguises the important fact that ΔStotal, which this equation expresses in an indirect way, is the only criterion of spontaneous change. 
From the foregoing, you should convince yourself that G  will decrease in any process occurring at constant temperature and pressure which is accompanied by an overall increase in the entropy. (The constant temperature is a consequence of the temperature and the enthalpy appearing in the preceding equation 4-5.) Since most chemical and phase changes of interest to chemists take place under such conditions, the Gibbs energy is the most useful of all the thermodynamic properties of a substance, and (as we shall see in the lesson that follows this one) it is closely linked to the equilibrium constant.

2  Gibbs energy and chemical change
ΔG determines the direction and extent of chemical change
Please remember that ΔG is meaningful only for changes in which the temperature and pressure remain constant. These are the conditions under which most reactions are carried out in the laboratory; the system is usually open to the atmosphere (constant pressure) and we begin and end the process at room temperature (after any heat we have added or which is liberated by the reaction has dissipated.)
The importance of the Gibbs function can hardly be over-stated: it serves as the single master variable that determines whether a given chemical change is thermodynamically possible. Thus if the free energy of the reactants is greater than that of the products, the entropy of the world will increase when the reaction takes place as written, and so the reaction will tend to take place spontaneously. Conversely, if the free energy of the products exceeds that of the reactants, then the reaction will not take place in the direction written, but it will tend to proceed in the reverse direction.
In a spontaneous change, Gibbs energy always decreases and never increases.
This of course reflects the fact that the entropy of the world behaves in the exact opposite way (owing to the negative sign in the TΔS term). Recalling the example of the freezing of water we presented in the previous lesson
H2O(liquid) → H2O (ice) 
water below its freezing point undergoes a decrease in its entropy, but the heat released into the surroundings more than compensates for this, so the entropy of the world increases, the free energy of the H2O diminishes, and the process proceeds spontaneously.
An important consequence of the one-way downward path of the free energy is that once it reaches its minimum possible value, net change comes to a halt. This, of course, represents the state of chemical equilbrium.
These relations are nicely summarized as follows:


ΔG < 0 
reaction can spontaneously proceed to the right:   A → B 


ΔG > 0 
reaction can spontaneously proceed to the left:   A ← B  


ΔG = 0 
the reaction is at equilibrium; the quantities of A and B will not change 




Finding the value of ΔG: don't bother!

This might seem strange, given the key importance ΔG in determining whether or not a reaction will take place in a given direction. It turns out, however, that it is almost never necessary to explicitly evaluate ΔG. As we will show in the lesson that follows this one, it is far more convenient to work with the equilibrium constant of a reaction, within which ΔG is "hidden". This is just as well, because for most reactions (those that take place in solutions or gas mixtures) the value of ΔG depends on the proportions of the various reaction components in the mixture; it is not a simple sum of the "products minus reactants" type, as is the case with ΔH. More on this in the next lesson!
		 
The important role of temperature
Recalling the condition for spontaneous change
ΔG = ΔH  TΔS < 0
it is apparent that the temperature dependence of ΔG depends almost entirely on the entropy change associated with the process. (We say "almost" because the values of ΔH and ΔS are themselves slightly temperature dependent; both gradually increase with temperature). In particular, notice that in the above equation the sign of the entropy change determines whether the reaction becomes more or less spontaneous as the temperature is raised.
For any given reaction, the sign of  ΔH can also be positive or negative. This means that there are four possibilities for the influence that temperature can have on the spontaniety of a process:
 


Case 1: ΔH < 0 and ΔS > 0
 
 
Under these conditions, both the ΔH and TΔS terms will be negative, so ΔG will be negative regardless of the temperature. Anexothermic reaction whose entropy increases will be spontaneous at all temperatures. 
 
 

 
 

Case 2: ΔH < 0 and ΔS < 0 

If the reaction is sufficiently exothermic it can force ΔG negative only at temperatures below which |TΔS| < |ΔH|. This means that there is a temperature T = ΔH / ΔS at which the reaction is at equilibrium; the reaction will only proceed spontaneously below this temperature. The freezing of a liquid or the condensation of a gas are the most common examples of this condition.
 


Case 3:  ΔH > 0 and ΔS > 0
This is the reverse of the previous case; the entropy increase must overcome the handicap of an endothermic process so that TΔS > ΔH. Since the effect of the temperature is to "magnify" the influence of a positive ΔS, the process will be spontaneous at temperatures above T = ΔH / ΔS. (Think of melting and boiling.)
 
 



 
Case 4: ΔH > 0 and ΔS < 0				
		 		
With both ΔH and  ΔS working against it, this kind of process will not proceed spontaneously at any temperature. Substance A always has a greater number of accessible energy states, and is therefore always the preferred form.

 

 


 

About the above diagrams
The plots on the left are the important ones; don't try to memorize them, but make sure you understand and can explain or reproduce them for a given set of ΔH and ΔS.

Their most important differentiating features are the position of the ΔH line (above or below the is TΔS line), and the slope of the latter, which of course depends on the sign of ΔS.
The reaction A → B will occur spontaneously only when ΔG is negative (blue arrows pointing down.)
Owing to the slight temperature dependence of ΔS, the TΔS plots are not quite straight lines as shown here. Similarly, the lines representing ΔH are even more curved.

The other two plots on each diagram are only for the chemistry-committed. 

Each pair of energy-level diagrams depicts the relative spacing of the microscopic energy levels in the reactants and products as reflected by the value of ΔS°. (The greater the entropy, the more closely-spaced are the quantized microstates.)
The red shading indicates the range of energy levels that are accessible to the system at each temperature. The spontaneous direction of the reaction will always be in the direction in which the red shading overlaps the greater number of energy levels, resulting in the maximum dispersal of thermal energy.
Note that the vertical offsets correspond to ΔH° for the reaction.
Never forget that it is the ability of thermal energy to spread into as many of these states as possible that determines the tendency of the process to take place. None of this is to scale, of course!



The maximum work
As we explained in Part 2, the two quantities qrev (qmin) and wmax associated with reversible processes are state functions. We gave the quotient qrev /T a new name, the entropy. What we did not say is that wmax also corresponds to the free energy.
The Gibbs energy is the maximum useful work (excluding PV work associated with volume changes of the system) that a system can do on the surroundings when the process occurs reversibly at constant temperature and pressure. 
This work is done at the expense of the internal energy of the system, and whatever part of that is not extracted as work is exchanged with the surroundings as heat; this latter quantity will have the value TΔS .
Why is this important? Recall that many chemical reactions (such as those that take place when a battery is discharged) can be made to force electrons to flow through an external circuit, thus producing electrical work. 

3  The standard Gibbs free energy
Reminder: what do we mean by "standard"?
You have already been introduced to the  terms such as ΔU° and ΔH° in which the ° sign indicates that all components (reactants and products) are in their standard states. This concept of standard states is especially important in the case of the free energy, so let's take a few moments to review it.
More exact definitions of the conventional standard states can be found in most physical chemistry textbooks, See also this short Wikipedia article. In specialized fields such as biochemistry and oceanography, alternative definitions may apply. For example, the "standard pH" of zero (corresponding to 
	 			{H+} = 1M) is impractical in biochemistry (there is not much "bio" going on at pH 0!), so pH = 7 is commonly employed.
 For most practical purposes (and certainly for this course), the following definitions are good enough:

gases: 1 atmosphere partial pressure
pure liquids: the liquid under a total (hydrostatic) pressure of 1 atm.
solutes: an effective concentration of 1 mol L–1 (1 mol dm–3).
		 					("Effective" concentrations approach real concentrations as the latter approach zero; for practical purposes, these can be considered identical at real concentrations smaller than about 10–4 molar.)
solids: the pure solid under 1 atm pressure

Note also that

 There is actually no "standard temperature", but because most thermodynamics tables list values for 298.15 K (25° C), this temperature is usually implied.
These same definitions apply to standard enthalpies and internal energies.
Don't confuse these thermodynamic standard states with the "standard temperature and pressure" (STP) widely employed in gas law calculations.

Defining ΔG° and ΔGf°
In order to make use of Gibbs energies to predict chemical changes, we need to know the free energies of the individual components of the reaction. For this purpose we can combine the standard enthalpy of formation and the standard entropy of a substance to get its standard free energy of formation
ΔGf° = ΔHf°  TΔSf°(4-6)
Recall that the symbol ° refers to the standard state of a substance measured under the conditions of 1 atm pressure or an effective concentration of 1 mol L–1 and a temperature of 298K.
and then determine the standard Gibbs energy of the reaction according to
ΔG° = Σ ΔGf°(products) Σ ΔGf°(reactants)(4-7) Must know this!
As with standard heats of formation, the standard free energy of a substance represents the free energy change associated with the formation of the substance from the elements in their most stable forms as they exist under the standard conditions of 1 atm pressure and 298K. Standard Gibbs free energies of formation are normally found directly from tables. Once the values for all the reactants and products are known, the standard Gibbs free energy change for the reaction is found by Eq 4-7.
Most tables of thermodynamic values list ΔGf°'s for common substances.  They can, of course, always be found from values of ΔHf° and ΔSf°. 		
 Problem Example 1
Find the standard Gibbs energy change for the reaction
CaCO3(s) → CaO(s)+ CO2(g)
The ΔGf° values for the three components of this reaction system are
								CaCO3(s): –1128 kJ mol–1, CaO(s): –603.5 kJ mol–1, CO2(g): –137.2 kJ mol–1.
						
Solution: Substituting into Eq. 4-7, we have
ΔG° = (–603.5 –137.2) – (–1128) kJ mol–1 = +387.3 kJ mol–1
						indicating that the process is not spontaneous under standard conditions (i.e., solid calcium carbone will not form solid calcium oxide and CO2 at 1 atm partial pressure at 25° C. 
Comment: This reaction is carried out on a huge scale to manufacture cement, so it is obvious that the process can be spontaneous under different conditions.

 

The practical importance of the Gibbs energy is that it allows us to make predictions based on the properties (ΔG° values) of the reactants and products themselves, eliminating the need to experiment. But bear in mind that while thermodynamics always correctly predicts whether a given process can take place (is spontaneous in the thermodynamic sense), it is unable to tell us if it will take place at an observable rate.
When thermodynamics says "no", it means exactly that. When it says "yes", it means "maybe".

 
 Problem Example 2 
The reaction ½ O2(g) + H2(g) → H2O(l) is used in fuel cells to produce an electrical current. The reaction can also be carried out by direct combustion.
        Thermodynamic data: molar entropies in J mol–1 K–1: 
        		O2(g) 205.0; H2(g)130.6; H2O(l) 70.0; H2O(l) ΔH°f = –285.9 kJ mol–1.
        Use this information to find
        a) The amount of heat released when the reaction takes place by direct combustion;
        b) The amount of electrical work the same reaction can perform when carried out in a fuel cell at 298K under reversible condtions;
        c) The amount of heat released under the same conditions.             
        Solution: First, we need to find ΔH° and ΔS° for the process. Recalling that the standard enthalpy of formation of the elements is zero,
        ΔH° = ΔH°f(products) – ΔH°f(reactants) = –285.9 kJ mol–1 – 0 = –285.9 kJ mol–1.
Similarly, ΔS° = S°f(products) – S°f(reactants) = (70.0) – (½×205.0 + 130.6) = –163 J K–1mol–1
a) When the hydrogen and oxygen are combined directly, the heat released will be 
		     		ΔH° = –285.9 kJ mol–1.
b) The maximum electrical work the fuel cell can perform is given by ΔG° = ΔH° – TΔS° =  –285.9 kJ mol–1 – (298 K)(–163 JK–1mol–1) = –237.2  kJ mol–1.
c) The heat released in the fuel cell reaction is the difference between the enthalpy change (the total energy available) and the reversible work that was expended: 
		     ΔH° – ΔG°= TΔS° =  (298 K)(–163 JK–1mol–1) = –48800 J mol–1 = –48.8 kJ mol–1. 
In this reaction, 1.5 moles of gas disappear, to be replaced by 18 mL (1 mole) of water. The system undergoes a marked contraction in which the atmosphere performs pressure-volume work on the system. But this PV work is the "non-useful" work that is not included in the ΔG value.

The foregoing example illustrates an important advantage of fuel cells. Although direct combustion of a mole of hydrogen gas yields more energy than is produced by the same net reaction within the fuel cell, the latter, in the form of electrical energy, can be utilized at nearly 100-percent energy efficiency by a motor or some other electrical device. If the thermal energy released by direct combustion were supplied to a heat engine, second-law considerations would require that at least half of this energy be "wasted" to the surroundings. 


4  ΔG and ΔG°: what's the difference?
The apparent similarity of the terms ΔG, ΔG° and ΔGf° makes it easy to overlook the distinctions between them and is a major source of confusion and error for students (and sometimes even for teachers!) Although these terms were discussed above, it might be useful to summarize and expand upon these distinctions.
The most important  thing to remember is that the terms ΔG° and ΔGf° refer to single, specific chemical changes in which all components (reactants and products) are in their standard states. 
Standard Gibbs energies of formation
The ΔGf° of a substance, like ΔHf°, refers to the reaction in which that substance is formed from the elements as they exist in their most stable forms at 1 atm pressure and (usually) 298K. Both of these Δ terms are by definition zero for the elements in their standard states. 
There are only a few common cases in which this might create some ambiguity:

example ΔGf°, kJ mol–1


O2(g)
O3(g)  ΔGf° = 163.2


C(graphite)
C(diamond)   ΔGf° = 2.9

S(monoclinic) ΔGf° = 0.1

Ions in aqueous solution are a special case; their standard free energies are relative to the hydrated hydrogen ion H+(aq) which is assigned ΔGf° = 0.
 


Plain-vanilla ΔG is very different from  ΔG° !

The distinction is nicely illustrated in this diagram in which ΔG is plotted on a vertical axis for two hypothetical reactions having opposite signs of ΔG°. The horizontal axis schematically expresses the relative concentrations of reactants and products at any point of the process. Note that the origin corresponds to the composition at which half of the reactants have been converted into products.
 

Take careful note of the following:

The red line on the left plots the values of ΔG for the ΔG° > 0 reaction. Notice that there are an infinite number of these values, depending on the progress of the reaction. In contrast there is only a single value  of ΔG°, corresponding to the composition at which  ΔG = 0 ().
At this point, some products have been formed, but the composition is still dominated by reactants. 
If we begin at a composition to the left of ,  ΔG will be negative and the composition will move to the right. Similarly if we begin with a composition to the right of ,  ΔG will be positive and the composition will move to the left.
The plot on the right is for the  ΔG° < 0 reaction, for which ΔG° is shown at . At its equilibrium point , there are more products than reactants. If we start at a composition to the right of , the composition will tend to move to the left. If the initial composition is to the left of , the reaction will tend to proceed to the right.
What would happen if ΔG° were 0? The equilibrium point of such a reaction would be at the origin, corresponding to half the reactants being converted to products.

The important principle you should understand from this is that a negative ΔG° does not mean that the reactants will be completely transformed into products. By the same token, a positive ΔG° does not mean that no products are formed at all.

 
It should now be clear from the discussion above that a given reaction carried out under standard conditions is characterized by a single value of ΔG°.
The reason for the Gibbs energy minimum at equilibrium relates to the increase in entropy when products and reactants coexist in the same phase. As seen in the plot, even a minute amount of "contamination" of products by reactants reduces the free energy below that of the pure products. For more on the entropy and Gibbs energy of mixing, see here. 
In contrast, composition of a chemical reaction system undergoes continual change until the equilibrium state is reached. So the a single reaction can have an infinite number of  ΔG values, reflecting the infinite possible compositions between the extremes of pure reactants (zero extent of reaction) and pure products (unity extent of reaction).
In the example of a reaction A → B, depicted in the above diagram, the standard free energy of the products  is smaller than that of the reactants , so the reaction will take place spontaneously. But as will be explained in the next lesson, this does not mean that each mole of pure A will be converted into one mole of pure B. For reactions in which products and reactants occupy a single phase (gas or solution), the meaning of "spontaneous" is that the equilibrium composition  will correspond to an extent of reaction greater than 0.5 but smaller than unity. 
Note, however, that for ΔG° values in excess of about ±50 kJ mol–1, the equilibrium composition will be negligibly different from zero or unity extent-of-reaction.
The physical meaning of ΔG is that it tells us how far the free energy of the system has changed from G° of the pure reactants . As the reaction proceeds to the right, the composition changes, and ΔG begins to fall. When the composition reaches  , ΔG reaches its minimum value and further reaction would cause it to rise. But because free energy can only decrease but never increase, this does not happen. The composition of the system remains permanently at its equilibrium value.
A G vs. extent-of-reaction diagram for a non-spontaneous reaction can be interpreted in a similar way; the equilibrium composition   will correspond to an extent of reaction greater than zero but less than 0.5.
In this case, the minimum at  reflects the increase in entropy when the reactants are "contaminated" by a small quantity of products.
 
If all this detail about ΔG seems a bit overwhelming, don't worry: it all gets hidden in the equilibrium constant and reaction quotient that we discuss in the next lesson!

5  Interpretation of standard Gibbs energy changes
Some example processes
Although it is ΔG rather than ΔG° that serves as a criterion for spontaneous change at constant temperature and pressure, ΔG° values are so readily available that they are often used to get a rough idea of whether a given chemical change is possible. This is practical to do in some cases, but not in others.
It generally works for reactions such as
4 NH3(g)+ 5 O2(g)→ 4 NO(g)+ 6 H2O(g)      ΔG° = –1010 kJ
(industrially important for the manufacture of nitric acid) because ΔG° is so negative that the reaction will be spontaneous and virtually complete under just about any reasonable set of conditions.

The following reaction expresses the fact that the water molecule is thermodynamically stable:
 2 H2(g)+ ½ O2(g)→ H2O(g)       ΔG° = –237.2 kJ
Note that this refers to liquid water (the standard state of H2O at 25°). If you think about it, a negative standard Gibbs energy of formation (of which this is an example)  can in fact be considered a definition of molecular stability.

Similarly, dissociation of dihydrogen into its atoms is highly unlikely under standard conditions:
H2O(g)→ 2 H(g)+ O(g)       ΔG° = +406.6 kJ
Again, an analogous situation would apply to any stable molecule.

Now consider the dissociation of dinitrogen tetroxide 
N2O4(g)→ 2 NO2(g)       ΔG° = +2.8 kJ
in which the positive value of ΔG° tells us that N2O4 at 1 atm pressure will not change into two moles of NO2 at the same pressure, but owing to the small absolute value of ΔG°, we can expect the spontaneity of the process to be quite sensitive to both the temperature (as shown in the table below) and to the pressure in exactly the way the Le Châtelier principle predicts.

For reactions involving dissolved ions, one has to be quite careful. Thus for the dissociation of the weak hydrofluoric acid
HF(aq) → H+(aq) + F–(aq)      ΔG° = –317 kJ  
it is clear that a 1 mol/L solution of HF will not dissociate into 1M ions,  but this fact is not very useful because if the HF is added to water, the initial concentration of the fluoride ion will be zero (and that of H+ very close to zero), and the Le Châtelier principle again predicts that some dissociation will be spontaneous.

It is common knowledge that dissociation of water into hydrogen- and hydroxyl ions occurs only very sparingly:
 H2O(l) → H+(aq) + OH–(aq)      ΔG° = 79.9 kJ  
which correctly predicts that the water will not form 1M (effective concentration) of the ions, but this is hardly news if you already know that the product of these ion concentrations can never exceed 10–14 at 298K.

Finally, consider this most familiar of all phase change processes, 
		 		the vaporization of liquid water:
H2O(l)→ H2O(g)     ΔG° = 8.58 kJ 
For more on the vapor pressure of water and relative humidity,  see here.
 Conversion of liquid water to its vapor at 1 atm partial pressure does not take place at 25° C, at which temperature the equiibrium partial pressure of the vapor (the "vapor pressure") is only 0.031 atm (23.8 torr.) Gaseous H2O at a pressure of 1 atm can only exist at 100° C. Of course, water left in an open container at room temperature will spontaneously evaporate if the partial pressure of water vapor in the air is less than 0.031 atm, corresponding to a relative humidity of under 100% 

Finding the equilibrium temperature
A reaction is in its equilibrium state when
ΔG = ΔH  TΔS = 0
The temperature at which this occurs is given by
T = ΔH / TΔS (4-4)
If we approximate ΔH by ΔH° and ΔS by ΔS°, we can estimate the normal boiling point of a liquid. From the following thermodynamic data for water:

Caution! Because ΔH° values are normally expressed in kilojoules while ΔS° is given in joules, a very common student error is to overlook the need to express both in the same units.
we find that liquid water is in equilibrium with water vapor at a partial pressure of 1 atm when the temperature is 
T = (44100 J) / (118.7 J K–1) = 371.5 K
But "the  normal boiling point of water is 373 K", you say? Very true. The reason we are off here is that both ΔH ° and ΔS ° have their own temperature dependencies; we are using the "standard" 25° values without correcting them to 100° C. Nevertheless, if you think about it, the fact that we can estimate the boiling point of a liquid from a table of thermodynamic data should be rather impressive!
Of course, the farther one gets from 298K, the more unreliable will be the result. Thus for the dissociation of dihydrogen into its atoms,

T = (436000 J) / (98.6 J K–1) = 4420 K
All one can say here is that H2 will break down at somethng over 3000K or so. (You may already know that all molecules will dissociate into their atoms at high temperatures.)
 

We tend to think of high temperatures as somehow "forcing" molecules to dissociate into their atoms, but this is wrong. In order to get the H–H bond to vibrate so violently through purely thermal excitation that the atoms would fly apart, a temperature more like 30,000K would be required. The proper interpretation is at the temperature corresponding to ΔH/TΔS, the molecule spontaneously absorbs energy from the surroundings sufficient to overcome the H-H bond strength.

Predicting the effects of temperature
In a previous section of this lesson we described the role of temperature in the Gibbs function, showed plots that explain how the sign of the TΔS term interacts with  that of ΔH to determine whether the reaction can take place at a given temperature. 
This can be more clearly understood by examining plots of TΔS° and ΔH° as functions of the temperature for some actual reactions. Of course these parameters refer to standard states that generally do not correspond to the temperatures, pressures, or concentrations that might be of interest in an actual case. Nevertheless, these quantities are easily found and they can usefully predict the way that temperature affects these systems.
 


Exothermic reaction, ΔS° > 0

 
C(graphite) + O2(g)→ CO2(g) ΔH° = 393 kJ
  ΔS° = +2.9 J K1,
  ΔG° = 394 kJ at 298 K.
             This combustion reaction, like most such reactions, is spontaneous at all temperatures. The positive entropy change is due mainly to the greater mass of CO2 molecules compared to those of O2.


Exothermic reaction, ΔS° < 0

3 H2 + N2 → 2 NH3(g)
ΔH° = 46.2 kJ,
ΔS° = 389 J K1,
ΔG° = 16.4 kJ at 298 K.
The decrease in moles of gas in the Haber ammonia synthesis drives the entropy change negative, making the reaction spontaneous only at low temperatures. Thus higher T, which speeds up the reaction, also reduces its extent.


Endothermic reaction, ΔS° > 0

N2O4(g)→ 2 NO2(g),
 ΔH° = 55.3 kJ,
ΔS° = +176 J K1

ΔG° = +2.8 kJ at 298 K.
Dissociation reactions are typically endothermic with positive entropy change, and are therefore spontaneous at high temperatures. Ultimately, all molecules decompose to their atoms at sufficiently high temperatures.


Endothermic reaction, ΔS° < 0

½ N2 + O2 → NO2(g)
               ΔH° = 33.2 kJ
ΔS° = 249 J K–1,
ΔG° = +51.3 kJ at 298 K.
This reaction is not spontaneous at any temperature, meaning that its reverse is always spontaneous. But because the reverse reaction is kinetically inhibited, NO2 can exist indefinitely at ordinary temperatures even though it is thermodynamically unstable.


 

6  Some remarks on the Gibbs free energy
Free energy: is it free? Is it energy? Is it real? 
It's not necessarily "free" 
The appellation free energy for G has led to so much confusion that many scientists now refer to it simply as the Gibbs energy. The free part of the older name reflects the steam-engine origins of thermodynamics with its interest in converting heat into work: ΔG is the maximum amount of energy which can be freed from the system to perform useful work.
By "useful", we mean work other than  that which is associated with the expansion of the system. This is most commonly in the form of electrical work (moving electric charge through a potential difference), but other forms of work (osmotic work, increase in surface area) are also possible. 
It's not energy! 
A much more serious difficulty with the Gibbs function, particularly in the context of chemistry, is that although G has the units of energy (joules, or in its intensive form, J mol1), it lacks one of the most important attributes of energy in that it is not conserved. Thus although the free energy always falls when a gas expands or a chemical reaction takes place spontaneously, there need be no compensating increase in energy anywhere else. Referring to G as an energy also reinforces the false but widespread notion that a fall in energy must accompany any change. But if we accept that energy is conserved, it is apparent that the only necessary condition for change (whether the dropping of a weight, expansion of a gas, or a chemical reaction) is the redistribution of energy. The quantity ΔG associated with a process represents the quantity of energy that is shared and spread, which as we have already explained is the meaning of the increase in the entropy. The quotient ΔG/T is in fact identical with ΔStotal, the entropy change of the world, whose increase is the primary criterion for any kind of change.
It's not even "real"! 
G differs from the thermodynamic quantities H and S in another significant way: it has no physical reality as a property of matter, whereas H and S can be related to the quantity and distribution of energy in a collection of molecules. The free energy is simply a useful construct that serves as a criterion for change and makes calculations easier. 


Who was Gibbs, anyway?
J. Willard Gibbs (1839-1903) is considered the father of modern thermodynamics and the most brilliant American-born scientist of the 19th century. He did most of his work in obscurity, publishing his difficult-to-understand papers in the Proceedings of the Connecticut Academy of Sciences, a little-read journal that was unknown to most of the world.


Some Gibbs links: brief bio - scientific biography.
              A remarkably rich account of Gibbs' seemingly gray life and his unusual powers of visualization was written by a noted American poet: M. Rukeyser, Willard Gibbs. Garden City, N.J.: Doubleday Duran and Co., Inc., 1942.

  Optional: Gibbs energy of mixing and dilution
In order to keep this rather long page from getting even longer, this topic has its own separate page.
Please note, however, that this material is not normally covered in elementary Chemistry courses. So unless you are enrolled in a university-level honors course which makes explicit reference to this topic, you can safely skip it.
That having been said, this additional matierial is a natural extension of what is presented above and leads to a more complete understanding of chemical equilibrium. It is presented in a way that emphasizes the basic concepts and avoids the mathematical rigor of the standard physical chemistry treatment.
 

Summary of key concepts
(You are expected to be able to define and explain the significance of terms identified in green type.)

The Gibbs [free] energy is a state function defined as G = H  TS . 
The Gibbs energy is the maximum useful work that a system can do on the surroundings when the process occurs reversibly at constant temperature and pressure. 
The practical utility of the Gibbs function is that ΔG for any process is negative if it leads to an increase in the entropy of the world. Thus spontaneous change at a given temperature and pressure can only occur when it would lead to a decrease in G. 
The sign of the standard free energy change ΔG° of a chemical reaction determines whether the reaction will tend to proceed in the forward or reverse direction. 
Similarly, the relative signs of ΔG° and ΔS° determine whether the spontaniety of a chemical reaction will be affected by the temperature, and if so, in what way. 
The existence of sharp melting and boiling points reflects the differing temperature dependancies of the free energies of the solid, liquid, and vapor phases of a pure substance, which are in turn reflect their differing entropies.

Driving Forces and Gibbs Free Energy
Some reactions are spontaneous because they give off
energy in the form of heat (H < 0). Others are spontaneous because they lead to an increase in the
disorder of the system (S > 0). Calculations of H and S can be used to probe the driving force behind a particular reaction.



Practice Problem 5:Calculate H and S  for the
    following reaction and decide in which direction each of these factors will drive the
    reaction.

What happens when one of the potential driving forces behind a chemical
reaction is favorable and the other is not? We can answer this question by defining a new
quantity known as the Gibbs free energy (G) of the system, which reflects
the balance between these forces.
The Gibbs free energy of a system at any moment in time is defined as the
enthalpy of the system minus the product of the temperature times the entropy of the
system.
G = H - TS
The Gibbs free energy of the system is a state function because it is
defined in terms of thermodynamic properties that are state functions. The change in the
Gibbs free energy of the system that occurs during a reaction is therefore equal to the
change in the enthalpy of the system minus the change in the product of the temperature
times the entropy of the system.
G
= H - (TS)
If the reaction is run at constant temperature, this equation can be
written as follows.
G
= H - TS
The change in the free energy of a system that occurs during a reaction
can be measured under any set of conditions. If the data are collected under
standard-state conditions, the result is the standard-state free energy of reaction
(Go).
Go
= Ho - TSo
The beauty of the equation defining the free energy of a system is its
ability to determine the relative importance of the enthalpy and entropy terms as driving
forces behind a particular reaction. The change in the free energy of the system that
occurs during a reaction measures the balance between the two driving forces that
determine whether a reaction is spontaneous. As we have seen, the enthalpy and entropy
terms have different sign conventions.



Favorable 

Unfavorable


Ho
    < 0

Ho
    > 0


So
    > 0 

So
    < 0



The entropy term is therefore subtracted from the enthalpy term when
calculating Go
for a reaction. 
Because of the way the free energy of the system is defined, Go is negative
for any reaction for which Ho is negative and So is positive. Go is therefore negative for any
reaction that is favored by both the enthalpy and entropy terms. We can therefore conclude
that any reaction for which Go is negative should be favorable, or spontaneous. 



Favorable, or spontaneous reactions:

Go
    < 0



Conversely, Go is positive for any reaction for which Ho is positive
and So
is negative. Any reaction for which Go is positive is therefore unfavorable.



Unfavorable, or non-spontaneous reactions:

Go
    > 0



Reactions are classified as either exothermic (H < 0) or endothermic
(H > 0) on the
basis of whether they give off or absorb heat. Reactions can also be classified as exergonic
(G < 0) or endergonic
(G > 0) on the
basis of whether the free energy of the system decreases or increases during the reaction.

When a reaction is favored by both enthalpy (Ho < 0) and
entropy (So
> 0), there is no need to calculate the value of Go to decide whether the reaction should
proceed. The same can be said for reactions favored by neither
enthalpy (Ho
> 0) nor entropy (So
< 0). Free energy calculations become important for reactions favored by only one of
these factors.

    following reaction:

      NH4+ (aq) + NO3- (aq)

    reaction at 25o C, and explain why NH4NO3 spontaneously
    dissolves is water at room temperature.

    to Practice Problem 6.





The Effect of Temperature on the Free Energy of a
Reaction 
The balance between the contributions from the
enthalpy and entropy terms to the free energy of a reaction depends on the temperature at
which the reaction is run.



Practice Problem 7:Use the values of  H and S calculated in Practice
    Problem 5 to predict whether the following reaction is spontaneous at 25C:

    answer to Practice Problem 7.

    to Practice Problem 7.



The equation used to define free energy suggests that the entropy term
will become more important as the temperature increases. 




Go
        = Ho - TSo




Since the entropy term is unfavorable, the reaction
should become less favorable as the temperature increases.

    following reaction is still spontaneous at 500C:

Standard-State Free Energies of Reaction
Go
for a reaction can be calculated from tabulated standard-state free energy data. Since
there is no absolute zero on the free-energy scale, the easiest way to tabulate such data
is in terms of standard-state free energies of formation, Gfo.
As might be expected, the standard-state free energy of formation of a substance is the
difference between the free energy of the substance and the free energies of its elements
in their thermodynamically most stable states at 1 atm, all measurements being made under
standard-state conditions.


Interpreting Standard-State Free Energy of
Reaction Data 
We are now ready to ask the obvious question: What does the value of Go tell us
about the following reaction?






N2(g) + 3 H2(g)  2 NH3(g)

Go
            = -32.96 kJ







By definition, the value of Go for a reaction measures the difference between
the free energies of the reactants and products when all components of the reaction are
present at standard-state conditions. 
Go
therefore describes this reaction only when all three components are present at 1 atm
pressure. 
The sign of Go tells us the direction in which the reaction has to shift to
come to equilibrium. The fact that Go is negative for this reaction at 25oC means that
a system under standard-state conditions at this temperature would have to shift to the
right, converting some of the reactants into products, before it can reach equilibrium.
The magnitude of Go for a reaction tells us how far the standard state is from
equilibrium. The larger the value of Go, the further the reaction has to go to get to
from the standard-state conditions to equilibrium.
Assume, for example, that we start with the following reaction under
standard-state conditions, as shown in the figure below.
N2(g) + 3 H2(g)  2 NH3(g)

The value of G at that moment in time will be equal to the standard-state free energy
for this reaction, Go.






When Qp = 1:

G = Go 







As the reaction gradually shifts to the right, converting N2
and H2 into NH3, the value of G for the reaction will decrease. If we could find
some way to harness the tendency of this reaction to come to equilibrium, we could get the
reaction to do work. The free energy of a reaction at any moment in time is therefore said
to be a measure of the energy available to do work.


The Relationship Between Free Energy and
Equilibrium Constants 
When a reaction leaves the standard state because of a change in the ratio
of the concentrations of the products to the reactants, we have to describe the system in
terms of non-standard-state free energies of reaction. The difference between Go and G for a reaction is
important. There is only one value of Go for a reaction at a given temperature, but there
are an infinite number of possible values of G.
The figure below shows the relationship between G for the following
reaction and the logarithm to the base e of the reaction quotient for the
reaction between N2 and H2 to form NH3.
N2(g) + 3 H2(g)  2 NH3(g)

Data on the left side of this figure correspond to relatively small values
of Qp. They therefore describe systems in which there is far more
reactant than product. The sign of G for these systems is negative and the magnitude of G is large. The system is
therefore relatively far from equilibrium and the reaction must shift to the right to
reach equilibrium. 
Data on the far right side of this figure describe systems in which there
is more product than reactant. The sign of G is now positive and the magnitude of G is moderately large. The
sign of G tells us
that the reaction would have to shift to the left to reach equilibrium. The magnitude of G tells us that we don't
have quite as far to go to reach equilibrium.
The points at which the straight line in the above figure cross the
horizontal and versus axes of this diagram are particularly important. The straight line
crosses the vertical axis when the reaction quotient for the system is equal to 1. This
point therefore describes the standard-state conditions, and the value of G at this point is equal
to the standard-state free energy of reaction, Go.






When Qp = 1: 

G = Go







The point at which the straight line crosses the horizontal axis describes
a system for which G
is equal to zero. Because there is no driving force behind the reaction, the system must
be at equilibrium.






When Qp = Kp:

G = 0







The relationship between the free energy of reaction at any moment in time
(G) and the
standard-state free energy of reaction (Go) is described by the following equation.
G
= Go + RT
ln Q
In this equation, R is the ideal gas constant in units of J/mol-K, T
is the temperature in kelvin, ln represents a logarithm to the base e, and Q
is the reaction quotient at that moment in time.
As we have seen, the driving force behind a chemical reaction is zero (G = 0) when the reaction
is at equilibrium (Q = K).
0 = Go
+ RT ln K
We can therefore solve this equation for the relationship between Go and K.
Go
= - RT ln K
This equation allows us to calculate the equilibrium constant for any
reaction from the standard-state free energy of reaction, or vice versa.
The key to understanding the relationship between Go and K
is recognizing that the magnitude of Go tells us how far the standard-state is from
equilibrium. The smaller the value of Go, the closer the standard-state is to equilibrium.
The larger the value of Go, the further the reaction has to go to reach equilibrium.
The relationship between Go and the equilibrium constant for a chemical reaction is
illustrated by the data in the table below.

The equilibrium constant for a reaction can be expressed in two ways: Kc
and Kp. We can write equilibrium constant expressions in terms of the
partial pressures of the reactants and products, or in terms of their concentrations in
units of moles per liter.
For gas-phase reactions the equilibrium constant
obtained from Go
is based on the partial pressures of the gases (Kp). For reactions in
solution, the equilibrium constant that comes from the calculation is based on
concentrations (Kc).

The Temperature Dependence of Equilibrium
Constants 
Equilibrium constants are not strictly constant because they change with
temperature. We are now ready to understand why.
The standard-state free energy of reaction is a measure of how far the
standard-state is from equilibrium.
Go
= - RT ln K
But the magnitude of Go depends on the temperature of the reaction.
Go
= Ho - TSo
As a result, the equilibrium constant must depend on the temperature of
the reaction.
A good example of this phenomenon is the reaction in which NO2
dimerizes to form N2O4.
2 NO2(g)  N2O4(g)
This reaction is favored by enthalpy because it forms a new bond, which
makes the system more stable. The reaction is not favored by entropy because it leads to a
decrease in the disorder of the system.
NO2 is a brown gas and N2O4 is colorless.
We can therefore monitor the extent to which NO2 dimerizes to form N2O4
by examining the intensity of the brown color in a sealed tube of this gas. What should
happen to the equilibrium between NO2 and N2O4 as the
temperature is lowered?
For the sake of argument, let's assume that there is no significant change
in either  Ho
or So
as the system is cooled. The contribution to the free energy of the reaction from the
enthalpy term is therefore constant, but the contribution from the entropy term becomes
smaller as the temperature is lowered.
Go
= Ho - TSo
As the tube is cooled, and the entropy term becomes less important, the
net effect is a shift in the equilibrium toward the right. The figure below shows what
happens to the intensity of the brown color when a sealed tube containing NO2
gas is immersed in liquid nitrogen. There is a drastic decrease in the amount of NO2
in the tube as it is cooled to -196oC.



Practice Problem 11:Use
    values of  Ho
    and Sofor
    the following reaction at 25C to estimate the equilibrium constant for this reaction at
    the temperature of boiling water (100C), ice(0C), a dry ice-acetone bath (-78C), and
    liquid nitrogen (-196C):
2 NO2(g)  N2O4(g)

The Relationship Between Free Energy and Cell
Potentials 
The value of G for a reaction at any moment in time tells us two things. The sign of G tells us in what
direction the reaction has to shift to reach equilibrium. The magnitude of G tells us how far the
reaction is from equilibrium at that moment.
The potential of an electrochemical cell is a measure of how far an
oxidation-reduction reaction is from equilibrium. The Nernst equation describes the
relationship between the cell potential at any moment in time and the standard-state cell
potential.

Let's rearrange this equation as follows.
nFE = nFEo - RT ln Q
We can now compare it with the equation used to describe the relationship
between the free energy of reaction at any moment in time and the standard-state free
energy of reaction.
G
= Go + RT
ln Q
These equations are similar because the Nernst equation is a special case
of the more general free energy relationship. We can convert one of these equations to the
other by taking advantage of the following relationships between the free energy of a
reaction and the cell potential of the reaction when it is run as an electrochemical cell.
G = -nFE


Practice Problem 12:Use the relationship
    between Go
    and Eo for an electrochemical reaction to derive the relationship
    between the standard-state cell potential and the equilibrium constant for the reaction.

University of California -  Los Angeles

                  UCLA's primary purpose as a public research university is the creation, dissemination, preservation and application of knowledge for the betterment of our global society. To fulfill this mission, UCLA is committed to academic freedom in its fullest terms: We value open access to information, free and lively debate conducted with mutual respect for individuals, and freedom from intolerance. In all of our pursuits, we strive at once for excellence and diversity, recognizing that openness and inclusion produce true quality. These values underlie our three institutional responsibilities.

Learning and teaching at UCLA are guided by the belief that undergraduate, graduate and professional school students and their teachers belong to a community of scholars. This community is dedicated to providing students with a foundational understanding of a broad range of disciplines followed by the opportunity for in-depth study in a chosen discipline. All members of the community are engaged together in discovering and advancing knowledge and practice. Learning occurs not only in the classroom but also through engagement in campus life and in communities and organizations beyond the university.                




 


University of San Francisco

                  The core mission of the University is to promote learning in the Jesuit Catholic tradition. The University offers undergraduate, graduate and professional students the knowledge and skills needed to succeed as persons and professionals, and the values and sensitivity necessary to be men and women for others.

Area Rugs Buying Guide



Shopping for an area rug can be overwhelming, especially when buying online—so we’re here to help make your search easier. Think of this guide as your starting point to answer the tough questions and help you find the size, quality, and style of area rug that’s the best fit for your space. Not sure about what size is right for your space or what look you want to achieve? We'll help you every step of the way!The rug buying questions you should be asking are:



Found out more about:

What's The Right Size
What's The Best Quality
What Look Do You Want
What Are The Care Details



What's the Right Size?

The size of your space and furniture layout are the two main considerations when choosing a area rug size. Avoid the common mistake of buying a throw rug that’s too small—if you’re unsure or between sizes, err on the larger side for a final look that feels thoughtful instead of haphazard.

Living Area

There are three common furniture arrangements that impact the size you should get. The rug should always be grounded under your coffee table, and the right dimensions determined from there based on the layout you want.
All Legs on the Rug

Front Legs on the Rug

Coffee Table on the Rug
An all-legs-on layout is the best choice for anchoring open concept spaces (and will require the largest area rug), front-legs-on is the most versatile, and only-coffee-table-on is ideal for small spaces. Keep uniformity across all your furniture pieces, so if only the front legs of your sofa are on the rug, the same goes for your armchairs and side tables, too.

Dining Room

Simply add 36 inches to both the length and width of your table—or to the diameter if it’s round. (Be sure to pull the leaves of your table out if you use them regularly when entertaining.) This rule prevents chairs from sitting on uneven surfaces or catching the edge of a rug as they’re pushed in.

All Legs on the Rug

All Legs on the Rug

Bedroom

Use your bed as the sizing guide for the three main layout options. The rug should always extend 18-24 inches beyond all sides of the bed.

All Legs on the Rug

2/3 Bed on the Rug

Runners on Each Side
When determining size, account for any furniture at the foot of the bed—the entire piece should either sit on or off the area or throw rug. If you have nightstands, measure the distance from the outer edges to find the right width. For runners, the width should be larger than your nightstands, but slightly shorter than the length of your bed.
Kitchen
For rooms with an island or galley layout, a runner can visually extend the space.
Hallway
Runners are the go-to choice for corridors, where it’s best not to have any furniture legs sit on the rug.
Entry
Let the shape of the space dictate the choice of round, rectangular, or runner, and use the width of your front door as a baseline. Check the pile height to ensure your door will clear the throw rug when it’s opened.


What Qualities Matter to You?
How a rug is made and the material it’s made with will determine the key qualities of the rug, like durability and softness. The best combination of the two depends on what’s important to you in the space you’re shopping for.

Holds up to High Traffic

Wool
Flat weave(Fibers are woven together into a thin, mat-like area rug.)
Knotted(Fibers are tied in individual knots.)

Ideal: Wool has resilient fibers that spring back, standing up to wear. Flat weave or knotted styles in cotton or synthetic materials are durable, easy to clean, and may be reversible.

Avoid:
Shag or high-pile rugs will flatten, especially in synthetic materials. Silk is too delicate to stand up to wear, and jute or sisal stain very easily.

Stands up to Stains

Cotton, synthetic, or wool
Low to no pile(Pile: The density of the fibers in a rug. Pile height is the thickness and ranges from flat (0-1/4 inch) to thick (1+ inch).)

Ideal: Cotton and synthetic materials are very easy to clean, and cotton is often machine washable. Wool is naturally stain resistant. Low-pile weaves are the easiest to spot treat.

Avoid: Jute and sisal can irreversibly stain. Some pets can be allergic to jute.

Can Handle Moisture

Synthetic materials
Wool in flat-woven styles(Fibers are woven together into a thin, mat-like rug.)

Ideal: Silk and jute are moisture sensitive, and a high pile will absorb humidity.

Avoid: Jute and sisal can irreversibly stain. Some pets can be allergic to jute.

Lasts for Decades

Wool
Handmade (The gold standard that creates strong, long-lasting rugs.)

Ideal: Handmade rugs in wool, especially hand-knotted or hand-tufted, are the best—though they’re more expensive. Shorter pile heights will wear better over time.

Avoid: Cotton and synthetic materials in machine-made styles are better short-term options. High pile throw rugs are likely to matte or dent.


What Look Do You Want?
Choosing a rug is a matter of taste—there’s no right or wrong choice. But if you’re not sure what style you want, here’s how you can think about it.

Neutral Room, Statement Rug


Photo: Natalie Myers
If you want your rug to be the statement piece in a room with mostly solid colored furniture or a subtle overall palette, consider a high-contrast pattern. Bold geometric prints, bright kilims, Orientals with lots of detail, or overdyed Persians can be the star of the show.
Choosing a rug is a matter of taste—there’s no right or wrong choice. But if you’re not sure what style you want, here’s how you can think about it.

Neutral Room, Quiet Rug


Photo: Victoria Elizabeth Design
If you like your neutral or monochromatic room the way it is and want your rug to follow suit, look for a rug in the same color palette that features a subtle pattern or texture. Natural fiber rugs, like jute and sisal, are also a great option.

Bold Room, Quiet Rug


Photo: A Place of My Taste
You’ve got two options. A solid, neutral-color or natural-fiber area rug are great options for keeping it simple. Or, choose a solid throw rug in the secondary color of your room’s palette for a cohesive look.

Bold Room, Statement Rug


Photo: Chango & Co.
If you have a dramatic style, go all in with the rug you love. If you already have pattern in your room, keep the scale rule in mind: Any new print you introduce should be four times bigger or smaller than the others so as not to compete with or overwhelm your existing look.

Not Sure?


Photo: Common Bond Design
That’s OK! Stick with the standbys: stripes, solid color, or jute rugs. Think of it as a starter rug, and look for simple, more affordable options.


The Care Details

Here’s what you should know before purchasing.
Machine-Washable vs. Professional Cleaning

Most cotton rugs can be machine-washed. Wool, silk, hides, and natural fiber rugs should be professionally cleaned. Some rugs can only be spot-cleaned.
Frequency

It's important to deep-clean rugs every 12-18 months.
Vacuuming


All rugs, regardless of material, can and should be vacuumed regularly without the brush roll on to keep from damaging the fibers.

Jute and sisal rugs should be vacuumed frequently because of their loose weave.
Tufted wool rugs should be vacuumed frequently, especially early on, as they shed.
Delicate or high-pile rugs can be shaken out and brushed to clean.

Area Rugs



Using an area rug can help define your space and solidify your overall theme. Perhaps you need a little splash of colour to really bring the room together or you want to find something that will accent the sofa. Maybe you need an area rug to cover up that hideous stain on the floor that you cannot get rid of! Whatever the reason for needing or wanting an area rug, know that we have the selection and the price that will make you happy. Shop online at Wayfair to find an area or throw rug that will match the décor and style of any room – whether it is for a dining room, kitchen bedroom or living room floor.



When looking to buy your new area rug, there are a few things to consider. Here are a few commonly asked questions:

How do I know what size area rug to buy? 
First, you should consider the size and the shape of your room. If you have a round room with circular furniture, a round rug would be right for you. If you have all square furniture in a square room, a square area rug is best for you. From here you want to make sure the rug is big enough to be placed on the ground and not completely covered by any furniture that's placed on top of it. When in doubt, order a rug that's a little bit bigger to make sure your sofa, sitting chairs, bed, or any other piece of furniture doesn’t hide the area rug. For a more detailed guide on this, you can read our area rug size guide. 



Which area rug material is right for my space?
Popular area rugs include sheepskin rugs, cotton rugs, wool rugs, braided rugs, natural fiber rugs, and more. When picking the right style rug, think about the purpose of your room. Is the room used a lot with a considerable amount of foot traffic and furniture movement? If so, you may want to opt for a wool or cotton rug as they are much more durable than a natural fiber or sea grass rug. Put a sheepskin rug in your bedroom or sitting rooms to help achieve that warm glam look. Design options are endless with fun and creative area rugs.  



How to I find the perfect area rug?
To buy area rugs, it's best to use the filters on the left to narrow your selection. If you're looking for the popular 5' x 7' rug, for example, you can hit the 5' to 8' filter to see only the rugs that are the right size for your space. Similarly you can filter by the colours of the area rug, shape, pattern, material and more. Also be aware that most of the area rugs we offer come in multiple sizes. Look for the "More Options" link beneath the picture. In these cases, the site will list a price range rather than a single fixed price, representing the cost of different sizes or shapes of the rug.  



Cat Area Rug Tip: Cats that have not been declawed may want to sharpen their claws on your area rug. It has been observed that cats strongly prefer wool rugs for claw sharpening and are less interested in synthetics, particularly when cat tree or scratching post is available nearby.
Whether you are looking for a wool rug, rag rug, braided rug, or oriental rug, we have it all. We even have faux animal rugs, which include grizzly bears, black bears, pandas, and tigers – a fun option for kids! Choose from a variety of different colours, styles, and patterns sure to blend in nicely with your home décor.Wayfair.ca features a wide selection of Area Rugs so that you can find the perfect one for your home. Whether you live in Calgary, Toronto, Vancouver, or somewhere else, you'll discover a variety of Area Rugs options from top brand like Laurel Foundry Modern Farmhouse and Red Barrel Studio.
