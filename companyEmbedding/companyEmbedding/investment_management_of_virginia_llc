Our approach

Leaders of small and mid-sized businesses have multiple roles and competing priorities. You want a best-in-class retirement plan but may be unsure about all the complexities and requirements. You may be uncertain about the costs and fees involved. You need a provider focused solely on retirement and aligned with your needs and goals—and fully committed to you, your participants, and the ongoing improvement of retirement investing.

Vanguard is committed to the retirement business and is a leader in the retirement plan industry. Best of all, you can benefit from Vanguard's unique ownership structure: We're owned by our clients and not by outside investors or stockholders. That means you never need to question whose interests come first for us. This approach serves as a foundation for all that we do with Vanguard Retirement Plan Access™, our 401(k) offer for small and mid-sized plans. You can count on our expertise to remove the uncertainties from managing your plan and our leadership to help you offer a strong plan for your participants. 



Key benefits




You can:

Have confidence in your plan.
Understand your costs.
Focus on your business.





Cost-conscious?
As a business owner and plan fiduciary, you want to eliminate ambiguity in retirement plan costs. Research has shown that plan costs for the smaller end of the market tend to be higher, and you need a retirement plan provider that not only provides transparent pricing but has a fair and reasonable cost structure.1
With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access:

You receive an All-in Fee Report that shows the total cost of your plan.
You have access to low-cost Vanguard index funds, plus the opportunity to choose from among more than 12,000 non-Vanguard funds.
Your annual recordkeeping price is based on a per-participant fee—a fee that doesn't jump as your assets grow, as with many small to mid-sized retirement plans.
You have flexibility in how you cover your plan costs—including a recordkeeping credit depending on the share class selected.




Too busy?
 As a business owner, you're pressed for time and focused on many aspects of business. With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access, you can rely on high-quality recordkeeping and administration to ease your administrative burden and help your employees stay on track for retirement.

Forward thinking and decisive action are keys to winning chess and successful investing. Investment Management of Virginia, LLC has the experience, knowledge and versatility to identify opportunities and challenges for our clients.
Investment Management of Virginia, LLC (IMVA) is a registered investment advisor providing professional money management services to high net-worth individuals, foundations, and institutions. We offer several equity-based investment management styles and tailored programs to meet our client’s individual preferences.
Our firm operates under the following guiding principles:


Independence
IMVA’s independence allows us to focus on our clients’ best interests. IMVA is not affiliated with any bank or broker-dealer. Originally established in 1982 as a subsidiary of Scott & Stringfellow, Inc., the firm became independent in July of 2000, following a management-led buyout.


Experience
Experience is one of IMVA’s strengths. The firm’s investment professionals average more than 20 years in the investment industry. This depth of professional experience gives the firm a tested understanding of the advantages of long-term investing and a solid foundation for the ongoing execution of robust and replicable investment processes.  The firm’s partners are active in the business and are focused on using the portfolio management team for the full benefit of the firm’s clients.


Service
Serving clients’ best interest is IMVA’s first priority. Our client focus allows us to address concerns, questions, or other issues quickly. We also communicate regularly through our quarterly letters, which include clear portfolio appraisals, investment returns, and transaction summaries.  In addition, portfolio managers are available to arrange personal meetings.



Transparency
Our clients custody their accounts at a brokerage firm, bank or trust company of their choosing and are not locked into long-term investment arrangements.
 


Long-Term Focus
We have a long-term focus in our investment styles.  Portfolio turnover in our strategies is typically between 10 and 40 percent, indicating that we hold stocks for an average of two to five years.  The relatively low turnover improves the potential for tax-efficient, compound growth.  Low turnover also reduces trading commissions and fees.

The Opportunity Portfolio
 
IMVA’s Opportunity Portfolio invests in equity securities that, in the opinion of the portfolio manager, represent unique opportunities for capital appreciation. Considerable appreciation potential at an attractive price is the primary investment criterion, and both value and growth companies are considered for purchase. Typical investment attributes include reasonable price/earnings multiples relative to projected earnings and cash flow growth, strong or improving profit margins, a solid financial position, and impressive management. “Insider” transactions, stock buy-backs, effective use of innovative technologies, exposure to international markets, and identifiable catalysts for change are other important considerations.
The portfolio manager relies on personal contact with management (when possible), published financial reports, analyst meetings and conferences, and the advice of securities analysts with proven knowledge of a company and its industry. Some sectors are more heavily weighted than others based on the manager’s judgment that certain industries are substantially more attractive than others at any given time.
The Opportunity Portfolio investment range includes small, medium, and large capitalization companies. Over time, each account owns approximately the same stocks in similar percentages. The Portfolio generally holds 20 to 30 positions in each account.
The Opportunity Portfolio employs a highly concentrated investment style and will normally produce results that are considerably more volatile than those of the broader market. Consequently, the Portfolio may be appropriate for long-term, risk tolerant investors.
The Opportunity Portfolio uses the S&P 500 and the S&P 1500 indices as its benchmarks.

Investment Philosophy

IMVA’s portfolio managers are long-term investors. Their investment goal is to produce attractive long-term returns for clients within the context of a particular portfolio’s strategy and risk tolerance parameters. Fundamentally, IMVA wants to invest in quality companies, at attractive prices, for long-term ownership.
Within the context of a given portfolio or investment strategy, the portfolio managers believe “quality” is determined by a company’s balance sheet strength, net income and cash flow potential, management strength, and the “barriers to entry” associated with the business. After considering these attributes, IMVA seeks only those opportunities where price provides an attractive opportunity to generate above-average returns on the investment capital employed.
IMVA maintains several distinct investment styles. Each portfolio’s management team has, for its style, different investment and risk tolerance parameters. These investment styles may include small and/or large capitalization securities and growth and/or value holdings. In each case, the portfolio managers are looking for attractive risk-to-reward opportunities in companies whose quality and strength are undervalued by the market at the time of investment.
Business Analysis
IMVA uses quantitative screening to reduce the large universe of companies to a more manageable list of opportunities, but the firm’s primary due diligence effort consists of fundamental analysis of individual businesses. Simply put, the portfolio managers want to understand the company and the risks involved with owning the business. The process involves a thorough analysis of the key drivers of business operations, business strategy, management’s integrity and vision, financial strength and stability, and, most importantly, an estimate of the trend of future net income and cash flows. The intent of this initial process is to pass judgment on the strength of the basic business and its potential.
Stock Price Analysis
If the business analysis described indicates that a company’s business and strategy are compelling, IMVA portfolio managers endeavor to determine an attractive entry price. After analyzing current and potential growth trends in earnings, dividends, book value, sales, and cash flow, the managers compare these metrics to the historic ranges to determine the assumptions and risk currently reflected in the pricing of a stock. While not a perfect science, this strategy seeks first to eliminate as much of the price risk as possible in order to increase the probability of capturing attractive capital gains.
Fundamental Analysis and Process
The IMVA research process is designed to evaluate the intrinsic business value and price risks of a stock in an attempt to create a “margin of safety” at purchase. This process is specifically geared toward finding opportunities where the common stock of quality companies has been mispriced, due to excessive fear in the marketplace, temporary business disruptions, or other transitory factors. Extensive study, evaluation, and a clear understanding of a company and its stock can give portfolio managers the confidence to place investments at opportune times (frequently when many other investors may be selling). Prior to investing, the portfolio managers generally will have developed expectations of future business achievements on which rest specific targets or “hurdles.” These events or developments can be used to track a company’s progress and assist the managers in determining whether the investment should be held or sold. When investments work well, portfolio managers use valuation-driven price targets in order to maintain an appropriate risk-to-reward ratio in the security.
Portfolio Construction
The first step in selecting an IMVA portfolio depends upon understanding client needs, risk tolerance, and investment objectives. IMVA’s mission is to meet and exceed client expectations by providing excellent service and delivering attractive investment returns over a long-term investment horizon.
Flexibility in satisfying special or unique client needs is an integral part of IMVA’s daily attitude and overall business approach.
Risk Management
All investments have the potential for short and long-term volatility and/or loss. Though risk levels and investment parameters vary by strategy within IMVA, each investment style is subject to ongoing due diligence, with the goal of balancing risks and rewards. Specifically, managers try to identify and maintain a margin of safety between the stock price and the company’s long-term intrinsic value. As stock prices advance, IMVA portfolio managers continuously evaluate return potential versus downside risk. Generally, when target prices are met or exceeded, or positions grow excessive in the manager’s judgment or vis-à-vis a given strategy’s parameters, managers may trim or liquidate positions. Liquidations of unsuccessful positions are an unpleasant but necessary step at times as well. When significant price declines occur, managers will attempt to assess the price action in the context of the company’s long-term fundamentals and determine a course of action; these may include adding to a position, scaling back a position, or liquidating a position and re-deploying the capital elsewhere.
Fixed Income/Balanced Portfolios
Bonds can be an important element in risk management and portfolio construction for some investors. As IMVA’s portfolio managers work with clients to determine the suitability of a specific investment policy, it may become apparent that a Balanced (fixed income/equity) investment approach is appropriate. IMVA generally focuses on investment grade bond issues with short and intermediate-term maturities. Bond maturities are structured to meet specific client income needs and to provide liquidity for withdrawals.

Consensus Ratings for Time (NYSE:TIME) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 4 Hold Ratings, 1 Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.20)Consensus Price Target: $15.20 (9.75% upside)

Our approach

Leaders of small and mid-sized businesses have multiple roles and competing priorities. You want a best-in-class retirement plan but may be unsure about all the complexities and requirements. You may be uncertain about the costs and fees involved. You need a provider focused solely on retirement and aligned with your needs and goals—and fully committed to you, your participants, and the ongoing improvement of retirement investing.

Vanguard is committed to the retirement business and is a leader in the retirement plan industry. Best of all, you can benefit from Vanguard's unique ownership structure: We're owned by our clients and not by outside investors or stockholders. That means you never need to question whose interests come first for us. This approach serves as a foundation for all that we do with Vanguard Retirement Plan Access™, our 401(k) offer for small and mid-sized plans. You can count on our expertise to remove the uncertainties from managing your plan and our leadership to help you offer a strong plan for your participants. 



Key benefits




You can:

Have confidence in your plan.
Understand your costs.
Focus on your business.





Cost-conscious?
As a business owner and plan fiduciary, you want to eliminate ambiguity in retirement plan costs. Research has shown that plan costs for the smaller end of the market tend to be higher, and you need a retirement plan provider that not only provides transparent pricing but has a fair and reasonable cost structure.1
With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access:

You receive an All-in Fee Report that shows the total cost of your plan.
You have access to low-cost Vanguard index funds, plus the opportunity to choose from among more than 12,000 non-Vanguard funds.
Your annual recordkeeping price is based on a per-participant fee—a fee that doesn't jump as your assets grow, as with many small to mid-sized retirement plans.
You have flexibility in how you cover your plan costs—including a recordkeeping credit depending on the share class selected.




Too busy?
 As a business owner, you're pressed for time and focused on many aspects of business. With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access, you can rely on high-quality recordkeeping and administration to ease your administrative burden and help your employees stay on track for retirement.

Forward thinking and decisive action are keys to winning chess and successful investing. Investment Management of Virginia, LLC has the experience, knowledge and versatility to identify opportunities and challenges for our clients.
Investment Management of Virginia, LLC (IMVA) is a registered investment advisor providing professional money management services to high net-worth individuals, foundations, and institutions. We offer several equity-based investment management styles and tailored programs to meet our client’s individual preferences.
Our firm operates under the following guiding principles:


Independence
IMVA’s independence allows us to focus on our clients’ best interests. IMVA is not affiliated with any bank or broker-dealer. Originally established in 1982 as a subsidiary of Scott & Stringfellow, Inc., the firm became independent in July of 2000, following a management-led buyout.


Experience
Experience is one of IMVA’s strengths. The firm’s investment professionals average more than 20 years in the investment industry. This depth of professional experience gives the firm a tested understanding of the advantages of long-term investing and a solid foundation for the ongoing execution of robust and replicable investment processes.  The firm’s partners are active in the business and are focused on using the portfolio management team for the full benefit of the firm’s clients.


Service
Serving clients’ best interest is IMVA’s first priority. Our client focus allows us to address concerns, questions, or other issues quickly. We also communicate regularly through our quarterly letters, which include clear portfolio appraisals, investment returns, and transaction summaries.  In addition, portfolio managers are available to arrange personal meetings.



Transparency
Our clients custody their accounts at a brokerage firm, bank or trust company of their choosing and are not locked into long-term investment arrangements.
 


Long-Term Focus
We have a long-term focus in our investment styles.  Portfolio turnover in our strategies is typically between 10 and 40 percent, indicating that we hold stocks for an average of two to five years.  The relatively low turnover improves the potential for tax-efficient, compound growth.  Low turnover also reduces trading commissions and fees.

Investment Management
Insights, Strategies and Solutions
Our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional, alternative and non-financial assets.  We can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs.






Portfolio Consulting
A collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager
Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.
4 Brokerage services are provided by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a registered broker-dealer, Member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation.
Certain U.S. Trust associates are registered representatives with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S") and may assist you with investment products and services provided through MLPF&S and other nonbank investment affiliates. MLPF&S is a registered broker-dealer, member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BofA Corp."). U.S. Trust operates through Bank of America, N.A., and other subsidiaries of BofA Corp.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
