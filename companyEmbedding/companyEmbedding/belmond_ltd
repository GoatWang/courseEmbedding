Company OverviewOur Portfolio




Belmond Ltd. (the “Company”) is a hotel company and sophisticated adventure travel operator delivering luxury experiences in some of the world’s most inspiring and enriching destinations. Operated and marketed under the Belmond brand (belmond.com), the Company’s collection embraces 49 hotel, river cruise, safari and luxury rail businesses in 24 countries. The Company was established in 1976 with the purchase of Belmond Hotel Cipriani in Venice and then shortly thereafter with the recreation of the celebrated Venice Simplon-Orient-Express (“VSOE”), linking London, Paris and Venice, along with other European cities. The Company’s Class A common shares were listed on the New York Stock Exchange in August 2000 and trade under the ticker symbol BEL.
The creation of the Company has in itself been a fascinating global journey. James B Sherwood, Founder and Chairman Emeritus, acquired the legendary Belmond Hotel Cipriani for the Company in 1976, going on to purchase the first two VSOE carriages a year later before scouring Europe to discover others, including many from the fabled Orient Express service of the 1920s and 1930s, to make up a full train rake. Each carriage was painstakingly restored, from the original marquetry to the glamorous Lalique glass panels before, in 1982, the VSOE – returned to its original splendor – pulled out of London’s Victoria station and headed south for Venice.
Today the Company’s collection is diverse, spanning land and water, adventure and relaxation, combining a strong local presence and international acclaim. The Company owns, part-owns and/or manages 37 hotels, including iconic properties such as Belmond Grand Hotel Europe, St. Petersburg; Belmond Copacabana Palace, Rio de Janeiro; Belmond Maroma Resort & Spa, Riviera Maya; and Belmond El Encanto, Santa Barbara. The Company’s eight tourist trains include the legendary VSOE in Europe, the Eastern & Oriental Express in Southeast Asia and Belmond Royal Scotsman, and its three river cruise operations include Belmond Road to Mandalay on the Ayeyarwady River in Myanmar and Belmond Afloat in France, which operates luxury péniche-hôtels (barges) on the inland waterways of France. The Company also operates ‘21’, one of New York’s most storied restaurants, and the Company also part-owns and manages PeruRail in Peru, which operates, among other routes, the Cusco-Machu Picchu train services used by nearly every tourist to Peru, including the first-class Belmond Hiram Bingham train experience. 
The Company seeks to operate additional distinctive luxury properties and travel experiences throughout the world to enhance its portfolio. The Company is actively pursuing management contracts for hotels in key destinations, including major gateway cities. It seeks out luxurious properties and distinctive assets where it can promote a local brand’s unique identity. These iconic names are unified by the Belmond brand, which assures exceptional quality and service.
The Company is highly committed to the implementation of responsible business practices furthering the sustainability of tourism, ensuring that its properties and corporate offices engage with their local communities and environments in a positive manner through their on-going activities. A cornerstone of the Company’s philosophy is the promise of authentic and one-of-a-kind luxury travel experiences that connect guests with the culture and environment of unique locations. Likewise, the Company’s long-term commitment to environmental sustainability and social responsibility embodies a Think Global, Act Local approach and includes:

the adoption of sustainable food sourcing principles throughout all properties developed by Raymond Blanc OBE, Vice President, Gastronomy 
the implementation of meaningful educational programs around wellness and nutrition for employees and, where appropriate, local communities 
the implementation of accountable and transparent measures to reduce the impact of our operations on the environment and ensure our properties are energy efficient

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
Belmond is deeply committed to the communities at our worldwide destinations. We are also strongly aware of our responsibility towards natural resources and the environment, especially at locations close to World Heritage Sites.




All our hotels, trains and river cruises run initiatives to support the places and people that surround them. As part of our “Think Global, Act Local” approach we:Purchase as much food as possible from sustainable sourcesRun and support educational programmesFollow sustainable practices to reduce the impact of our operations on the environment and to ensure energy efficiency



Examples that embrace these aims include: 


Belmond Hotel das Cataratas in Brazil’s Iguassu National Park supports an ecology school and a project to protect endangered jaguars and pumas.





Belmond Road to Mandalay and Belmond Orcaella, our Myanmar river cruisers, have helped to build and run more than 20 schools and clinics along their routes thanks to the generous contributions of both staff and guests. It is 20 years since we first began operating cruises in Myanmar and we will celebrate in December with a fund-raising anniversary cruise.





Belmond Palacio Nazarenas in Cusco, Peru, works with local farmers to source unusual ingredients for its kitchens at fair trade prices. Dairy products and flowers come from an organic farm nearby.





Belmond Charleston Place runs Feed the Need and Teach the Need programmes to help homeless and low-income people access nutritious food and train high school students in hospitality skills.





The Eastern & Oriental Express train in Southeast Asia has hosted a “Tiger Express” journey that raised £27,700 for UK charity Save Wild Tigers. The funds will help to protect this threatened species native to the rainforest along the train’s route.

Current initiatives

Every Belmond product, be it an iconic city hotel or our lodge at Machu Picchu, is profoundly respectful of its community and environment. 
Over the years we have constantly undertaken initiatives to ensure that we tread lightly and indeed make a positive contribution to the many destinations where our company operates around the world. 
 Among our many initiatives, the food and beverage operations of the majority of Belmond’s products are assessed by the UK-based Sustainable Restaurant Association. Belmond is the first global luxury hospitality brand to have undertaken this third party testing.

HAMILTON, Bermuda
  --(BUSINESS WIRE)--
  Belmond Ltd. (NYSE:BEL) (the “Company”), owners, part-owners or managers
  of 47 luxury hotel, restaurant, tourist train and river cruise
  properties, including three scheduled to open over the course of the
  next twelve months, which operate in 23 countries, today announced its
  results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2016. 
 Roeland Vos, president and chief executive officer, remarked: “Results
  for our second quarter were in line with our expectations, with constant
  currency RevPAR at the bottom of our guidance range, reflecting specific
  challenges in select parts of our global portfolio. However, we were
  pleased with the directional performance at a number of properties and
  benefited from a reduction in central overheads compared to the
  prior-year quarter. The year-over-year net decrease in our second
  quarter 2016 adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to an expected decrease
  in EBITDA at our Italian hotels due in large part to the Biennale art
  festival in
  Venice, Italy
  , which occurs every other year and took place
  in 2015, and an anticipated lull in demand for our two hotels in
  Brazil
  ahead of August’s Summer Olympic Games in
  Rio de Janeiro
  . 
 "During the second quarter, we hosted an investor and analyst meeting in
  New York
  at which we unveiled a focused strategic plan to double the
  Company’s adjusted EBITDA and properties in operation by 2020. The
  message we provided at our meeting was straightforward: we have
  successfully repositioned the Company in recent years; we have a solid
  foundation from which we expect to grow; and we have a clear strategy,
  with a defined roadmap and ambitious but achievable goals. We intend to
  execute our strategic plan in a disciplined manner by focusing on three
  key areas: driving organic growth, continuing to build brand awareness
  and expanding our global footprint. With nearly half of our growth
  expected to come from existing properties, organic growth is a vital
  component of the plan, and, at the investor and analyst meeting, we
  provided specific examples of operating initiatives already executed or
  underway. We continue to be engaged in identifying and evaluating
  revenue-generating, cost-saving and investment opportunities across the
  globe, and we anticipate bringing additional initiatives to market in
  the near future. Driving the other half of our growth, our global
  footprint expansion efforts are also gaining traction, and I am pleased
  to report that we recently announced a new luxury overnight train
  experience in
  Peru
  , Belmond Andean Explorer, which we expect to launch
  in May 2017. This additional train product will follow and complement
  our new luxury overnight train experience in
  Ireland
  , Belmond Grand
  Hibernian, which is scheduled to commence operations in the third
  quarter of 2016. We are encouraged by the progress we have already made
  on our strategic plan and will provide regular updates on the
  achievement of our 2020 aspirational goals as we move forward. 
 "Looking specifically at the remainder of 2016, we see promising
  indications of solid growth but acknowledge the inherent uncertainty of
  recent global events. In particular, we believe that it is too early to
  assess the full impact on Belmond of the United Kingdom’s decision to
  leave the European Union, which has led to the recent decrease in the
  value of the British pound. At a high-level, this decision primarily
  impacts the Company’s results in two ways: translation of
  pound-denominated operations and central overheads to
  U.S.
  dollars and
  demand for our luxury travel experiences from British guests. From a
  translation standpoint, a decrease in the pound is marginally beneficial
  to the Company’s
  U.S.
  dollar reported results due to the fact that the
  majority of the Company’s central overheads are pound denominated. On
  the demand side, 13% of the Company’s hotel guests originate from the
  United Kingdom
  , although we have not yet seen a material shift in their
  booking behavior. 
 "Even with these uncertainties, we expect to have a solid third quarter,
  driven largely by the benefit of the Olympic Games on Belmond Copacabana
  Palace in
  Rio de Janeiro
  and demand for our European hotels during their
  peak season. As such, for the full year 2016, we are maintaining our
  guidance for same store, constant currency RevPAR growth of between 3%
  and 7%." 
Second Quarter 2016 Operating Results
 Total revenue for the second quarter of 2016 was
  $158.1 million
  , a
  $4.7
    million
  or 3% decrease from total revenue for the second quarter of
  2015. In constant currency, total revenue for the second quarter of 2016
  increased
  $0.6 million
  over the second quarter of 2015. 
 Same store RevPAR for owned hotels for the second quarter of 2016
  decreased 1% from the prior-year quarter on a constant currency basis as
  a result of a 1% decrease in average daily rate ("ADR"), with occupancy
  in line with that of the prior-year quarter. 
 Total adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2016 was
  $38.1 million
  ,
  a
  $2.8 million
  or 7% decrease from total adjusted EBITDA of
  $40.9
    million
  for the second quarter of 2015. In constant currency, total
  adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2016 decreased
  $2.0 million
  or
  5% from the second quarter of 2015. 
 Net earnings attributable to Belmond Ltd. for the second quarter of 2016
  were
  $8.4 million
  (
  $0.08
  per common share), a
  $7.0 million
  or 45%
  decrease from
  $15.4 million
  (
  $0.15
  per common share) for the second
  quarter of 2015. The year-over-year decrease was largely attributable to
  a gain on sale of Hotel Ritz,
  Madrid, Spain
  of
  $19.8 million
  , partially
  offset by a goodwill impairment of
  $5.7 million
  and net tax expense
  related to the preceding two items of
  $4.2 million
  , recognized in the
  prior-year quarter. 
 Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations for the second quarter
  of 2016 were
  $4.0 million
  (
  $0.04
  per common share), a
  $2.9 million
  or
  42% decrease from
  $6.9 million
  (
  $0.07
  per common share) for the second
  quarter of 2015. 
Recent Company Highlights

Announces new luxury train in
    Peru
— In June 2016, the Company
    announced the launch of South America’s first luxury sleeper train,
    Belmond Andean Explorer in
    Peru
    . The new train, which is expected to
    launch in May 2017, is set to travel along one of the highest rail
    routes on earth, traversing the Peruvian Andes from Cusco to Lake
    Titicaca and Arequipa, on one- and two-night journeys with a maximum
    of 68 guests. The train is owned by PeruRail, the Company's 50/50
    joint venture that engages in passenger and freight train operations,
    and will be managed by the Company. 
Refinances loan secured by Belmond Charleston Place,
    South Carolina
—
    In June 2016, Charleston Place LLC, the owner of Belmond Charleston
    Place, refinanced its
    $86.0 million
    loan secured on its real and
    personal property with an amended
    $112.0 million
    loan. The amended
    loan has approximately three years remaining until maturity with no
    annual amortization and an interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.35%. The
    majority of the additional proceeds from this refinancing were used to
    repay in full a local loan facility with a principal balance of
    $10.0
      million
    and an accrued interest balance of
    $16.8 million
    . 
Expands room product offering at Belmond Miraflores Park,
    Lima,
      Peru
— In July 2016, the Company commenced operation of eight new
    junior suites on the third floor of Belmond Miraflores Park. Replacing
    offices, meeting space and a business center, the new keys increase
    the hotel's key count by 10% — from 81 to 89. 

Second Quarter 2016 Business Unit Results
Owned hotels:

Europe
  :
 For the second quarter of 2016, revenue from owned hotels was
  $67.0
    million
  , a decrease of
  $4.8 million
  or 7% from
  $71.8 million
  for the
  second quarter of 2015. In constant currency, revenue for the region for
  the second quarter of 2016 decreased
  $2.7 million
  or 4% from the
  prior-year quarter primarily due to a revenue decrease of
  $3.6 million
  or 22% at Belmond Hotel Cipriani,
  Venice, Italy
  partially due to a
  challenging comparable period, with revenue for the second quarter of
  2015 benefiting from the Biennale art festival, which occurs every other
  year, and the final receipt of
  $1.1 million
  of settlement income related
  to the 2010 settlement of the Cipriani trademark litigation. Partially
  offsetting this decline, Belmond Reid's Palace, Madeira,
  Portugal
  increased revenue by
  $0.7 million
  or 18% due to occupancy growth of 8
  percentage points as a result of capitalizing on increased demand for
  the destination; Belmond Hotel Caruso,
  Ravello, Italy
  increased revenue
  by
  $0.6 million
  or 11% due to transient-driven ADR growth of 10%; and
  Belmond La Residencia, Mallorca,
  Spain
  grew revenue by
  $0.4 million
  or
  8% mainly as a result of improved revenue management coupled with
  increased demand for the destination, which drove 14% RevPAR growth. 
 In constant currency, same store RevPAR for owned hotels in the region
  was in line with the prior-year quarter, as a 2 percentage point
  increase in occupancy was offset by a 4% decrease in ADR. 
 Adjusted EBITDA for the region for the quarter of
  $26.3 million
  represented a decrease of
  $3.3 million
  or 11% from
  $29.6 million
  for the
  second quarter of 2015. In constant currency, adjusted EBITDA for the
  region for the second quarter of 2016 decreased
  $2.4 million
  or 8% from
  the prior-year quarter mainly due to an adjusted EBITDA decrease of
  $2.8
    million
  or 36% at Belmond Hotel Cipriani, partially offset by adjusted
  EBITDA growth of
  $0.4 million
  or 20% at Belmond La Residencia;
  $0.4
    million
  or 19% at Belmond Hotel Caruso; and
  $0.3 million
  or 23% at
  Belmond Reid's Palace. 

North America
  :
 Revenue from owned hotels for the second quarter of 2016 was
  $38.1
    million
  , down
  $1.6 million
  or 4% from
  $39.7 million
  for the second
  quarter of 2015. This decrease was largely the result of a
  $1.0 million
  or 30% revenue decrease at Belmond Maroma Resort & Spa largely due to
  the re-opening of renovated hotels in the
  Los Cabos
  resort area on
  Mexico's
Baja Peninsula
  in the second half of 2015 and increased local
  competition, as well as a
  $0.7 million
  or 12% revenue decrease at
  Belmond La Samanna,
  St. Martin
  , French West Indies primarily due to a
  year-over-year decrease in call volume due in part to concern over the
  Zika virus. Partially offsetting these decreases, Belmond El Encanto,
  Santa Barbara, California
  grew revenue by
  $0.3 million
  or 6% mainly due
  to a 4 percentage point increase in occupancy. 
 In constant currency, same store RevPAR for owned hotels in the region
  was down 3% from the prior-year quarter due to a 2% decrease in ADR and
  a 1 percentage point decrease in occupancy. 
 Adjusted EBITDA for the region for the quarter was
  $8.5 million
  , a
  decrease of
  $1.1 million
  or 11% from
  $9.6 million
  for the second quarter
  of 2015. The year-over-year decline was primarily the result of a
  $0.9
    million
  decrease in adjusted EBITDA at Belmond La Samanna and a
  $0.6
    million
  or 69% decrease in adjusted EBITDA at Belmond Maroma Resort &
  Spa, partially offset by a
  $0.3 million
  increase in adjusted EBITDA at
  Belmond El Encanto. 
Rest of world:
 Revenue from owned hotels for the second quarter of 2016 was
  $24.3
    million
  , a decrease of
  $1.2 million
  or 5% from
  $25.5 million
  for the
  second quarter of 2015 primarily due to year-over-year currency
  depreciation. In constant currency, revenue for the second quarter of
  2016 increased
  $0.8 million
  or 4% over the prior-year quarter
  principally as a result of revenue growth of
  $0.8 million
  or 81% at
  Belmond Safaris,
  Botswana
  , as Belmond Eagle Island Lodge, one of the
  Company's three safari lodges, was operational in 2016 following a
  complete renovation that required a planned closure from January to
  November 2015. Additionally, revenue increased
  $0.4 million
  or 24% at
  Belmond Mount Nelson Hotel,
  Cape Town, South Africa
  primarily due to 17%
  ADR growth that was largely the result of investments the Company made
  over the past several years in the hotel's room product and meeting and
  banqueting facilities. Partially offsetting these increases was a
  combined
  $0.4 million
  or 3% decrease in revenue for the Company's two
  hotels in
  Brazil
  largely due to an expected lull in demand ahead of
  August's Olympic Games in
  Rio de Janeiro
  and
  Brazil's
  challenging
  economic situation. 
 In constant currency, same store RevPAR for owned hotels was up 1% over
  the prior-year quarter, as a 4% increase in ADR was offset by a 1
  percentage point decrease in occupancy. 
 Adjusted EBITDA for the region for the quarter of
  $2.1 million
  decreased
  $0.9 million
  or 30% from adjusted EBITDA of
  $3.0 million
  for the
  prior-year quarter. In constant currency, adjusted EBITDA for the region
  decreased
  $0.9 million
  or 35% from the prior-year quarter largely due to
  a combined adjusted EBITDA decrease of
  $1.2 million
  or 51% at the
  Company's two hotels in
  Brazil
  primarily resulting from a decline in
  revenue coupled with an increase in payroll taxes and inflationary
  increases to payroll, partially offset by a
  $0.4 million
  increase in
  adjusted EBITDA at Belmond Safaris. 
Part-owned / managed hotels:
 Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2016 of
  $1.3 million
  decreased
  $0.9 million
  or 41% from
  $2.2 million
  for the second quarter of 2015
  largely due to a
  $0.4 million
  or 20% decrease in adjusted EBITDA
  recognized for the Company's
  Peru
  hotels joint venture primarily as a
  result of a year-over-year decrease in group business at the joint
  venture's two hotels in Cusco. 
Owned trains & cruises:
 Revenue for the second quarter of 2016 was
  $21.4 million
  , up
  $1.3
    million
  or 6% from
  $20.1 million
  for the second quarter of 2015. In
  constant currency, revenue increased
  $2.5 million
  or 13% primarily as a
  result of a
  $2.5 million
  or 27% revenue increase for the
  Venice
  Simplon-Orient-Express train largely as a result of operating six more
  trips in the current-year quarter. 
 Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was
  $3.6 million
  , a
  $0.5 million
  or 16%
  increase over
  $3.1 million
  for the second quarter of 2015. In constant
  currency, adjusted EBITDA increased
  $0.7 million
  or 23% largely due to a
  $0.4 million
  or 15% increase in adjusted EBITDA for
  Venice
  Simplon-Orient-Express. 
Part-owned / managed trains:
 Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2016 of
  $5.6 million
  increased
  $0.3 million
  or 6% over adjusted EBITDA of
  $5.3 million
  for the second
  quarter of 2015 as a result of a
  $0.2 million
  or 3% increase in EBITDA
  recognized for the Company’s PeruRail joint venture largely as a result
  of the joint venture commencing transport of copper concentrate from the
  Las Bambas mine, which began production at the end of 2015. 
Central costs:
 For the second quarter of 2016, adjusted central overheads of
  $5.8
    million
  were
  $1.9 million
  or 25% lower than adjusted central overheads
  of
  $7.7 million
  for the prior-year quarter primarily due to reduced
  legal and professional fees, payroll savings related to a weaker British
  pound than in the prior-year quarter and other general savings. 
Investments
 The Company continued its strategy of disciplined re-investment in core
  assets and projects with attractive forecasted returns. During the
  second quarter of 2016, the Company invested a total of
  $16.1 million
  in
  its portfolio, including
  $2.4 million
  on the
  Venice
  Simplon-Orient-Express train mainly for required statutory works and the
  phased installation of air-conditioning;
  $1.8 million
  at Belmond
  Charleston Place partially for a new high-end sports pub that opened in
  July 2016;
  $1.4 million
  at Belmond La Residence d'Angkor, Siem Reap,
  Cambodia
  primarily for a rooms renovation project;
  $1.3 million
  on the
  Belmond Grand Hibernian luxury sleeper train, which is scheduled to
  commence operations in
  Ireland
  in the third quarter of 2016; and
  $1.1
    million
  at Belmond Mount Nelson Hotel mainly for the renovation of rooms
  in the hotel's main building. 
Balance Sheet
 At June 30, 2016, the Company had total debt of
  $600.3 million
  and cash
  balances of
  $149.9 million
  , resulting in total net debt of
  $450.4
    million
  and a ratio of net debt to trailing twelve-months total adjusted
  EBITDA of 3.7 times, which compared to net debt of
  $443.9 million
  and a
  ratio of net debt to trailing twelve-months total adjusted EBITDA of 3.7
  times at December 31, 2015. 
Outlook
 The Company is providing the following RevPAR and other guidance for the

About Belmond Ltd.
 Belmond (belmond.com)
  is a global collection of exceptional hotel and luxury travel adventures
  in some of the world’s most inspiring and enriching destinations.
  Established almost 40 years ago with the acquisition of Belmond Hotel
  Cipriani in
  Venice
  , its unique and distinctive portfolio now embraces 47
  hotel, rail and river cruise experiences, including three scheduled for
  future opening, in many of the world’s most celebrated destinations.
  From city landmarks to intimate resorts, the collection includes Belmond
  Grand Hotel Europe,
  St. Petersburg
  ; Belmond Copacabana Palace,
  Rio de
    Janeiro
  ; Belmond Maroma Resort & Spa, Riviera Maya; and Belmond El

  . Belmond also encompasses safaris, seven luxury
  tourist trains, including the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express, and three
  river cruises. Belmond also operates ‘21’ Club, one of New York’s most
  storied restaurants. Further information on the Company can be found at investor.belmond.com. 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and
  Definitions
 Management analyzes the operating performance of the Company on the
  basis of earnings before interest, foreign exchange, tax (including tax
  on unconsolidated companies), depreciation and amortization (EBITDA),
  and believes that EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, is a useful
  measure of operating performance, for example to help determine the
  ability to incur capital expenditure or service indebtedness, because it
  is not affected by non-operating factors such as leverage and the
  historical cost of assets. EBITDA is also a financial performance
  measure commonly used in the hotel and leisure industry, although the
  Company’s EBITDA may not be comparable in all instances to that
  disclosed by other companies. EBITDA does not represent net cash
  provided by operating, investing and financing activities under
  U.S.
  generally accepted accounting principles (
  U.S.
  GAAP), is not necessarily
  indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs, and should not
  be considered as an alternative to earnings from operations or net
  earnings under
  U.S.
  GAAP for purposes of evaluating operating
  performance. 
 Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net earnings / (losses) of the Company are
  non-GAAP financial measures and do not have any standardized meanings
  prescribed by
  U.S.
  GAAP. They are, therefore, unlikely to be comparable
  to similar measures presented by other companies, which may be
  calculated differently, and should not be considered as an alternative
  to net earnings, cash flow from operating activities or any other
  measure of performance prescribed by
  U.S.
  GAAP. Management considers
  adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net earnings / (losses) to be meaningful
  indicators of operations and uses them as measures to assess operating
  performance because, when comparing current period performance with
  prior periods and with budgets, management does so after having adjusted
  for non-recurring items, foreign exchange (a non-cash item), disposals
  of assets or investments, and certain other items (some of which may be
  recurring) that management does not consider indicative of ongoing
  operations or that could otherwise have a material effect on the
  comparability of the Company’s operations. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted
  net earnings / (losses) are also used by investors, analysts and lenders
  as measures of financial performance because, as adjusted in the
  foregoing manner, the measures provide a consistent basis on which the
  performance of the Company can be assessed. 
 All references to constant currency represent a comparison between
  periods excluding the impact of foreign exchange movements. The Company
  calculates these amounts by translating prior-year results at
  current-year exchange rates. The Company analyzes certain key financial
  measures on a constant currency basis to better understand the
  underlying results and trends of the business without distortion from
  the effects of currency movements. 
Cautionary Statements
 This news release and related oral presentations by management contain,
  in addition to historical information, forward-looking statements within
  the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
  These include statements regarding the Company's three-point growth
  strategy, future revenue, earnings, RevPAR, EBITDA, statement of
  operations and cash flow outlook, investment plans, debt refinancings,
  asset acquisitions, leases and sales, entry into third-party management
  contracts, benefits of the Company’s brand and similar matters that are
  not historical facts and therefore involve risks and uncertainties.
  These statements are based on management’s current expectations and
  beliefs regarding future developments, are not guarantees of performance
  and are subject to a number of uncertainties and risks that could cause
  actual results to differ materially from those described in the
  forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause actual results,
  performance and achievements to differ from those express or implied in
  the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those
  mentioned in the news release and oral presentations, our ability to
  execute and achieve our three-point growth strategy, future effects, if
  any, on the travel and leisure markets of terrorist activity and any
  police or military response, varying customer demand and competitive
  considerations, failure to realize expected hotel bookings and
  reservations and planned real estate sales as actual revenue, inability
  to sustain price increases or to reduce costs, rising fuel costs
  adversely impacting customer travel and the Company’s operating costs,
  fluctuations in interest rates and currency values, uncertainty of
  negotiating and completing any future asset acquisitions, leases, sales
  and third-party management contracts, debt refinancings, capital
  expenditures and acquisitions, inability to reduce funded debt as
  planned or to obtain bank agreement to any future requested loan
  agreement waivers or amendments, adequate sources of capital and
  acceptability of finance terms, possible loss or amendment of planning
  permits and delays in construction schedules for expansion projects,
  delays in reopening properties closed for repair or refurbishment and
  possible cost overruns, shifting patterns of tourism and business travel
  and seasonality of demand, adverse local weather conditions, possible
  challenges to the Company’s ownership of its brands, the Company’s
  reliance on technology systems and its development of new technology
  systems, changing global or regional economic conditions and weakness in
  financial markets which may adversely affect demand, legislative,
  regulatory and political developments (including the evolving political
  situation in
  Ukraine
  and
  Brazil
  , and in the
  United Kingdom
  in respect of
  its expected withdrawal from the European Union, and the resulting
  impact of these situations on local and global economies, exchange rates
  and on current and future demand), the threat or current transmission of
  epidemics, infectious diseases, and viruses, such as the Zika virus
  which may affect demand in
  South America
  and elsewhere, and possible
  challenges to the Company’s corporate governance structure. Further
  information regarding these and other factors that could cause
  management’s current expectations and beliefs not to be realized is
  included in the filings by the Company with the
  U.S.
  Securities and
  Exchange Commission. Except as otherwise required by law, the Company
  undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any
  forward-looking statement, whether due to new information, future events
  or otherwise.
