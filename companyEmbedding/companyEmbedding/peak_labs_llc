EPA Approved Air Monitoring Applications:
Peak Laboratories is introducing our NEW 910-170 series RCP platform that has recently received its Federal Equivalency Method designation (EQCA-0814-217) issued by the USA EPA for Continuous Monitoring of CO in Ambient Air in August 2014. In addition to our standard offerings of 0-50 ppm range, this pivotal platform can also offer optimum results at the 0-10 ppm and 0-1 ppm ranges without using NDIR. 
  Peak Lab's RCP technology has been used for trace atmospheric CO (and H2) for over 20 years by NOAA, atmospheric chemists and research organizations worldwide. Our cost-effective platform is proven to have incomparable stability (gas chromatography eliminates interference problems) with exceptionally higher sensitivity (superior modeling data) than NDIR technologies.
  In addition to our unique EPA approved method to monitor CO, our 920 series FID platform can be used for continuous monitoring of greenhouse gases (GHG): methane and carbon dioxide (and CO if an EPA approved method is not needed). Atmospheric trends of CH4 and CO2 (and CO) can easily be monitored using one of our process GC's in rural or urban settings. The combination of these systems can be installed for remote or laboratory settings for half the price of CRDS based solutions without a compromising ambient data.
  Please for more details when considering to "upgrade" your Thermo, Teledyne or other IR based monitors for trace, continuous CO measurements.        
 
 Peak Offers the Following Detectors (Typical lower detection limits in parts per trillion) 



RCP (aka RGD): Hydrogen, Carbon Monoxide, Ethylene, Acetylene, 1,3 Butadiene, Benzene, Isoprene and Propylene 



FID:  Methane, Carbon Monoxide, Carbon Dioxide and NMHC 




PDHID: Nitrogen and Argon 




TCD:  Argon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, Nitrogen and Methane 


 **We also offer a critical orifice based Internal Calibration Blender as an installed option.
 
 Specific Industries Include:



Air Separation Plants


Government Air Monitoring            


Regulatory Air Monitoring


Quality Assurance / Control


Process Control


Government and University Research Institutes 


Semiconductor Plants


 Purifier Manufacturers 


Medical Research Labs.


We provide a simple, innovative complete solution for the trace (ppt) to percent level analysis of most permanent gases in various gas matrices ranging from research to semiconductor applications. With our unique design we are able to provide our users with accurate measurements, down to the part per trillion levels, while still maintaining a wide linear range.
 

Peak Labs is the perfect solution to your analytical needs with our  highly experienced team of engineers and instrumental customization capabilities. Please Contact Peak Laboratories Here or contact a local sales representative for custom applications and further information on our standard applications.

                        About Us
                    


Peak Laboratories provides a simple, innovative solution for trace (ppbv or pptv) analysis of H2, CO, saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons, and many other substances, in a wide variety of applications without using preconcentration or cryogenic trap techniques.
Our Peak Performer GC series uses a hybrid of our own detector design and proven detectors which are integrated into our unique, complete operating platform. Our systems can measure trace gas impurities down to part per trillion levels while offering a percentage upper range for complete analysis and accurate measurements.
Our technology has proven to offer a more cost-effective and user friendly alternative to other instruments for similar applications. In addition, Peak Labs practical experience and ability to customize to suit your applications makes Peak Labs your partner, not just your supplier.

				(1) A clinical laboratory is a facility for the biological, microbiological, serological, chemical, immunohematological, hematological, biophysical, cytological, pathological, or other examination of materials derived from the human body for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of any disease or impairment of, human beings. These examinations also include procedures to determine, measure, or otherwise describe the presence or absence of various substances or organisms in the body. Facilities only collecting or preparing specimens (or both) or only serving as a mailing service and not performing testing are not considered clinical laboratories. (2) Any facility that examines materials from the human body for purposes of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of any disease or impairment of, or the assessment of, the health of human beings. Typical divisions of a clinical laboratory include hematology, cytology, bacteriology, histology, biochemistry, medical toxicology, and serology.

					Some organization health care providers are made up of components that furnish different types of health care or have separate physical locations where health care is furnished. These components and physical locations are not themselves legal entities, but are part of the organization health care provider (which is a legal entity).

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

It's amazing what three letters can do.
Adding "Inc." or "LLC" to your business' name is more than a good look. It protects your personal assets, creates tax advantages, and much more.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
