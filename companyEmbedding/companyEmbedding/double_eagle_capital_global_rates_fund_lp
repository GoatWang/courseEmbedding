Double Eagle Energy Permian LLC Announces Strategic Relationship to 
      Fund Midland Basin Asset Acquisitions and Development






























FORT WORTH, Texas, Nov 14, 2016 (BUSINESS WIRE) --
Funds managed by affiliates of Apollo Global Management, LLC                 

/quotes/zigman/4560597/composite APO
-0.18%


 
      (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, “Apollo”) and Post Oak 
      Energy Capital, LP (“Post Oak”) announced today that Double Eagle Energy 
      Permian LLC (“Double Eagle” or “the Company”) and Magnetar Capital 
      (“Magnetar”) have entered into a definitive agreement, wherein Magnetar 
      has agreed to invest up to $450 million of equity and delayed draw 
      unsecured debt capital to support additional Midland Basin acquisition 
      opportunities and to accelerate the Company’s operated drilling program.


                                        








Double Eagle Energy Permian LLC was recently formed through the 
      combination of Double Eagle Energy Lone Star LLC (“Double Eagle Lone 
      Star”) and Veritas Energy Partners Holdings LLC (“Veritas Energy”). 
      Double Eagle owns more than 60,000 core Midland Basin net acres (over 
      70% operated) located in Midland, Martin, Howard, Glasscock, Upton and 
      Reagan counties.


                                        








Double Eagle has rapidly grown to become one of the largest pure-play 
      Midland Basin E&P companies. The capital infusion from Magnetar marks a 
      significant step in Double Eagle’s growth strategy and, along with 
      continued support and commitment from Apollo and Post Oak, provides 
      significant opportunity to expand on the Company’s world-class asset 
      base. The Company has initiated both an operated horizontal and vertical 
      rig program and expects to use the additional capital to increase 
      operations.


                                        








John Sellers and Cody Campbell, Co-CEOs of Double Eagle, commented, “We 
      are excited to have Magnetar as a partner and appreciate their support 
      and commitment to our vision. We have the clear opportunity to create a 
      tremendous amount of additional value, and we look forward to working 
      alongside the Magnetar team in executing our plans.”


                                        








Eric Scheyer, Partner and Head of Energy at Magnetar Capital, added, 
      “The Double Eagle team is uniquely positioned to execute on its growth 
      strategy in the absolute core of the Midland Basin. We look forward to a 
      long and mutually beneficial relationship with the team and the Company.”


                                        








Vinson & Elkins LLP acted as legal advisor and Jefferies LLC acted as 
      financial advisor to Double Eagle, and Kirkland & Ellis acted as legal 
      advisor and Bank of America Merrill Lynch acted as financial advisor to 
      Magnetar Capital.
