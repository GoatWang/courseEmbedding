EXPLANATORY
NOTE

 

Based upon a
limited review of our periodic reports by the Securities and
Exchange Commission staff, on May 19, 2011 the Company received
written staff comments regarding our annual report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2010.  Additional staff comments
requested further revisions to Item 9A which are included in this
amendment.  Other than these changes, this amended report does
not include subsequent events.

 

PART
II

 

ITEM 9A.
 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

 

Disclosure Controls and
Procedures

 

We maintain
disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed in our filings under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC.  This
information is accumulated to allow timely decisions




2

 

 

  

regarding
required disclosure.  Our President, who serves as our
principal executive officer and principal financial officer,
evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report and
he determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were
ineffective because we had a control deficiency.  During the
period we did not have additional personnel to allow segregation of
duties to ensure the completeness or accuracy of our information.
 Due to the size and operations of our Company we are unable
to remediate this deficiency until we acquire or merge with another
company with more personnel.

 

Management’s Annual
Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting

 

Management is
responsible to establish and maintain adequate internal control
over financial reporting.   Our principal executive
officer is responsible to design or supervise a process that
provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.  The policies and procedures include:

•

maintenance of
records in reasonable detail to accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of assets,

•

provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors, and

•

provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS  

 In this annual report references to "WorldNet," "we," "us," and "our"
refer to WorldNet, Inc. of Nevada.                                              

This annual report contains certain forward-looking statements.  For
this purpose any statements contained in this annual report that are not        
statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements.   
Without limiting the foregoing, words such as "may," "will," "expect,"
"believe," "anticipate," "estimate" or "continue" or comparable terminology     
are intended to identify forward-looking statements.  These statements by       
their nature involve substantial risks and uncertainties, and actual results    
may differ materially depending on a variety of factors, many of which are not  
within WorldNet's control.  These factors include but are not limited to        
economic conditions generally and in the industries in which WorldNet may       
participate; competition within WorldNet's chosen industry, including           
competition from much larger competitors; technological advances and failure    
by WorldNet to successfully develop business relationships.                     

ITEM 1: DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

Business Development                                                            

We were incorporated in the state of Nevada on March 10, 1986 as the
wholly-owned subsidiary of VIP Worldnet, Inc., and shortly after our            
incorporation we entered into an agreement to lease, sell and market the        
Hystar airship and the Burket Mill, a waste milling device.  However, the       
venture was found to be cost prohibitive and we ceased such activities in 1986  
and did not engage in any further commercial operations.                        

Our Plan                                                                        

  We are a "blank check" company and have had recurring operating losses
for the past two fiscal years.  Our independent auditors have expressed doubt   
that we can continue as a going concern unless we obtain financing to continue  
operations.                                                                     

    Our business plan is to seek, investigate, and, if warranted, acquire an
interest in a business opportunity.  Our acquisition of a business opportunity  
may be made by merger, exchange of stock, or otherwise.  We have very limited   
sources of capital, and we probably will only be able to take advantage of one  
business opportunity. At the present time we have not identified any business   
opportunity that we plan to pursue, nor have we reached any preliminary or      
definitive agreements or understandings with any person concerning an           
acquisition or merger.                                                          

    Based on current economic and regulatory conditions, management believes
that it is possible, if not probable, for a company like ours, without many     
assets or liabilities, to negotiate a merger or acquisition with a viable       
private company.  The opportunity arises principally because of the high legal  
and accounting fees and the length of time associated with the registration     
process of "going public".  However, should any of these conditions change, it  
is very possible that there would be little or no economic value for anyone     
taking over control of WorldNet.                                                

Our search for a business opportunity will not be limited to any    
particular geographical area or industry, including both U.S. and               
international companies.  Our management has unrestricted discretion in         
seeking and participating in a business opportunity, subject to the             
availability of such opportunities, economic conditions and other factors.      
Our management believes that companies who desire a public market to enhance    
liquidity for current stockholders, or plan to acquire additional assets        
through issuance of securities rather than for cash will be potential merger    
or acquisition candidates.                                                      

The selection of a business opportunity in which to participate is  
complex and extremely risky and will be                                         

P-->10KSB3rd�Page�of�21TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�3rd

made by management in the exercise of its business judgement.  There is no      
assurance that we will be able to identify and acquire any business             
opportunity which will ultimately prove to be beneficial to us and our          
stockholders.  Should a merger or acquisition prove unsuccessful, it is         
possible management may decide not to pursue further acquisition activities     
and management may abandon its activities and we may become dormant or be       
dissolved.                                                                      

Our activities are subject to several significant risks which arise 
primarily as a result of the fact that we have no specific business and may     
acquire or participate in a business opportunity based on the decision of       
management which will, in all probability, act without consent, vote, or        
approval of our stockholders.                                                   

 It is possible that the range of business opportunities that might be
available for consideration by us could be limited by impact of the SEC         
regulations regarding purchase and sale of "penny stock."  Our common stock is  
not publicly traded at this time and we cannot assure that a market will        
develop or that a stockholder ever will be able to liquidate his investments    
without considerable delay, if at all.  If a market develops, our shares will   
likely be subject to the rules of the Penny Stock Suitability Reform Act of     
1990. The liquidity of penny stock is affected by specific disclosure           
procedures required by this Act to be followed by all broker-dealers,           
including but not limited to, determining the suitability of the stock for a    
particular customer, and obtaining a written agreement from the customer to     
purchase the stock.  This rule may affect the ability of broker-dealers to      
sell our securities and may affect the ability of purchasers to sell our        
securities in any market.                                                       

Investigation and Selection of Business Opportunities                           

We anticipate that business opportunities will come to our attention
from various sources, including our officers and directors, our stockholders,   
professional advisors such as attorneys and accountants, securities             
broker-dealers, investment banking firms, venture capitalists, members of the   
financial community and others who may present unsolicited proposals.           
Management expects that prior personal and business relationships, and          
specifically, our relationship with Mutual Ventures Corporation, an investment  
banking firm, may lead to contacts with these various sources.                  

    Our management will analyze the business opportunities, however, none of
our management are professional business analysts.  (See, Part II Item 9:       
"Directors and Executive Officers.") Our management has had limited experience  
with mergers and acquisitions of business opportunities and has not been        
involved with an initial public offering.  Management may rely on promoters or  
their affiliates, principal stockholders or associates to assist in the         
investigation and selection of business opportunities.                          

Our management may also hire an outside consultant.  Since our      
management has no current plans to use any outside consultants or advisors to   
assist in the investigation and selection of business opportunities, no         
policies have been adopted regarding use of such consultants or advisors.  We   
have not established the criteria to be used in selecting such consultants or   
advisors, the service to be provided, the term of service, or the total amount  
of fees that may be paid. However, because of our limited resources, it is      
likely that any such fee we agree to pay would be paid in stock and not in      
cash.  In addition, there is a possibility that the amount of consultant fees   
may become a factor in negotiations related to a business opportunity.          

 Certain conflicts of interest exist or may develop between us and our
officers and directors.  Our management has other business interests to which   
they currently devote attention, which include their primary employment and     
management of other blank check reporting companies.  They may be expected to   
continue to devote their attention to these other business interests although   
management time should be devoted to our business.  As a result, conflicts of   
interest may arise that can be resolved only through their exercise of          
judgement in a manner which is consistent with their fiduciary duties to us.    
In particular, Don Mayer, our President is a director of other blank check      
companies with a structure and a business plan which is identical to ours and,  
our management may in the future be involved with other blank check companies.  
In the process of negotiations for an acquisition or merger or determination    
of consulting fees related to investigation of a business opportunity, our      
principal stockholders and                                                      

P-->10KSB4th�Page�of�21TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�4th

management may consider their own personal pecuniary benefit or the interests   
of other blank check companies they are affiliated with rather than the best    
interests of our other stockholders.                                            

We presently do not foresee entering into a merger or acquisition   
transaction with any business with which our officers or directors are          
currently affiliated. We may acquire or merge with companies of which our       
management's  affiliates or associates have a direct or indirect ownership      
interest.  If we determine in the future that a transaction with an affiliate   
would be in our best interest we are permitted by Nevada law to enter into      
such a transaction if:                                                          

 (1)      The material facts regarding the relationship or interest of
the affiliate in the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the  
board of directors.  The board authorizes the contract or transaction by the    
affirmative vote of a majority of the disinterested directors, even though the  
disinterested directors constitute less than a quorum; or                       

 (2)      The material facts regarding the relationship or interest of
the affiliate in the contract transaction are disclosed or are known to the     
stockholders entitled to vote on the transaction, and the contract or           
transaction is specifically approved by vote of the stockholders; or            

(3)      The contract or transaction is fair to us at the time it is
authorized, approved or ratified by the board of directors or the               
stockholders.                                                                   

    A decision to participate in a specific business opportunity may be made
upon our management's analysis of the quality of the business opportunity's     
management and personnel, the anticipated acceptability of its new products or  
marketing concept, the merit of its technological changes, the perceived        
benefit that it will derive from becoming a publicly held entity, and numerous  
other factors which are difficult, if not impossible, to analyze through the    
application of any objective criteria.  In many instances, we anticipate that   
the historical operations of a specific business opportunity may not            
necessarily be indicative of the potential for the future because of the        
possible need to shift marketing approaches substantially, expand               
significantly, change product emphasis, change or substantially augment         
management, or make other changes.  We will be dependent upon the owners of a   
business opportunity to identify any such problems which may exist and to       
implement, or be primarily responsible for the implementation of, required      
changes.                                                                        

In our analysis of a business opportunity we anticipate that we will
consider, among other things, the following factors:                            

(1)   Potential for growth and profitability, indicated by new      
technology, anticipated market expansion, or new products;                      

   (2)   Our perception of how any particular business opportunity will be
received by the investment community and by our stockholders;                   

(3)   Whether, following the business combination, the financial    
condition of the business opportunity would be, or would have a significant     
prospect in the foreseeable future of becoming sufficient to enable our         
securities to qualify for listing on a exchange or on a national automated      
securities quotation system, such as NASDAQ.                                    

(4)   Capital requirements and anticipated availability of required 
funds, to be provided by us or from operations, through the sale of additional  
securities, through joint ventures or similar arrangements, or from other       
sources;                                                                        

(5)   The extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced; 

P-->10KSB5th�Page�of�21TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�5th

(6)   Competitive position as compared to other companies of similar
size and experience within the industry segment as well as within the industry  
as a whole;                                                                     

(7)   Strength and diversity of existing management, or management  
prospect that are scheduled for recruitment;                                    

(8)   The cost of our participation as compared to the perceived    
tangible and intangible values and potential; and                               

    (9)   The accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, raw
materials, services, professional assistance, and other required items.         

No one of the factors described above will be controlling in the    
selection of a business opportunity.  Management will attempt to analyze all    
factors appropriate to each opportunity and make a determination based upon     
reasonable investigative measures and available data. Potentially available     
business opportunities may occur in many different industries and at various    
stages of development.  Thus, the task of comparative investigation and         
analysis of such business opportunities will be extremely difficult and         
complex. Potential investors must recognize that, because of our limited        
capital available for investigation and management's limited experience in      
business analysis, we may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts     
about the opportunity to be acquired.                                           

Form of Acquisition                                                             

  We cannot predict the manner in which we may participate in a business
opportunity. Specific business opportunities will be reviewed as well as our    
needs and desires and those of the promoters of the opportunity.  The legal     
structure or method deemed by management to be suitable will be selected based  
upon our review and our relative negotiating strength. Such method may          
include, but is not limited to, leases, purchase and sale agreements,           
licenses, joint ventures and other contractual arrangements. We may act         
directly or indirectly through an interest in a partnership, corporation or     
other forms of organization.  We may be required to merge, consolidate or       
reorganize with other corporations or forms of business organization. In        
addition, our present management and stockholders most likely will not have     
control of a majority of our voting shares following a merger or                
reorganization transaction. As part of such a transaction, our existing         
directors may resign and new directors may be appointed without any vote by     
our stockholders.                                                               

We likely will acquire our participation in a business opportunity  
through the issuance of common stock or other securities.  Although the terms   
of any such transaction cannot be predicted, it should be noted that issuance   
of additional shares might also may be done simultaneously with a sale or       
transfer of shares representing a controlling interest by current principal     
stockholders.                                                                   

Competition                                                                     

  We expect to encounter substantial competition in our effort to locate
attractive opportunities.  Business development companies, venture capital      
partnerships and corporations, venture capital affiliates of large industrial   
and financial companies, small investment companies, and wealthy individuals    
will be our primary competition. Many of these entities will have               
significantly greater experience, resources and managerial capabilities than    
we do and will be in a better position than we are to obtain access to          
attractive business opportunities.  We also will experience competition from    
other public "blank check" companies, many of which may have more funds         
available.                                                                      

Employees                                                                       

  We currently have no employees.  Our management expects to confer with
consultants, attorneys and accountants as necessary.  We do not anticipate a    
need to engage any full-time employees so long as we are seeking and            
evaluating business opportunities.  We will determine the need for employees    
based upon the specific business                                                

P-->10KSB6th�Page�of�21TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�6th

opportunity.                                                                    

ITEM 2: DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTIES 

   We do not currently own or lease any property.  We utilize office space
in the office of one of our shareholders at no cost.  Until we pursue a viable  
business opportunity and recognize income, we will not seek independent office  
space.                                                                          

ITEM 3: LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

 We are not a party to any proceedings or threatened proceedings as of
the date of this filing.                                                        

ITEM 4: SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS 

   We have not submitted a matter to a vote of our shareholders during the
fourth quarter of the 2000 fiscal year.                                         

ITEM 5: MARKET PRICE FOR COMMON EQUITY  
AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS 

   We have had no market activity in our stock as of this filing.  We have
approximately 84 stockholders of record holding 17,500,000 common shares.       
21,115,350 shares are unrestricted and 15,384,650 shares are restricted shares  
as that term is defined in Rule 144.  We have no options or warrants            
outstanding.  We have not declared dividends on our common stock and do not     
anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.      

b) Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities                                      

We have not sold any shares within the past three years without     
registration.                                                                   

ITEM 6: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION 

Plan of Operation                                                               

    We have no assets and have experienced losses from inception.  As of the
year ended December 31, 2000 we had no cash on hand and total current           
liabilities of $32,000.  The current liabilities reflect a note payable to      
Mutual Ventures Corporation for accounting and legal fees incurred in 1999 and  
paid on our behalf by Mutual Ventures.                                          

We have no commitments for capital expenditures for the next twelve 
months.  During the next twelve months we believe that our current cash needs   
can be met by loans from our directors, officers and stockholders based on      
understandings we have with these individuals.  We anticipate that Mutual       
Ventures Corporation will continue to provide investment banking services and   
advance costs on our behalf.  We may repay these loans, costs of services  and  
advancements with cash, if available, or we may convert them into common        
stock.  Also, management anticipates future private placements of our common    
shares will help fund our operations.                                           

Our reporting obligations involve considerable time, energy and     
professional fees.  We will incur expenses due to the legal and accounting      
services required to prepare such reports and the costs of filing such reports  
with the                                                                        

P-->10KSB7th�Page�of�21TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�7th

Securities and Exchange Commission.  Also, our management must expend time and  
effort to assist in the preparation and review of such reports.  In the event   
we acquire a business opportunity we may incur additional expenses related to   
proxy or information statements we must provide to our stockholders which       
disclose that company's business operations, management and financial           
condition.  In addition, the acquired or merged company will be subject to      
these same reporting obligations                                                

 Our management intends to actively seek business opportunities during
the next twelve months and if we obtain a business opportunity, it may be       
necessary to raise additional capital.  This may be accomplished by selling     
our common stock.                                                               

ITEM 7: FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Reference is made to the financial statements for the years ended   
December 31, 2000 and 1999 which are attached to this Form 10-KSB report.       

ITEM 8: CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS 

   As previously reported, on August 4, 2000, Crouch, Bierwolf & Chisholm,
C.P.A.s, located in Salt Lake City, Utah, was replaced by Chisholm &            
Associates as our independent auditor.  The decision to change accountants was  
approved by our Board of Directors.  Crouch, Bierwolf & Chisholm had audited    
our financials statements for December 31, 1999 and 1998.  Crouch Bierwolf &    
Chisholm's report on such financials, dated April 13, 2000 did not contain an   
adverse opinion, disclaimer of opinion nor was it modified as to uncertainty,   
audit scope or accounting principles.  There were no disagreements with         
Crouch, Bierwolf & Chisholm on any matter regarding accounting principles or    
practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure       
during the two fiscal years or any subsequent interim period preceding the      
date of their dismissal.                                                        

Neither we, nor someone on our behalf, consulted with Chisholm &    
Associates regarding the application of accounting principles to a specific     
completed or contemplated transaction or the type of audit opinion that might   
be rendered on our financial statements.  Nor was a written report or oral      
advice provided to us that Chisholm & Associates considered was an important    
factor we relied on in reaching decisions about accounting, auditing or         
financial reporting issues.                                                     

ITEM 9: DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS 

Our executive officers and directors and their respective ages,     
positions and term of office are set forth below.  Biographical information     
for each of those persons is also presented below.  Our bylaws require two      
directors who serve for terms of one year and our executive officers are        
chosen by our Board of Directors and serve at its discretion.  There are no     
existing family relationships between or among any of our executive officers    
or directors.                                                                   

Name                  Age      Position Held        Director or Officer Since   
------------        -------    -------------------  -------------------------

    Donald R. Mayer.  Mr. Mayer is the President and a director of Universal
Business Insurance.  He has worked in the insurance industry for over 17        
years, specializing in the motel/hotel industry.  He graduated from the         
University of Utah, located in Salt Lake City, Utah, with a B.A in accounting

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT  

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders                                      
of Worldnet, Inc. of Nevada, Inc.                                               

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Worldnet, Inc. of Nevada (a  
development stage company) as of  December 31, 2000 and 1999 and the related    
statements of  operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for the years    
ended December 31, 2000 and 1999 and from inception March 12, 1986 through      
December 31, 2000.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the    
Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these     
financial statements based on our audits.                                       

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing          
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to      
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of  
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence  
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit   
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant          
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial       
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis  
for our opinion.                                                                

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in   
all material respects, the financial position of Worldnet, Inc. of Nevada (a    
development stage company) as of  December 31, 2000 and 1999 and the results    
of its operations and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2000 and      
1999 and from inception March 12, 1986 through December 31, 2000 in conformity  
with generally accepted accounting principles.                                  

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the      
Company will continue as a going concern.  The Company has suffered recurring   
losses from operations which raises substantial doubt about its ability to      
continue as a going concern.  Management's plans in regard to these matters     
are described in Note 2.  The  financial statements do not include any          
adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Worldnet, Inc. of Nevada  
(A Development Stage Company)   
Notes to the Financial Statements   
December 31, 2000 and 1999  

NOTE 1 - Summary Of Significant Accounting Policies                             

a.     Organization & Consolidation Policy                            

     Worldnet, Inc. of Nevada (the Company), a Nevada corporation, was
incorporated March 12, 1986 to lease, sell, and market airships and the         
Burkett Mill, a waste milling device, which rights were acquired from VIP       
Worldnet, Inc. initially the only shareholder.  The technology to further       
develop the airship and the mill by the parent company proved to be             
prohibitive, and shortly after the acquisition of the marketing rights further  
activity ceased.  Worldnet, Inc. of Nevada has been inactive since that date.   

b.     Recognition of Revenue                                         

     The Company recognizes income and expense on the accrual basis of
accounting.                                                                     

c.     Earnings (Loss) Per Share                                      

     The computation of earnings per share of common stock is based on
the weighted average number of shares outstanding at the date of the financial  
statements.                                                                     

d.     Cash and Cash Equivalents                                      

       The company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities
of three months or less to be cash equivalents.                                 

e.     Provision for Income Taxes                                     

No provision for income taxes have been recorded due to net 
operating loss carryforwards totaling approximately $88,000 that will be        
offset against future taxable income.  These NOL carryforwards began to expire  
in the year 2001.  No tax benefit has been reported in the financial            
statements because the Company believes there is a 50% or greater chance the    
carryforward will expire unused.

f.  Use of estimates                                                  

        The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and        
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and      
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial    
statement and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the          
reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.            

NOTE 2 - Going Concern                                                          

     The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming
that the company will continue as a going concern.  The company has no assets   
and has had recurring operating losses for the past several years and is        
dependent upon financing to continue operations.  The financial statements do   
not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this          
uncertainty.  It is management's plan to find an operating company to merge     
with, thus creating necessary operating revenue.                                

NOTE 3 - Capitalization                                                         

     In 1986, the Company issued 17,000,000 shares of common stock for
the marketing rights to an airship and a waste milling device.  The value of    
this issuance was $17,000.                                                      

During 1991, the Company issued 110,000 shares of stock for 
    unpatented mining claims.  The project was soon thereafter abandoned and
claims were never given a value.                                    

        During 1991, the Company issued 390,000 shares of stock for services
valued at $39,000.
