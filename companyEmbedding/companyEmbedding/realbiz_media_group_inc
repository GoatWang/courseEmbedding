Share Article

















Company outlines new development that is expected for launch in early April






Fort Lauderdale, Florida (PRWEB)
March 12, 2015
 RealBiz Media Group, Inc. (OTCQB: RBIZ), announces its new upgrades for NestBuilder with an expected launch the first week of April.
NestBuilder is both a consumer and agent driven portal, which proudly boasts the largest collection of listing videos on the web. Until recently, NestBuilder has focused on consumer acquisition and experience on the front-facing side of the website. In early April, however, NestBuilder will be releasing its latest, and biggest, upgrade to date. The update will include a comprehensive backend office for real estate professionals. The backend will include productivity tools which will allow agents to manage/promote listings, manage and schedule social media posts and keep track of their client list with a full-fledged CRM system. The software will be released as, “NestBuilder PowerAgent.” The program is set to have affordable options, starting at $9 monthly and more comprehensive packages around the $149 monthly price-point. This backend system, combined with the consumer-facing website, will establish NestBuilder as a ‘go to’ product for any real estate agent.
NestBuilder’s PowerAgent will allow full integrations with client lists and give agents the ability to send out messages to their entire address book with just a couple of clicks. PowerAgent will also allow them to track actions as well as set reminders and to-dos for follow ups with clients. “We have this amazing portal with a wonderful look and feel, and now we’re taking the good looks and giving it the brains to back it up with this new productivity tool,” said Alex Aliksanyan, CIO of RealBiz.
“We’ve also seen a significant uptick in our social media services so the decision was made to combine a social media management software into the backend of NestBuilder. We are trying to give agents a tool that can manage most facets of their business without ever needing to sign onto multiple accounts,” said Aliksanyan. 
NestBuilder’s social media management program has continued to show impressive results - more than doubling its usership month-over-month.
Other NestBuilder upgrades include:
     Craigslist auto-publish listings
    ReachFactor review integration
    Map search
    Facebook Likes campaigns
    Promoted Listings
    Mobile Apps
    Enhanced customer loyalty 
These upgrades will make NestBuilder the only portal in the industry with these abilities and in essence will turn NestBuilder into the first portal designed with agent success and consumer usage in mind.

RealBiz Media Group Provides Business Update Announces New Operating Units and Product Category



NEW YORK, NY - (NewMediaWire) - July 26, 2017 - Verus Foods (Verus), currently trading as RealBiz Media Group, Inc. (OTCQB: RBIZ), is pleased to provide a business update covering legacy lawsuit, operational, and financial information. CEO Anshu Bhatnagar just completed an extensive series of meetings with suppliers and customers in both the Middle East and Asia, his fourth multi-country business trip in the last year.As previously communicated, July was an important month on the calendar due to the expected trial date for the legacy lawsuit involving Monaker Group and the company. Unfortunately, this date was pushed back to March 2018 by the court, due to a scheduling conflict. Although management cannot predict the outcome of current negotiations, the company is in very active discussions with the main parties involved, all of whom hold significant positions in RBIZ and are also adversely affected by further delays."Luckily, we can still grow the company while we wait for this date or some other resolution," explained Anshu Bhatnagar, CEO of Verus Foods, "but I think all parties understand that to handicap our growth is not logical and explains the mindset that led to the failure of the prior RealBiz business. To put this in perspective, we have given guidance that Verus can generate more revenue every five days than RealBiz did in its best full year. No reasonable shareholder would stand in the way of that kind of growth. We are doing everything in our power to end this unreasonable delay and hope to announce alternative solutions in coming weeks."From an operational standpoint, the company continues to position itself for future expansion, with the following activities completed since the last communication with shareholders:Formed United Arab Emirates subsidiary -- Verus Foods MENA Ltd.Formed Singapore-based subsidiary -- Verus Foods Sg Pte. LtdSigned new banking relationship with Standard Chartered Bank in Singapore to facilitate trade transactions for shipments - will reduce collection cycle significantly.Set an August start date for Vietnam beef shipments, at an initial $2.5 million/month rateCFO search complete, offer in place with lead candidate (pending acceptance)Signed agreement with Aznar, an international supplier of 100% natural pomegranate juice under the Grante Band for the retail sector.Began interviewing additional candidates to expand the company's Board of Directors"This new relationship with Standard Chartered Bank is very important because it will allow us to finance some of our shipments into clients, enabling us to generate some modest growth despite the persistent handicap to financing from the legacy RBIZ lawsuits," explained CEO Bhatnagar. "Also of great significance, the Grante pomegranate juice agreement marks our initial move into the retail space, an area where that first SKU is often the hardest. We believe that this relationship will open the door to sourcing other favorable high-margin products for the important retail segment."Verus Foods has completed the organizational measures necessary to meet its initial growth projections, with only the timing of milestones to be determined by the status of the legacy lawsuits. Investors should expect more frequent news flow in the near future as the company completes additional actions to expand its infrastructure and sales.About RealBiz Media Group, Inc.RealBiz Media Group, Inc. operates two business segments: an international food subsidiary (Verus Foods) that sells products to customers worldwide; and a real estate digital media and technology company.

(  OTCQB :  RBIZ ), is pleased to provide a business update covering legacy lawsuit, operational, and financial information. CEO Anshu Bhatnagar just completed an extensive series of meetings with suppliers and customers in both the Middle East and Asia, his fourth multi-country business trip in the last year.As previously communicated, July was an important month on the calendar due to the expected trial date for the legacy lawsuit involving Monaker Group and the company. Unfortunately, this date was pushed back to March 2018 by the court, due to a scheduling conflict. Although management cannot predict the outcome of current negotiations, the company is in very active discussions with the main parties involved, all of whom hold significant positions in RBIZ and are also adversely affected by further delays."Luckily, we can still grow the company while we wait for this date or some other resolution," explained Anshu Bhatnagar, CEO of Verus Foods, "but I think all parties understand that to handicap our growth is not logical and explains the mindset that led to the failure of the prior RealBiz business. To put this in perspective, we have given guidance that Verus can generate more revenue every five days than RealBiz did in its best full year. No reasonable shareholder would stand in the way of that kind of growth. We are doing everything in our power to end this unreasonable delay and hope to announce alternative solutions in coming weeks."From an operational standpoint, the company continues to position itself for future expansion, with the following activities completed since the last communication with shareholders:Formed United Arab Emirates subsidiary -- Verus Foods MENA Ltd.Formed Singapore-based subsidiary -- Verus Foods Sg Pte. LtdSigned new banking relationship with Standard Chartered Bank in Singapore to facilitate trade transactions for shipments - will reduce collection cycle significantly.Set an August start date for Vietnam beef shipments, at an initial $2.5 million/month rateCFO search complete, offer in place with lead candidate (pending acceptance)Signed agreement with Aznar, an international supplier of 100% natural pomegranate juice under the Grante Band for the retail sector.Began interviewing additional candidates to expand the company's Board of Directors"This new relationship with Standard Chartered Bank is very important because it will allow us to finance some of our shipments into clients, enabling us to generate some modest growth despite the persistent handicap to financing from the legacy RBIZ lawsuits," explained CEO Bhatnagar. "Also of great significance, the Grante pomegranate juice agreement marks our initial move into the retail space, an area where that first SKU is often the hardest. We believe that this relationship will open the door to sourcing other favorable high-margin products for the important retail segment."Verus Foods has completed the organizational measures necessary to meet its initial growth projections, with only the timing of milestones to be determined by the status of the legacy lawsuits. Investors should expect more frequent news flow in the near future as the company completes additional actions to expand its infrastructure and sales.About RealBiz Media Group, Inc.RealBiz Media Group, Inc. operates two business segments: an international food subsidiary (Verus Foods) that sells products to customers worldwide; and a real estate digital media and technology company.

In 2017, Verus plans to pursue a three-pronged development program through the addition of cold-storage facilities, product line expansion, and new vertical farm-to-market operations. Verus’ initial focus is on frozen foods, particularly meat, poultry, seafood, vegetables, and French fries. Verus has a significant regional presence in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) and sub-Saharan Africa (excluding Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”)-restricted nations), with deep roots in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries.
