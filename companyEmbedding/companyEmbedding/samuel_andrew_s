Samuel Andrews mansion on Euclid Avenue (Cleveland). This home was built in 1882-85 and was demolished in 1923.






Standard Oil Articles of Incorporation signed by John D. Rockefeller, Henry M. Flagler, Samuel Andrews, Stephen V. Harkness and William Rockefeller


Samuel Andrews (1836–1904) was a chemist and inventor. Born in England, he immigrated to the United States before the American Civil War and settled in Cleveland, Ohio. He is best known as a partner in the oil refining firm of Rockefeller, Andrews & Flagler, the major predecessor company of the Standard Oil corporate empire. When the first unit was formed in 1870, Andrews owned 16.67% of Standard Oil stock. He sold his stock early on in 1874 and while he was wealthy, he did not participate in the level of wealth generation that the other founders did.
Life and career[edit]
Andrews already had some experience in shale oil production in the newly-discovered oilfields of western Pennsylvania when, in 1862, he approached two Cleveland produce merchants to become stockholders in a new enterprise. One was John D. Rockefeller, who saw the potential in Andrews' plan and invested in the venture. With this capital, Andrews designed and began a small refinery in Cleveland.
Ida M. Tarbell, an early investigative journalist and the author of The History of Standard Oil, described Andrews as "a mechanical genius" who "devised new processes" to create a better product. He is credited with inventing the chemical process called fractional distillation, which is the separation of crude oil into its components.[citation needed]
While he left Standard Oil early, he did try to display his wealth by building a mansion on Cleveland's Euclid Avenue, also known as "Millionaire's Row". Andrews dreamed of entertaining Queen Victoria at the home, but that dream never came to fruition. The home was so large that the servants could not function effectively, and it was soon closed and remained vacant for 25 years until it was eventually bulldozed in 1923.
His better-known partners, Rockefeller and Henry Morrison Flagler, are credited with the marketing strategies and schemes that capitalized on Andrews' technical expertise. Andrews often disagreed with Rockefeller's aggressive growth, and soon Rockefeller offered to buy Andrews out. Andrews took the offer and sold out all his stock in 1874. Flagler's wife's ill-health later turned his attention to Florida, where he founded the Florida East Coast Railway and helped develop many resort communities, most notably the cities of Palm Beach and Miami. While Flagler began a new career in Florida, Andrews remained in Ohio and New Jersey.
Andrews died at a hotel in Atlantic City in 1904. His will was executed in Lakewood, dissolving his still sizeable estate.

Rev. Samuel Andrew (29 January 1656 – 24 January 1738[1]) was an American Congregational clergyman and educator. He was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
He was graduated from Harvard College in 1675.[2] He was a Tutor and Fellow at Harvard, and had assumed the chief responsibilities of Harvard during the administrations of Presidents Oakes and Rogers. He had, in that position, been Tutor to several students who, like him, later became trustees of the Collegiate School: James Pierpont, Samuel Russel, Noadiah Russell and Joseph Webb.[3]
He was ordained minister at Milford, Connecticut on 18 November 1685,[2] and was pastor of the church there for fifty years.
He was one of the ten ministers who pooled their books and resources to found the Collegiate School at Branford, Connecticut in 1701, from which Yale dates its founding.[4]
He was one of the ministers who assembled at Saybrook in 1708 by order of the General Court for the purpose of adopting and recommending to the churches a manual of church discipline called the "Saybrook Platform".[2]
His first wife was Abigail Treat (1660-1727), the daughter of Governor Robert Treat and his first wife Jane Tapp. His second wife was Abigail Beach.
He served as the rector pro tempore of the Collegiate School between 1707 (the death of Rev. Abraham Pierson, the first rector) and 1719. During his tenure the school was renamed Yale College to honor a gift from Elihu Yale, a governor of the British East India Company. Rev. Andrew continued to reside at Milford, loyal to his congregation, teaching the senior students there. He refused to move to New Haven.
On 21 March 1710/11 his daughter Elizabeth married the Rev. Timothy Cutler, who succeeded him as rector of Yale in 1719.[2]
Rev. Andrew is interred at Milford.
