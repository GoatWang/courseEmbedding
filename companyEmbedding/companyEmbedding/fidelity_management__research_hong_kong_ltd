About us

 


Who we are
Fidelity International offers world class investment solutions and retirement expertise. As a privately owned, independent company, investment is our only business. We are driven by the needs of our clients, not by shareholders. Our vision is to deliver innovative client solutions for a better future.
Established in 1969 as the international arm of Fidelity Investments, which was founded in Boston in 1946, Fidelity International became independent of the US organisation in 1980, and is today owned mainly by management and members of the original founding family.


What we do
We invest USD $290 billion* globally on behalf of clients in 25 countries across Asia-Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, and South America. Our clients range from central banks, sovereign wealth funds, large corporates, financial institutions, insurers and wealth managers, to private individuals.
In addition to asset management, we offer investment administration and guidance for employer benefit schemes, advisers and individuals in several countries. We are responsible for USD $85 billion* in assets under administration.
* As of 30/09/2016


 

Our Investment Philosophy & Approach
Building on active, bottom-up research, we create the competitive advantage that is able to deliver superior returns for our clients.  Because markets are only semi-efficient, we act on intelligent insight:

    We have one of the largest global                research capabilities with over                400 investment professionals                around the world.       Our portfolio managers and                analysts attend more than 17,000                company meetings a year – or                one every 10 minutes on average.       We are committed to proprietary                research, with 90% of our research               produced in-house.       Our analysts carry out their                research on the ground – visiting               the shop floor, speaking to                customers, competitors, suppliers,               and independent experts to form               conviction.  
This 360⁰ perspective lets us find growth opportunities or income streams that have not been priced in by the market – allowing us to consistently add value for our clients.
 
 


How we run our business
We train many of our fund managers through our rigorous Portfolio Manager Academy programme. New portfolio managers initially manage pilot funds to test their ideas with our own money first. To our clients we offer tried and tested funds as a matter of principle.
Our portfolio managers are compensated on their long-term performance so that client and manager time horizons and interests are aligned. The same is true for our management, whose shareholdings are for the duration of their careers with the company.
Our model of private, independent ownership ensures we always act in the best interest of our clients. It provides the long-term framework enabling us to invest heavily into technology and innovation to continually improve our performance in supporting the goals of our clients.
It’s an approach that works: numerous awards around the globe recognise the consistent strong achievements of our investment and client service teams.

Before investing, consider the funds’ investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

          The statements and opinions expressed within the articles found in 'Fidelity in the News' are those of the author. Fidelity Investments cannot guarantee the accuracy or completeness of any statements or data.
	
    

          Past performance is no guarantee of future results.
	
    

          Diversification/asset allocation does not ensure a profit or guarantee against loss.
	
    

          Keep in mind that investing involves risk. The value of your investment will fluctuate over time and you may gain or lose money.
	
    

          Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.
	
    

          In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk, liquidity risk, call risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible.
	
    

          ETFs are subject to market fluctuation and the risks of their underlying investments. ETFs are subject to management fees and other expenses. Unlike mutual funds, ETF shares are bought and sold at market price, which may be higher or lower than their NAV, and are not individually redeemed from the fund.
	
    

          Because of their narrow focus, sector funds tend to be more volatile than funds that diversify across many sectors and companies.
