What Will Be the Lasting Impact of Brexit on US Mortgages?
Steve Cook
 Although Britain will not actually implement June’s Brexit referendum to leave the European Union until next March at the earliest, it has already made a major impact on US mortgage rates. Will the long term impact of Brexit be as significant?
Within days of the referendum, uncertainty about the potential impact of Brexit on European economies caused investors to sell riskier global stocks and buy safer...

Are you considering purchasing a new home? Are you thinking about selling your current home? Or, maybe you're just eager to refinance while interest rates are low?
Whatever the case may be, you'll need to know the value of the property in question. Our home value search can provide you with a wealth of information, and unlike a costly appraisal, it's completely free.
Our home prices are calculated using a proprietary algorithm that takes recent comparable sales, neighborhood data, and specific property information into account when creating a broad property value estimate.
We're not suggesting that you use our home value estimate in lieu of an appraisal from a trained professional when selling, purchasing, or refinancing, but it's the perfect source when you just need a reasonable estimate and you don't want to wait.
In addition to a ballpark value figure, you'll have access to valuable data, incuding transaction histories, home features, mortgage insurance and property tax estimates, and recent local sales.
And if you're looking for mortgage or refinance rates, you'll find them right there, right where you need them: on our price estimate page.
Whether you're just daydreaming or you've started hunting for a home in earnest, we hope you'll find our free home pricing page to be a valuable research tool.

Excellent place to park your mower
Pros:Durable,"Innovative" Cons:Expensive Best Uses:"Yard Tool Storage","Lawn Mower Storage" Bottom Line:Yes, I would recommend this to a friend. When I first read about this shed I was amazed -- and not in a good way. I mean, come on, who would want a shed that's less than 4-feet deep? That sounds pretty silly. Then I got to thinking, my mower is less than 4-feet wide. My snow blower is less than 4-feet wide. My tiller is less than 4-feet wide... maybe it's not such a silly idea after all! This little shed nestles right up next to your house and is the perfect size for yard equipment and power tools -- all without taking up too much room in your yard! It's definitely worth a second look!

Sonoco Products CoSonoco ThermoSafe Launches Reusable Range of Shipping Solutions for Temperature-Sensitive Pharmaceutical and Biological ShipmentsTwitterFacebookLinkedInGooglePlusRedditPinterestUrlJul 26 2017 22:17 BSTSource: Business Wire

ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jul. 26, 2017--
      Sonoco ThermoSafe, a unit of Sonoco (NYSE: SON) and a leading global
      provider of temperature assurance packaging, has launched a new range of
      reusable, universal solutions for the pharmaceutical and biologics
      markets. ChillTech® is a pre-qualified range of 2°C to 8°C PCM systems
      providing exceptional temperature control from 2 days up to 6 days for
      payloads from 4L to 40L. ChillTech® utilizes Sonoco ThermoSafe’s
      patented Zero Bench-Time® technology, where systems can be packed-out
      straight from the freezer, saving customers space, time and money.
    

This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here:
http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170726006414/en/

      Similar shippers on the market are qualified for just 4-days and
      typically use high-value components, which translate into higher costs
      for customers. These shippers also typically need time outside of the
      freezer prior to packing out, making Sonoco ThermoSafe’s Zero Bench-Time
      technology a real benefit. Each ChillTech solution has the same pack-out
      configuration and is used year-round, regardless of season. In addition,
      following Sonoco ThermoSafe’s philosophy to Embrace Simple®: simply
      change the outer insulated shipper to switch shipment duration from 48
      hours to 96 hours to 144 hours.
    

      “Our ChillTech range offers 2-day, 4-day and 6-day shippers, something
      new for this market,” said Vishal Khushalani, director of global
      marketing and business development, Sonoco ThermoSafe. “Plus, our 2-day
      solutions will be the first affordable reusable shipping option in the
      market. Considering that most clinical shipments in each region happen
      within 48 hours, ChillTech shippers will help customers reduce their
      total cost of ownership significantly.”
    

      “Our innovative ChillTech range of solutions are the only reusable
      product available on the market that offers 2°C to 8°C protection with
      the option of single stage conditioning that covers durations from 2-6
      days,” said Ron Haub, commercial director of Sonoco ThermoSafe. “Market
      research has found that one of the key challenges faced by the cold
      chain industry is finding the time, space and money to accommodate a
      two-stage conditioning process when preparing time-sensitive cold chain
      shipments. We are answering that challenge while reducing the cost of
      ownership through affordable purchase or leasing options.”
    

      ChillTech products are available globally for purchase or for lease from
      Sonoco ThermoSafe locations across Europe and North America. To learn
      more about the ChillTech range, visit www.thermosafe.com/chilltech.
