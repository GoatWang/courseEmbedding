I couldn't have asked for more from them. Furthermore, the nurse who took my vitals - a European lady whose name I forget - was fantastic on both visits. She was professional, knowledgeable, friendly and had a great manner. Unfortunately the M.D. I was there to see, Dr. Debelen, did not even come close to matching the level of service that his staff provided. Indeed he offered a shockingly low level of service. Here is a summary of my two visits:1) I was referred to Dr. Debelen by a local hospital, having undergone a non-surgical procedure there. At the hospital, the resulting wound had of course been thoroughly dressed. Obviously, in order for Dr. Debelen to examine the wound, I had to remove the dressing. I duly did so, and he examined the wound. He advised me to return in a week if there was no improvement. He then concluded the presentation - while the dressing was half attached and still needing fixing. He left the room. I wondered if I had made a mistake, and that he was going to return in order to apply a new dressing, or at least fix the one I had ripped off. I waited. And waited. Sure enough, it really was over, so I had to go and look for him in the corridors, to ask him to help me with the dressing (I had not brought any medical supplies with me, and the adhesive no longer stuck). He asked a nurse to give me some tape. This gave the impression of a doctor who doesn't care much for his patients, something I am not used to.2) Dr. Debelen did not strike me as being very knowledgeable during my first visit and my expectations were low for visit No.2, but he somehow managed to fall below what I would term a basic level of care: before the hospital visit mentioned above, I had been prescribed anti-biotics, which had caused an allergic reaction. The hospital had then prescribed penicillin, but it hadn't had the desired effect - the wound was not healing sufficiently. I sat on a regular chair in Dr. Debelen's office . Instead of going and getting another chair and sitting down next to me, Dr. Debelen sprawled out across the patient bed with his laptop, in the same manner my cousin would if he was watching YouTube videos. He then decided to prescribe me the same drug that had caused me the allergic reaction in the first place! I was astonished, and told him, "No, that's what I was allergic to". Not only did he not appear to be helping, but if I had not been totally switched on, he may well has caused me some more problems. Overall, this is the worst medical 'professional' I have encountered and I certainly will not return.Ezeanolue, David D, MDRick G. ratedDear Dr. Dolue Ezeanolue (Dr. EZ) and Kind Staff:My account has been turned over to collections last week because I was billed (and rightly so) for injections that took place after my insurance had run out. I was not told this. Now I owe the office upwards of $1000 which I am willing to work on with monthly payments. However, the woman I dealt with in your collections was not the most accommodating person. I tried to work with her but all I can afford is $50 a month. I'm on a strict budget, I am HIV+ and on very expensive life-saving medications and all the costs that that entails, and I also see other doctors for that medical condition as well as have expensive blood work 3 times a year. So now I have to find a new pain doctor all because she (collection agent) refused to work with me). This pains me because I thoroughly enjoyed coming into your office and seeing people who I now consider my friends because they are so caring. I find it so hard and sad to think that I won't be coming back under my Health Plan of Nevada because of the actions of one woman. I will miss seeing the nice, professional people in the office who took such great care of me---not only my pain but always asked about my HIV status and genuinely cared. It's very, very sad to me to have to locate another pain office as Dr. EZ and his staff were always so kind and helpful. In the future, I will definitely recommend APEX but not after recounting this horrible experience with one collection agent in your office. So sadly and with a heavy heart, I say goodbye to APEX and my wonderful "family" of medical professionals there.Sincerely,Rick Grayson 702-376-9016 (DOB 11/1964)Michael E Seiff MDDaniel H. ratedIf you are just browsing, I will get right to the bottom line: Dr. Seiff is a fantastic doctor and neurosurgeon. I give him my highest possible recommendation. If you already know you need to see a neurosurgeon, go straight to Dr. Seiff. Six months ago, Dr. Seiff performed a double laminectomy (and more) on my lower spine (L3 through L5 and below). Prior to the surgery I was having near debilitating nerve pain in both legs; bad enough that simply standing up was painful. Today I am pain free. I found everything about Dr. Seiff to be top-notch and first-class, including his wonderful staff and assistants, who constantly communicated with and calmed a very nervous patient, me. The doctor was extremely careful and detailed in explaining everything, before and after the surgery, allowing me to understand totally what was going on. I want to stress that, if you are having pain in your head, neck, back, arms or legs, you need to see a neurosurgeon first. If you have already received a diagnosis from a different kind of practitioner, especially if it entails surgery, you need to get a second opinion from a neurosurgeon. In my case, another surgeon had already scheduled me for both an anterior and posterior fusion when I hit the pause button and went to see Dr. Seiff. It may be the smartest decision I ever made. Neurosurgeons are medical doctors with extremely rigorous advanced training. Dr. Michael Seiff is well-qualified, well-trained and very experienced. But in the end, it is his skill in the operating room that makes him special. In my case, that skill has given me a new life and I thank him every day for his superior work!PedsDuane O. ratedIt is a shame that Dr. Dewan, who is a great Pediatric Endocrinologist, hires such an unprofessional office staff.  I would give him 5 stars, but unfortunately I have to deal more with the front office staff than Dr. Dewan.  Never returning your calls in a timely manner, interrupting you while you are explaining what is needed, and claiming they never received faxed prescriptions from a pharmacy they always do business with all means that customer service is not a priority.  I am sure they have many tasks to perform and probably deal with many people who are difficult, but at this point I would probably get better service at the VA.  Unfortunately I can not tell this directly to Dr. Dewan unless I have an appointment or send him a certified letter in the mail.  Dr. Dewan is great with my son and I highly recommend him.  However, I wish he would put more effort into selecting quality staff who believe in customer service and doing what is right. It may not be fair to give him a low rating because of his staff, but ultimately he is responsible for the hiring of said individuals.  I promise if the experiences improve, I will revise my review.Timothy Duanne Francis DRElaine D. ratedI have suffered with sciatica pain for over 10 years.  I love to take long walks, but after 20 minutes or so, I would be hobbling back home, in serious pain.  I would have to lie down with my right leg elevated for 15 minutes until the pain subsided.  Even after that, I would be limping around the house for the rest of the day.  Then, I was referred to Dr. Francis.  After only 2 visits, I am now taking long, brisk walks for 45 minutes with NO PAIN!  When I get home, I don't have to sit or lie down at all.  I am able to continue functioning normally for the rest of the day with no discomfort!  I can't believe it!  I feel like I have a new lease on life!  I highly recommend Dr. Francis and have complete confidence in his ability to help me correct other medical issues that I have, as well.  Thank you, Dr. Francis!Jonathan Bernstein MDcadatownley ratedDr Berstein is a very devoted and caring man.  Even though he is a children's oncologist, he is one of the only hemotologists in the area that has a full understanding of factor 5 lieden deficiency and factor 2 proficiency.  It is a rare bleeding disorder and often when I appear at the ER and find a doctor that needs to be quickly educated on it so I don't die from blood lose or from receiving the wrong type of blood products, well, they get offended and ask me when I went to medical school.  I can call Dr. B any time day or night and get his help.  He is always ready to be there for his patients.  I am by far not a child but he still takes good care of me and I even get a sucker if I'm a good girl at my visit!  :}John J.

Very upfront and a bit brash but he's just being honest. Treatment and diagnosis was spot on.However, his office staff are not the greatest women ever. Very impatient (they'd call my name to go back and me being disabled at the time it took me a minute to even get to the door and they'd already be at the end of the hall), they talk very loud on the front office, and they just all around don't seem welcoming or happy to see a patient walk in the door.Only woman that made my office experience close to what it should be was an older woman with red hair. Very nice and very humorous :)Doctor, if you see this, you need an office meeting on hospitality asap.Nowins, John M, MDJessica S. ratedI am very pleased with the care I receive from Dr. John Nowins. He has been my Dr. for years now and I wouldn't change doctors. He is very thorough with all of my results and any questions I have for him. He always takes time to explain things to me in ways that I can understand. I always get copies of my results and he will even give me print outs of my diagnoses to read on my own to understand better. I also saw him for my pregnancy and it was my first pregnancy and he made the whole pregnancy and delivery very comfortable and easy. He was on top of everything and making sure baby and I were healthy. In my opinion he is a very good and caring doctor.Coy, Michael, MDDonna S. ratedDr. Coy sees my very large family. He is unbelievable when it comes to compassion. He has helped us through the Hospice process with our parents, even taking the time to frequently call and check up on us. He has announced pregnancies and adoptions & rejoiced with us thur those also. Dr. Coy is quick to research any issues he is not 100% sure of and humble enough to tell us when something is outside his expertise. He is encouraging and patiently listens.kHis staff is wonderful too!It sometimes takes awhile waiting but that's because he is giving everyone the time they need!Did You Know?Physicians and surgeons help to keep people - from infants to the elderly - as healthy as possible. These individuals provide diagnoses and treatments for a wide variety of ailments, and preventative care and early detection for more serious illnesses. Whether you love or hate going to the doctor, the fact is your physician is there to listen to your health concerns, take preventative measures against diseases and advise you on your options for staying in tip-top shape.In 2013, there were more than 1 million doctors of medicine in the U.S., over 854,000 of which were active. Additionally, in 2012, there were about 18,000 active general surgeons in the country. It's important to know which type of physician or surgeon you need, how to choose the best one, and account for other considerations in order to stay healthy.Different Types of PhysiciansPatients can choose from a wide variety of physicians depending on doctor specialty and what problems they are experiencing. Here are a few of the most common types of physicians that you may see in your lifetime:General Practitioner
Your GP is the doctor that you go to for regular checkups, vaccines and to identify health issues. GPs can treat many different illnesses and injuries, from the common cold to a broken arm. If your health requires a second opinion or expert care, the GP will refer you to a specialist who has the skills to focus in on the issue.Cardiologist
Heart attacks and heart disease are some of the most common afflictions seen across the country, making cardiologists important to your long-term health. These physicians specialize in studying and treating the heart and related diseases.Dentist
Other than a GP, the dentist is likely the most common physician you'll ever see. These professionals work with the human mouth, ensuring that your teeth and gum health are up to par. Patients typically go to the dentist twice a year.Dermatologist
Dermatologists are focused on skin-related issues and diseases, from skin cancers, to acute acne, eczema, psoriasis, and general cosmetic concerns like aging and scars. Most will also perform annual or semi-annual mole checks to screen for any signs of melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer.ENT
If you have a number of sinus infections or have had your tonsils taken out, you've likely seen an ENT specialist. ENTs handle ailments related to the ear, nose and throat, often related to taking out tonsils and treating hearing issues.OB/GYN
For many women, their gynecologist and obstetrician are the same person. These professionals work with the female reproductive system to focus on reproductive health, fertility issues, prenatal care, options for new and expectant mothers, neonatal care and childbirth. OB/GYNs can also help in the early detection of breast or cervical cancer.Choosing a PhysicianThere are obviously a number of physicians that you can choose from, but how do you know if they're the best choice for you? Here are a few considerations to help you pick a physician:Look at Your Insurance
Before you get down to the details, you need to verify which doctors are covered by your insurance and whether they are in or out of your carrier's network. Rates may be cheaper if the doc is in network – a doctor can be covered by your insurance but not necessarily in network. Out of network is typically more expensive. Doctors often add and drop plans, so it's important to ensure that your options are compatible with your insurance plan. Doing your homework will help you avoid unexpected expenses. Check for Board Certification
Your physician should be certified through the American Board of Medical Specialties. Doctors must earn a medical degree from a qualified school, complete three to seven years of residency training, be licensed by a state medical board and pass one or more ABMS exams to be certified.Examine the Reviews
Reviews of a doctor can reveal a lot about what your experience may be like. People may grade on staff friendliness, availability and effectiveness of treatment. Looking at these evaluations and getting recommendations from family and friends can direct you toward a physician for your needs.Choosing a SurgeonSurgeons can literally hold your life in their hands, and it's important to find the best one that can put you at ease and treat you effectivelyCompatibility Factor
You need to feel comfortable with your surgeon. It's important to communicate your concerns and that your surgeon can respond adequately. Surgeons should be willing to go over the details of your procedure and answer any questions that you may have. They must take the time to discuss and address your worries.Expertise Level
If you're going in for surgery, you want someone that knows what they're doing and has a high success rate. Ask how often the surgeon performs this surgery and try to find one that regularly does it. This will give you peace of mind that you're in capable hands.Understanding Your InsuranceYour decision on a physician or surgeon can be majorly affected by the insurance plan you have. You may have insurance through employment, your spouse, your parents if you're under 26, or the marketplace if the previous options don't apply to you. It's important to understand how your insurance works to have the full picture of what you'll need to pay for.Your insurance will have a deductible, which is the amount that you're responsible to pay for covered medical expenses. Some plans have coinsurances, where you must pay a certain percentage of the bill, and insurance will cover the rest. Co-pays state a flat rate for certain services, like paying $20 when you visit your GP or a $100 co-pay for an emergency room visit. Once you reach your out-of-pocket maximum, which will differ if you're an individual or within a family plan, your insurance may pay for 100 percent of covered medical expenses for the rest of the plan year.If you plan to go to the doctor, need medication or have been recommended for surgery, call your insurance provider or go online to see what your plan covers. You can choose the best doctor for your needs, understand your options and prevent yourself from being blindsided by medical expenses.Setting Your AppointmentMost doctors require a phone call for an appointment, although some may provide online scheduling as well. Be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment, and to bring it with you to the actual appointment. They need the ID numbers to verify your coverage, and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you don't have to show it again unless your insurance changes.When you call, let them know if you're a new patient, as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit. Tell them the reason for your visit, such as your symptoms if you're feeling sick. It's also important to inform them if you have Medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit, like current medications or medical records.From here, the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you. During your call, it's important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit. This information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect. Your appointment may progress faster as a result, and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for you.RisksDoctors see a number of patients in a day, sometimes in 15-minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand. This can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations, and they can end up missing certain problem indicators. While some problems, like a cold or flu, can be diagnosed in this time, more complex ailments require attention, which takes up time. Reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demand.Surgery has some more dire risks attached to it, so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure. If a patient has a reaction to anesthesia, it can cause very serious complications, but this is an uncommon occurrence. Blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery, often caused by inactivity during recovery. Infections, numbness, scarring, swelling and death are all possible, but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery you're undergoing. Talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potential.AftercareSurgery affects people in different ways, but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia, you'll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have. The nurse will tell you how the procedure went, what effect it will have on your condition, what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal. If you start feeling pain, the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse. When possible, it's also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs. This can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot. Some surgeries are outpatient procedures, where people are released the same day. For major surgeries, patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home. Discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bring.Recovery and Follow-upYour recovery time and follow-up expectations will vary depending on your procedure. For example, you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out, but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heart-valve surgery. Your surgeon will give you a list of things that you'll need to do during this time, including what medications to take and when you'll be able to get back to work and other activities.Every surgery will have a follow-up call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health. If you have a major operation, like heart surgery, it's important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal. Visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected. These appointments will give you peace of mind about your state of health and ensure that any issues are caught early on.
