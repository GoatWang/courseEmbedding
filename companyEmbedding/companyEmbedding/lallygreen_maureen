Foregoing retirement, Maureen Lally-Green became the first female to serve as dean of Duquesne University School of Law on July 1, after a year as interim dean. As a judge of the Superior Court of Pennsylvania, she chaired the Gender Fairness and Implementation Committee, as well as the group that developed and proposed to the Supreme Court a nondiscrimination policy and procedures for the judicial branch of government, which was adopted and became effective in 2008. She talked about experiencing Duquesne in multiple roles and why she’ll continue to teach.
What appealed to you about leading Duquesne’s School of Law?

                            Maureen Lally-Green is the dean of the Duquesne University School of Law.                        
Joe Wojcik










 


I went here as an undergraduate, and at the law school, I was a professor here for many years and always stayed close. The appeal to me was the opportunity to not only give back in terms of my personal involvement, but also to work with students as they meet the challenges associated with the practice of law.
In effect, you’re reporting to your predecessor since Duquesne’s president, Kenneth Gormley, is the former dean. What’s that like?
He knows my issues. I’m committed to some of the things he began here, and he’s committed to listening to my ideas. We work together well, and we’re at a very different level, probably, than most people in these positions. I just think he gets it.




What drew you to a career in the law?
What turned the switch for me was meeting a woman who was a graduate of Duquesne Law, Judge Carol Los Mansmann. She was working in the District Attorney’s office and people at Duquesne said I should meet her while I was making my decision about whether to go to law school. I’d taken the LSAT but wasn’t sure about what I wanted to do. When I sat down with her, she was so inspirational that I made the decision and went to law school. She ended up being a judge on the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania and then became a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.

Did her example stir your interest in serving on the bench?
I’m sure Carol’s experience, and others’ experiences, added to the attraction. But a lot of the work I did was in the appellate round, and I loved that arena. So when the opportunity came around, it was not a hard choice.
What is the biggest challenge for Duquesne University School of Law?
To create an educational opportunity for the students that meets their needs and goals, which is part of our mission in a context of ethics and professionalism to prepare them for the jobs that exist now or will exist in the future. The practice of law has shifted, and it’s no longer the way it was 30 years ago or even 20 years ago.




 


From your years on the state Superior Court bench, was there a case that stands out to you, maybe a benchmark in your career as a judge?
It’s not so much a case but the opportunity to work on a problem so it’s no longer a problem or at least minimized, such as policies on nondiscrimination on the basis of race or gender. It really opened my eyes.
Will you continue to teach?
Yes. In the fall, I’ll be co-teaching Appellate Practice and Procedure, a course I’ve taught before, and in the spring, I’ll co-teach Governance, Compliance and Risk Management.
Why is it important to you to do this?
When one teaches, one is certainly informed by the students from the questions they ask and the goals they set for themselves. I think it’s a great way to keep a pulse on who we’re serving so that you can better serve them. It does take a lot of time, but that’s OK. Teaching is a privilege in my view. It’s a wonderful opportunity to work with those who’ll be the next generation of lawyers.
If you weren’t in your current position, what would you be doing?
I was trying to be retired. I don’t think there’s another path for me.
Would you do-over any part of your career?
I actually don’t look back. I’m just grateful. You go through things and say, “Oh, Lord, what is this experience going to evolve to be?” In retrospect, it usually was something that taught me a lot. I certainly wouldn’t change any of the people. They all taught me good lessons of life and, certainly, many, many took the time to mentor me and give me opportunities. Even though it didn’t seem like a straight path, it allowed me to grow in ways I never thought I’d grow.
If you could change jobs for a day with anyone, who would it be — and why?
A member of the U.S. Supreme Court.
Your husband, Stephen Ross Green, is also a lawyer, now retired, so did it help you having shared lives and a shared profession?
It was terrific. He understood my life, and I understood his. He was more in banking and patents, different stuff than I worked with. People always ask, “Did you argue a lot?” Not really. We could discuss topics, and he might have a different perspective.
What haven’t you achieved that you still want to do?
I want to be a grandma. My oldest daughter is pregnant, and we’re awaiting a baby in the fall.

Maureen Lally-Green is an American lawyer in the state of Pennsylvania. She currently serves as a judge on the Pennsylvania Superior Court.

Personal[edit]
Lally-Green was born in Sharpsville, Mercer County, in 1949. She graduated from Duquesne University with a B.S. in 1971 and its School of Law in 1974.
Lally-Green practiced law in a private law firm in Pittsburgh. She later served as counsel to Commodity Futures Trading Commission in Washington, D.C., as counsel to the former Westinghouse Electric Corporation, and as a consultant to Justices of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. She was a professor at Duquesne University School of Law, and is currently the Dean of the Law School
Judicial career[edit]
In 1998, Lally-Green was appointed by Governor Tom Ridge to the Superior Court of Pennsylvania and confirmed by the State Senate. The next year, Judge Lally-Green was elected for a full ten-year term.
Lally-Green ran for a seat on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in 2007. During the campaign, a Virginia organization called the Center for Individual Freedom ran over $1.2 million worth of ads on her behalf. The organization had not registered with the state nor did it file campaign reports. The campaign led to efforts by state officials to determine the origin of the cash. However, the source was never determined. [1]
Lally-Green finished third in the race behind Seamus McCaffery and Debra Todd, two colleagues on the Superior Court.
