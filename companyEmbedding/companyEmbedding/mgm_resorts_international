Restaurants





Other than choosing where to sleep, choosing where to eat may be the most difficult decision you make on your next vacation. It's only made tougher when you consider how diverse the collection of restaurants are under MGM Resorts' roof. Our resorts offer Michelin Star rated restaurants, 24 hour cafes, and everything in between. In fact, the best chefs in the world are at MGM Resorts restaurants including master chefs such as Joel Robuchon, Julian Serrano, Michael Mina, Wolfgang Puck, Jose Andres, and Alain Ducasse. Rather than worry about TV shows, our chefs work hard to prepare menus that satisfy and delight all the senses. And while we like to keep them a secret, we can't hold back any longer, we want everyone to enjoy a night out on their next vacation. If you have the appetite for it, you can find it here.

Will MGM Resorts (MGM) Disappoint This Earnings Season?


July 25, 2017, 08:57:00 AM EDT
By Zacks Equity Research, Zacks.com

  MGM Resorts International MGM  is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 numbers on Jul 27, before the opening bell.    Last quarter, MGM Resorts pulled off a 46.15% positive earnings surprise. In fact, the company's earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 164.92%.    Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.    MGM Resorts International Price and EPS     Surprise        MGM Resorts International Price and EPS   Surprise    |      MGM Resorts International Quote   Factors Likely to Affect Q2 Results    Given the improved operating environment in Macau, the company's consistent efforts to boost tourism and traffic therein, has started yielding results with revenues at MGM China improving on a year-over-year basis in the last two quarters. In fact, this happened after it witnessed consistent year-over-year declines since the second quarter of 2014.    Per the Macau Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau, gross gaming revenues (GGR) rose in all the three months of the quarter too, thereby continuing the revival in Macao. This, in turn, should boost second-quarter results.    But VIP table games' revenues witnessed a decline of 5% in the previous quarter as turnover plunged 16%. Thus, the results in the to-be-reported quarter may also be somewhat hampered given the lingering anxieties related to the sustainability of revenues from the VIP market.    Nevertheless, MGM Resorts' earnings in the to-be-reported quarter are expected to benefit from higher demand at its properties in Las Vegas on the back of improving employment rate trends and increasing tourism numbers in the region. Moreover, the diversification of its resort portfolio and non-gaming options is likely to propel revenues. Meanwhile, the company's profit growth plan is poised to increase the quarter's profits.    However, the company expects the Easter calendar shift in April to negatively impact convention room nights. This along with higher-than-normal table games hold in prior-year quarter is thus set to provide tough year-over-year comparisons in the to-be-reported quarter. MGM Resorts thus anticipates its Las Vegas Strip revenues to be flat in the quarter, with casino revenues projected to decline slightly. Nevertheless, non-gaming revenues are expected to rise marginally.   Earnings Whispers    Our proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for MGM Resorts this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as elaborated below.   Zacks ESP  : MGM Resorts has an Earnings ESP of -3.45%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is 28 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 29 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter  .   Zacks Rank  : MGM Resorts has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).      As it is, we caution you against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.   Stocks to Consider    Here are some companies to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:    Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. LYV  has an Earnings ESP of +31.25% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks   here   .    Penn National Gaming, Inc. PENN  has an Earnings ESP of +8.33% and a Zacks Rank #1.    Time Warner Inc. TWX  has an Earnings ESP of +3.39% and a Zacks Rank #2.   More Stock News: Tech Opportunity Worth $386 Billion in 2017    From driverless cars to artificial intelligence, we've seen an unsurpassed growth of high-tech products in recent months. Yesterday's science-fiction is becoming today's reality. Despite all the innovation, there is a single component no tech company can survive without. Demand for this critical device will reach $387 billion this year alone, and it's likely to grow even faster in the future.

The Company has based forward-looking statements on management's current expectations and assumptions and not on historical facts. Examples of these statements include, but are not limited to, the Company being added to the S&P 500 index. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in such forward-looking statements include effects of economic conditions and market conditions in the markets in which the Company operates and competition with other destination travel locations throughout the United States and the world, the design, timing and costs of expansion projects, risks relating to international operations, permits, licenses, financings, approvals and other contingencies in connection with growth in new or existing jurisdictions and additional risks and uncertainties described in the Company's Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and Form 8-K reports (including all amendments to those reports).
