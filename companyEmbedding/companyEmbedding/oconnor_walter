A saga of  high adventure, sex, madness, catharsis and exploration of human relationships in a crazy world.

Walter Minion is an archetypical retired Englishman.  His life is gentle and domesticated.  But gradually little stresses mount, culminating in breakdown.  His enforced therapy is to undertake a voyage that will test him to the extreme limits of his courage, fortitude, love and erotic resistance.
A wondrous girl mysteriously joins him.  She is feminine perfection, but Walter discovers that she is also weirdly unnatural.
The two are caught up in a series of wild adventures as they cross oceans, make exotic landfalls and survive terrifying dangers. They encounter more people: good, evil and mad.  Throughout their odyssey Walter faces tantalising prospects of submission and erotic rapture.  He wrestles with the emotional conflicts that ensue, and with humanity’s stupidity and hatred, beauty and love.  Walter’s therapy sails to a surprising finale, a counterpoint of... More > tragedy and joyful triumph.< Less

"Therapy for the reader too!" Walter's retirement leads to mental breakdown. His prescribed therapy is to sail around the world in a yacht called Therapy.  As he leaves harbor, he observes his wife walking away on the arm of his psychiatrist. On his weird and wonderful voyage he has some fantastic adventures, is joined by a mysterious, beautiful siren and is boarded by pirates. There are massive highs and lows along the way and twists right up to the end. This is pure fiction, as every part of the story is totally unbelievable, yet the reader is captured by the spirit and begins to wish that it were reality. By the end of the book, we are left wondering, "Was it real, or was it all just a dream?" A brilliantly unique read, and the pace makes it very easy to relax into. Great therapy!  And if you like this one, you'll LOVE Pat O'Connor's second novel, which, characteristically of Walter himself, is actually the prequel to the first! The title: "Walter Minion's... More > Secret Life."< Less

                                "Unbelievably believable" If you liked "Therapy," you'll LOVE Pat O'Connor's second novel, which, characteristically of Walter himself, is actually the prequel to the first!  Walter's life is a continuous flow of fantasies as he makes his accidental mark on world affairs and gets himself involved in shaping modern history. Fantastic though the story of Walter's life is, it is only a step or two removed from what would be a very ordinary life, and so it seems totally plausible.  From his boring life as a civil servant, Walter finds himself catapulted into the world of high espionage, being flown around the world and advising world leaders. This is an extremely entertaining read. The action never stops. The conclusion of each chapter leaves the reader anticipating the next.

Product Specification

OverviewTech SpecDownloadsPart numbersAsk OConnor


With the 30L Carbon Fiber Tripod OConnor replaces the legacy 25L & 35L lines of tripods. Combining the benefits of new-age materials with precision engineering has created a support system which is both lightweight, yet solid and stable, an ideal fit for the new generation of smaller new Ultimate 1030D & 1030Ds Fluid Heads.
At just 8.8 lbs (4 kg) the 30L's double extension design ensures it can safely and stably carry payloads of up to 209 lbs (95 kg) even at its maximum height of 63.4" (161 cm). And the 30L is versatile. Despite its generous height range, it folds down to a mere 29.5” (75 cm) for convenient travel. A smart quick clamping system offers secure and visible tripod lockdown. The system's integral spreader system offers easy trouble-free security. Removable rubber feet expose spikes for optimal traction and payload safety on a variety of surfaces.
OConnor's new 30L tripod system features an expanded payload range in a lightweight package that makes it the perfect companion for the new 1030D and 1030Ds Ultimate Fluid Heads.

Lightweight, two-stage carbon fiber tripod with 100 mm bowl for payloads up to 209 lbs (95 kg)



   Model 30L     Type 2-Stage Tripod   Material Carbon Fiber   Capacity 209 lbs. (95 kg)   Weight 8.8 lbs (4 kg) tripod only   Maximum Height 61.8 in. (157 cm)   Minimum Height 22 in.
