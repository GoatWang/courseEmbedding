         PRIMARY GENERAL AGENCY                            BROKER/DEALER

                      SBL VARIABLE PRODUCTS SALES AGREEMENT

Effective Date:

    1.   This Agreement is made among Security  Benefit Life Insurance  Company,
         of Topeka,  Kansas, and its affiliated company,  Security Distributors,
         Inc.,  hereinafter jointly called "SBL,"  ("Broker/Dealer") and each of
         the agencies listed on Exhibit "A", attached hereto (if any), ("General
         Agent").   SBL  hereby  authorizes   Broker/Dealer  and  those  persons
         associated  with General Agent who are  registered  representatives  of
         Broker/Dealer  and  licensed  agents of SBL to solicit  and service (1)
         variable   annuities  issued  under  Security  Benefit  Life  Insurance
         Company's  several  Variable  Annuity  Accounts and (2)  variable  life
         insurance   policies  issued  under  Security  Benefit  Life  Insurance
         Company's variable life accounts, each of which have been registered as
         securities under the Securities Act of 1933 with Security Distributors,
         Inc. (a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.)
         having been designated  Principal  Underwriter  thereof.  Said variable
         annuity contracts and variable life insurance  policies are referred to
         herein as "variable products."

    2.   General  Agent is hereby  authorized  to solicit,  and to recommend for
         appointment  subagents  (referred to herein as Agents) to solicit sales
         of SBL variable products, to deliver the contracts,  and to service the
         business.  General  Agent may organize,  train,  and maintain an agency
         force;  however,  SBL may at its option,  refuse to  contract  with any
         proposed  Agent and may at any time  terminate any  Agreement  with any
         Agent.

         General  Agent  agrees  to abide by the terms  and  conditions  of this
         Agreement and any sales  manuals  and/or rules and practices of SBL and
         agrees  that its Agents  will not (i)  solicit or submit  applications,
         (ii) receive any  compensation  based on  transactions in securities or
         the  provision  of  securities  advice,  or (iii)  engage  in any other
         securities  activities,  unless such Agents are properly licensed under
         applicable   insurance  laws  and  are  "associated   persons"  of  the
         Broker/Dealer  within the meaning of "associated  person of a broker or
         dealer,"  as that term is used in Section  3(a)(18)  of the  Securities
         Exchange Act of 1934.  General Agent agrees to abide by all  applicable
         local,  state and federal laws and  regulations in conducting  business
         under this Agreement.  General Agent  undertakes and agrees to hold SBL
         harmless against any loss of whatever kind or nature arising out of any
         claim made by any of said agents for compensation.

         General  Agent shall  endeavor  to promote  SBL's  interests  and those
         mutual  interests  of  General  Agent and SBL as  contemplated  by this
         Agreement  and shall at all times  conduct  itself,  and see that those
         Agents  assigned  to or  appointed  by General  Agent or its  employees
         conduct  themselves,  so  as  not  to  adversely  affect  the  business
         reputation or good standing of either General Agent or SBL. The primary
         General Agent agrees to provide the affiliated General Agents listed on
         Exhibit "A" attached hereto (if any), with a copy of this agreement and
         insure compliance with its terms by each General Agents.

         General  Agent shall be  responsible  to SBL for the acts of the Agents
         assigned to or appointed by General  Agent or its  employees  and shall
         indemnify and hold harmless from any and all expenses, costs, causes of
         actions,   and/or  damages   resulting  from  or  growing  out  of  any
         unauthorized act by General Agent or any of its Agents or employees. In
         addition, the primary General Agent shall be responsible to SBL for the
         acts of each of the  affiliated  General  Agents  (if  any)  listed  on
         Exhibit "A",  attached  hereto,  and shall  indemnify and hold harmless
         from any and all expenses,  costs,  causes of actions,  and/or  damages
         resulting from or growing out of any  unauthorized act by General Agent
         or any of its Agents or employees.

    3.   Broker/Dealer  hereby accepts  authorization to solicit and service SBL
         variable products and confirms that  Broker/Dealer is properly licensed
         to solicit and service such  variable  products for SBL and is a member
         in good standing of the National  Association  of  Securities  Dealers,
         Inc., hereinafter called "NASD," and further agrees to notify SBL if it
         ceases to be a member of NASD.

    4.   Broker/Dealer shall have the authority to recruit,  train and supervise
         registered  representatives  for the sale of variable  products of SBL.
         Such training and supervision  shall be conducted by the  Broker/Dealer
         in  accordance  with the  Securities  Exchange Act of 1934,  the NASD's
         Rules of Fair Practice and other applicable law. SBL reserves the right
         to require termination of any registered representative's right to sell
         SBL  variable  products.  Broker/Dealer  shall be  responsible  for any
         registered representative appointed hereunder complying with the terms,
         conditions and limitations as set forth in this Agreement.

    5.   Commissions  on  stipulated  payments  or  premiums  accepted by SBL on
         behalf of an  annuitant,  participant,  or  policyholder  of a variable
         product  covered  by this  Agreement  will be in  accordance  with  the
         Schedule of Commissions  made part of this  Agreement,  and are in full
         consideration of all services rendered and expenses incurred  hereunder
         by the General Agent and Broker/Dealer or their representatives.  First
         year  commissions  are  payable  when an  individual  variable  annuity
         contract, group variable annuity certificate or variable life insurance
         policy is issued  and paid for upon an  application  submitted  through
         Broker/Dealer and accepted by the applicant thereof.  General Agent and
         Broker/Dealer  are  not  authorized  to  deduct  commissions  prior  to
         forwarding  any  remittance  received  to SBL.  All  checks  or  drafts
         received  by the  General  Agent or  Broker/Dealer  in  regards  to any
         variable  product  shall  be made  payable  to  Security  Benefit  Life
         Insurance Company.  All compensation payable hereunder shall be subject
         to a first lien and may be  reduced  or set off as to any  indebtedness
         owed by the General Agent or Broker/Dealer to SBL. Any commissions paid
         to a third party at the request of the General  Agent or  Broker/Dealer
         shall be deducted from the commissions payable hereunder.  In the event
         this agreement is executed by one or more affiliated insurance agencies
         listed on Exhibit  "A",  it is  understood  and agreed that the primary
         agency will collect and disburse  said  commissions  to the  soliciting
         General Agency.

    6.   General  Agent  and  Broker/Dealer  agree  to be  bound  by the  terms,
         conditions  and  limitations  set forth in this Agreement and the rules
         and practices of SBL that are now and hereafter in force. Broker/Dealer
         agrees not to solicit or submit  applications for variable  products to
         SBL  unless  they and their  registered  representatives  are  properly
         licensed,  and further  agrees that it will  conform to all  applicable
         state,  federal and local laws and  regulations in conducting  business
         under this Agreement.  Both SBL and Broker/Dealer hereby agree to abide
         by the  applicable  Rules of Fair  Practice of the NASD which Rules are
         incorporated  herein  as if set  forth in  full.  The  signing  of this
         Agreement and the purchase of variable  products  pursuant thereto is a
         representation  to SBL  that  Broker/Dealer  is a  properly  registered
         Broker/Dealer under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934.

    7.   Neither the General Agent,  Broker/Dealer nor their representatives are
         authorized  to  make  any   representations   concerning  the  variable
         products,  their sponsor  (SBL),  the principal  underwriter  (Security
         Distributors,  Inc.)  or  the  underlying  mutual  funds  except  those
         contained in the  applicable  current  prospectuses  and in the printed
         information furnished by SBL. General Agent and Broker/Dealer agree not
         to use any other advertising or sales material relating to the variable
         products unless specifically approved in writing by SBL.

    8.   General  Agent  and  Broker/Dealer  are  not  authorized  and  have  no
         authority (a) to make, alter or discharge any contract for or on behalf
         of SBL,  (b) endorse any check or draft  payable to SBL,  (c) to accept
         any variable product consideration after the initial remittance, (d) to
         waive  or  modify  any  prospectus,  contract,  policy  or  application
         provision,  condition or obligation, (e) to extend the time for payment
         of any variable product consideration or accept payment of any past due
         variable product consideration.

    9.   This  Agreement  shall  not  create  or be  construed  as  creating  an
         Employer-Employee or Master-Servant  relationship between General Agent
         and SBL or Broker/Dealer and SBL.

   10.   General Agent agrees to keep accurate  records on all business  written
         and moneys received under this Agreement.  Such records may be examined
         by SBL or its representatives at any reasonable time.

   11.   General Agent and Broker/Dealer  agree to be responsible for any county
         or municipal occupational or privilege fee, tax or license which may be
         required of General Agent,  Broker/Dealer or its  representatives  as a
         result of business submitted under this Agreement.

   12.   Broker/Dealer  will maintain books and records  relating to the sale of
         the  variable  products and the receipt and  disbursement  of insurance
         commissions and fees thereon. Such books and records will be maintained
         and preserved in conformity  with the  requirements of Section 17(a) of
         the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules  thereunder,  to the
         extent applicable,  and will at all times be compiled and maintained in
         a manner  that  permits  inspection  by the  supervisory  personnel  of
         Broker/Dealer,  the Securities and Exchange  Commission,  the NASD, and
         other appropriate regulatory authorities.

   13.   The receipt of commissions  and fees relating to the variable  products
         will  be  reflected  in  the  quarterly  FOCUS  reports  filed  by  the
         Broker/Dealer and in its fee assessment reports filed with the NASD.

   14.   A   designated    principal   of   Broker/Dealer   will   approve   all
         advertisements.

   15.   All premiums  derived from the sale of the  variable  products  will be
         sent directly to SBL, or will be sent by customers to the Broker/Dealer
         for  forwarding to SBL. The General Agent will not receive,  accumulate
         or maintain custody of customer funds.

   16.   Neither this Agreement nor the compensation  payable hereunder shall be
         assigned or pledged  without the written  consent of SBL.  SBL reserves
         the right to reject any assignment or pledge.

   17.   No consent or change in this Agreement shall be binding upon SBL unless
         in writing and signed by the president, a vice president,  secretary or
         an assistant secretary of SBL. Any failure of SBL to insist upon strict
         compliance  with the provisions of this Agreement  shall not constitute
         or be construed as a waiver thereof.

   18.   SBL shall have the right to decline  or modify  any  application  or to
         refund any variable product  consideration or any portion thereof,  and
         General  Agent shall refund  immediately  upon request any  commissions
         received  in  connection  therewith.   All  applications  for  variable
         products are subject to  acceptance  by SBL and become  effective  only
         upon confirmation by SBL. General Agent agrees to return to SBL without
         delay any  commissions  received  on a variable  product,  contract  or
         policy if such  contract or policy is tendered  for  redemption  within
         seven (7) business days after acceptance of the application by SBL.

   19.   Variable products, contracts and policies will be offered to the public
         at the price as outlined in the applicable  variable  product's current
         prospectus. All cash surrenders require the written request and consent
         of the contract or policyowner  and such surrenders will conform to the
         provisions set forth in the applicable contract or policy.

   20.   SBL  has  been  and is  designated  Administrative  Agent  of  Security
         Distributors,  Inc.  to perform  duties,  including  recordkeeping  and
         payment of  commissions,  necessary  under this Agreement in connection
         with  the  solicitation,   sales  and  servicing  of  variable  annuity
         contracts sold and solicited hereunder.

   21.   SBL  reserves  the right to amend or  terminate  this  agreement at any
         time.  In the  event  (i)  Broker/Dealer  ceases to be a member in good
         standing  of  the  NASD;  (ii)  General  Agent's  license  is  revoked,
         terminated  or not renewed;  or (iii)  General  Agent or  Broker/Dealer
         files or,  has filed on its  behalf a  petition  for  bankruptcy,  this
         Agreement  shall   terminate   automatically   without  notice.   After
         termination General Agent and Broker/Dealer upon request, shall without
         delay  pay in full  any  indebtedness  owed to SBL and  return  all SBL
         property  to  their  Home  Office.   In  the  event  General  Agent  or
         Broker/Dealer  are doing  business  in such manner  that  servicing  is
         impossible, SBL reserves the right to reassign the business and service
         fees to another party.  Should General Agent or  Broker/Dealer  fail to
         comply with any of the terms of this Agreement,  SBL reserves the right
         to terminate this Agreement and terminate vesting as to all commissions
         payable hereunder.

   22.   General  Agent and  Broker/Dealer  agree to hold harmless and indemnify
         SBL against any and all claims,  liabilities and expenses which SBL may
         incur from  liabilities  arising  out of or based  upon any  alleged or
         untrue  statement other than statements  contained in the  registration
         statement, prospectus or approved sales materials of any contract.

   23.   If it should  appear that any term of this contract is in conflict with
         any applicable rule of law, statute, or regulation,  then any such term
         shall be deemed  inoperative  and null and void insofar as it may be in
         conflict therewith and shall be deemed modified to conform to such rule
         of law,  statute,  or  regulation.  The  existence of any such apparent
         conflict  shall  not  invalidate  the  remaining   provisions  of  this
         contract.

    24.  This  agreement may be executed in one or more  counterparts,  together
         which shall be deemed a complete original.

   25.   This  Agreement is effective as of the  Effective  Date set forth above
         and  replaces any previous  Agreement  between the parties  relating to
         variable  products  of  SBL  except  as  to  any  commissions   payable
         thereunder.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be executed
as of the Effective Date set forth above.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public Reference Branch at 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549-0102 [tel. (202) 942-8090].
Applicants' Representations
1. Security Benefit is a Life insurance company organized under the laws of the State of Kansas. Security Benefit offers life insurance policies and annuity contracts, as well as financial and retirement services. It is authorized to conduct life insurance and annuity business in the District of Columbia and all states except New York. Together with its subsidiaries, Security Benefit has total funds under management of approximately $10.3 billion.
2. First Security Benefit is a stock life insurance company organized under the laws of the State of New York. First Security Benefit offers variable contracts in New York and is admitted to do business in that state. It is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Security Benefit.
3. Security Benefit established Variable Account XIV on June 26, 2000 pursuant to Kansas law. Variable Account XIV is registered with the Commission as a unit investment trust and is currently divided into 60 subaccounts (“Subaccounts”). Each Subaccounts invests exclusively in shares of a corresponding open-end management investment company (“Series”). Certain of the Series are managed by Security Management Company, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Security Benefit. Variable Account XIV funds the variable benefits available under the Contracts. Security Benefit has filed registration statements on Form N-4 under the 1940 Act and the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”) to register interests in Variable Account XIV under the Contracts. The Contracts are the Initial Contract (File No. 333-41180) and a New Contract (File No. 333-52114) (each a “Contract” and together, the “Contracts”).
4. SDI, a wholly owned subsidiary of Security Benefit, serves as the principal underwriter for the variable contracts issued by Security Benefit, including the Contracts. SDI is registered as a broker/dealer with the Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Security Benefit Group, Inc.,, a financial services holding company wholly owned by Security Benefit.
5. Security Benefit does not deduct a sales load from purchase payments. If a Contract holder withdraws Contract value, Security Benefit may deduct a contingent deferred sales charge (“withdrawal charge”). The withdrawal charge depends on how long a purchase payment has been held under a Contract. The withdrawal charge on a payment withdrawal during the first and second year is subject to a 7% withdrawal charge. The charge is 6% for payments withdrawn in the third year, 5% in year four, 4% in year five, 3% in year six and 2% in year seven. There is not withdrawal charge for payments that have been held under a Contract for seven complete years.
6. The withdrawal charge will be waived on withdrawals to the extent that total withdrawals in any 12-month period, measured from the Contract date, do not exceed the free withdrawal Start Printed Page 58536amount. The free withdrawal amount in the first Contract year is equal to 10% of Purchase Payments made during the year. In any subsequent Contract year, the free withdrawal amount is equal to 10% of Contract value as of the first day of that Contract year.
7. Security Benefit deducts a charge for mortality and expense risks assumed by Security Benefit under the Contracts. The mortality and expense risk charge is determined each month by reference to the amount of the Contract value as follows:
Contract valueInitial contract  (percent)New contract  (percent)Less than $25,000.851.10At least $25,000 but less than $100,000.70.95$100,000 or more.60.85
8. Security Benefit deducts a monthly charge for optional riders that may be elected by a Contract holder. The charge may not exceed 1% of Contract value for the Initial Contract and 2% for the New Contract.
9. Security Benefit also deducts a daily administration charge under the Contracts. The charge is equal to .15% annually for assets allocated to the Subaccounts under the Initial Contract. The daily charge under the New Contract differs by Subaccounts and ranges from an annual rate of .25% to .60%. In addition, a $30 administration charge is deducted under both Contracts on the Contract anniversary. Security Benefit also assesses a premium tax charge to reimburse itself or premium taxes that it incurs in connection with a Contract.
10. An optional Extra Credit Rider (the “Rider”) under the Contract makes available a credit enhancement (“Credit Enhancement”), which is an amount added to Contract value by Security Benefit. A Contract holder must purchase the Rider at issue. If purchased, a Credit Enhancement of 3%, 4% or 5% or purchase payments, as elected in the application, will be added to Contract value for each purchase payment made in the first Contract year. Any Credit Enhancement will be allocated among the Subaccounts in the same proportion as the purchase payment is allocated.
11. Security Benefit deducts a charge for the Rider for a period of seven years from a Contract's date of issue. After the end of seven years from a Contract's date of issue, Security Benefit will no longer assess a charge for the Rider and the Credit Enhancements will be fully vested. The charge for this Rider, which is equal to a percentage, on an annual basis, of Contract value, varies based upon the interest rate selected by the Contract holder as set forth below:
Interest rate  (percent)Rider charge  (percent)3.454.605.75
12. The Contracts permit Contract holders to cancel their Contracts and to receive a refund during the Free-Look Period. The Free-Look Period generally is a 10-day period beginning on the day a Contract holder receives his or her Contract. If a Contract holder returns a Contract during the Free-Look Period, the Contract will be canceled and treated as void from the Contract date.
13. In most instances, a Contract holder who returns a Contract during the Free-Look Period is entitled to a refund of his or her Contract value plus any charges deducted from such Contract value, as of the end of the business day on which the Contract is received for cancellation. A Contract holder will also receive a refund of any amounts that may have been deducted to pay for state premium taxes and/or other taxes. As is disclosed in the Contract prospectus, the value of any Credit Enhancement added to the Contract value will be deducted if the Contract holder returns the Contract during the Free-Look Period.
14. In the event of a full or partial withdrawal under a Contract with a Rider in force, Security Benefit will recapture all or part of any Credit Enhancement that has not yet vested. An amount equal to 1/7 of the Credit Enhancement will vest as of each anniversary of the Contract's date of issue and the Credit Enhancement will be fully vested at the end of seven years from that date. The amount to be forfeited in the event of a withdrawal is equal to a percentage of the Credit Enhancement that has not yet vested. The percentage is determined for each withdrawal as of the date of the withdrawal by dividing the amount of the withdrawal, including any withdrawal charges, by the Contract value immediately prior to the withdrawal.
15. The Contracts provide for a death benefit upon the death of the Contract holder prior to the annuity start date. The death benefit proceeds will be the death benefit reduced by any outstanding loan balance including loan interest, any pro rata account administration charge and any uncollected premium tax. If a Contract holder dies before the annuity start date, the amount of the death benefit generally will be the greater of: (a) The sum of all Purchase Payments (not including Credit Enhancement if an Extra Credit Rider was in effect), less any reductions caused by previous withdrawals, including withdrawal charges (“Purchase Payment Death Benefit”); or (b) the Contract value on the date due proof of death and instructions regarding payment are received by Security Benefit (less the amount of any Credit Enhancement applied during the 12 months prior to the date of the Contract holder's death if an Extra Credit Rider was in effect) (“Contract Value Death Benefit”). If a Contract holder dies prior to the annuity start date and due proof of death and instructions regarding payment are not received by Security Benefit at its home office within six months of the date of the Contract holder's death, the death benefit will be the Contract Value Death Benefit. If a Contract holder has purchased one of the following riders, the death benefit will be as determined under the terms of the applicable rider: (a) Annual Stepped Up Death Benefit; (b) Guaranteed Growth Death Benefit; (c) Combined Annual Stepped Up and Guaranteed Growth Death Benefit; and (d) Combined Guaranteed Growth Death Benefit and Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit. Each of those riders also excludes Credit Enhancements from any Purchase Payment Death Benefit and reduces the amount of any other death benefit by an amount equal to any Credit Enhancements applied during the 12 months prior to the date of the Contract holder's death.
16. Applicants seek exemptions pursuant to section 6(c) from sections 2(a)(32), 22(c), and 27(i)(2)(A) of the Act and rule 22c-1 thereunder to the extent necessary to permit the SBL Insurers with respect to the Contracts to: (a) deduct from any full or partial withdrawal a proportionate amount of any Credit Enhancement that has not yet vested; and (b) deduct from any death benefit, except the Purchase Payment Death Benefit, the amount of any Credit Enhancement applied during the 12 months prior to the date of the Contract holder's death. The requested exemptions would also apply to any Future Contract funded by the Separate Accounts or Future Accounts that recapture Credit Enhancements provided that any such Future Contract is substantially similar in all material respects to the Contracts.Start Printed Page 58537

Applicants' Legal Analysis
1. Subsection (i) of section 27 of the 1940 Act provides that section 27 does not apply to any registered separate account funding variable insurance contracts, or to the sponsoring insurance company and principal underwriter of such separate account, except as provided in paragraph (2) of that subsection. Paragraph (2) provides that it shall be unlawful for such a separate account or sponsoring insurance company to sell a contract funded by the registered separate account unless “(A) such contract is a redeemable security.”
2. Section 2(a)(32) of the 1940 Act defines “redeemable security” as any security, other than short-term paper, under the terms of which the holder, upon presentation to the issuer, is entitled to receive approximately his or her proportionate shares of the issuer's current net assets, or the cash equivalent thereof.
3. Applicants state that the amount paid in the event of a full or partial withdrawal excludes a proportionate amount of any Credit Enhancement conditionally applied to the Contract in the seven years prior to the date of the full or partial withdrawal. The amount of any death benefit that is based upon Contract value does not include the amount of any Credit Enhancement conditionally applied to the Contract in the 12 months prior to the date of the Contract holder's death. In each instance, the Contract holder arguably is not receiving his or her proportionate share of applicable Separate Account's then-current net assets. Applicants submit, however, that the recapture of the amount of any Credit Enhancement conditionally applied to the Contract during the seven-year period beginning on the date of issue of the Contract or the 12-month period prior to the date of the Contract holder's death would not deprive a Contract holder of his or her proportionate share of the issuer's current net assets. Until or unless the Credit Enhancement is vested, Security Benefit retains a right and interest in the Credit Enhancement. The prospectus clearly discloses that, for purposes of withdrawals, a Credit Enhancement will vest only at the end of the seven-year period beginning on the Contract's date of issue. The prospects also clearly discloses that, for purposes of the death benefit, a Credit Enhancement will vest only if it has been added to the Contract value of a Contract holder as of a date more than 12 months prior to the date of the Contract holder's death.
4. Applicants submit that annuity contracts, unlike life insurance contracts, are not intended to insure against the risk of the premature death of the insured. Instead, annuity contracts are intended to provide an income stream to the Contract holder or a named beneficiary, for the life of the annuitant or for a period of years. The risk to an insurer under an annuity contract typically is that the annuitant lives longer than the insurer's prediction.
5. According to the Applicants, if Credit Enhancements are applied unconditionally to the death benefit under an annuity contract before a minimum period of time has elapsed from the time that a Credit Enhancement has been credited, the insurer runs the risk of adverse selection. The insurer runs the risk that, for example, a terminally ill Contract holder will make a large purchase payment in order to leverage the amount of money he or she is able to transfer to the beneficiary. Applicants that requiring a year to elapse before a Credit Enhancement may be included in a death benefit is an appropriate means to ensure that the Contracts are not used as a risk-free vehicle for persons to leverage the amount of money they wish to transfer to a beneficiary.
6. Section 22(c) of the 1940 Act authorizes the Commission to make rules and regulations applicable to registered investment companies and to principal underwriters of, and dealers in, the redeemable securities of any registered investment company to accomplish the same purposes as contemplated by section 22(a). Rule 22c-1 thereunder prohibits a registered investment company issuing a redeemable security, a person designated in such issuer's prospectus as authorized to consummate transactions in such security, and a principal underwriter of, or dealer in, such security, from selling, redeeming, or repurchasing any such security except at a price based on the current net asset value of such security which is next computed after receipt of a tender of such security for redemption or of an order to purchase or sell such security.
7. Applicants state that Security Benefit's recapture of the Credit Enhancement with respect to the Contracts in instances in which: (a) A withdrawal is made and fewer than seven years have elapsed since the issue date of the Contract, or (b) a death benefit is paid, other than the Purchase Payment Death Benefit, and fewer than 12 months have elapsed between the time that the Credit Enhancement has been applied to the Contract, and the death of the Contract holder, might arguably be viewed as resulting in the redemption of redeemable securities for a price other than one based on the current net asset value of the applicable Subaccount of a Separate Account. In other words, because any such Credit Enhancement paid by Security Benefit is immediately added, on a conditional basis, to the Contract value of certain Contract holders, and further because these amounts are allocated to certain Subaccounts for the benefit of the participating Contract holder, the net asset value of each Subaccount arguably is affected by these credits.
8. Applicants content, however, that the recapture of the Credit Enhancement under the circumstances described in the application should not be deemed to be a violation of section 22(c) and rule 22c-1. To the extent that the recapture practices described in the application are considered to be technical violations of these provisions, Applicants request relief from Section 22(c) and rule 22c-1 in order to recapture Credit Enhancements as discussed above for the Contracts and Future Contracts to the extent that an SBL Insurer has provided Credit Enhancements to a Control holder within: (a) Seven years of a full or partial withdrawal; or (b) 12 months of the Contract holder's death before the Annuity Start Date where the death benefit is not a Purchase Payment Death Benefit.
9. Applicants assert that the recapture of the Credit Enhancement does not involve either of the practices that rule 22c-1 was intended to eliminate or reduce as far as reasonably practicable, namely: (a) The dilution of the value of outstanding redeemable securities of registered investment companies through their sale at a price below net asset value or their redemption or repurchase at a price above it, and (b) other unfair results, including speculative trading practices.
10. Applicants submit that the proposed recapture of the Credit Enhancement poses no threat of dilution. To effect a recapture of a Credit Enhancement, Security Benefit redeems (and the other SBL Insurer will redeem) interests in the Subaccounts at a price determined on the basis of the current accumulation unit value of each of the Subaccounts of the Separate Account in which the Contract holder's Contract value is allocated. The amount recaptured in the event of a full or partial withdrawal or death benefit, will be equal to the amount of the Credit Enhancement paid out of the General Account assets of Security Benefit. That amount will be redeemed at the current accumulation unit value of the applicable Subaccount(s) as of the date Start Printed Page 58538of receipt of the death claim, or withdrawal request, in proper order. Thus, no dilution will occur upon the recapture of a Credit Enhancement.
11. Applicants also submit that the second practice that rule 22c-1 was designed to address, namely, speculative trading practices calculated to take advantage of backward pricing, will not occur as a result of the recapture of the Credit Enhancement.
Conclusion
For the reasons summarized above, Applicants assert that the requested exemptions are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act.
