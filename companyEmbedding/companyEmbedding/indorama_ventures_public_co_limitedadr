Background of the business[edit]
Beginning of Business in Thailand[edit]
Entry into the PET business[edit]
Indorama Ventures commenced business operations in 1994 with the incorporation of Indorama Holdings Ltd., which was the first worsted wool yarn producer in Thailand.
The Group’s PET business segment comprises primarily the manufacture and sale of PET, a plastic polymer resin primarily used for beverage containers and food packaging, as well as for the packaging of pharmaceuticals and household products as well as in industrial packaging applications. Moreover, the Group also manufactures High Value Added (HVA) products such as packaging for oxygen-sensitive foods and beverages.
In 1995, IVL entered the petrochemical industry focusing on the polyester value chain business with the establishment of a PET resin facility in Thailand. Since then, each successive growth and addition has been committed to the polyester value chain. It has become a major global polyester value chain producer with a presence in three key business segments, PET resin, polyester fibers and Feedstock comprising PTA, MEG and various EO derivatives. The PET business has been achieved through greenfield investments, strategic acquisitions, and brownfield expansions.
From 1995 to 2002, PET business has grown after engaging in the downstream production of PET preforms, bottles and closures through a joint venture with Serm Suk Pcl, as well as through various expansion projects leading to increased capacities
Entry into the Fibers business[edit]
The Group’s fiber business segment comprises the manufacture and sale of a variety of polyester and other types of fibers and yarns (which are also used in the Group’s HVA products, particularly in personal care, automotive and industrial applications). Polyester is one of the most widely used synthetic fibers in the world and is a versatile material with wide-ranging textile and industrial applications. The development in the polyester business has been achieved through the acquisition of distressed assets and organic growth through debottlenecking and asset optimization. IVL entered into the polyester business in 1997 through the acquisition of Indo Poly, a polyester fiber plant in Thailand. In 2008, the company acquired Tuntex Thailand, the largest polyester fiber producer in Thailand. Both of the polyester facilities were acquired as distressed assets at a discount to their replacement cost and have been successfully turned around. In 2009, Indo Poly transferred all of its assets to, and all of its liabilities were assumed by Tuntex Thailand, which was subsequently re-named Indorama Polyester Industries.[6]
Background integration into Feedstock[edit]
The Group's feedstock business segment comprises the manufacture, production and sale of PTA, MEG, EO derivatives and by-products, which are raw materials used in the production of the Group's polyester products. The Group's feedstock business segment supports its PET and polyester business segments and forms part of its strategy to vertically integrate its operations.
Becoming global leader[edit]
Expansion of PET business in US and Europe[edit]
The PET production footprint internationally expanded into North America in 2003, with the acquisition of the StarPet facility, and into Europe in 2006, with the commencement of Orion Global PET facility. The expansion made us the only PET resin producer with operations in the three largest consuming regions of Asia, Europe and North America. The further expansion of manufacturing presence with the acquisition of two PET resin facilities from Eastman Chemical Company in Europe in 2008, and a Greenfield investment in the PET business with AlphaPet in North America in 2009. In the first half of 2011, IVL had completed major acquisitions of PET plants in China, Indonesia, Mexico, Poland and United States, leading the company to become the world’s largest PET producer and the largest player in Europe.[7] PET production footprint was expanded to Africa by implementing the new solid state polymerization SSP plant in Nigeria, which started commercial operations in 2012. In 2012, PT Polypet Karyapersada which is located at Cilegon, Indonesia, was acquired as IVL's PET production asset. In 2015, IVL has expanded its business into the Middle East following the acquisition of two PET plants in Turkey, one in the southern region and one in northern region of Turkey. In May 2015, the Group also acquired a stake in Bangkok Polyester Public Company Limited, a PET producer in Thailand which further consolidated PET production in the local market. Recently, IVL acquired PET business of Micro Polypet Private Limited (MicroPet) and its two subsidiaries Sanchit Polymers Private Limited and Eternity Infrabuild Private Limited in India.
Expansion of Polyester business[edit]
In the first half of 2011, polyester production footprint expanded internationally into Indonesia and USA. Later in November 2011, there was an acquisition of the PET and Polyester fibers recycling businesses of Wellman International in Europe, which consisted of three production facilities in the Republic of Ireland, the Netherlands, and France. In January 2012, IVL acquired 100% of FiberVisions Holdings LLC, a global manufacturer of specialty mono and bi-component fibers based in Duluth, Georgia, USA.
Backward Integration into MEG[edit]
In 2012, IVL took another step upward to feedstock integration by the acquisition of Old World Industries I, Ltd. and Old World Transportation, Ltd. in the USA, which is the largest single EO/EG production facility in the U.S. Mono Ethylene Glycol (MEG) is one of the company’s key feedstocks together with Purified Terephthalic Acid (PTA) in the manufacture of Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) and Polyester Fibers and Yarns, both downstream products of IVL. Recently, the acquisition from Compañía Española de Petróleos (CEPSA) which is PTA business in Canada and IVL also acquired 100% of Indorama Ventures Olefins Holding LLC, an old ethylene cracker in USA in September 2015 (under refurbishment).
Business Differentation[edit]
High Value Added (HVA) Segments[edit]
IVL has invested laterally into high value added products in PET, Polyester fibers and yarns, Polypropylene fibers and yarns, Nylon fibers and yarns and Purified Ethylene Oxide PEO. The expansion into HVA products has helped mitigate the weakness that the commodity sector has seen over the past two years allowing us to maintain healthy margins. The company has made significant headway on the HVA front as a market leader and innovator of numerous products. IVL's specialty range has enhanced the brand value of IVL making the company a total global solutions provider. In 2015, HVA portfolio represented 21% of production and 48% of consolidated core EBITDA. Core EBITDA is calculated as book EBITDA less inventory gains or losses less extraordinary items if any.
Recycling Business[edit]
In 2011, IVL acquired Wellman International in Europe. At the beginning of 2014, the company extended the know-how obtained from Wellman International and commenced production of the recycled PET and fiber facility in Nakhon Pathom, Thailand. IVL expected to further leverage on Wellman’s bottle to flake technology on a global scale. The company have also integrated three production sites in USA and Mexico with recycled PET and objective is to continue to increase the use of recycled PET in the operations.

Background of the business[edit]
Beginning of Business in Thailand[edit]
Entry into the PET business[edit]
Indorama Ventures commenced business operations in 1994 with the incorporation of Indorama Holdings Ltd., which was the first worsted wool yarn producer in Thailand.
The Group’s PET business segment comprises primarily the manufacture and sale of PET, a plastic polymer resin primarily used for beverage containers and food packaging, as well as for the packaging of pharmaceuticals and household products as well as in industrial packaging applications. Moreover, the Group also manufactures High Value Added (HVA) products such as packaging for oxygen-sensitive foods and beverages.
In 1995, IVL entered the petrochemical industry focusing on the polyester value chain business with the establishment of a PET resin facility in Thailand. Since then, each successive growth and addition has been committed to the polyester value chain. It has become a major global polyester value chain producer with a presence in three key business segments, PET resin, polyester fibers and Feedstock comprising PTA, MEG and various EO derivatives. The PET business has been achieved through greenfield investments, strategic acquisitions, and brownfield expansions.
From 1995 to 2002, PET business has grown after engaging in the downstream production of PET preforms, bottles and closures through a joint venture with Serm Suk Pcl, as well as through various expansion projects leading to increased capacities
Entry into the Fibers business[edit]
The Group’s fiber business segment comprises the manufacture and sale of a variety of polyester and other types of fibers and yarns (which are also used in the Group’s HVA products, particularly in personal care, automotive and industrial applications). Polyester is one of the most widely used synthetic fibers in the world and is a versatile material with wide-ranging textile and industrial applications. The development in the polyester business has been achieved through the acquisition of distressed assets and organic growth through debottlenecking and asset optimization. IVL entered into the polyester business in 1997 through the acquisition of Indo Poly, a polyester fiber plant in Thailand. In 2008, the company acquired Tuntex Thailand, the largest polyester fiber producer in Thailand. Both of the polyester facilities were acquired as distressed assets at a discount to their replacement cost and have been successfully turned around. In 2009, Indo Poly transferred all of its assets to, and all of its liabilities were assumed by Tuntex Thailand, which was subsequently re-named Indorama Polyester Industries.[6]
Background integration into Feedstock[edit]
The Group's feedstock business segment comprises the manufacture, production and sale of PTA, MEG, EO derivatives and by-products, which are raw materials used in the production of the Group's polyester products. The Group's feedstock business segment supports its PET and polyester business segments and forms part of its strategy to vertically integrate its operations.
Becoming global leader[edit]
Expansion of PET business in US and Europe[edit]
The PET production footprint internationally expanded into North America in 2003, with the acquisition of the StarPet facility, and into Europe in 2006, with the commencement of Orion Global PET facility. The expansion made us the only PET resin producer with operations in the three largest consuming regions of Asia, Europe and North America. The further expansion of manufacturing presence with the acquisition of two PET resin facilities from Eastman Chemical Company in Europe in 2008, and a Greenfield investment in the PET business with AlphaPet in North America in 2009. In the first half of 2011, IVL had completed major acquisitions of PET plants in China, Indonesia, Mexico, Poland and United States, leading the company to become the world’s largest PET producer and the largest player in Europe.[7] PET production footprint was expanded to Africa by implementing the new solid state polymerization SSP plant in Nigeria, which started commercial operations in 2012. In 2012, PT Polypet Karyapersada which is located at Cilegon, Indonesia, was acquired as IVL's PET production asset. In 2015, IVL has expanded its business into the Middle East following the acquisition of two PET plants in Turkey, one in the southern region and one in northern region of Turkey. In May 2015, the Group also acquired a stake in Bangkok Polyester Public Company Limited, a PET producer in Thailand which further consolidated PET production in the local market. Recently, IVL acquired PET business of Micro Polypet Private Limited (MicroPet) and its two subsidiaries Sanchit Polymers Private Limited and Eternity Infrabuild Private Limited in India.
Expansion of Polyester business[edit]
In the first half of 2011, polyester production footprint expanded internationally into Indonesia and USA. Later in November 2011, there was an acquisition of the PET and Polyester fibers recycling businesses of Wellman International in Europe, which consisted of three production facilities in the Republic of Ireland, the Netherlands, and France. In January 2012, IVL acquired 100% of FiberVisions Holdings LLC, a global manufacturer of specialty mono and bi-component fibers based in Duluth, Georgia, USA.
Backward Integration into MEG[edit]
In 2012, IVL took another step upward to feedstock integration by the acquisition of Old World Industries I, Ltd. and Old World Transportation, Ltd. in the USA, which is the largest single EO/EG production facility in the U.S. Mono Ethylene Glycol (MEG) is one of the company’s key feedstocks together with Purified Terephthalic Acid (PTA) in the manufacture of Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) and Polyester Fibers and Yarns, both downstream products of IVL. Recently, the acquisition from Compañía Española de Petróleos (CEPSA) which is PTA business in Canada and IVL also acquired 100% of Indorama Ventures Olefins Holding LLC, an old ethylene cracker in USA in September 2015 (under refurbishment).
Business Differentation[edit]
High Value Added (HVA) Segments[edit]
IVL has invested laterally into high value added products in PET, Polyester fibers and yarns, Polypropylene fibers and yarns, Nylon fibers and yarns and Purified Ethylene Oxide PEO. The expansion into HVA products has helped mitigate the weakness that the commodity sector has seen over the past two years allowing us to maintain healthy margins. The company has made significant headway on the HVA front as a market leader and innovator of numerous products. IVL's specialty range has enhanced the brand value of IVL making the company a total global solutions provider. In 2015, HVA portfolio represented 21% of production and 48% of consolidated core EBITDA. Core EBITDA is calculated as book EBITDA less inventory gains or losses less extraordinary items if any.
Recycling Business[edit]
In 2011, IVL acquired Wellman International in Europe. At the beginning of 2014, the company extended the know-how obtained from Wellman International and commenced production of the recycled PET and fiber facility in Nakhon Pathom, Thailand. IVL expected to further leverage on Wellman’s bottle to flake technology on a global scale. The company have also integrated three production sites in USA and Mexico with recycled PET and objective is to continue to increase the use of recycled PET in the operations.

Background of the business[edit]
Beginning of Business in Thailand[edit]
Entry into the PET business[edit]
Indorama Ventures commenced business operations in 1994 with the incorporation of Indorama Holdings Ltd., which was the first worsted wool yarn producer in Thailand.
The Group’s PET business segment comprises primarily the manufacture and sale of PET, a plastic polymer resin primarily used for beverage containers and food packaging, as well as for the packaging of pharmaceuticals and household products as well as in industrial packaging applications. Moreover, the Group also manufactures High Value Added (HVA) products such as packaging for oxygen-sensitive foods and beverages.
In 1995, IVL entered the petrochemical industry focusing on the polyester value chain business with the establishment of a PET resin facility in Thailand. Since then, each successive growth and addition has been committed to the polyester value chain. It has become a major global polyester value chain producer with a presence in three key business segments, PET resin, polyester fibers and Feedstock comprising PTA, MEG and various EO derivatives. The PET business has been achieved through greenfield investments, strategic acquisitions, and brownfield expansions.
From 1995 to 2002, PET business has grown after engaging in the downstream production of PET preforms, bottles and closures through a joint venture with Serm Suk Pcl, as well as through various expansion projects leading to increased capacities
Entry into the Fibers business[edit]
The Group’s fiber business segment comprises the manufacture and sale of a variety of polyester and other types of fibers and yarns (which are also used in the Group’s HVA products, particularly in personal care, automotive and industrial applications). Polyester is one of the most widely used synthetic fibers in the world and is a versatile material with wide-ranging textile and industrial applications. The development in the polyester business has been achieved through the acquisition of distressed assets and organic growth through debottlenecking and asset optimization. IVL entered into the polyester business in 1997 through the acquisition of Indo Poly, a polyester fiber plant in Thailand. In 2008, the company acquired Tuntex Thailand, the largest polyester fiber producer in Thailand. Both of the polyester facilities were acquired as distressed assets at a discount to their replacement cost and have been successfully turned around. In 2009, Indo Poly transferred all of its assets to, and all of its liabilities were assumed by Tuntex Thailand, which was subsequently re-named Indorama Polyester Industries.[6]
Background integration into Feedstock[edit]
The Group's feedstock business segment comprises the manufacture, production and sale of PTA, MEG, EO derivatives and by-products, which are raw materials used in the production of the Group's polyester products. The Group's feedstock business segment supports its PET and polyester business segments and forms part of its strategy to vertically integrate its operations.
Becoming global leader[edit]
Expansion of PET business in US and Europe[edit]
The PET production footprint internationally expanded into North America in 2003, with the acquisition of the StarPet facility, and into Europe in 2006, with the commencement of Orion Global PET facility. The expansion made us the only PET resin producer with operations in the three largest consuming regions of Asia, Europe and North America. The further expansion of manufacturing presence with the acquisition of two PET resin facilities from Eastman Chemical Company in Europe in 2008, and a Greenfield investment in the PET business with AlphaPet in North America in 2009. In the first half of 2011, IVL had completed major acquisitions of PET plants in China, Indonesia, Mexico, Poland and United States, leading the company to become the world’s largest PET producer and the largest player in Europe.[7] PET production footprint was expanded to Africa by implementing the new solid state polymerization SSP plant in Nigeria, which started commercial operations in 2012. In 2012, PT Polypet Karyapersada which is located at Cilegon, Indonesia, was acquired as IVL's PET production asset. In 2015, IVL has expanded its business into the Middle East following the acquisition of two PET plants in Turkey, one in the southern region and one in northern region of Turkey. In May 2015, the Group also acquired a stake in Bangkok Polyester Public Company Limited, a PET producer in Thailand which further consolidated PET production in the local market. Recently, IVL acquired PET business of Micro Polypet Private Limited (MicroPet) and its two subsidiaries Sanchit Polymers Private Limited and Eternity Infrabuild Private Limited in India.
Expansion of Polyester business[edit]
In the first half of 2011, polyester production footprint expanded internationally into Indonesia and USA. Later in November 2011, there was an acquisition of the PET and Polyester fibers recycling businesses of Wellman International in Europe, which consisted of three production facilities in the Republic of Ireland, the Netherlands, and France. In January 2012, IVL acquired 100% of FiberVisions Holdings LLC, a global manufacturer of specialty mono and bi-component fibers based in Duluth, Georgia, USA.
Backward Integration into MEG[edit]
In 2012, IVL took another step upward to feedstock integration by the acquisition of Old World Industries I, Ltd. and Old World Transportation, Ltd. in the USA, which is the largest single EO/EG production facility in the U.S. Mono Ethylene Glycol (MEG) is one of the company’s key feedstocks together with Purified Terephthalic Acid (PTA) in the manufacture of Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) and Polyester Fibers and Yarns, both downstream products of IVL. Recently, the acquisition from Compañía Española de Petróleos (CEPSA) which is PTA business in Canada and IVL also acquired 100% of Indorama Ventures Olefins Holding LLC, an old ethylene cracker in USA in September 2015 (under refurbishment).
Business Differentation[edit]
High Value Added (HVA) Segments[edit]
IVL has invested laterally into high value added products in PET, Polyester fibers and yarns, Polypropylene fibers and yarns, Nylon fibers and yarns and Purified Ethylene Oxide PEO. The expansion into HVA products has helped mitigate the weakness that the commodity sector has seen over the past two years allowing us to maintain healthy margins. The company has made significant headway on the HVA front as a market leader and innovator of numerous products. IVL's specialty range has enhanced the brand value of IVL making the company a total global solutions provider. In 2015, HVA portfolio represented 21% of production and 48% of consolidated core EBITDA. Core EBITDA is calculated as book EBITDA less inventory gains or losses less extraordinary items if any.
Recycling Business[edit]
In 2011, IVL acquired Wellman International in Europe. At the beginning of 2014, the company extended the know-how obtained from Wellman International and commenced production of the recycled PET and fiber facility in Nakhon Pathom, Thailand. IVL expected to further leverage on Wellman’s bottle to flake technology on a global scale. The company have also integrated three production sites in USA and Mexico with recycled PET and objective is to continue to increase the use of recycled PET in the operations.

Background of the business[edit]
Beginning of Business in Thailand[edit]
Entry into the PET business[edit]
Indorama Ventures commenced business operations in 1994 with the incorporation of Indorama Holdings Ltd., which was the first worsted wool yarn producer in Thailand.
The Group’s PET business segment comprises primarily the manufacture and sale of PET, a plastic polymer resin primarily used for beverage containers and food packaging, as well as for the packaging of pharmaceuticals and household products as well as in industrial packaging applications. Moreover, the Group also manufactures High Value Added (HVA) products such as packaging for oxygen-sensitive foods and beverages.
In 1995, IVL entered the petrochemical industry focusing on the polyester value chain business with the establishment of a PET resin facility in Thailand. Since then, each successive growth and addition has been committed to the polyester value chain. It has become a major global polyester value chain producer with a presence in three key business segments, PET resin, polyester fibers and Feedstock comprising PTA, MEG and various EO derivatives. The PET business has been achieved through greenfield investments, strategic acquisitions, and brownfield expansions.
From 1995 to 2002, PET business has grown after engaging in the downstream production of PET preforms, bottles and closures through a joint venture with Serm Suk Pcl, as well as through various expansion projects leading to increased capacities
Entry into the Fibers business[edit]
The Group’s fiber business segment comprises the manufacture and sale of a variety of polyester and other types of fibers and yarns (which are also used in the Group’s HVA products, particularly in personal care, automotive and industrial applications). Polyester is one of the most widely used synthetic fibers in the world and is a versatile material with wide-ranging textile and industrial applications. The development in the polyester business has been achieved through the acquisition of distressed assets and organic growth through debottlenecking and asset optimization. IVL entered into the polyester business in 1997 through the acquisition of Indo Poly, a polyester fiber plant in Thailand. In 2008, the company acquired Tuntex Thailand, the largest polyester fiber producer in Thailand. Both of the polyester facilities were acquired as distressed assets at a discount to their replacement cost and have been successfully turned around. In 2009, Indo Poly transferred all of its assets to, and all of its liabilities were assumed by Tuntex Thailand, which was subsequently re-named Indorama Polyester Industries.[6]
Background integration into Feedstock[edit]
The Group's feedstock business segment comprises the manufacture, production and sale of PTA, MEG, EO derivatives and by-products, which are raw materials used in the production of the Group's polyester products. The Group's feedstock business segment supports its PET and polyester business segments and forms part of its strategy to vertically integrate its operations.
Becoming global leader[edit]
Expansion of PET business in US and Europe[edit]
The PET production footprint internationally expanded into North America in 2003, with the acquisition of the StarPet facility, and into Europe in 2006, with the commencement of Orion Global PET facility. The expansion made us the only PET resin producer with operations in the three largest consuming regions of Asia, Europe and North America. The further expansion of manufacturing presence with the acquisition of two PET resin facilities from Eastman Chemical Company in Europe in 2008, and a Greenfield investment in the PET business with AlphaPet in North America in 2009. In the first half of 2011, IVL had completed major acquisitions of PET plants in China, Indonesia, Mexico, Poland and United States, leading the company to become the world’s largest PET producer and the largest player in Europe.[7] PET production footprint was expanded to Africa by implementing the new solid state polymerization SSP plant in Nigeria, which started commercial operations in 2012. In 2012, PT Polypet Karyapersada which is located at Cilegon, Indonesia, was acquired as IVL's PET production asset. In 2015, IVL has expanded its business into the Middle East following the acquisition of two PET plants in Turkey, one in the southern region and one in northern region of Turkey. In May 2015, the Group also acquired a stake in Bangkok Polyester Public Company Limited, a PET producer in Thailand which further consolidated PET production in the local market. Recently, IVL acquired PET business of Micro Polypet Private Limited (MicroPet) and its two subsidiaries Sanchit Polymers Private Limited and Eternity Infrabuild Private Limited in India.
Expansion of Polyester business[edit]
In the first half of 2011, polyester production footprint expanded internationally into Indonesia and USA. Later in November 2011, there was an acquisition of the PET and Polyester fibers recycling businesses of Wellman International in Europe, which consisted of three production facilities in the Republic of Ireland, the Netherlands, and France. In January 2012, IVL acquired 100% of FiberVisions Holdings LLC, a global manufacturer of specialty mono and bi-component fibers based in Duluth, Georgia, USA.
Backward Integration into MEG[edit]
In 2012, IVL took another step upward to feedstock integration by the acquisition of Old World Industries I, Ltd. and Old World Transportation, Ltd. in the USA, which is the largest single EO/EG production facility in the U.S. Mono Ethylene Glycol (MEG) is one of the company’s key feedstocks together with Purified Terephthalic Acid (PTA) in the manufacture of Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) and Polyester Fibers and Yarns, both downstream products of IVL. Recently, the acquisition from Compañía Española de Petróleos (CEPSA) which is PTA business in Canada and IVL also acquired 100% of Indorama Ventures Olefins Holding LLC, an old ethylene cracker in USA in September 2015 (under refurbishment).
Business Differentation[edit]
High Value Added (HVA) Segments[edit]
IVL has invested laterally into high value added products in PET, Polyester fibers and yarns, Polypropylene fibers and yarns, Nylon fibers and yarns and Purified Ethylene Oxide PEO. The expansion into HVA products has helped mitigate the weakness that the commodity sector has seen over the past two years allowing us to maintain healthy margins. The company has made significant headway on the HVA front as a market leader and innovator of numerous products. IVL's specialty range has enhanced the brand value of IVL making the company a total global solutions provider. In 2015, HVA portfolio represented 21% of production and 48% of consolidated core EBITDA. Core EBITDA is calculated as book EBITDA less inventory gains or losses less extraordinary items if any.
Recycling Business[edit]
In 2011, IVL acquired Wellman International in Europe. At the beginning of 2014, the company extended the know-how obtained from Wellman International and commenced production of the recycled PET and fiber facility in Nakhon Pathom, Thailand. IVL expected to further leverage on Wellman’s bottle to flake technology on a global scale. The company have also integrated three production sites in USA and Mexico with recycled PET and objective is to continue to increase the use of recycled PET in the operations.

Background of the business[edit]
Beginning of Business in Thailand[edit]
Entry into the PET business[edit]
Indorama Ventures commenced business operations in 1994 with the incorporation of Indorama Holdings Ltd., which was the first worsted wool yarn producer in Thailand.
The Group’s PET business segment comprises primarily the manufacture and sale of PET, a plastic polymer resin primarily used for beverage containers and food packaging, as well as for the packaging of pharmaceuticals and household products as well as in industrial packaging applications. Moreover, the Group also manufactures High Value Added (HVA) products such as packaging for oxygen-sensitive foods and beverages.
In 1995, IVL entered the petrochemical industry focusing on the polyester value chain business with the establishment of a PET resin facility in Thailand. Since then, each successive growth and addition has been committed to the polyester value chain. It has become a major global polyester value chain producer with a presence in three key business segments, PET resin, polyester fibers and Feedstock comprising PTA, MEG and various EO derivatives. The PET business has been achieved through greenfield investments, strategic acquisitions, and brownfield expansions.
From 1995 to 2002, PET business has grown after engaging in the downstream production of PET preforms, bottles and closures through a joint venture with Serm Suk Pcl, as well as through various expansion projects leading to increased capacities
Entry into the Fibers business[edit]
The Group’s fiber business segment comprises the manufacture and sale of a variety of polyester and other types of fibers and yarns (which are also used in the Group’s HVA products, particularly in personal care, automotive and industrial applications). Polyester is one of the most widely used synthetic fibers in the world and is a versatile material with wide-ranging textile and industrial applications. The development in the polyester business has been achieved through the acquisition of distressed assets and organic growth through debottlenecking and asset optimization. IVL entered into the polyester business in 1997 through the acquisition of Indo Poly, a polyester fiber plant in Thailand. In 2008, the company acquired Tuntex Thailand, the largest polyester fiber producer in Thailand. Both of the polyester facilities were acquired as distressed assets at a discount to their replacement cost and have been successfully turned around. In 2009, Indo Poly transferred all of its assets to, and all of its liabilities were assumed by Tuntex Thailand, which was subsequently re-named Indorama Polyester Industries.[6]
Background integration into Feedstock[edit]
The Group's feedstock business segment comprises the manufacture, production and sale of PTA, MEG, EO derivatives and by-products, which are raw materials used in the production of the Group's polyester products. The Group's feedstock business segment supports its PET and polyester business segments and forms part of its strategy to vertically integrate its operations.
Becoming global leader[edit]
Expansion of PET business in US and Europe[edit]
The PET production footprint internationally expanded into North America in 2003, with the acquisition of the StarPet facility, and into Europe in 2006, with the commencement of Orion Global PET facility. The expansion made us the only PET resin producer with operations in the three largest consuming regions of Asia, Europe and North America. The further expansion of manufacturing presence with the acquisition of two PET resin facilities from Eastman Chemical Company in Europe in 2008, and a Greenfield investment in the PET business with AlphaPet in North America in 2009. In the first half of 2011, IVL had completed major acquisitions of PET plants in China, Indonesia, Mexico, Poland and United States, leading the company to become the world’s largest PET producer and the largest player in Europe.[7] PET production footprint was expanded to Africa by implementing the new solid state polymerization SSP plant in Nigeria, which started commercial operations in 2012. In 2012, PT Polypet Karyapersada which is located at Cilegon, Indonesia, was acquired as IVL's PET production asset. In 2015, IVL has expanded its business into the Middle East following the acquisition of two PET plants in Turkey, one in the southern region and one in northern region of Turkey. In May 2015, the Group also acquired a stake in Bangkok Polyester Public Company Limited, a PET producer in Thailand which further consolidated PET production in the local market. Recently, IVL acquired PET business of Micro Polypet Private Limited (MicroPet) and its two subsidiaries Sanchit Polymers Private Limited and Eternity Infrabuild Private Limited in India.
Expansion of Polyester business[edit]
In the first half of 2011, polyester production footprint expanded internationally into Indonesia and USA. Later in November 2011, there was an acquisition of the PET and Polyester fibers recycling businesses of Wellman International in Europe, which consisted of three production facilities in the Republic of Ireland, the Netherlands, and France. In January 2012, IVL acquired 100% of FiberVisions Holdings LLC, a global manufacturer of specialty mono and bi-component fibers based in Duluth, Georgia, USA.
Backward Integration into MEG[edit]
In 2012, IVL took another step upward to feedstock integration by the acquisition of Old World Industries I, Ltd. and Old World Transportation, Ltd. in the USA, which is the largest single EO/EG production facility in the U.S. Mono Ethylene Glycol (MEG) is one of the company’s key feedstocks together with Purified Terephthalic Acid (PTA) in the manufacture of Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) and Polyester Fibers and Yarns, both downstream products of IVL. Recently, the acquisition from Compañía Española de Petróleos (CEPSA) which is PTA business in Canada and IVL also acquired 100% of Indorama Ventures Olefins Holding LLC, an old ethylene cracker in USA in September 2015 (under refurbishment).
Business Differentation[edit]
High Value Added (HVA) Segments[edit]
IVL has invested laterally into high value added products in PET, Polyester fibers and yarns, Polypropylene fibers and yarns, Nylon fibers and yarns and Purified Ethylene Oxide PEO. The expansion into HVA products has helped mitigate the weakness that the commodity sector has seen over the past two years allowing us to maintain healthy margins. The company has made significant headway on the HVA front as a market leader and innovator of numerous products. IVL's specialty range has enhanced the brand value of IVL making the company a total global solutions provider. In 2015, HVA portfolio represented 21% of production and 48% of consolidated core EBITDA. Core EBITDA is calculated as book EBITDA less inventory gains or losses less extraordinary items if any.
Recycling Business[edit]
In 2011, IVL acquired Wellman International in Europe. At the beginning of 2014, the company extended the know-how obtained from Wellman International and commenced production of the recycled PET and fiber facility in Nakhon Pathom, Thailand. IVL expected to further leverage on Wellman’s bottle to flake technology on a global scale. The company have also integrated three production sites in USA and Mexico with recycled PET and objective is to continue to increase the use of recycled PET in the operations.

The expansion into HVA products has helped mitigate the weakness that the commodity sector has seen over the past two years allowing us to maintain healthy margins. The company has made significant headway on the HVA front as a market leader and innovator of numerous products. IVL's specialty range has enhanced the brand value of IVL making the company a total global solutions provider. In 2015, HVA portfolio represented 21% of production and 48% of consolidated core EBITDA. Core EBITDA is calculated as book EBITDA less inventory gains or losses less extraordinary items if any.
Recycling Business[edit]

Background of the business[edit]
Beginning of Business in Thailand[edit]
Entry into the PET business[edit]
Indorama Ventures commenced business operations in 1994 with the incorporation of Indorama Holdings Ltd., which was the first worsted wool yarn producer in Thailand.
The Group’s PET business segment comprises primarily the manufacture and sale of PET, a plastic polymer resin primarily used for beverage containers and food packaging, as well as for the packaging of pharmaceuticals and household products as well as in industrial packaging applications. Moreover, the Group also manufactures High Value Added (HVA) products such as packaging for oxygen-sensitive foods and beverages.
In 1995, IVL entered the petrochemical industry focusing on the polyester value chain business with the establishment of a PET resin facility in Thailand. Since then, each successive growth and addition has been committed to the polyester value chain. It has become a major global polyester value chain producer with a presence in three key business segments, PET resin, polyester fibers and Feedstock comprising PTA, MEG and various EO derivatives. The PET business has been achieved through greenfield investments, strategic acquisitions, and brownfield expansions.
From 1995 to 2002, PET business has grown after engaging in the downstream production of PET preforms, bottles and closures through a joint venture with Serm Suk Pcl, as well as through various expansion projects leading to increased capacities
Entry into the Fibers business[edit]
The Group’s fiber business segment comprises the manufacture and sale of a variety of polyester and other types of fibers and yarns (which are also used in the Group’s HVA products, particularly in personal care, automotive and industrial applications). Polyester is one of the most widely used synthetic fibers in the world and is a versatile material with wide-ranging textile and industrial applications. The development in the polyester business has been achieved through the acquisition of distressed assets and organic growth through debottlenecking and asset optimization. IVL entered into the polyester business in 1997 through the acquisition of Indo Poly, a polyester fiber plant in Thailand. In 2008, the company acquired Tuntex Thailand, the largest polyester fiber producer in Thailand. Both of the polyester facilities were acquired as distressed assets at a discount to their replacement cost and have been successfully turned around. In 2009, Indo Poly transferred all of its assets to, and all of its liabilities were assumed by Tuntex Thailand, which was subsequently re-named Indorama Polyester Industries.[6]
Background integration into Feedstock[edit]
The Group's feedstock business segment comprises the manufacture, production and sale of PTA, MEG, EO derivatives and by-products, which are raw materials used in the production of the Group's polyester products. The Group's feedstock business segment supports its PET and polyester business segments and forms part of its strategy to vertically integrate its operations.
Becoming global leader[edit]
Expansion of PET business in US and Europe[edit]
The PET production footprint internationally expanded into North America in 2003, with the acquisition of the StarPet facility, and into Europe in 2006, with the commencement of Orion Global PET facility. The expansion made us the only PET resin producer with operations in the three largest consuming regions of Asia, Europe and North America. The further expansion of manufacturing presence with the acquisition of two PET resin facilities from Eastman Chemical Company in Europe in 2008, and a Greenfield investment in the PET business with AlphaPet in North America in 2009. In the first half of 2011, IVL had completed major acquisitions of PET plants in China, Indonesia, Mexico, Poland and United States, leading the company to become the world’s largest PET producer and the largest player in Europe.[7] PET production footprint was expanded to Africa by implementing the new solid state polymerization SSP plant in Nigeria, which started commercial operations in 2012. In 2012, PT Polypet Karyapersada which is located at Cilegon, Indonesia, was acquired as IVL's PET production asset. In 2015, IVL has expanded its business into the Middle East following the acquisition of two PET plants in Turkey, one in the southern region and one in northern region of Turkey. In May 2015, the Group also acquired a stake in Bangkok Polyester Public Company Limited, a PET producer in Thailand which further consolidated PET production in the local market. Recently, IVL acquired PET business of Micro Polypet Private Limited (MicroPet) and its two subsidiaries Sanchit Polymers Private Limited and Eternity Infrabuild Private Limited in India.
Expansion of Polyester business[edit]
In the first half of 2011, polyester production footprint expanded internationally into Indonesia and USA. Later in November 2011, there was an acquisition of the PET and Polyester fibers recycling businesses of Wellman International in Europe, which consisted of three production facilities in the Republic of Ireland, the Netherlands, and France. In January 2012, IVL acquired 100% of FiberVisions Holdings LLC, a global manufacturer of specialty mono and bi-component fibers based in Duluth, Georgia, USA.
Backward Integration into MEG[edit]
In 2012, IVL took another step upward to feedstock integration by the acquisition of Old World Industries I, Ltd. and Old World Transportation, Ltd. in the USA, which is the largest single EO/EG production facility in the U.S. Mono Ethylene Glycol (MEG) is one of the company’s key feedstocks together with Purified Terephthalic Acid (PTA) in the manufacture of Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) and Polyester Fibers and Yarns, both downstream products of IVL. Recently, the acquisition from Compañía Española de Petróleos (CEPSA) which is PTA business in Canada and IVL also acquired 100% of Indorama Ventures Olefins Holding LLC, an old ethylene cracker in USA in September 2015 (under refurbishment).
Business Differentation[edit]
High Value Added (HVA) Segments[edit]

The expansion into HVA products has helped mitigate the weakness that the commodity sector has seen over the past two years allowing us to maintain healthy margins. The company has made significant headway on the HVA front as a market leader and innovator of numerous products.

Background of the business[edit]
Beginning of Business in Thailand[edit]
Entry into the PET business[edit]
Indorama Ventures commenced business operations in 1994 with the incorporation of Indorama Holdings Ltd., which was the first worsted wool yarn producer in Thailand.
The Group’s PET business segment comprises primarily the manufacture and sale of PET, a plastic polymer resin primarily used for beverage containers and food packaging, as well as for the packaging of pharmaceuticals and household products as well as in industrial packaging applications. Moreover, the Group also manufactures High Value Added (HVA) products such as packaging for oxygen-sensitive foods and beverages.
In 1995, IVL entered the petrochemical industry focusing on the polyester value chain business with the establishment of a PET resin facility in Thailand. Since then, each successive growth and addition has been committed to the polyester value chain. It has become a major global polyester value chain producer with a presence in three key business segments, PET resin, polyester fibers and Feedstock comprising PTA, MEG and various EO derivatives. The PET business has been achieved through greenfield investments, strategic acquisitions, and brownfield expansions.
From 1995 to 2002, PET business has grown after engaging in the downstream production of PET preforms, bottles and closures through a joint venture with Serm Suk Pcl, as well as through various expansion projects leading to increased capacities
Entry into the Fibers business[edit]
The Group’s fiber business segment comprises the manufacture and sale of a variety of polyester and other types of fibers and yarns (which are also used in the Group’s HVA products, particularly in personal care, automotive and industrial applications). Polyester is one of the most widely used synthetic fibers in the world and is a versatile material with wide-ranging textile and industrial applications. The development in the polyester business has been achieved through the acquisition of distressed assets and organic growth through debottlenecking and asset optimization. IVL entered into the polyester business in 1997 through the acquisition of Indo Poly, a polyester fiber plant in Thailand. In 2008, the company acquired Tuntex Thailand, the largest polyester fiber producer in Thailand. Both of the polyester facilities were acquired as distressed assets at a discount to their replacement cost and have been successfully turned around. In 2009, Indo Poly transferred all of its assets to, and all of its liabilities were assumed by Tuntex Thailand, which was subsequently re-named Indorama Polyester Industries.[6]
Background integration into Feedstock[edit]
The Group's feedstock business segment comprises the manufacture, production and sale of PTA, MEG, EO derivatives and by-products, which are raw materials used in the production of the Group's polyester products. The Group's feedstock business segment supports its PET and polyester business segments and forms part of its strategy to vertically integrate its operations.
Becoming global leader[edit]
Expansion of PET business in US and Europe[edit]
The PET production footprint internationally expanded into North America in 2003, with the acquisition of the StarPet facility, and into Europe in 2006, with the commencement of Orion Global PET facility. The expansion made us the only PET resin producer with operations in the three largest consuming regions of Asia, Europe and North America. The further expansion of manufacturing presence with the acquisition of two PET resin facilities from Eastman Chemical Company in Europe in 2008, and a Greenfield investment in the PET business with AlphaPet in North America in 2009. In the first half of 2011, IVL had completed major acquisitions of PET plants in China, Indonesia, Mexico, Poland and United States, leading the company to become the world’s largest PET producer and the largest player in Europe.[7] PET production footprint was expanded to Africa by implementing the new solid state polymerization SSP plant in Nigeria, which started commercial operations in 2012. In 2012, PT Polypet Karyapersada which is located at Cilegon, Indonesia, was acquired as IVL's PET production asset. In 2015, IVL has expanded its business into the Middle East following the acquisition of two PET plants in Turkey, one in the southern region and one in northern region of Turkey. In May 2015, the Group also acquired a stake in Bangkok Polyester Public Company Limited, a PET producer in Thailand which further consolidated PET production in the local market. Recently, IVL acquired PET business of Micro Polypet Private Limited (MicroPet) and its two subsidiaries Sanchit Polymers Private Limited and Eternity Infrabuild Private Limited in India.
Expansion of Polyester business[edit]
In the first half of 2011, polyester production footprint expanded internationally into Indonesia and USA. Later in November 2011, there was an acquisition of the PET and Polyester fibers recycling businesses of Wellman International in Europe, which consisted of three production facilities in the Republic of Ireland, the Netherlands, and France. In January 2012, IVL acquired 100% of FiberVisions Holdings LLC, a global manufacturer of specialty mono and bi-component fibers based in Duluth, Georgia, USA.
Backward Integration into MEG[edit]
In 2012, IVL took another step upward to feedstock integration by the acquisition of Old World Industries I, Ltd. and Old World Transportation, Ltd. in the USA, which is the largest single EO/EG production facility in the U.S. Mono Ethylene Glycol (MEG) is one of the company’s key feedstocks together with Purified Terephthalic Acid (PTA) in the manufacture of Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) and Polyester Fibers and Yarns, both downstream products of IVL. Recently, the acquisition from Compañía Española de Petróleos (CEPSA) which is PTA business in Canada and IVL also acquired 100% of Indorama Ventures Olefins Holding LLC, an old ethylene cracker in USA in September 2015 (under refurbishment).
Business Differentation[edit]
High Value Added (HVA) Segments[edit]
IVL has invested laterally into high value added products in PET, Polyester fibers and yarns, Polypropylene fibers and yarns, Nylon fibers and yarns and Purified Ethylene Oxide PEO. The expansion into HVA products has helped mitigate the weakness that the commodity sector has seen over the past two years allowing us to maintain healthy margins. The company has made significant headway on the HVA front as a market leader and innovator of numerous products. IVL's specialty range has enhanced the brand value of IVL making the company a total global solutions provider. In 2015, HVA portfolio represented 21% of production and 48% of consolidated core EBITDA. Core EBITDA is calculated as book EBITDA less inventory gains or losses less extraordinary items if any.
Recycling Business[edit]
In 2011, IVL acquired Wellman International in Europe. At the beginning of 2014, the company extended the know-how obtained from Wellman International and commenced production of the recycled PET and fiber facility in Nakhon Pathom, Thailand. IVL expected to further leverage on Wellman’s bottle to flake technology on a global scale. The company have also integrated three production sites in USA and Mexico with recycled PET and objective is to continue to increase the use of recycled PET in the operations.

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

The Acting President, Yemi Osinbajo, has presented a certificate for the Formal Release Ceremony to discharge Indorama Eleme Petrochemicals Limited (IEPL) from the mandatory five-year Monitoring Programme of the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE).
Presenting the certificate to Indorama at the company's premises in Eleme, Prof. Osinbajo said 75 per cent of Eleme Petrochemical Limited's equity was sold to Indorama for $225m while 10 per cent was sold to the NNPC Pension Fund for $30m.
He said following the transaction, the company was handed over to its new owners on October 26, 2006.
"Today is the culmination of that process of monitoring and oversight by the BPE. I am delighted that it is taking place on an inspiring and hopeful note, and that we are all here today celebrating a thriving and promising company," he said.
He noted that the Fertiliser Initiative of the present administration had created significant economic opportunities for companies like Indorama, stressing that he had been informed that Indorama would in 2017 supply about 360,000 metric tonnes of urea to fertiliser blenders.
"This is the kind of economic progress we are after, in which every unlocked opportunity proceeds to unlock several others across multiple sectors of the economy," he said.
He said the Federal Government would continue to support Indorama's expansion ambition.
Earlier, the Chairman of Indorama Fertiliser Chemical Ltd, Siri Prakash Lohia, said the plant was the largest angle train urea in the world with a capacity of 1.4 million tonnes per year.
He said with a total of $1.4bn in the plant, pipelines and export terminal, the fertiliser company was one of the largest investments done in the non-oil and gas sector.
Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, said the state government had an investment interest in the company, saying that it would continue to support it.Copyright Daily Trust.
