Cardinal Group managing student housing


			Posted by John Rebchook

Inn at Auraria is now being managed by the Cardinal Group.
Cardinal Group Management & Advisory LLC, a Denver-based owner and operator of student housing, effective July 1, took over property and asset management of the Inn at Auraria in downtown Denver, the company announced today.
The Inn at Auraria – with 125 units and 439 beds – shares its building with the Curtis Hotel at 1051 14th Street, occupying the top 14 floors. The Inn is owned by the Auraria Foundation and was completely renovated in 2006 using bond financing in an effort to add more dedicated housing for students attending the University of Colorado-Denver, Metropolitan State College of Denver and the Colorado Community College of Denver. The property’s redesign successfully converted the space into one of Denver’s only modern, high-rise student residence communities.
After several years of successful operation, the bonds fell into default and were recently purchase by Fundamental Advisors LP, a private equity firm in New York City.
Opportunities seen
“We are very excited to be entering into this partnership with the Auraria Foundation,” said Eric Frank, a principal at Cardinal Group Management & Advisory. “As enrollment increases at the Auraria Campus, so too will the demand for safe student housing in the core of downtown Denver. We believe there are many opportunities to improve the living experience at the Inn and make it the go-to property for students.”
Cardinal Group is exploring the possibility of adding an amenity suite at the property as well as improving other management functions.
“We feel like there are many possibilities surrounding the property that could lead to increased performance,” Frank said.
Cardinal Group Management & Advisory is a Denver-based owner and operator of student housing and urban multifamily properties. The company owns and manages 20 student housing properties consisting of nearly 1,900 beds and was the ninth largest buyer of student housing nationally in 2010.

Cardinal Group Purchases Texas Multifamily Community for $11M





























Cardinal Group Purchases Texas Multifamily Community for $11M

Austin, Texas—Denver-based Cardinal Group Investments LLC has teamed with New York City-based Fundamental Advisors LP on the $11 million acquisition of Century Square—an apartment community in the Hyde Park neighborhood of Austin, Texas, which was purchased from Roscoe Properties.
“We love the Austin market and the Hyde Park/North Campus neighborhood in particular,” Jason Luker, Cardinal’s managing principal, tells MHN. “This neighborhood is a great mix of students and young professionals and fits perfectly into our Mint Urban brand. In addition, the community has a very attractive mix of floor plans.”
Located at 3401 Red River St., just two blocks north of the University of Texas campus, Century Square consists of 138 units and an attached parking garage and includes studio, one- and two-bedroom units.
“We are really focused on two strategies: student housing and urban infill. This asset represents the perfect mix between the two,” Luker says. “We are also focused on value-add opportunities where we can apply our unique approach to design, construction, marketing and management.”
It is the second multifamily property in Austin that Cardinal purchased in the last year, joining the University Towers private dormitory in the West Campus neighborhood.
“We are very bullish on Austin, and this represents our second acquisition in the city in the last 10 months,” Luker says. “We are actively looking for value-add apartment opportunities in core urban neighborhoods.”
Plans for the new purchase include making capital improvements to the property aimed at improving the unit interior and amenity quality, and Cardinal will rebrand the property and install a new management team.
Cardinal will rebrand the property under its urban multifamily platform, Mint Urban, which focuses on creating a unique property offering that caters to working professionals who are looking for a cool, chic living experience in vibrant urban neighborhoods.
“The Hyde Park/North Campus neighborhood is one of the most highly sought after areas in Austin. The neighborhood consists mostly of renovated single-family homes and older apartment buildings with few amenities,” Luker says. “The average price of a single-family home is significantly higher than the rest of the city, and Century Square offers one of the few renovated and fully amenitized apartment properties in the area.”
CGI’s affiliated property management company, Cardinal Group Management, will manage the operations.
Cardinal Group is an experienced multifamily owner and operator with 25 properties in seven states totaling more than 1,900 units. The purchase was the fifth partnership between Cardinal Group and Fundamental Advisors.

About US




We get the student experience because student housing is
all we do.






American Campus Communities (ACC) is the nation’s largest developer, owner and manager of high-quality student housing communities.
Whether we’re creating a new development, upgrading an acquired community, or partnering with a university to develop or manage on-campus housing, our goal is the same: deliver the best possible experience for students – at every price point.
And it’s not just about great living spaces and great amenities. It’s about giving students the resources and environment they need to succeed, both academically and personally.



 





Our passion for student success is grounded in our experience.




ACC was co-founded by Bill Bayless, who began his career as a Resident Assistant and turned his dedication to student success into the company he runs today. Twenty-five members of ACC’s senior corporate staff began their careers as Resident Assistants, and most of the management staff first joined ACC as students working at ACC communities.
By blending our grassroots expertise with a fierce commitment to quality, we bring unparalleled service and value to students, parents and universities, while consistently outperforming our peers in the student housing industry.



Loving What We Do




Throughout their collective careers, our senior staff has been involved in the development, acquisition or management of more than 350 student housing communities consisting of more than 222,000 beds.

Cardinal Group Management & Advisory LLC, a Denver-based owner and operator of student housing, effective July 1, took over property and asset management of the Inn at Auraria in downtown Denver, the company announced today.
The Inn at Auraria – with 125 units and 439 beds – shares its building with the Curtis Hotel at 1051 14th Street, occupying the top 14 floors. The Inn is owned by the Auraria Foundation and was completely renovated in 2006 using bond financing in an effort to add more dedicated housing for students attending the University of Colorado-Denver, Metropolitan State College of Denver and the Colorado Community College of Denver. The property’s redesign successfully converted the space into one of Denver’s only modern, high-rise student residence communities.
After several years of successful operation, the bonds fell into default and were recently purchase by Fundamental Advisors LP, a private equity firm in New York City.
Opportunities seen
“We are very excited to be entering into this partnership with the Auraria Foundation,” said Eric Frank, a principal at Cardinal Group Management & Advisory. “As enrollment increases at the Auraria Campus, so too will the demand for safe student housing in the core of downtown Denver. We believe there are many opportunities to improve the living experience at the Inn and make it the go-to property for students.”
Cardinal Group is exploring the possibility of adding an amenity suite at the property as well as improving other management functions.
“We feel like there are many possibilities surrounding the property that could lead to increased performance,” Frank said.
Cardinal Group Management & Advisory is a Denver-based owner and operator of student housing and urban multifamily properties. The company owns and manages 20 student housing properties consisting of nearly 1,900 beds and was the ninth largest buyer of student housing nationally in 2010.

                    welcome
                    

 


 





Founded in 1958, Cardinal Manufacturing 
						Company is a family-owned and operated  
						custom roll forming company dedicated to 
						delivering high quality parts at competitive costs.   
						Cardinal specializes in producing roll-formed parts made 
						to customers' design and specifications, while offering 
						our customers the highest customer service throughout 
						the process. 
						

What is roll forming?

Roll 
                    forming 
                    is a progressive metal fabrication process in which coiled 
					metal is fed through a series of contoured roller dies to 
					form a profile that can be cut to any length. Typical roll formed profiles include,
					but are not limited to, angles, channels, hat sections, box sections, open and
					lock-seam tubing. At Cardinal Manufacturing we are capable 
					of producing all of these profiles and more, but we 
					specialize in producing custom profiles, 
					rolled to customers' designs and specifications. 

Why roll forming?

The advantages of roll-forming over other 
					forms of metal fabrication, such as stamping, are numerous. 
					The biggest advantage is that, often, a complete part can be 
					produced after one fast-moving process, reducing both the 
					cost and the time taken to produce the part. 

Why Cardinal Manufacturing?


Cardinal Manufacturing builds and 
							maintains all of our roll-forming 
							equipment, including tooling, presses, and 
							roll-forming machines. This allows us to maintain 
							excellent customer service and keep prices low.


Our continuing investment in new 
							technologies allows us to maintain tight tolerances 
							while keeping the process running at a fast rate.


Cardinal places the quality of our 
							parts first, from start to finish, making sure all of our parts meet 
							customer specifications


We offer excellent customer 
							service with a personal touch throughout the entire 
							business process.
