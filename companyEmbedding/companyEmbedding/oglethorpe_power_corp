								Yesterday's Total Member System Peak Load
							















The daily system peak represents the highest instantaneous electricity use of all of OPC's 38 Member Systems combined on any given day.  The biggest daily peaks normally occur on hot summer afternoons and evenings when air conditioning use is at its highest. Peak demand is expressed in megawatts (MW), or millions of watts.  One MW represents enough electricity to serve approximately 500 to 600 homes.

Historical Conservation Efforts
​   Electric Membership Corporations (EMCs) in Georgia have been leaders in promoting education, conservation and energy efficiency for more than 30 years. Moreover, co-ops have a long history of conducting and encouraging home energy audits, and providing assistance to make homes, businesses and industries more energy efficient.    Although impressive and necessary, the amount of power demand that can be reduced or eliminated through conservation and efficiency programs is not sufficient to cover the growth in demand in EMC territories.          
















Quick Facts
EMCs in Georgia ​​have promoted conservation for more than 30 years.    Many EMCs offer audits and other efficiency and conservation services.    Conservation alone is not enough to meet the growing need for electricity.

Environmental Upgrades to Plants
    Oglethorpe Power Corporation (OPC) is committed to improving the air quality in metro Atlanta and throughout the state in compliance with Georgia and federal regulations. To address this issue, the corporation has made hundreds of millions of dollars in environmental improvements to its coal-fired power plants, with more planned for the future.    Between 1994 and 2014, Oglethorpe Power reduced the emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) by approximately 73 percent and sulfur dioxide (SO2) by approximately 95 percent. During the same period, fossil-fuel electricity generation increased by more than 67 percent.    These reductions were accomplished primarily through the installation of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) and Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD)  technology at the Wansley coal-fired plant and by switching to lower sulfur Powder River Basin coal at Units 1 and 2 of Plant Scherer.     These efforts have also significantly reduced the emissions of NOx during the summer ozone season, when air quality problems in urban areas like Atlanta often arise. In fact, the average ozone season NOx emission rate for Oglethorpe Power power plants declined by nearly 92 percent between 1995 and 2013.    Mercury emissions have been reduced dramatically as well.  Between 2000 and 2013, mercury emissions dropped by more than 78 percent with the addition of activated carbon injection and baghouses at Plant Scherer, and the SCR and FGD control technology at Plant Wansley.
















Quick Facts



OPC has made hundreds of millions of dollars in environmental improvements to its plants.


Mercury emissions are down by more than 78 percent in 2013 compared to 2000 levels.


NOx  and SO2 emissions have dropped by approximately 73 and 95 percent respecitively.


Emissions of NOx during the summer ozone season has been reduced by 92 percent between 1995 and 2013.​​

History[edit]
In 1935, the Rural Electrification Administration (REA) provided loans for building transmission lines in rural areas, and EMCs were created in Georgia to purchase power from various sources. In 1974, 39 Georgia-based EMCs incorporated Oglethorpe Power Corporation to invest in generating capacities and transmission lines.[1]
In 1996, Oglethorpe Power signed a 15-year, $4-5 billion deal with LG&E to receive half of its electricity needs from the Kentucky-based power supplier, with a locked down price on the coal-fired megawatt that LG&E must maintain.[2]
In 1997, Ogelthorpe restructured into three separate, but interrelated, cooperatives. Oglethorpe Power Corporation handles electricity generation, Georgia Transmission Corporation owns and operates the transmission lines and substations and Georgia System Operations Corporation provides system and administrative support.[1]
In September 2008, Oglethorpe Power announced the construction of a massive woody biomass power plant (two 100-megawatt-per-year, carbon-neutral facilities) to power nearly half of Georgia's population.[3]
In 2017, the turmoil surrounding the failed deliveries of nuclear reactors by bankrupted Westinghouse put Oglethorpe Power at the forefront of the country's nuclear crisis.[4]
Activity[edit]
Oglethorpe Power is the largest power supply cooperative in the United States based upon assets and annual kilowatt-hour sales. The utility's service area covers 65 percent of the state of Georgia. Ogelthorpe co-own several of its plants with Georgia Power (largest electricity supplier in the state) and the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia.
Oglethorpe's power plants has an annual revenue of $1 billion and assets of over $7 billion, and 4.1 million customers (2011).[1] About 24% of the capacity is coal, 47% natural gas, 19% nuclear and 10% hydroelectric power (2009).[1]
Oglethorpe Power owns 817 megawatts of the 1,095-megawatt Rocky Mountain Hydroelectric Plant, a pure pumped-storage hydroelectric plant that stores energy during periods of low electricity demand and produces electricity during periods of high demand. The utility's nuclear power comes from its partial ownership of the Edwin I. Hatch Nuclear Generating Station and the Alvin W. Vogtle Electric Generating Plant. It has partial ownership of two coal plants and full ownership of a combined cycle power plant and several gas turbine power plants.
Governance[edit]

Bobby C. Smith, Jr. - Chairman of the board (since 2015)
Marshall S. Millwood - Vice chairman of the board (since 2012)

The board of directors has 13 members.

History[edit]
In 1935, the Rural Electrification Administration (REA) provided loans for building transmission lines in rural areas, and EMCs were created in Georgia to purchase power from various sources. In 1974, 39 Georgia-based EMCs incorporated Oglethorpe Power Corporation to invest in generating capacities and transmission lines.[1]
In 1996, Oglethorpe Power signed a 15-year, $4-5 billion deal with LG&E to receive half of its electricity needs from the Kentucky-based power supplier, with a locked down price on the coal-fired megawatt that LG&E must maintain.[2]
In 1997, Ogelthorpe restructured into three separate, but interrelated, cooperatives. Oglethorpe Power Corporation handles electricity generation, Georgia Transmission Corporation owns and operates the transmission lines and substations and Georgia System Operations Corporation provides system and administrative support.[1]
In September 2008, Oglethorpe Power announced the construction of a massive woody biomass power plant (two 100-megawatt-per-year, carbon-neutral facilities) to power nearly half of Georgia's population.[3]
In 2017, the turmoil surrounding the failed deliveries of nuclear reactors by bankrupted Westinghouse put Oglethorpe Power at the forefront of the country's nuclear crisis.[4]
Activity[edit]
Oglethorpe Power is the largest power supply cooperative in the United States based upon assets and annual kilowatt-hour sales. The utility's service area covers 65 percent of the state of Georgia. Ogelthorpe co-own several of its plants with Georgia Power (largest electricity supplier in the state) and the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia.
Oglethorpe's power plants has an annual revenue of $1 billion and assets of over $7 billion, and 4.1 million customers (2011).[1] About 24% of the capacity is coal, 47% natural gas, 19% nuclear and 10% hydroelectric power (2009).[1]
Oglethorpe Power owns 817 megawatts of the 1,095-megawatt Rocky Mountain Hydroelectric Plant, a pure pumped-storage hydroelectric plant that stores energy during periods of low electricity demand and produces electricity during periods of high demand. The utility's nuclear power comes from its partial ownership of the Edwin I. Hatch Nuclear Generating Station and the Alvin W. Vogtle Electric Generating Plant. It has partial ownership of two coal plants and full ownership of a combined cycle power plant and several gas turbine power plants.
Governance[edit]

Bobby C. Smith, Jr. - Chairman of the board (since 2015)
Marshall S. Millwood - Vice chairman of the board (since 2012)

The board of directors has 13 members.
