Our Products
SLS offers a complete range of geosynthetic products, installed by a professional, highly-trained team dedicated to be the best in the USA.
We sell and install the most reliable and widely used high-performance lining systems. SLS also backs every product with QC assurance that meets the most stringent criteria in the industry.
Geosynthetics:
Geosynthetics is a general classification representing all man-made materials used in geotechnical engineering applications.
The Best Alternative:
The value of our products lies in their ability to partially or completely replace natural resources such as gravel, sand, and clay at a much lower cost.
The technical advantages lie in the engineered testability of geosynthetic products versus the often difficult to verify quality and specs of naturally occurring materials.
Liner Systems:
Geomembrane liners come in a broad group of products with distinctive properties and advantages in use as liners for ponds, tanks, float covers, reservoirs, lagoons, landfills, caps, secondary containment — uses of Liner is limited only by the imagination.

Search results are sorted by a combination of factors to give you a set of choices in response to your search criteria. These factors are similar to those you might use to determine which business to select from a local Yellow Pages directory, including proximity to where you are searching, expertise in the specific services or products you need, and comprehensive business information to help evaluate a business's suitability for you. “Preferred” listings, or those with featured website buttons, indicate YP advertisers who directly provide information about their businesses to help consumers make more informed buying decisions. YP advertisers receive higher placement in the default ordering of search results and may appear in sponsored listings on the top, side, or bottom of the search results page.Sort:DefaultDefaultDistanceRatingName (A - Z)Sponsored LinksAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection1. Tri Stat Holdings199 Heather DrMarshall, MI 49068(269) 558-5024Holding CompaniesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection2. Tri State Holdings93 Friendship LnMarshall, MI 49068(269) 558-5026Holding CompaniesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection3. Kalamazoo Holdings Inc3713 W Main StKalamazoo, MI 49006(269) 349-9711Holding CompaniesInvestmentsWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection4. Dma Holdings LTD1350 W Centre AvePortage, MI 49024(269) 488-4500Holding CompaniesWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection5. PBS Holdings317 S Drake RdKalamazoo, MI 49009(269) 342-4892Holding CompaniesInvestmentsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection6. J D Development & Holdings Inc5659 Stadium DrKalamazoo, MI 49009(269) 375-7713Holding CompaniesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection7. Cit Holdings204 S Main StPlainwell, MI 49080(269) 685-5938Holding CompaniesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection8. C I T Holdings134 E Allegan StOtsego, MI 49078(269) 694-9239Holding CompaniesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection9. Wright Aircraft Holdings449 S Skyview DrKalamazoo, MI 49009(269) 353-1788Holding CompaniesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection10. KPH Holdings770 Jackson StEaton Rapids, MI 48827(517) 663-1293Holding CompaniesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection11. Kph Holdings402 Haven StEaton Rapids, MI 48827(517) 663-1293Holding CompaniesBusinesses in related categories to Holding CompaniesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection12. Starcom Mediavest Group1 Kellogg SqBattle Creek, MI 49017(212) 468-4000Holding CompaniesWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection13. Heikkila Holding5424 Beckley RdBattle Creek, MI 49015(269) 883-6448Holding CompaniesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection14. Verona Holding590 Vass AveBattle Creek, MI 49014(269) 224-6040Holding CompaniesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection15. Monarch Community BankBBB Rating: A+375 N Willowbrook RdColdwater, MI 49036(800) 882-2911BanksCommercial & Savings BanksFrom Business: Monarch Community Bancorp is a publicly traded bank holding company based in Coldwater, Mich.
