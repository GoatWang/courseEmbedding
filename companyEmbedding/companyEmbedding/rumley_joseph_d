Limoneira Company Appoints Joseph Rumley as Chief Financial Officer
SANTA PAULA, CA, Jun 16, 2010 (MARKETWIRE via COMTEX News Network) -- Limoneira Company (NASDAQ: LMNR), a leading agribusiness with prime agricultural land and operations, real estate and water rights throughout California, today announced that Joseph ("Joe") Rumley was appointed Chief Financial Officer, effective June 15, 2010 and Don Delmatoff will be transitioning from his role as Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Delmatoff and Mr. Rumley will work together in the following months to ensure a smooth transition. Mr. Delmatoff will continue to work for the Company as a compliance officer managing the firm's internal audit and Sarbanes-Oxley reporting requirements as he transitions towards retirement. Mr. Delmatoff began his career at Limoneira in 2000 as Controller. He was named Chief Financial Officer and Corporate Secretary in 2004, and most recently he also served as Vice 
President of Finance and Administration. Harold Edwards, the Company's 
President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We are grateful to Don for all of his contributions to our company over the past ten years. During his tenure with Limoneira, we grew our core agriculture and rental businesses and made several strategic agribusiness and real estate acquisitions. Additionally, Don recently led our efforts to list our securities on the NASDAQ Global Market. I am delighted that Don will continue to be involved with the Company as he transitions towards retirement." Mr. Delmatoff stated, "I have truly enjoyed being a part of the Limoneira organization for the past ten years, and I am extremely proud of all that we have achieved. While I will continue to be involved with Limoneira managing the firm's internal audit and Sarbanes-Oxley reporting requirements, I believe Joseph Rumley as Chief Financial Officer will be a great addition to the Limoneira team 
and I am confident that Limoneira will maintain its long standing position as one of the premier integrated agribusinesses." Mr. Rumley brings over 25 years of public and private accounting management experience. Mr. Rumley most recently was an Audit Partner at McGladrey & Pullen LLP. From 2005 to 2008, he held a similar position at Grant Thornton LLP. He also served as Audit Director at Deloitte & Touche LLP. He served public and private companies in Deloitte's Consumer Business Practice and Enterprise Risk Services from 1996 to 2005. In all three of these roles, Mr. Rumley planned, conducted, and managed financial and information system audit engagements of privately and publicly owned companies. Prior to Deloitte & Touche, Mr. Rumley served as Vice President, Finance for two different privately held companies. Mr. Rumley also served as Controller for Penske 
Automotive Group from 1990 to 1995. Mr. Rumley received a BS in Accounting from California State University Northridge and a MBA with an emphasis in Finance from Pepperdine University. He is a Certified Public Accountant. Mr. Edwards commented, "We are excited to welcome Joe to the Limoneira team. Many of our senior team members have worked with Joe in the past as he previously served as the Senior Audit Director at Deloitte & Touche during the period that firm performed our annual audit. With his wealth of experience in public accounting and SEC reporting, he has the ideal background to lead Limoneira through our new era as a NASDAQ listed company. I am confident that Joe will be instrumental as we execute on our long-term business plan to deliver growth in our agribusiness, rental, and real estate operations." Mr. Rumley, the Company's Chief Financial Officer, stated, 
"I am pleased to join the Limoneira team during this exciting time. I look forward to helping the company achieve its operational goals as well as working toward maximizing financial performance and shareholder value."
