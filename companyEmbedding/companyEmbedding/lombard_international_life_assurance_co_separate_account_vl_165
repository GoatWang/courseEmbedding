SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The following is a summary of the application; the complete application is available for a fee from the Public Reference Branch of the Commission.
Applicants' Representations
1. Glenbrook is a stock life insurance company organized under the laws of the State of Arizona in 1998. Previously, Glenbrook Life was organized under the laws of the State of Illinois in 1992. Glenbrook Life was originally organized under the laws of the State of Indiana in 1965. From 1965 to 1983 Glenbrook Life was known as “United Standard Life Assurance Company” and from 1983 to 1992 as “William Penn Life Assurance Company of America.” Glenbrook's home office is located at 3100 Sanders Road, Northbrook, Illinois, 60062. Glenbrook is currently licensed to operate in the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and all states except New York. Glenbrook is a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Allstate Life Insurance Company. Allstate Life Insurance Company is a wholly owned subsidiary of Allstate Insurance Company, a stock property-liability insurance company incorporated under the laws of Illinois. All of the outstanding capital stock of Allstate Insurance Company is owned by The Allstate Corporation.
2. Glenbrook established Glenbrook Multi-Manager, Glenbrook VL, Variable Annuity Account, Scudder Account, and AIM VL Account as separate account pursuant to Illinois law. Each is a “separate account,” as defined by section 2(a)(37) of the Act, and is registered with the Commission pursuant to the Act as a unit investment trust.
3. Certain variable annuity contracts sponsored by Glenbrook and issued through Glenbrook Multi-Manager, Variable Annuity Account and Scudder Account are registered with the Commission pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”).
4. Certain variable life insurance contracts sponsored by Glenbrook and issued through Glenbrook VL and AIM VL Account are registered with the Commission pursuant to the Securities Act.
5. Glenbrook Multi-Manager is divided into 88 sub-accounts, each of which invests exclusively in shares of a corresponding portfolio of an open-end, diversified management investment company registered under the Act (the “Funds”). Variable Annuity Account is divided into 39 sub-accounts, each of which invests exclusively in shares of a corresponding portfolio of the Funds. Scudder Account is divided into 10 sub-accounts, each of which invests exclusively in shares of a corresponding portfolio of the Funds.
6. Glenbrook VL is divided into 57 sub-accounts, each of which invests exclusively in shares of a corresponding portfolio of the Funds. AIM VL Account is divided into 18 sub-accounts, each of which invests exclusively in shares of a corresponding portfolio of the Funds.
7. After considering the nature and purpose of each separate account, the Boards of Directors of Glenbrook has determined that the efficiency of the operations of the separate accounts could be improved, and the overall administration enhanced, by merging: (a) Variable Annuity Account and Scudder Account into Glenbrook Multi-Manager; and (b) AIM VL Account into Glenbrook VL (together, the “Merger”). Start Printed Page 13603The Merger will be structured so there will be no change in the rights and benefits of persons having an interest in any of the Contracts issued by those Separate Accounts.
8. The Merger provides for the transfer of Variable Annuity Account and Scudder Account assets to Glenbrook Multi-Manager and the assumption of the liabilities and contractual obligations of each of Variable Annuity Account and Scudder Account by Glenbrook Multi-Manager in return for the crediting of accumulation units of Glenbrook Multi-Manager to Variable Annuity Account and Scudder Account contract owners. Once this process has been completed, the units of Variable Annuity Account and Scudder Account would be cancelled, Variable Annuity Account and Scudder Account would each submit an application to the Commission pursuant to section 8(f) of the Act to effect its deregistration as an investment company and would cease to exist, and Glenbrook Multi-Manager would continue to exist.
9. Immediately following the Merger, each Variable Annuity Account and Scudder Account contract owner will possess a number of Glenbrook Multi-Manager units (both full and fractional) that, when multiplied by the unit value of Glenbrook Multi-Manager units, would result in an aggregate unit value equal to the aggregate unit value of the units the contract owner had in the respective Separate Account immediately before the consummation of the Merger.
10. Glenbrook will distribute to each existing Variable Annuity Account and Scudder Account contract owner: (a) A contract rider indicating that such contracts are thereafter funded by Glenbrook Multi-Manager; (b) a letter informing such contract owners of the Merger; and (c) a prospectus supplement that reflects Glenbrook Multi-Manager as the separate account funding the contracts.
11. The Merger also provides for the transfer of AIM VL Account assets to Glenbrook VL and the assumption of the liabilities and contractual obligations of AIM VL Account by Glenbrook VL in return for the crediting of accumulation units of Glenbrook VL to AIM VL Account contract owners. Once this process has been completed, the units of AIM VL Account would be cancelled, AIM VL Account would submit an application to the Commission pursuant to section 8(f) of the Act to effect its deregistration as an investment company and would cease to exist, and Glenbrook VL would continue to exist.
12. Immediately following the Merger, each AIM VL Account contract owner will possess a number of Glenbrook VL units (both full and fractional) that, when multiplied by the unit value of Glenbrook VL units, would result in an aggregate unit value equal to the aggregate unit value of the units the contract owner had in the respective Separate Account immediately before the consummation of the Merger.
13. Glenbrook will distribute to each existing AIM VL Account contract owner: (a) A contract rider indicating that such contracts are thereafter funded by Glenbrook VL; (b) a letter informing such contract owners of the Merger; and (c) a prospectus supplement that reflects Glenbrook VL as the separate account funding the contracts.
14. Except for the change in the separate account funding the variable annuity contracts and variable life contracts, all the rights and benefits of the contract owners will remain unchanged after the Merger. Further, the fees and charges under the contracts will not change as a result of the Merger.
15. Glenbrook asserts that the Merger will have no tax consequences for Glenbrook contract owners. In addition, no payments will be required or charges imposed under the Glenbrook contracts in connection with, or by virtue of, the Merger that would not otherwise be required or imposed.
Applicants' Legal Analysis
1. Section 17(a) of the Act provides generally that it is unlawful for any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such a person, acting as principal to knowingly purchase or to sell any security or other property from or to such registered company.
2. Section 17(b) of the Act provides generally that the Commission may grant an order exempting a transaction otherwise prohibited by section 17(a) of the Act if evidence establishes that: (a) The terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned; (b) the proposed transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned; and (c) the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the Act.
3. The Merger may be subject to the provisions of section 17(a) of the Act because it could be viewed as involving an investment company (VA Account, Scudder Account, AIM VL Account) selling its assets to another investment company (Glenbrook Multi-Manager, Glenbrook VL) that is affiliated by reason of having sponsoring insurance companies that are under common control, or by reason of having common directors.
4. Applicants request an order of the Commission pursuant to section 17(b) of the Act to the extent necessary to exempt the Merger from the provisions of section 17(a) of the Act.
5. Applicants assert that the terms of the Merger are fair and reasonable. The transfer of assets held by Variable Annuity Account, Scudder Account and AIM VL Account respectively, will be made at the relative net asset values of the sub-accounts. Consequently, the interests of Glenbrook Multi-Manager and Glenbrook VL owners will not be diluted by the Merger. Each Variable Annuity Account and Scudder Account contract will be credited, immediately after the Merger, with units of Glenbrook Multi-Manager having the same aggregate value as the aggregate value of the units of Variable Annuity Account and Scudder Account credited to such contract immediately prior to the Merger. Likewise, each AIM VL Account contract will be credited, immediately after the Merger, with units of the Glenbrook VL having the same aggregate value as the aggregate value of the units of AIM VL Account credited to such contract immediately prior to the Merger. The Merger will not result in any change in charges, costs, fees or expenses borne by any Contract owner. No direct or indirect costs will be incurred by any Separate Account concerned as a result of the Merger. Therefore, the proposed transactions will not result in dilution of the economic interests of any Contract owners. In addition, the Merger will result in no change in the investment options available to Glenbrook contract owners. Each sub-account of the Separate Accounts will continue to invest in the same Fund as that sub-account invested in prior to the Merger.
6. The consolidation of any overlapping sub-accounts will take place at their respective net asset values and each Glenbrook Contract owner holding units of interest in one of the merging sub-accounts will have those units exchanged for units of equal value in the corresponding surviving sub-account. The values of the exchanged interests under the Contracts will thus be equivalent. The accumulation unit values for these sub-accounts will not change, and the Contract value of any affected Contract owner immediately after the sub-account consolidation will be the same as the value immediately before the sub-account consolidation.
7. Applicants assert that the Merger do not involve overreaching on the part of any party involved and is consistent with the general purposes of the Act. Start Printed Page 13604The purposes of the Merger are to consolidate three variable annuity separate accounts, each of which issue variable annuity contracts, into a single separate account and to consolidate two variable life separate accounts, each of which issue variable life contracts, into a single separate account. The Merger will allow for administrative efficiencies and cost savings by Glenbrook because it can consolidate its separate account operations. The Merger will not dilute or otherwise adversely affect the economic interests of the owners of the Glenbrook contracts, nor will the Merger affect the values determined under the Glenbrook contracts.
8. Applicants represent that the Merger are consistent with the policy of each Separate Account as set forth in its registration statement. The policy of each Separate Account is to invest in the Funds. As noted above, the Merger will result in no change to any Fund underlying the Glenbrook Separate Accounts. Each sub-account of the Separate Accounts will continue to invest in the same Fund as that sub-account invested in prior to the Merger. Accordingly, the assets underlying the Contracts will continue to be invested in accordance with the policies recited in the Separate Accounts' respective registration statements.
Conclusion
For the reasons summarized above, Applicants assert that the terms of the Merger, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned, are consistent with the policies of the Glenbrook Separate Accounts as recited in their registration statements, are consistent with the general purposes of the Act, and therefore meet the conditions for exemptive relief established by section 17(b).

The Lowest Rates and Best Coverage

LifePlans.com is dedicated to helping you find the best life insurance policy, while saving you as much money as possible! How do we do that? Simply put, our technology and relationships are what enable us to pass the savings onto you.
Life insurance companies are constantly calculating and updating rates based on the changing demographics of the US population. LifePlans.com is connected to the databases of the leading carriers to help you find the best deal while using the most up-to-date rates.
What’s better is that our service is 100% free, and super-fast! All you have to do is:


1. Confirm your zip code.
2. Tell us about yourself and your coverage needs.
3. See your custom-results and start comparing multiple quotes.


As you are shopping around, there are certain questions that you should ask yourself. The best one to start with is: “How much coverage do I need?”  To give you an idea, most people opt for a Term Policy with about $250,000 in coverage. Why this amount or any amount for that matter? The answer is that it all depends on how much debt you would need to payoff and how much income you would need to replace in the event you are no longer around to provide for your loved ones.
Another good question to ask yourself, or one of the several qualified agents LifePlans.com can connect you with, is how long do want to be covered and whether an investment component in your policy is right for you. Unlike a term policy, which as its name suggests has rates and coverage based on a set term or number of years, a Permanent Policy does not expire. Typically, Whole Life, the most common type of permanent insurance, not only serves to pay-out your beneficiaries upon your passing, but also has a current cash value that can be borrowed against or cashed-out anytime. Essentially,               permanent policies are investments and can grow in value whereas term policies do not.  The catch is that they often have higher premiums. You can learn more about life insurance and policy types by clicking on the icons below.
So with flexible policy options plus the best rates and coverage, don’t wait any longer. Secure your coverage now with LifePlans.com and get back to living your life with those who matter most!

Term Life Insurance
A Term Life policy offers coverage only if death occurs during a specific period of time, which coincides with the terms in which the insured member is required to make a monthly premium. A Term Life policy pays a benefit to the beneficiaries only if the policy holder dies during the time period for which the policy was initially contracted and has remained current on their annual or monthly premium payments.
This type of policy is beneficial for parents of young children, people with debt obligations and also home buyers. It can be renewed after the initial term has ended and it may also be converted to a whole life policy. The premiums are based on your age and your health status. Purchasing a new Term policy at the expiration of your existing policy will result in a higher premium and you may not qualify if you have disqualifying health issues.
Term Life is a "death benefit only" policy that you buy for a specified length of time. Think of it like leasing a car: you pay for the use of the car for a specified period and when the contract period is over, you return the car.
Term Life is referred to as "benefit only" insurance because unlike the various types of permanent life such as Whole Life, it carries no "cash surrender value". Because of this, Term Life insurance premiums tend to be very affordable. Young and relatively healthy individuals can often obtain a policy with limited or no medical background check. It is ideal for families that are just starting out, or for the family income provider who wants to make sure his or her family will be protected, but may not be able to afford, or desire a permanent life policy. However, understand that as a person ages over the period of the term, monthly premiums may increase.
It is often an ideal option to insure a second spouse, or for single people, even for children, just to make sure the often unexpectedly expensive costs of a funeral are covered. There are many insurance and financial professionals who suggest that those who purchase a Term Life policy can make up for the investment component of a Permanent Life insurance policy by investing the cost savings between the two on their own.
The earlier you purchase a term life policy and the healthier you are, the cheaper the premiums will be over the term of the policy.
Annual Renewable Term Life policies are those that are purchased year-by-year. The next year you do not have to prequalify. Simply choose to renew at what may or may not be an increased rate. Rates for Annual Renewable policies are at historic lows. A young healthy person can get $250,000.00 for only a few hundred dollars per year.
There are very good rates these days on Term Life. The premium is fixed and will not go up for the life of the term, usually 10,15, 20 or 30 years. It is not uncommon for a healthy non-smoking 40 year-old male to obtain a 20 or 30-year policy with a fixed premium of less than $30 per month.
So just how much Insurance should you buy? Many things factor into that answer, but at the minimum the experts say purchase enough insurance to equal at least 5-7 years of your present salary. If you have young children, make that around 10 years. So, if you make $50,000 a year that means at least $250,000 to $500,000 in coverage. Feel free to use our Life Insurance Calculator to help determine the right amount for your circumstances.
Term Life Insurance is an affordable life insurance product to ensure that your loved ones are protected in the event of your unexpected death, for a specific term period of time.

All disputes arising out of or relating to any purchase you make with via this Site, any information you provide via the Site, these Terms (including the formation, performance or alleged breach), and your use of the Site will be exclusively resolved under confidential binding arbitration in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (collectively, the “AAA Rules”) then in effect at the time of the dispute. The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. If you initiate arbitration, Healthplans.com will promptly reimburse you for any standard filing fee which may have been required under AAA Rules once you have notified Healthplans.com in writing and provided a copy of the arbitration proceedings. However, if Healthplans.com is the prevailing party in the arbitration, applicable law may allow the arbitrator to award attorneys’ fees and costs to Healthplans.com. If for any reason the AAA is unavailable, the parties shall mutually select another arbitration forum. The arbitration will be conducted in the city of Los Angeles, California, but may proceed telephonically if the claimant so chooses.
The arbitrator’s award will be binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no arbitration under these Terms may be joined to an arbitration involving any other party subject to these Terms, whether through class arbitration proceedings or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we will have the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in state or federal court located to enforce these Terms or prevent an infringement of a third party’s rights. In the event equitable relief is sought, each party hereby irrevocably submits to the personal jurisdiction of such court.

BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT YOU MAY HAVE TO JOIN CLAIMS WITH THOSE OF OTHERS or participate as a member of a class of claimants with respect to any claim submitted to arbitration. The parties to this arbitration agreement acknowledge that this class action waiver is material and essential to the arbitration of any disputes between the parties and is nonseverable from the agreement to arbitrate claims. If any portion of this class action waiver is limited, voided, or cannot be enforced, then the parties’ agreement to arbitrate shall be null and void. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER, YOU MAY ONLY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST Healthplans.com IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WOULD HAVE HAD A RIGHT TO LITIGATE THROUGH A COURT, TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE YOUR CASE AND TO BE PARTY TO A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. HOWEVER, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO HAVE ANY CLAIMS DECIDED INDIVIDUALLY AND ONLY THROUGH ARBITRATION.
You shall have thirty (30) days from the date that you submit your personally identifiable information to opt-out of this arbitration agreement. To opt out of arbitration you must email us at legal@healthplans.com. If more than thirty (30) days have passed, you are not eligible to opt out of arbitration.

Life Insurance Overview
Similar to other types of insurance, life insurance helps plan for your loved ones in the event of the incident – in this case, death.  Life insurance is completely different in that it is based on “when”, and not “if” occurrence, thus making life insurance products more complex. This fundamental difference is what makes life insurance more like a financial product. Complexities aside, life insurance offers peace of mind regarding the financial future of those that depend on you, and can be a part of your overall legacy. Benefits can range from covering funeral costs to paying for higher education for your children and mortgages. Understanding your insurance coverage needs will help you purchase the right policy for you and your loved ones’ specific needs.
Here are some basic life insurance terms and definitions:

• Premiums - Monthly, quarterly, or yearly payments required to maintain coverage
• Face Value - The original death benefit amount
• Convertibility - Option to convert from one type of policy (term) to another (whole life)
• Cash Value - The savings portion of a policy that can be borrowed against or cashed in
• Beneficiary - The individual(s) or entity (e.g., trust) that is designated as benefit recipient
• Paid Up - A policy requiring no further premium payments due to prepayment or earnings

Basic insurance types include:
Term Life Insurance (Temporary) - the most basic, and generally least expensive form of life insurance for people under age 50. Term Life Insurance provides for life insurance coverage for a specified term of years for a specified premium.
Declining Balance Term - Variation on term insurance, often used as mortgage insurance since it can be written to match the amortization of your mortgage principal. While the premium stays constant over the term, the face value steadily declines. Once the mortgage is paid off, the insurance is no longer needed and the policy expires. Unlike many other policies, term insurance has no cash value.
Whole Life - Combines permanent protection with a savings component. As long as you continue to pay the premiums, you are able to lock in coverage at a level premium rate, with some accruing as cash value.
Universal Life - Similar to whole life with the added benefit of potential earnings on the savings component. Universal life policies are also flexible in regard to premiums and face value. Premiums can be increased, decreased or deferred, and cash values can be withdrawn. You may also have the option to change face values.
Variable Life - Offers fixed premiums and control over the policy’s cash value. The cash value is invested in a choice of stock, bond, or money market funding options. Cash values and death benefits can fluctuate based on the performance of the investment choices. Capital gains and other investment earnings accrue tax deferred as long as the funds remain invested in the insurance contract.
Universal Variable Life - The most aggressive type of policy. Like variable life, you decide the investment in mutual funds, though there are no guarantees on these policies beyond the original face value death benefit.

The Lowest Rates and Best Coverage

LifePlans.com is dedicated to helping you find the best life insurance policy, while saving you as much money as possible! How do we do that? Simply put, our technology and relationships are what enable us to pass the savings onto you.
Life insurance companies are constantly calculating and updating rates based on the changing demographics of the US population. LifePlans.com is connected to the databases of the leading carriers to help you find the best deal while using the most up-to-date rates.
What’s better is that our service is 100% free, and super-fast! All you have to do is:


1. Confirm your zip code.
2. Tell us about yourself and your coverage needs.
3. See your custom-results and start comparing multiple quotes.


As you are shopping around, there are certain questions that you should ask yourself. The best one to start with is: “How much coverage do I need?”  To give you an idea, most people opt for a Term Policy with about $250,000 in coverage. Why this amount or any amount for that matter? The answer is that it all depends on how much debt you would need to payoff and how much income you would need to replace in the event you are no longer around to provide for your loved ones.
Another good question to ask yourself, or one of the several qualified agents LifePlans.com can connect you with, is how long do want to be covered and whether an investment component in your policy is right for you. Unlike a term policy, which as its name suggests has rates and coverage based on a set term or number of years, a Permanent Policy does not expire. Typically, Whole Life, the most common type of permanent insurance, not only serves to pay-out your beneficiaries upon your passing, but also has a current cash value that can be borrowed against or cashed-out anytime. Essentially,               permanent policies are investments and can grow in value whereas term policies do not.  The catch is that they often have higher premiums. You can learn more about life insurance and policy types by clicking on the icons below.
So with flexible policy options plus the best rates and coverage, don’t wait any longer. Secure your coverage now with LifePlans.com and get back to living your life with those who matter most!

No matter when you start, you always want to start off on the right foot.
And with a term life insurance policy from New York Life Insurance Company you’re starting off on the best foot possible.

Term life is simple and affordable and you pay a low monthly premium based on the term length and the amount of coverage you need. At the end of your term, you may be able to renew your coverage, often at a higher premium without having to provide evidence of good health. Buying term life insurance can be a wise decision while you are young and healthy, since premiums tend to be much lower. So why wait? Protect the ones you love and keep good going in your life.

The many benefits of a term life insurance policy include:


Affordable premiums: cover yourself, spouse, family or business without breaking the bank
Guaranteed death benefit paid out to a beneficiary or beneficiaries you select
Guaranteed coverage for the duration of the term selected (example: 5, 10, 20 years)
Conversion privilege at the end of the term to a permanent policy (certain limitations apply)


To get started, fill out the form above and a local, professionally-trained agent will get back to you with a no-cost, no-obligation consultation.

In Oregon, the policy form numbers are as follows: Family Protection - 206-110.27; Level Premium Convertible Term - 210-60.27; One-Year Non Renewable Term - 209-125.27; and Yearly Convertible Term - 210-135-27.
