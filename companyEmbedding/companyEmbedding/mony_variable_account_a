Common Questions
Beneficiary information 



What is a beneficiary?
The beneficiary is the person(s) designated in the policy to receive the death proceeds in the event of the Insured's death.


Can I designate my minor child as a beneficiary?
Yes. If proceeds become payable to a child during his/her minority, we will pay the court-appointed guardian for the estate of the child. The minor's parent automatically serves as guardian of the minor's person but not his/her estate.
Alternative suggestion: The policy owner should consider designating a Custodian to receive, manage, invest and distribute the proceeds for the minor under the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act. Ex: John Doe as custodian for Bobby Smith, a minor born 3/3/98, under the NY UTMA. When the minor reaches the age of majority, the custodianship terminates and the balance of any funds are distributed to the child.


Can I designate my revocable trust as beneficiary?
Yes, simply indicate the name of the trustee(s), the name of the trust, the date of the trust and the name(s) of the grantors in Section 1 of the Title Change Form. Sample wording: XYZ Bank as trustee or the successor trustee under an agreement known as the John Smith Living Trust dated 01/01/98, made by and between John Smith and said trustee. Click here for a printable form.


When is my change of beneficiary effective?
Any change of beneficiary will take effect as of the date the form was signed, provided is has been accepted and recorded at the Operations Center, subject to any payment made by us or action taken by us before receipt of the request at our Operations Center.


Can I designate multiple persons as primary beneficiary?
Yes. Simply indicate the relationship(s) to the insured person(s) along with the full names of the proposed beneficiaries. All primary beneficiaries should be listed in Section 1 under First Beneficiary(ies). Joint beneficiaries will receive equal shares proportionate to the number of those beneficiaries who survive the insured.


What should I do to change my beneficiary now that I am recently married?
A Title Change form (10481) should be completed, dated and signed. Indicate the new beneficiaries in Section 1 (be sure to indicate the full name and relationship of each person to the insured). Your change of name can also be indicated on the form in the space directly under the policy number. Click here for a printable form.


Must I complete a new change of beneficiary request form to reflect a change in the beneficiary's name due to marriage or divorce?
No. Simply write to us at
MONY Life of AmericaP. O. Box 4830Syracuse, NY 13221
advising us that your beneficiary, Jane Doe, has changed her name to Jane Smith. Provide her new address, if appropriate. We will make note of this information. No forms are necessary. Please be sure to include your policy number(s).


Can I use one form to change the beneficiary on all of my MONY policies/contracts?
Multiple policies may be indicated on each Title Change form (10481). However, separate forms must be used for each insured,except in the case of a Multi-Life policy. Click here for a printable form.


What is a Rights holder?
The person who can exercise rights is the rights holder of the policy. This term is synonymous with Owner, the individual who can exercise all rights under the provisions of the policy.


How does a Divorce impact my Beneficiary Designation?
If you are required to designate an ex-spouse or children as beneficiary(ies) pursuant to a divorce decree or order, then the decree should be submitted to us. We will conform the beneficiary designation to the terms of the decree. If you currently have your ex-spouse listed as beneficiary, then you should either change the beneficiary to reflect your new choice of beneficiary or to reconfirm your desire to designate the ex-spouse despite the divorce. In most states, a divorce does not automatically extinguish the rights of an ex-spouse as beneficiary. Therefore, an Insured who inadvertently leaves his/her ex-spouse as beneficiary of record may cause payment of the death benefits to the ex-spouse even though such payment is contrary to his/her intent.



Lost policy



How do I replace a policy that has been lost?
Once you have determined that the policy is lost and not temporarily misplaced, please advise us by completing a Certification of Loss or Destruction of Policy/Contract form(3551)and mailing it to the address shown.
Click here for a printable form.(If someone is holding the policy and refusing to surrender it due to an adverse death claim, the policy is not considered lost and you should advise us of the circumstances of the claim.)



Dividends



What are policy dividends?
Policy dividends are a return of divisible surplus to the owners of participating policies. Dividends are based on factors which change from year to year including investment earnings, mortality experience and expenses. Dividends are not guaranteed.


What are the available dividend options?
MONY has a wide variety of dividend options to choose from. For example, dividends can be: used to purchase paid-up additional insurance coverage

sent in cash
used to reduce the premium
left with the company to earn interest (which would be reported to the IRS via a 1099INT).

Other dividend options may be available from time to time.


Can dividends be withdrawn?
Yes. The available cash value of any dividend additions and/or deposits may be: withdrawn in cash

used to pay premiums on the same policy 
used to repay outstanding loan balances 

Such withdrawals will affect the total death benefit payable but will not affect the base policy face amounts.



Payments



What are the billing options available on my policy?
We offer a number of payment modes that may be available to pay premiums. Annual billing is the least expensive due to our lower billing costs and immediate interest earnings on the annual premium received.

Annual - Will require payment of the full year's payment on the policy anniversary date
Semi-Annual - Will require payments at six-month intervals, with one premium due on the policy anniversary date
Quarterly - Will require a payment at three-month intervals, with one premium due on the policy anniversary date
Monthly - Automatic payments under our MONY-Matic plan. Click here for a printable form.



Do I have an option to have premiums automatically withdrawn from my checking account?
Yes! We offer a convenient MONY-Matic payment method, which allows monthly premiums to be automatically withdrawn from your checking account. You can do this by completing our MONY-Matic Authorization form. Click here for a printable form.

Policy values



What is total death benefit?
The amount payable to a beneficiary upon the death of the insured. This generally represents the face amount of the base policy, the face amount of any additional coverage on the insured provided under a rider, the face amount of any dividend additions, the cash value of any dividend deposits, less any outstanding indebtedness (loan balance and loan interest).


What is total policy cash value?
This represents the guaranteed cash value of the base policy, if any, the cash value of any riders, the cash value of any accumulated dividends, less any outstanding indebtedness (loan balance and loan interest) that would be paid upon termination of the contract.


How can I access the funds in my policy and keep my valuable insurance protection?
There are several options that may be available to you

Withdraw any dividend for cash 
Withdraw any dividend cash value to help pay premiums 
Withdraw available dividend cash value to reduce any outstanding loan balance and/or pay loan interest 
Take a loan against the policy's cash value 
Take a policy loan to help pay premiums

Note: Please keep in mind when borrowing against the cash value, that loan interest will accrue daily and will be due on the policy anniversary date. Any outstanding indebtedness will be deducted from and will reduce the proceeds payable at surrender, lapse, or payment of a claim. Furthermore, withdrawals of dividend cash value will reduce the proceeds payable at surrender, lapse or payment of claim.


How can I obtain investment information on my Variable Life Policy?

Completing an online form called Transfer Request Click here for a printable form.

If the Owner of the policy is a corporation or a trust, and not an individual, we require the owner's written request for transfer. Complete and return to the address on the form.



Loans 



How does a policy loan affect my coverage?
Any outstanding indebtedness will be deducted from the proceeds payable at lapse, surrender, maturity, or payment of the death claim. Therefore, it is in the client's best interest to make loan repayments whenever possible. Loan repayments will also reduce future loan interest payments.


How can loan repayments be made?
Loan repayments can be made at your convenience in amounts of $10.00 or more by sending a check indicating the policy number and how the money is to be applied, to MONY Life of America, PO Box 4830, Syracuse, NY 13221. Additional loan repayment options are available such as

What is loan interest?
Like most financial institutions, we charge loan interest on the policy anniversary date to compensate for our loss of investment earnings from the borrowed amount. Please refer to your contract for details concerning your policy's loan interest rate.


How is loan interest charged?
Loan interest accrues daily on the unpaid loan balance and is due once a year on the policy anniversary date or upon full repayment of the loan principal. In most circumstances, if the loan interest remains unpaid at the end of the 31-day grace period, it will automatically be added to the existing loan balance, becoming interest-bearing loan principal.


How can I access the funds in my policy and keep my valuable insurance protection?
There are several options that may be available to you

Withdraw any dividend for cash 
Withdraw any dividend cash value to help pay premiums 
Withdraw available dividend cash value to reduce any outstanding loan balance and/or pay loan interest 
Take a loan against the policy's cash value 
Take a policy loan to help pay premiums 

Note: Please keep in mind when borrowing against the cash value, that loan interest will accrue daily and will be due on the policy anniversary date. Any outstanding indebtedness will be deducted from and will reduce the proceeds payable at surrender, lapse, or payment of a claim.

How can I confirm my policy's current cash value?
Online through the AXA website. Login or Register The Portfolio Summary screen will list your policy's Net Cash Surrender Value and the date this value was calculated. Net Cash Surrender Value reflects deductions from your policy's cash value for any loan and loan interest and any surrender charges, if they apply.

By calling our toll-free number at (800) 487-6669 and speaking to a Customer Service Representative



Do I have to repay the loan?
You can repay all or part of your loan at any time. Please note that unpaid policy loan balance and interest will reduce your policy's death benefit and cash value.
Interest will be billed annually, on your policy's anniversary. If you do not pay the amount due, it will be added to the amount of the loan and next year's interest will be based on this new loan amount. If the cash surrender value is ever insufficient to pay the loan balance, including unpaid loan interest, the policy could lapse.


What is the effect of a loan on a policy that is a MEC (Modified Endowment Contract)?
If your policy is a MEC (Modified Endowment Contract) the tax treatment of any death benefit provided under the contract will still qualify for income tax free treatment. However, you may be subject to additional taxes and penalties on any distributions from your policy during the lifetime of the insured. Any distribution from a policy that is a MEC will be taxed on an "income-first" basis. Distributions for this purpose include a loan (including any increase in the loan amount to pay interest on an existing loan or an assignment or a pledge to secure a loan) or withdrawal. Any such distributions will be considered taxable income to you to the extent there is gain in the policy at the time of distribution. That is, the distribution will be includible in income up to the amount your account value exceeds your basis in the policy.
A 10% penalty tax also will apply to the taxable portion of most pre-age 59 1/2 distributions from a policy that is a Modified Endowment Contract.

The beneficiary is the person(s)designated in the contract to receive the death proceeds in the event of the Annuitant/Owner's death.


Can I designate my minor child as beneficiary?
Yes. However, if proceeds become payable to a child during his/her minority, we will pay the court-appointed guardian for the estate of the child. The minor's parent automatically serves as guardian of the minor's person but not his/her estate.
Alternative suggestion: The contract owner should consider designating a Custodian to receive, manage, invest and distribute the proceeds for the minor under the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act. Ex: John Doe as custodian for Bobby Smith, a minor born 3/3/98, under the NY UTMA. When the minor reaches the age of majority, the custodianship terminates and the balance of any funds are distributed to the child.


Can I designate a revocable trust as beneficiary?
Yes, simply indicate the name of the trustee(s), the name of the trust, the date of the trust and the name(s) of the grantors in Section 1 of the Title Change Form. Sample wording: XYZ Bank as trustee or the successor trustee under an agreement known as the John Smith Living Trust dated 01/01/98, made by and between John Smith and said trustee. Click here for a printable form.


When is my change of beneficiary effective?
Any change of beneficiary will take effect as of the date the form was signed, provided it has been accepted and recorded at our Operations Center, subject to any payment made by us or action taken by us before receipt of the request.


Can I designate multiple persons as primary beneficiary?
Yes. Simply indicate the relationship(s) to the Annuitant(s) along with the full names of the proposed beneficiaries. All primary beneficiaries should be listed in Section 1 under First Beneficiary(ies). Joint beneficiaries will receive equal shares proportionate to the number of those beneficiaries who survive.


What should I do to change my beneficiary now that I am recently married?
A Title Change form (10481) should be completed, dated and signed. Click here for a printable form. Indicate the new beneficiaries in Section 1 (be sure to indicate the full name and relationship of each person to the Annuitant). Your change of name can also be indicated on the form in the space directly under the contract number.


Must I complete a new change of beneficiary request form to reflect a change in the beneficiary's name due to marriage or divorce?
No. Simply write to us at:
MONY Life of AmericaP. O. Box 4830Syracuse, NY 13221
Advise us that your beneficiary, Jane Doe, has changed her name to Jane Smith. Provide her new address, if appropriate. We will make note of this information. No forms are necessary. Please be sure to include your contract number(s).


Can I use one form to change the beneficiary on all of my MONY policies/contracts?
Multiple policies may be indicated on each Title Change form (10481). However, separate forms must be used for each Annuitant, except in the case of a Joint-Life contract. Click here for a printable form.


What is a Rights holder?
The person who can exercise rights is the rights holder of the contract. This term is synonymous with Owner, the individual who can exercise all rights under the provisions of the contract.


How does a Divorce impact my Beneficiary Designation?
If you are required to designate an ex-spouse or children as beneficiary(ies) pursuant to a divorce decree or order, then the decree should be submitted to us. We will conform the beneficiary designation to the terms of the decree. If you currently have your ex-spouse listed as beneficiary, then you should either change the beneficiary to reflect your new choice of beneficiary or to reconfirm your desire to designate the ex-spouse despite the divorce. In most states, a divorce does not automatically extinguish the rights of an ex-spouse as beneficiary. Therefore, an Annuitant who inadvertently leaves his/her ex-spouse as beneficiary of record may cause payment of the death benefits to the ex-spouse even though such payment is contrary to his/her intent.



Death benefits



How do I file a Death Claim?
You can start by filing a Death Benefit Claim. You can also contact Claims at (800) 659-1058.


What documents are required?
Documents required when a claim for death benefits is being filed:

Original annuity contracts (or "life insurance policies") if available. 
A certified copy of the death certificate 
Certificates of appointment (if you are filing as executor, administrator, or in any other fiduciary responsibility) 
Completed Death Claim forms 

Click here for Death Claim forms.


How will I receive the annuity proceeds?
There may be different ways in which you may receive your annuity proceeds. The best payment method for you depends on the amount of your annuity proceeds and your own financial situation. In some cases, a payment method has been chosen for you by the policyholder (or contract holder). But in many cases, you are eligible to choose one or more methods of payment. Some of these options require a minimum amount. Your Financial Professional can help you determine which option is best for you. Note that death claims are payable only on policies/contracts that are in force at the time of Insured's/Annuitant's death.

3. About This Contract
 
The following is an overview of some basic
contract provisions to aid your
understanding. The specific provisions of
the Contract are found in the pages
following this overview. In the event of a
discrepancy between this overview and
any specific provisions of this Contract,
the specific Contract provisions will
control.
 
This is a Flexible Payment Variable Annuity
Contract. This Contract goes into
effect on the Effective Date. This Contract
is a "promise to pay" Annuity
Payments which start on a date chosen by
you called the Annuity Starting Date
(or maturity date). Those payments are made
to a person chosen by you as the
Payee. The Annuitant is the person on whose
life the Contract is based (the
measuring life).
 
If the Annuitant (or Secondary Annuitant)
is living on the Annuity Starting
Date, we begin to make Annuity Payments. If
the Annuitant dies before the
Annuity Starting Date, the Secondary
Annuitant (if you designated one) takes
over as Annuitant. If the Annuitant and the
Secondary Annuitant both die before
the Annuity Starting Date, the Contract
ends and a death benefit is payable to
the Beneficiary (person who receives the
Death Benefit) chosen by you. The death
benefit is equal to the Fund Value or, if
greater, the Purchase Payments paid by
you less any partial surrenders, plus or
minus any Market Value Adjustment and
less any surrender charge. The Beneficiary
does not have to be the Payee. If the
Owner (and Successor Owner under certain
circumstances) dies before the Annuity
Starting Date, while the Annuitant is
living, the proceeds in this Contract must
be distributed within 5 years after the
date of death (see Death of Owner
section).
 
Purchase Payments are payments you make to
us. The sum of Purchase Payments made
(less partial surrenders, charges, etc.)
determine the value of the Contract.
There may be a positive or negative Market
Value Adjustment and a surrender
charge on partial surrenders you make or,
if you surrender (cash in) the
Contract in full. The Market Value
Adjustment depends on which Accumulation
Period(s) you selected, how many years are
left in the applicable Period(s) and
how interest rates have changed since those
Periods began. The surrender charge
depends on how long ago you purchased the
Contract.
 
The value of this Contract is based on
Purchase Payments which you allocate to
either the Variable Account, the Guaranteed
Interest Account or the Dollar Cost
Averaging Plus Account. The Fund Value is
the combined value of the Variable
Account, the Guaranteed Interest Account
and the Dollar Cost Averaging Plus
Account BEFORE any Market Value Adjustment
is applied, any surrender charge and
any Annual Contract Charge, as applicable,
are deducted. The Cash Value, if any,
is the value AFTER any Market Value
Adjustment is applied, any surrender charge
and any Annual Contract Charge, as
applicable are deducted. The Guaranteed
Interest Account and Dollar Cost Averaging
Plus Account are "fixed" accounts and
are part of our General Account. We may
offer one or more choices of Guaranteed
Interest Account Accumulation Periods and
interest rates to apply during those
Periods. The Variable Account is an account
that is separate from our General
Account. The value of the Variable Account
can increase or decrease depending on
investment experience. The Variable Account
is made up of several Sub-accounts
(subdivisions) with different investment
objectives. Each Sub-account invests
only in the shares of its own portfolio of
its fund. The measure of value in a
Sub-account is called a Unit.
 
The value of Units in a Sub-account can
only change on a Business Day. A
Business Day is any day the New York Stock
Exchange is open for trading or any
other day on which there is enough trading
to change the Unit value of a
Sub-account. Trading refers to the purchase
and sale of securities held by the
portfolio.
 
When we refer to "I" or "my" in a question,
or to "you" or "your" in an answer,
we mean the Owner. The Owner is the person
who holds the Contract and who has
the rights of ownership. The Owner chooses
any options the Contract offers. When
we refer to "we", "us" and "our" we mean
MONY Life Insurance Company of America.
"Administrative Office" means our office at
1740 Broadway, New York, NY 10019
and also includes our Operations Center at
One MONY Plaza, P.O. Box 4830,
Syracuse, NY 13221.

4. We Will Pay
 
What will the Company pay and when will
they pay it?
 
1. We will pay the Annuity Payments
starting on the Annuity Starting Date to a
person named by you as Payee. You can name
a Payee either in the application or
later (if later, we will send an
endorsement to show the change).
 
2. We will pay the Death Benefit to the
Beneficiary if the Annuitant dies before
the Annuity Starting Date. But we must
first receive proof that the Annuitant
died before the Annuity Starting Date.
Payment in any case will only be made in
accordance with all the provisions of this
Contract. "Annuitant" includes a
"Secondary Annuitant" if you designated
one.
 
What are Annuity Payments?
 
Annuity Payments are Income Payments made
periodically (monthly, quarterly,
semi-annually or annually) over the
lifetime of the Payee or for a selected
period. The income will be purchased by the
Cash Value on the Annuity Starting
Date. The amount of the Cash Value and the
Settlement (payout) Option chosen
will determine the amount of income
payments.
 
But, if you elect Settlement Option 3 or
3A, the income will be purchased by the
Fund Value on the Annuity Starting Date.
That benefit will be based on the
Payee's lifetime, as explained in the
Settlement Options section.
 
If no other election is made before that
Date, the Fund Value will be settled
under Settlement Option 3 with 10 years
certain, based on the Annuitant's life,
as provided by and subject to the
provisions in the Settlement Options section.
 
Can I change the date Annuity Payments
start?
 
Yes, you may advance or defer the Annuity
Starting Date, but only while the
Annuitant is living. We must receive your
request before the Annuity Starting
Date. The Date may not be advanced to a
date earlier than the 10th anniversary.
It may not be deferred to a date later than
the anniversary following the
Annuitant's 95th birthday. The change will
be effective as of the date we
receive your written request at our
Administrative Office. You do not need to
return the Contract for us to make the
change unless we ask for it.
 
If the Annuitant dies, what does the
Company pay?
 
If the Annuitant dies before the Annuity
Starting Date, we will pay to the
Beneficiary, the greater of:
 
(a)   the Fund Value on the date we
receive due proof of death and election of a
     settlement
option; or
 
(b)   the Purchase Payments paid by you,
reduced proportionately by each partial
     surrender
(reflecting any Market Value Adjustment and any surrender
     charge).
 
But we must first receive proof that the
Annuitant died before the Annuity
Starting Date.
 
Any Death Benefit payable under this
Contract is not less than the minimum
benefit required by the law of the state in
which the Contract is delivered.
 
If the proceeds are not paid by the end of
30 days from the date we receive due
proof of death of the Annuitant, we will
pay interest on the proceeds if
required by the state in which the Contract
is
 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PAGE 6
 
<PAGE>
 

================================================================================
 
delivered at the rate specified by that
state. If interest is payable, it will
be paid from date of the death to date of
payment of proceeds.
 
How are proportionate reductions
calculated?
 
For each partial surrender, the
proportionate reduction is equal to the amount
of the partial surrender divided by the
Fund Value immediately before that
partial surrender, multiplied by the
Purchase Payments paid before that partial
surrender.
 

================================================================================
 
5. Purchase Payments You Make
 
What Payments can I make to the
Company?
 
The Initial Purchase Payment is shown on
Page 3. You can send additional
Purchase Payments to our Administrative
Office. On request, we will give a
receipt signed by our Treasurer. We will
accept Purchase Payments any time
before the Annuity Starting Date as long as
the Annuitant is living.
 
Is there a limit on Payments I can make to
the Company?
 
Yes, we may limit the sum of Purchase
Payments you make. That limit is
$1,500,000 (less any partial surrenders,
any Market Value Adjustment and any
surrender charge).We may return any
Purchase Payment that would exceed the
$1,500,000 limit.
 
Can I make Payments to the Company
automatically?
 
Yes, you can make automatic Purchase
Payments to us through an automatic payment
plan. It could be payroll deductions by a
central remitter with whom we make an
agreement or, authorized government
allotments if we receive official military
verification. It could also be automatic
bank drafts or any other automatic plan
we agree to.
 
Can I make Payments to the Company other
than automatic Payments?
 
Yes, whether you are on an automatic
payment plan or not, you can make
non-automatic Purchase Payments.
 
What is a Net Purchase Payment?
 
When we refer to net Purchase Payments, we
mean the Purchase Payment amount
after deduction of any applicable taxes
(see Page 3 for the amount of tax, if
any). We may waive any deduction of taxes
on Purchase Payments. But if we do, we
can stop waiving them on future Payments if
we give you at least 30 days written
notice.
 
When will net Purchase Payments be
allocated to the Sub-accounts, Guaranteed
Interest Account or Dollar Cost Averaging
Plus Account as I have chosen?
 
Any portion of a net Purchase Payment
allocated to the Sub-accounts, the
Guaranteed Interest Account or the Dollar
Cost Averaging Plus Account (if
available), will be placed in that Account
as chosen on the later of the
Effective Date and the Business Day that
falls on, or next follows the date we
receive the Purchase Payment at our
Administrative Office.
 
When we do this, we use the most recent
valid allocation choice and Accumulation
Period choice (if applicable) we have from
you. If we have no valid allocation
choice and Allocation Period choice (if
applicable) from you, we will allocate
the net Purchase Payments to the Money
Market Sub-account.
 
When will interest be credited on Purchase
Payments I allocate to the Guaranteed
Interest Account or Dollar Cost Averaging
Plus Account?
 
Interest will be credited on Purchase
Payments allocated to the Guaranteed
Interest Account or Dollar Cost Averaging
Plus Account (if available), at an
annual rate not less than the Guaranteed
Minimum Interest Rate shown in Section
1 (see also Guaranteed Interest Account and
Dollar Cost Averaging Plus Account
sections). Such interest will be credited
from the later of the Effective Date
and the Business Day that falls on or next
follows the date we receive the
Purchase Payment at our Administrative
Office.

<PAGE>
 

================================================================================
 
Are there any rules for allocation
choices?
 
Yes, allocations must be made in whole
percentages. If a Sub-account, the
Guaranteed Interest Account or the Dollar
Cost Averaging Plus Account (if
available), is to receive any allocation,
the allocation must be at least 1%
and, the total must equal 100% of the net
Purchase Payment. We use the most
recent valid allocation choice and
Accumulation Period choice (if applicable) we
have from you. If we have no valid
allocation choice and Accumulation Period
choice from you, we will allocate the net
Purchase Payments to the Money Market
Sub-account. You may change your allocation
choice by writing to us at our
Administrative Office. A change will take
effect within 7 days after we receive
that notice.
 
Allocations to the Guaranteed Interest
Account may be limited as follows. We
reserve the right to limit the Fund Value
in the Guaranteed Interest Account to
a percentage of the total Fund Value held
under the Contract. That percentage
will never be less than 10%. If we impose
this limit, we will reject any
allocation to the Guaranteed Interest
Account if the Fund Value in that Account
exceeds the limit or, if that allocation
would cause the Fund Value in the
Guaranteed interest Account to exceed that
limit.
 
Can I earmark a non-automatic net Purchase
Payment for an allocation different
from my regular allocation choice?
 
Yes, you can choose a specific allocation
for a non-automatic Purchase Payment
and it will not change your allocation
choice and/or Accumulation Period choice
for future Purchase Payments. Allocations
must be by amount or percentage in
whole numbers only. If a Sub-account, the
Guaranteed Interest Account or the
Dollar Cost Averaging Plus Account (if
available), is to receive any allocation,
the allocation must be at least 1% and the
total must equal 100% of the net
Purchase Payment.
 
If you do not give us a specific allocation
for the non-automatic Purchase
Payment, or if your allocation choice is
not valid, we will use the most recent
valid allocation choice and/or Accumulation
Period choice we have from you.
 
6. Fund Value
 
What is the Fund Value on the Effective
Date?
 
The Fund Value on the Effective Date is the
net Purchase Payments received by us
on or before the Effective Date and any
interest credited to those Payments.
 
When are Fund Value calculations made?
 
After the Effective Date, Fund Value
calculations are made on Business Days. If
a Fund Value calculation has to be made for
a day that is not a Business Day,
then we will use the next Business Day.
 
How is the Fund Value determined on a
Business Day?
 
The Fund Value on a Business Day is
determined as follows:
 
(a)   Determine the Fund Value in each
Sub-account on that Day (see below for
     details).
 
(b) Total the Fund Value in each
Sub-account on that Day.
 
(c)   Add the Fund Value in the
Guaranteed Interest Account on that Day (see
     below for
details).
 
(d)   Add the Fund Value in the Dollar
Cost Averaging Plus Account on that Day
     (see below for
details).
 
(e)   Add any net Purchase Payments
received on that Day.
 
(f)   Deduct any transfer charges on
that Day.
 
(g)   Deduct any partial surrender,
(reflecting any Market Value Adjustment and
     any surrender
charge) made on that Day.
 
(h)   Deduct any Annual Contract Charge
made on that Day.
 
Regarding (a) above, how is the Fund Value
for each Sub-account determined on
that Business Day?
 
For each Sub-account we multiply the number
of Units credited to that
Sub-account by its Unit value on that Day.
The multiplication is done BEFORE the
purchase or redemption of any Units on that
Day.
 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PAGE 8
 
<PAGE>
 

================================================================================
 
Regarding (c) above, what makes up the Fund
Value in the Guaranteed Interest
Account on that Business Day?
 
The Fund Value in the Guaranteed Interest
Account on that Day is the accumulated
value at the applicable interest rate(s) of
net Purchase Payments allocated to
the Guaranteed Interest Account BEFORE that
Day, decreased by allocations
against the Guaranteed Interest Account
BEFORE that Day for:
 
     (i)   any partial surrender, any Market
Value Adjustment and any surrender
         
charge;
 
     (ii) any amount
transferred from the Guaranteed Interest Account, any
         
Market Value Adjustment, and any transfer charge;
 
     (iii) any Annual
Contract Charge.
 
Regarding (d) above, what makes up the Fund
Value in the Dollar Cost Averaging
Plus Account on that Business Day?
 
The Fund Value in the Dollar Cost Averaging
Plus Account on that Day is the
accumulated value at the applicable
interest rate(s) of net Purchase Payments
allocated to the Dollar Cost Averaging Plus
Account BEFORE that Day, decreased
by allocations against the Dollar Cost
Averaging Plus Account BEFORE that Day
for:
 
     (i)   any partial surrender and any
surrender charge;
 
     (ii) any amount
transferred from the Dollar Cost Averaging Plus Account;
 
     (iii) any Annual
Contract Charge.
 

================================================================================
7. Transfers
 
When can I make transfers?
 
Transfers may be made only after the "Right
to Return Contract" period has
ended.
 
What transfers can I make?
 
There are 4 types of transfers you can
make. Each type is explained (along with
any rules and limitations) below:
 
Type 1. Transfers AMONG Sub-accounts (that
do not involve the Guaranteed
Interest Account or Dollar Cost Averaging
Plus Account). There are no
restrictions on this type of transfer.
 
Type 2. Transfers INTO the Guaranteed
Interest Account. Transfers into the
Guaranteed Interest Account are subject to
the availability of one or more
Accumulation Period(s).
 
If one or more Accumulation Periods are
available, transfers INTO the Guaranteed
Interest Account may be limited as follows.
We reserve the right to limit the
Fund Value in the Guaranteed Interest
Account to a percentage of the total Fund
Value held under the Contract. That
percentage will never be less than 10%. If
we impose this limit, we will reject any
transfer INTO the Guaranteed Interest
Account if the Fund Value in that Account
exceeds the limit or, if that transfer
would cause the Fund Value in the
Guaranteed Interest Account to exceed that
limit.
 
Type 3. Transfers FROM the Guaranteed
Interest Account. This type of transfer
can be requested at any time. A Market
Value Adjustment will apply unless your
request is received at our Administrative
Office, WITHIN 30 DAYS BEFORE the end
of the applicable Accumulation Period. If
multiple Accumulation Period accounts
are in effect, your transfer request must
specify which Accumulation Period
account(s) funds are to be transferred
from.
 
Type 4. Transfers FROM the Dollar Cost
Averaging Plus Account. This type of
transfer can only be made to one or more
Sub-accounts in accordance with the
Dollar Cost Averaging Plus Account section.
Fund Value may not be transferred
from the Dollar Cost Averaging Plus Account
to the Guaranteed Interest Account.
 
Transfers INTO the Dollar Cost Averaging
Plus Account are not permitted.
 
When will a transfer request take
effect?
 
Type 1 or Type 2 transfers will take effect
on the Business Day that falls on,
or next follows, the date we receive the
request at our Administrative Office.
Type 3 transfers requested within 30 days
before the end of an Accumulation
Period will take effect at the end of the
Accumulation Period. Type 3 transfers
requested at any other time will take
effect on the Business Day that falls on,
or next follows, the date we receive the
request at our
 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                         
PAGE 9
 
<PAGE>
 

================================================================================
 
Administrative Office. Type 4 transfers
will take effect on the scheduled
monthly or quarterly anniversary as elected
by you. See the Dollar Cost
Averaging Plus section.
 
What is the charge for a transfer and how
does it work?
 
Each request for a transfer is considered
one transaction even if more than one
type of transfer and several different
accounts are involved. Transfers during
any contract year in excess of the number
of guaranteed free transfers shown on
page 3 are subject to a transfer charge.
The guaranteed maximum amount of that
charge is shown on page 3. But, we may
charge less than that maximum, or waive
the charge entirely, in accordance with our
procedure in effect at the time of
the request. There is no transfer charge
applicable to transfers from the Dollar
Cost Averaging Plus Account.
 
If we change the amount of the charge we
will send an endorsement to show the
change.
 
If a transfer charge is applicable, how is
it allocated among the accounts?
 
The charge is allocated against the first
of the Sub-accounts and/or the
Guaranteed Interest Account from which Fund
Value is being transferred.
 

================================================================================
8. Full And Partial Surrenders
 
Can I withdraw money from the Contract?
 
Yes, money may be withdrawn by making a
full or partial surrender.
 
When can I make a full or partial
surrender?
 
At any time on or before the Annuity
Starting Date and while the Annuitant is
living, you may make a full or partial
surrender of the Contract for its Cash
Value (Fund Value plus or minus any Market
Value Adjustment less any applicable
surrender charge) and less the Annual
Contract Charge due on full surrender of
the contract. A full surrender will end the
Contract.
 
If a partial surrender reduces the Cash
Value to less than $1,000, we will
process it as a full surrender.
 
If I make a full surrender, will annuity
(income) payments begin on the Annuity
Starting Date?
 
No. If a full surrender of the Contract is
made on or before the Annuity
Starting Date, the income which was to
begin on that Date will not be payable.
 
What is the full value of the Contract on
surrender?
 
The full value of the Contract on surrender
is the Cash Value (Fund Value plus
or minus any Market Value Adjustment and
less any applicable surrender charge)
less the Annual Contract Charge due on full
surrender of the Contract.
 
Any cash surrender available under this
Contract is not less than the minimum
benefit required by the law of the state in
which the Contract is delivered.
 
When will a full or partial surrender take
effect?
 
A full or partial surrender will take
effect on the Business Day that falls on,
or next follows, the date we receive your
request at our Administrative Office.
 
How can I specify partial surrender
allocations and are there minimums?
 
You can specify partial surrender
allocations by amount or percentage.
Allocations by percentage must be in whole
percentages and the minimum
percentage is 1% against any Sub-account,
the Guaranteed Interest Account or the
Dollar Cost Averaging Plus Account.
Percentages must total 100%.
 
We will not accept an allocation which does
not comply with the above rules or
if there is not enough Fund Value in a
Sub-account, the Guaranteed Interest
Account or the Dollar Cost Averaging Plus
Account to provide its share of the
allocation.
