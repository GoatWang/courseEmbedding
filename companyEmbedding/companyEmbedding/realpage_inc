BBB Reason for Ratings


        BBB rating is based on 13 factors: Get the details about the factors considered.










BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned









                        BBB reports when mail sent to the business was returned by the Postal Service.

                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

                        RealPage, Inc. has received 3.75 out of 5 stars based on 9 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

        RealPage® to Acquire Lease Rent Options, LRO®

RealPage® to Acquire Lease Rent Options, LRO®
Expands Rental Housing Asset Optimization SolutionsRICHARDSON, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
      RealPage,
      Inc. (NASDAQ:RP)
      today announced its agreement to acquire Lease Rent Options (LRO) and
      related assets from The Rainmaker Group for $300 million in cash. LRO is
      a revenue management solution that empowers optimized pricing for over
      1.5 million apartments. LRO, coupled with the recent acquisition of
      Axiometrics, expands RealPage’s suite of solutions for precision data
      analytics and asset optimization for the rental housing industry.
    Highlights
        Better positions RealPage to penetrate an emerging global market
        opportunity to optimize operational and transactional yields for
        rental housing assets.
      
        Expands the company’s real-time lease transaction data, which is
        expected to improve optimization of new and renewal prices for rental
        housing leases.
      
        Provides additional data science talent and data modeling tools that
        allow for better harvesting and placement of capital in the rental
        housing industry.
      
        The industry is ripe for adoption: RealPage estimates that less than
        10% of owners and operators of the 45 million rental housing
        properties in the U.S. currently utilize data-driven pricing science.
        International markets are believed to possess an even lower rate of
        adoption for asset optimization software and data analytic solutions.
      
        Adds 500,000 new units opening up cross selling opportunities for
        other products and services offered by RealPage.
      Steve Winn, Chairman and CEO of RealPage
      “With many apartment markets softening around the U.S., now is the right
      time to bring together the best data-science talent, a comprehensive
      lease-transaction database, and RealPage’s powerful suite of pricing,
      demand and credit optimization tools into one comprehensive platform.
      Price optimization creates real opportunity to increase asset values and
      yields from the nearly $3.0 trillion of apartment stock in the U.S. that
      turns over at approximately $150 billion per year. As revenue management
      becomes more broadly accepted, we expect our combined platform to drive
      accelerated, sustained revenue growth in our Asset Optimization product
      family over the long-term. We believe we have all of the components
      necessary to offer solutions that bring efficiency and precision to the
      apartment real estate sector which has historically lacked the solutions
      available in other investment classes.”
    Bryan Hill, CFO and Treasurer of RealPage
      “The acquisition of LRO fits within our capital allocation strategy of
      generating the highest risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders. We
      expect the acquisition to be immediately accretive to our adjusted
      EBITDA margin, contributing to our ongoing objective to expand adjusted
      EBITDA margin approximately 200 basis points per year. The transaction
      will be financed through an expanded debt arrangement with our current
      bank syndicate.”
    Financial and Operational Highlights
      The completion of the acquisition remains subject to certain standard
      conditions, and is expected to close during the second quarter of
      2017. The acquisition purchase price of approximately $300 million in
      cash is subject to working capital adjustments and post-acquisition
      indemnification claims. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the LRO
      business possessed revenue and EBITDA of $35.6 million and $10 million,
      respectively. Integration work is expected to be completed in 2018 and
      RealPage expects to achieve incremental revenue and expense synergies
      that will be accretive to its long term revenue growth objectives and
      Adjusted EBITDA margin expansion.
    
      Bruce Barfield, CEO and Founder, and Tammy Farley, COO and Founder, are
      expected to remain with The Rainmaker Group to run the gaming and
      hospitality division, but have agreed to work closely with RealPage
      during a transition period immediately after the acquisition is closed.

      Statements

      RealPage, Inc.’s financial outlook, expected, possible or assumed future
      results and RealPage’s long-term revenue and adjusted EBITDA margin
      goals. These forward-looking statements are based on management's

      that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not
      limited to, the following: (a) the possibility that general economic

      industry, to be reduced or purchasing decisions to be delayed; (b) an
      increase in insurance claims; (c) an increase in customer cancellations;

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Growth Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Last updated January 13, 2016

RealPage, Inc. (“RealPage”) is committed to providing our product and service users with clear and concise information regarding our privacy policy and practices. This Privacy Policy describes in detail our policy and practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of user information by the RealPage family of companies, products, and services. By accessing our websites or utilizing our products and services, you consent to the information collection and handling practices outlined in this policy.

Information Collection


RealPage may collect various types of information, both personal and anonymous, through our products, services, and websites. The information is gathered from your usage of our products and services, as well as from your entry of information on our websites. This collected information consists of two basic types of data: 1) personal information and 2) non-personal information.


Personal information is information that can be used to uniquely identify you as an individual or contact you directly. This may include contact information such as your name, address, telephone number, and email address. For certain financial, health, or credit-based products and services, personal information may also include sensitive data such as payment data, credit records, social security numbers, date of birth, and account numbers. Personal information is only collected based upon your choice to provide it to RealPage through our products, services, and websites. You have the option to choose not to provide personal information to us; however, the lack of such personal information will typically prevent RealPage from providing the requested products or services to you.


If you provide us personal information about others, or if others give us your information, we will only use that information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us.
Non-personal information is general information that does not permit direct association with you as an individual. When you browse RealPage websites, we may automatically collect non-personal information such as your IP address, device information, browser, internet connection speed, past web pages visited, and your link selections on our various website pages. This information may be used to: (1) manage and protect our websites, products, services, and users from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; and (2) help us research, develop, and improve our websites, products, and services. This type of information may also be aggregated or otherwise rendered anonymous for business and marketing uses by us or by third parties.

Except as explained in this Privacy Policy, RealPage does not sell, license, or share our users’ information outside the RealPage family of companies without the consent and authorization of the user whose information will be shared.


We may share your information within the RealPage family of companies, products, and services for operational and marketing purposes. The RealPage companies that access your information will do so in conformity with the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

RealPage may periodically send offers, promotions, and updates regarding RealPage products and services to current and potential users via e-mail. Every marketing e-mail RealPage sends contains instructions and procedures allowing you to opt out of additional marketing e-mails for that product or service.


In some circumstances, we use third-party companies, agents, and contractors to perform services on our behalf, such as website optimization, email distribution, processing credit card transactions, infrastructure and IT services, background screening, and other data analysis, processing, or handling functions. In the course of engaging these third party services, RealPage only shares your information to the extent reasonably necessary for the third party to perform the services on our behalf. We do not permit these third parties to use or disclose your personal information except for the purpose of providing the services we request of them. However, please note that RealPage does not maintain control over the privacy policies and practices of any third party companies, agents, or contractors.

RealPage also reserves the right to disclose user information if we reasonably believe that such disclosure is necessary to (1) satisfy any applicable legal or regulatory requirement, (2) to respond to a governmental request, as required by law such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process (3) enforce RealPage Terms of Use or investigate potential violations thereof, (4) to protect against fraudulent, malicious, abusive, unauthorized or unlawful use of RealPage products, services, and websites, or (5) to protect our rights or property, or the safety or security of our customers, employees or data.


If RealPage enters into any business transition, restructuring, merger, sale, or other transferring of assets, we reserve the right to transfer user information, including all personal information, as part of or in connection with the transaction. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.
