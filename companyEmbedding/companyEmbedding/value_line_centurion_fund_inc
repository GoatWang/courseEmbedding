(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") is intended to help a reader understand Value Line, its operations and business factors. The MD&A should be read in conjunction with Item 1, "Business", Item 1A, "Risk Factors", and in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes contained in Item 8 of this report.  The MD&A includes the following subsections:  ? Executive Summary of the Business  ? Results of Operations  ? Liquidity and Capital Resources  ? Recent Accounting Pronouncements  ? Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies  Executive Summary of the Business  The Company's core business is producing investment periodicals and their underlying research and making available copyright data, including certain proprietary Ranking System and other proprietary information, to third parties under written agreements for use in third-party managed and marketed investment products and for other purposes. Value Line markets under well-known brands including Value Line(R), the Value Line logo(R), The Value Line Investment Survey(R), Smart Research. Smarter Investing(TM) and The Most Trusted Name in Investment Research(R). The name "Value Line" as used to describe the Company, its products, and its subsidiaries, is a registered trademark of the Company. Prior to December 23, 2010, (see "Asset Management and Mutual Fund Distribution Businesses" below), the Company provided investment management services to the Value Line(R) Mutual Funds ("Value Line Funds"), institutional and individual accounts and provided distribution, marketing, and administrative services to the Value Line Funds. Since December 23, 2010, EULAV Asset Management Trust ("EAM") was established to provide the investment management services to the Value Line Funds, institutional and individual accounts and provide distribution, marketing, and administrative services to the Value Line(R) Mutual Funds ("Value Line Funds"). The Company maintains a significant investment in EAM from which it receives non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests. Pursuant to the EAM Declaration of Trust, the Company granted EAM the right to use the Value Line name for all existing Value Line Funds and agreed to supply the Value Line proprietary Ranking System information to EAM without charge or expense.  The Company's target audiences within the investment research field are individual investors, colleges, libraries, and investment management professionals. Individuals come to Value Line for complete research in one package. Institutional licensees consist of corporations, financial professionals, colleges, and municipal libraries. Libraries and universities offer the Company's detailed research to their patrons and students. Investment management professionals use the research and historical information in their day-to-day businesses. The Company has a dedicated department that solicits institutional subscriptions.  Payments received for new and renewal subscriptions and the value of receivables for amounts billed to retail and institutional customers are recorded as unearned revenue until the order is fulfilled. As the orders are fulfilled, the Company recognizes revenue in equal installments over the life of the particular subscription. Accordingly, the subscription fees to be earned by fulfilling subscriptions after the date of a particular balance sheet are shown on that balance sheet as unearned revenue within current and long term liabilities.  The Company's move to new headquarters in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 resulted in lower rent expense over the term of the sublease. However, rental expenses during fiscal 2014 included additional one time overlapping rent of $771,000 for the previously occupied office facilities to permit an orderly move during the short term lease extension which ended September 15, 2013.  Prior to December 23, 2010, the Company's businesses consolidated into two reportable business segments. The investment periodicals and related publications (retail and institutional) and fees from copyright data including the proprietary Ranking System information and other proprietary information consolidate into one segment called Publishing and the investment management services to the Value Line Funds and other managed accounts were consolidated into a second business segment called Investment Management. Subsequent to December 23, 2010, the Publishing segment constitutes the Company's only reportable business segment.  Asset Management and Mutual Fund Distribution Businesses  The Company completed the restructuring of its asset management and mutual fund distribution businesses (the "Restructuring Transaction") on December 23, 2010 (the "Restructuring Date") and executed the EAM Declaration of Trust (the "EAM Declaration of Trust"). Pursuant to the EAM Declaration of Trust, the Company received an interest in certain revenues of EAM and a portion of the residual profits of EAM but has no voting authority with respect to the election or removal of the trustees of EAM.  The business of EAM is managed by its trustees each owning 20% of the voting profits interest in EAM and by its officers subject to the direction of the trustees. The Company's non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests in EAM entitle it to receive a range of 41% to 55% of EAM's revenues (excluding distribution revenues) from EAM's mutual fund and separate account business and 50% of the residual profits of EAM (subject to temporary increase in certain limited circumstances). The Voting Profits Interest Holders will receive the other 50% of residual profits of EAM. Distribution is not less than 90% of EAM's profits payable each fiscal quarter under the provisions of the EAM Trust Agreement. Value Line's percent share of EAM's revenues calculated each fiscal quarter was 50.05%, 50.16%, 50.14% and 49.97% during the first, second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2016, respectively, and 49.18%, 49.63%, 49.80% and 49.87% during the first, second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2015, respectively.  Pursuant to the EAM Declaration of Trust, the Company granted EAM the right to use the Value Line name for all existing Value Line Funds and agreed to supply the Value Line proprietary Ranking System information to EAM without charge or expense.  Business Environment  The nation's economy slowed during the fourth quarter of calendar 2015, and then proceeded to grow even a little more anemically during the opening three months of calendar 2016, with the U.S. gross domestic product increasing just tepidly during the latest span. Setbacks in nonresidential fixed investment (in part from declining energy sector capital spending), in federal government spending, and in exports were the principal drags on growth. Such weakness was offset to a degree by modest improvement in residential construction and consumer spending.  Meanwhile, the second quarter of calendar 2016 likely saw some notable improvement, underpinned by a strengthening in housing, further increases in consumer spending, and some emerging stability on the manufacturing and non-manufacturing fronts. To be sure, GDP growth may still have been hampered by a weak export market, excessive inventories, and the aforementioned decline in the energy-sector capital spending. But there should have been enough offsetting strength for the nation's gross domestic product to have pushed forward solidly in the just-concluded three months.  Thereafter, some working down in inventories, further strength in the housing and consumer spending areas (aided by a presumptive acceleration in employment growth), and a less-ominous outlook in the energy markets, should help generate reasonable levels of growth in the second half of this year. Such a prospect would likely enable the Federal Reserve to pursue slightly tighter monetary policies later in 2016 or thereafter.  Meanwhile, the global outlook is still unsettled, with slowing business growth in China, the apparent British break from the European Union, continuing economic ills and ongoing terrorist threats and actions across parts of Europe, and periodic crises in the Middle East (including intermittent terrorism in that region) headlining the problems offshore as we head toward the latter stages of 2016. To date, the U.S. economy has remained quite well insulated from these global headwinds. In all, and assuming the ailing commodities markets are now stabilizing on a long-term basis, our country's gradual economic improvement should continue.  Results of Operations for Fiscal Years 2016, 2015 and 2014 The following table illustrates the Company's key components of revenues and expenses. Fiscal Years Ended April 30, 2016 2015 2014 Change ($ in thousands, except earnings per share) '16 vs. '15 '15 vs. '14 Income from operations $ 1,880 $ 2,399 $ 2,501 -21.6 % -4.1 % Revenues and profits interests from EAM Trust $ 7,651 $ 7,970 $ 7,499 -4.0 % 6.3 % Income from operations plus non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests from EAM Trust $ 9,531 $ 10,369 $ 10,000 -8.1 % 3.7 % Operating expenses $ 32,666 $ 33,124 $ 33,830 -1.4 % -2.1 % Income from securities transactions, net $ 477 $ 126 $ 178 278.6 % -29.2 % Income before income taxes $ 10,008 $ 10,495 $ 10,178 -4.6 % 3.1 % Net income $ 7,291 $ 7,292 $ 6,768 0.0 % 7.7 % Earnings per share $ 0.75 $ 0.74 $ 0.69 1.4 % 7.2 %  During the twelve months ended April 30, 2016, the Company's net income of $7,291,000, or $0.75 per share, was comparable to net income of $7,292,000, or $0.74 per share, for the twelve months ended April 30, 2015. During the twelve months ended April 30, 2016 there were 9,781,495 average common shares outstanding as compared to 9,813,623 average common shares outstanding during the twelve months ended April 30, 2015. Income from operations of $1,880,000 for the twelve months ended April 30, 2016 which included additional depreciation and amortization expense of $1,102,000 was $519,000 below income from operations of $2,399,000 for the twelve months ended April 30, 2015. During the fourth quarter ended April 30, 2016, the Company's reported loss from operations of $462,000 was the result of the accelerated amortization of the capitalized software development costs.  During the twelve months ended April 30, 2015, the Company's net income of $7,292,000, or $0.74 per share, was $524,000 or 7.7% above net income of $6,768,000, or $0.69 per share, for the twelve months ended April 30, 2014. Income from operations of $2,399,000 for the twelve months ended April 30, 2015 which included additional depreciation and amortization expense of $630,000 including accelerated amortization of $138,000 related to obsolete software recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 was $102,000 below income from operations of $2,501,000 for the twelve months ended April 30, 2014. During the fourth quarter ended April 30, 2015, the Company's reported loss from operations of $560,000 was the result of 12 weeks of print revenues recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 as compared to 13 weeks recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, and an additional direct marketing campaign in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and the accelerated write-off of obsolete software.  Income from operations for the twelve months ended April 30, 2014 of $2,501,000 included additional depreciation and amortization expense of $533,000 and one time overlapping rent expense of $771,000 for the previously occupied office facilities during the short term lease extension that ended September 15, 2013.  Total operating revenues   Fiscal Years Ended April 30, Change ($ in thousands) 2016 2015 2014 '16 vs. '15 '15 vs. '14 Investment periodicals and related publications: Print $ 15,659 $ 16,553 $ 18,346 -5.4 % -9.8 % Digital 16,266 16,123 15,252 0.9 % 5.7 % Total investment periodicals and related publications 31,925 32,676 33,598 -2.3 % -2.7 % Copyright data fees 2,621 2,847 2,733 -7.9 % 4.2 % Total publishing revenues $ 34,546 $ 35,523 $ 36,331 -2.8 % -2.2 %  During the twelve months ended April 30, 2016 total publishing revenues from investment periodicals and related publications excluding copyright data fees were $31,925,000, which is 2.3% below the total publishing revenues excluding copyright data fees of $32,676,000 during the twelve months ended April 30, 2015. Total publishing revenues from investment periodicals and related publications excluding copyright data fees were $33,598,000 during the twelve months ended April 30, 2014.  Within investment periodicals and related publications, subscription sales orders are derived from print and digital products. The following chart illustrates the changes in the sales orders associated with print and digital subscriptions.  Sources of subscription sales   Fiscal Years Ended April 30, 2016 2015 2014 Print Digital Print Digital Print Digital New Sales 12.0 % 24.7 % 12.4 % 28.6 % 19.0 % 24.3 % Conversion and Renewal Sales 88.0 % 75.3 % 87.6 % 71.4 % 81.0 % 75.7 % Total Gross Sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 %  During the twelve months ended April 30, 2016 new sales of print and digital publications decreased as a percent of the total gross print and digital sales as a result of less aggressive promotion to first-time customers at introductory prices. Conversion and renewal sales orders increased over fiscal 2015 outpacing the decrease in new sales orders as a result of increased success by our in-house Retail and Institutional Sales departments.  During the twelve months ended April 30, 2015 new sales of print publications decreased as a percent of the total gross sales while conversion and renewal revenues increased from fiscal 2014 as a result of increased resources of the in-house Telemarketing department. New sales of digital products in fiscal 2015 showed a marked increase over fiscal 2014.   As of April 30, Change ($ in thousands) 2016 2015 2014 '16 vs. '15 '15 vs. '14 Unearned subscription revenue (current and long term liabilities) $ 25,442 $ 26,047 $ 25,124 -2.3 % 3.7 %  Unearned subscription revenue as of April 30, 2016 is 2.3% below April 30, 2015 and is 3.7% above April 30, 2014. The decline from April 30, 2015, reflects curtailed advertising for order generation. Further, a certain amount of variation is to be expected due to the volume of new orders and timing of renewal orders, direct mail campaigns and higher priced Institutional Sales orders.  Investment periodicals and related publications revenues  Investment periodicals and related publications revenues decreased $751,000, or 2.3%, for the twelve months ended April 30, 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015. The Company continued its efforts to attract new subscribers through various marketing channels, primarily direct mail, e-mail, and by the efforts of our sales personnel. Total product line circulation at April 30, 2016 was 3.7% below total product line circulation at April 30, 2015. The Company has been successful in growing revenues from digitally-delivered investment periodicals within the institutional market. Institutional Sales generated total sales orders of $14,240,000 for the twelve months ended April 30, 2016 which were $915,000 or 6.9%, above comparable total sales orders of $13,325,000, for the twelve months ended April 30, 2015. This growth continues a positive trend for Institutional Sales, but is not sufficient to wholly offset the lost revenues from retail subscribers. We have also benefited from "converting" some customers from lower cost retail to the more robust professional priced services.  Digital publications revenues during the twelve months ended April 30, 2016 were $143,000 above fiscal 2015. Revenues from institutional digital publications increased $749,000 or 6.9% as compared to fiscal 2015. Digital publications revenues from retail subscribers decreased $606,000 or 11.6% with circulation decreasing by 7.2% for the twelve months ended April 30, 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015. During the twelve months ended April 30, 2016, $191,000 of retail digital revenues were converted to higher priced Institutional Sales orders generating $159,000 additional revenues.  Print publication revenues decreased $894,000 or 5.4% for the twelve months ended April 30, 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. Revenues from institutional print publications increased $165,000 or 8.4% while print publications revenues from retail subscribers decreased $1,059,000 or 7.3% for the twelve months ended April 30, 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015. Total print circulation at April 30, 2016 was 2.4% below total print circulation at April 30, 2015 including an increase in the introductory lower-priced Value Line 600 print product. The VL 600 was utilized during fiscal 2016 and the latter part of 2015 as a retail lead-generation product. Though revenue from expiring full-price subscriptions has not been matched by the initial revenue from new promotional retail orders, our retail sales and marketing personnel have made an effort to renew and upgrade the new customers.  The Company has marketed The Value Line 600 and digital Investor 600 services as "starter" products to familiarize new customers with our services at attractive prices. The Company seeks to expand familiarity with our brand through this means, exposing our offerings to new customers who heretofore may not have been familiar with our services. Our goal is to introduce these investors to Value Line and ultimately to attract many to additional, premium-priced services targeted at their specific needs for investment research on various classes of equities including mutual funds and ETFs. Such a step-up strategy has been seen in the faster-than-expected acceptance of The Value Line 900 service, featuring an expanded mix of established and newer/smaller companies, by a number of new-to-the-Company Investor 600 and The Value Line 600 subscribers. Moreover, by growing our active customer base, the retail sales team and marketing staff have thousands more subscribers to whom they offer our more sophisticated services. The brand exposure philosophy is additionally reinforced by our selective efforts to join forces with other well respected financial industry participants through our copyright data and other distribution efforts under our Institutional Services umbrella.  Investment periodicals and related publications revenues decreased $922,000, or 2.7%, for the twelve months ended April 30, 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014. Total product line circulation at April 30, 2015 was 5.8% above total product line circulation at April 30, 2014, continuing a positive trend of increased subscribers at modestly lower average prices. Institutional Sales generated total sales orders of $13,325,000 for the twelve months ended April 30, 2015 which were $481,000 or 3.7%, above comparable total sales orders of $12,844,000, for the twelve months ended April 30, 2014.  Digital publications revenues increased $871,000 or 5.7% for the twelve months ended April 30, 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. Revenues from institutional digital publications increased $923,000 or 9.3% for the twelve months ended April 30, 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014. Digital publications revenues from retail subscribers decreased 1% for the twelve months ended April 30, 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014. At April 30, 2015 total digital product circulation has increased 6.4% above total digital product circulation at April 30, 2014.  Print publication revenues decreased $1,793,000 or 9.8% for the twelve months ended April 30, 2015 from fiscal 2014. Revenues from institutional print publications increased $60,000 or 3.1% for the twelve months ended April 30, 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. Print publications revenues from retail subscribers decreased $1,853,000 or 11.3% for the twelve months ended April 30, 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014. Total print circulation at April 30, 2015 was 5.5% above total print circulation at April 30, 2014 including a 200% increase in the introductory lower-priced Value Line 600 print product. The VL 600 was utilized during fiscal 2015 as a retail lead generation product.  The Company has relied more on its personnel selling efforts in both the institutional segment and retail retention and sales, as the ability to obtain orders profitably through traditional direct marketing plateaus. The majority of the Company's subscribers have traditionally been individual investors who generally receive printed publications via U.S. Mail on a weekly basis. Individual investors interested in digitally-delivered investment information have access to both free and subscription equity research from many sources. Continuing factors that have contributed to the decline in the retail digital investment periodicals and related publications revenues include competition in the form of free or low cost investment research on the Internet and research provided by brokerage firms at no direct cost to their clients. Further, there appears to be a relative decline in individuals' interest in holding specific stocks as compared with ETFs, mutual funds and participation in retirement plans. In order to address competition the Company has emphasized its lower-priced "starter" levels of service in attracting new customers. Also many of the professional subscribers to the Company's digital and print retail products have been successfully converted to a higher priced Institutional product, with the peak impact of such movement behind us. The Company offers quality publications on mutual funds and Exchange Traded Funds, but they have achieved only modest market share.  Value Line serves primarily individual and professional investors in stocks, who pay, primarily on annual subscription plans, for basic services or as much as $100,000 or more annually for comprehensive premium quality research, not obtainable elsewhere. The ongoing goal of adding new subscribers has led us to experiment with varying terms for our reliable, proprietary research including a period of intensive promotion of "starter" services and publications.  Copyright data fees  The Value Line proprietary Ranking System information (the "Ranking System"), a component of the Company's flagship product, The Value Line Investment Survey, is also utilized in the Company's copyright data business. The Ranking System is made available to EAM for specific uses without charge. The Ranking System is designed to be predictive over a six to twelve month period. For the six month periods ended April 30, 2016, the combined Ranking System "Rank 1 & 2" stocks' decrease of 1.3% was better than the Russell 2000 index decrease of 2.5%. For the twelve month period ended April 30, 2016, the combined Ranking System "Rank  During the twelve months ended April 30, 2016, copyright data fees of $2,621,000 were 7.9% below fiscal 2015. As of April 30, 2016, total third party sponsored assets were attributable to three contracts for copyright data representing $1.8 billion in various products, as compared to four contracts for copyright data representing $2.3 billion in assets at April 30, 2015. The value of assets managed by third party sponsors was affected by reassigning assets in their portfolios to a management approach independent of Value Line's copyright data program effective April 2015. The Company has retained our highest-fee client. During the twelve months ended April 30, 2014, copyright data fees were $2,733,000 and total third party sponsored assets were attributable to four contracts for copyright data representing $2.3 billion in various products, in assets at April 30, 2014.  The Company believes this part of the business is dependent upon the desire of third parties to use the Value Line trademarks and proprietary research for their products, on competition and on fluctuations in segments of the equity markets. Management is actively pursuing potential channels for the copyright data products, including Ranking System-based concepts as well as other proprietary quantitative models.  Investment management fees and services - (unconsolidated)  The Company has a substantial non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests in EAM, the asset manager to the Value Line Mutual Funds. Accordingly, the Company does not report this operation as a separate business segment, although it maintains a significant interest in the cash flows generated by this business and will receive ongoing payments in respect of its non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests.  Total assets in the Value Line Funds managed and/or distributed by EAM at April 30, 2016, were $2.2 billion, which is $128 million, or 5.4%, below total assets of $2.4 billion in the Value Line Funds managed and/or distributed by EAM at April 30, 2015, reflecting market depreciation and the net redemptions all over the past twelve months ended April 30, 2016.  The largest decline of approximately $60 million is in the Guardian channel. Shares of Value Line Strategic Asset Management Trust ("SAM") and Value Line Centurion Fund ("Centurion") are within certain variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts issued by The Guardian Insurance & Annuity Company, Inc. ("GIAC"); new contracts of this type are no longer sold. The two funds consequently continue to experience net redemptions. Starting January 2015, the Value Line VIP Equity Advantage Fund was added to the Guardian Pro Series Variable Annuities. The fund is an open end fund that invests primarily in a basket of closed-end funds.  Total assets in the Value Line Funds managed and/or distributed by EAM at April . . .

II. BACKGROUND
 
Overview
From 1986 to November 2004, VLI directed approximately $24.2 million in brokerage commissions from the Value Line Funds to an affiliated broker-dealer, Value Line Securities, Inc. (“VLS”), without disclosing to the Funds or the Funds’ shareholders that VLS did not provide any brokerage services to the Funds for these commissions.  On November 4, 2009, the Commission, VLI, VLS, and two individuals at these companies1entered into a settlement, described in greater detail below, in which VLI paid to the Commission $24,168,979 in disgorgement, $9,536,786 in prejudgment interest, and $10,000,000 as a civil penalty.  These amounts have been paid and placed into a Fair Fund created by the Commission.  The Distribution Plan proposes to distribute from the Fair Fund to eligible investors their share of losses resulting from the violations, plus interest.
 
The Distribution Plan is subject to approval by the Commission, and the Commission retains jurisdiction over implementation of the Distribution Plan. 
 
Settlement Description
On November 4, 2009, the Commission entered an Order Instituting Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order Pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 15(b)(4), 15(b)(6) and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Sections 203(e), 203(f) and 203(k) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and Sections 9(b) and 9(f) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (Securities Act Release No. 9081) (the “Order”) with respect to Respondents.  Simultaneously with the entry of the Order, the Commission accepted settlement offers from Respondents in which Respondents consented to the entry of the Order without admitting or denying the Order’s findings, except as to jurisdiction.
 
In the Order, the Commission found that VLI, VLS, Buttner, and Henigson willfully violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder; VLI willfully violated Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”), and VLS, Buttner, and Henigson willfully aided and abetted and caused VLI’s violations of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act; VLI willfully violated Section 207 of the Advisers Act; VLI willfully violated Section 15(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (“Investment Company Act”); VLI and VLS willfully violated Section 17(e)(1) of the Investment Company Act; and VLI, Buttner, and Henigson willfully violated Section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act.  As a remedial sanction, the Commission ordered that VLI pay disgorgement in the amount of $24,168,979, plus prejudgment interest of $9,536,786.  Additionally, civil monetary penalties were ordered to be paid by VLI in the amount of $10,000,000, by Buttner in the amount of $1,000,000, and by Henigson in the amount of $250,000.
 
In accordance with the Order, monies totaling $44,955,765 were paid to the Commission, of which $43,705,765 comprising VLI’s payment of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties was used to create a Fair Fund pursuant to Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, 15 U.S.C. Section 7246, and Rule 1100 of the Commission’s Rules on Fair Funds and Disgorgement Plans, 17 C.F.R. 201.100.  The SEC Fair Fund (also referred to herein as the “Distribution Fund”) has been deposited at the U.S. Department of the Treasury Bureau of the Public Debt (“BPD”) for investment.  Other than interest from those investments, it is not anticipated the SEC Fair Fund will receive additional funds.
 
The purpose and intent of the Distribution Plan is to distribute a portion of the Distribution Fund to persons who held shares of any of the Value Line Funds during the Relevant Period2 based on the Plan of Allocation described herein.  The Fund Administrator has agreed to take reasonable steps to identify and contact all potential Claimants3, verify each potential Claimant’s eligibility to receive a share of the Distribution Fund4,  calculate each Claimant’s Disbursement5 amount, resolve any disputes, and distribute the Distribution Fund to those Claimants whom the Fund Administrator determines to be eligible.
 
WHO IS ELIGIBLE?
 
III. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA AND THE DISTRIBUTION FORMULA
 
Generally
The Net Distribution Fund6 shall be distributed based on the acceptable, timely claims forms submitted by Eligible Claimants7 as calculated pursuant to the Allocation Methodology described below.  Eligible Claimants are those Claimants the Fund Administrator determines to be entitled to receive Disbursements from the Distribution Fund.
Allocation Methodology
The Allocation Methodology is as follows:
(a) Each Eligible Claimant shall be paid from the Net Distribution Fund their share of losses, plus interest thereon, as calculated by the methodology described in this paragraph.  
(b) The Fund Administrator shall determine each Eligible Claimant’s allocation of the Net Distribution Fund based on the shares in the Value Line Funds held by the Eligible Claimant at the end of each calendar quarter during the Relevant Period8.  (c) The Fund Administrator will calculate each Eligible Claimant’s share of the Net Distribution Fund as follows:

Calculate the average yearly share holdings in each Fund held by each Eligible Claimant for each calendar year during the Relevant Period using the shares held at each calendar quarter end (“Average Yearly Holdings”);
Calculate the amount of Harm Per Share for each Fund for each year in the Relevant Period by dividing the estimated amount of brokerage commissions overpaid by each Fund for each year during the Relevant Period by the total number of shares in each Fund for each year (“Harm Per Share”);9  
Multiply the Harm Per Share for each Fund for each year in the Relevant Period by the Average Yearly Holdings for each Eligible Claimant to determine an Eligible Claimant’s harm for each year for each respective Fund (“Annualized Harm”); 
Each Eligible Claimant shall also receive interest on his/her Annualized Harm.  The interest paid will be based on the three month T-bill rate published by the U.S. Treasury, compounded annually through the approximate date of the disbursement of the Distribution Fund.  
The total of each year of Annualized Harm plus interest thereon for all shares claimed pursuant to the calculations above is each Eligible Claimant’s Disbursement from the Net Distribution Fund.
Each Eligible Claimant shall receive his/her allocation of the Net Distribution Fund as determined by the above methodology except that no payment will be issued to any Eligible Claimant whose total Disbursement Amount is less than $10.00 (the “De Minimis Threshold”).
 
IV. CLAIM DETERMINATIONS AND DISTRIBUTION
 
Within one hundred eighty (180) days after the close of the claims period, the Fund Administrator shall notify, in writing, all persons whose claims the Fund Administrator rejected for participation in the Distribution Fund.  The Fund Administrator shall advise each person in writing of the basis for rejection of their claim.
 
Any person who seeks reconsideration of the denial must so advise the Fund Administrator within twenty (20) days of the postmark date of the initial denial of the claim.  Following subsequent review, the Fund Administrator shall notify such person in writing of the Fund Administrator’s decision, which shall be final.
 
Claimants will be able to utilize the toll-free phone number to contact the Fund Administrator and ask questions on how to correct their claims.  Claimants will also be able to provide additional documentation or make inquiries using the email address or a dedicated fax number for the case that will be included on all correspondence or by sending correspondence via U.S. Mail.  These contact options will be noted in all written correspondence exchanged with Claimants in regard to their claims.
 
After all objections have been resolved and the determination of eligibility has been reviewed by the SEC, Disbursement checks will be mailed to Eligible Claimants.
