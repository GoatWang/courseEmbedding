Variable annuities are insurance products that are complex, long-term investment vehicles that are subject to market risk, including the potential loss of principal invested.
A fund underlying your contract in which a subaccount invests may have a name, portfolio manager, objectives, strategies and characteristics that are the same or substantially similar to those of a publicly-traded retail mutual fund. Despite these similarities, an underlying fund is not the same as any publicly traded retail mutual fund. Each underlying fund will have its own unique portfolio holdings, fees, operating expenses and operating results. The results of each underlying fund may differ significantly from any publicly-traded retail mutual fund.

procure a judgment in its favor, whether civil or           
criminal, including an action by or in the right of any     
other corporation of any type or kind domestic or           
foreign, which any director or officer or employee of the   
depositor served in any capacity at the request of the      
depositor, by reason of the fact that he, his testator or   
intestate, was a director or officer or employee of the     
depositor, or served such other corporation in any          
capacity, against judgments, fines, amounts paid in         
settlement and reasonable expenses, including attorneys'    
fees, actually and necessarily incurred as a result of      
such action or proceeding, or any appeal therein, if such   
person acted in good faith, for a purpose which he          
reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the      
depositor and, in criminal actions or proceedings, in       
addition had no reasonable cause to believe that his        
conduct was unlawful.

Insofar as indemnification for liability arising under the                      
Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to director, officers and               
controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing                 
provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in               
the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such                      
indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act                
and is, therefore, unenforceable.  In the event that a claim for                
indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by             
the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer              
or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense               
of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director,                
officer or controlling person in connection with the securities                 
being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its             
counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent,                   
submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether              
such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in             
the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such                  
issue.
