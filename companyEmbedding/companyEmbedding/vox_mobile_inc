Intelligent TEM: Keeping your Mobility Spend Optimized –
Today and for the Future



Monitoring and managing the complex factors that constitute mobile spend is a full-time job – one we take seriously. Our Vox Control managed service provides much more than expense reporting. Going beyond the typical Telecom Expense Management solutions, our experience, our people and the analysis of your expenditures, usage trends and carrier contracts allows us to deliver outcomes - verses the traditional approach of presenting you with data that you still have to decipher. 



Leveraging our Encompass platform, we will have the needed insight at the point of action to identify tangible ways to optimize your spend – while ensuring a superior user experience. This valuable service is not a one-and-done, we continuously evaluate if there are changes in your mobile expenses that should be addressed, audit carrier changes, perform accurate departmental cost allocations and make recommendations for improving your mobile costs.

 















Lack of visibility and time is costing your organization dearly in mobile costs
– until now
Most organizations have huge spikes in mobile costs – driven by a lack of visibility in usage trends, compliance issues, needed controls or simply a lack of foresight about future initiatives. Vox Control is a fully managed, outsourced service that will deliver the insights your organization needs to make informed spending decisions and to plan for the future, while assessing critical factors that meet the needs of your mobile users.

CUSTOMER PAIN POINTS


Our mobile expenses have spiked and we don’t know why 
									










There are two drivers to mobility cost: your contract and behavior.  Organizations understand how to negotiate their contracted rates; however, many struggle to bring visibility to behavior.  And unfortunately with mobility, you cannot “set it and forget it.”  Each month, Vox Mobile architects  will analyze your environment to ensure you have the correct pooling, complete business rules such as canceling zero use lines, and email manager summaries detailing the behaviors they should investigate to drive down costs.



How can we be sure we are up to date on the latest carrier plans? 
									










Mobile carriers continually introduce incentives and special rate plans.  While some may seem enticing at first, it is important to apply these promotions to your actual environment and compare your current rates.  This takes a lot of time, time most administrators do not have.  Vox Mobile architects receive all new incentives applicable and will analyze them against your environment. Each month, your service delivery manager will review the proposed changes and complete action items on your behalf.



We need to allocate mobile costs to the appropriate departments 
									










Powered by the Encompass platform, Vox Mobile architects will create your custom allocation methodology and deliver files to your finance team each month, in their required format.  











The Vox Control Process
With Vox Control, you will see usage trends, projected usage for growth and new apps, carrier and technology advancements to build a spending plan that incorporates control points and potential changes.





Plan
Vox Control, a managed service, will identify areas where your mobile spend can be optimized including how to control user behaviors that drive up costs, carrier compliance issues, device procurement practices, and projected mobile needs. An informed budget is a budget that can be managed to.  




Deliver
With Vox Control, you’ll eliminate mobile expense spikes and surprises. You’ll know you are investing in areas that enhance user productivity, responsiveness and satisfaction. The information you will have at your fingertips will enable you to manage to documented processes and demonstrate financial responsibility.




Improve
Vox Control ensures you know the latest available plans, who is using what and every cost attached, as well as factors that increase costs unnecessarily. Actionable reports will empower everyone to make changes that will enable you to consistently optimize your spend and make informed decisions for the future.

Key Capabilities:

Dedicated spend specialists stay up-to-date on carrier offerings
