	Effective April 1, 2016, the following information replaces the
	similar disclosure contained under the “POLICIES ABOUT TRANSACTIONS" section of each fund’s prospectus.



	 



	When you sell shares that have a CDSC

	, the CDSC is based
	on the original purchase cost or current market value of the shares sold, whichever is less. In processing orders to sell shares,
	the shares with the lowest CDSC are sold first. For each investment you make, we use the first day of the month in which you bought
	shares to calculate a CDSC on that particular investment. A CDSC is not imposed when you exchange from one fund into another. However,
	when you sell shares of the fund that you exchanged into a CDSC may be imposed. Any CDSC on sales of exchanged shares will be based
	on the CDSC schedule for the fund you originally purchased and will be based on the shares’ original cost and purchase date.


	 


	 



	Effective April 1, 2016, the following information replaces the
	similar disclosure contained in the “Exchanges” subsection under the “Redemptions" subheading of the “PURCHASES
	AND REDEMPTIONS OF SHARES” section of Part II of each fund’s Statement of Additional Information.



	 



	General

	. Shareholders may request a taxable exchange of their
	shares for shares of the corresponding class of other Deutsche funds without imposition of a sales charge, subject to the provisions
	below. However, when you sell shares of the fund that you exchanged into a CDSC may be imposed. Any CDSC on sales of exchanged
	shares will be based on the CDSC schedule for the fund you originally purchased and will be based on the shares’ original
	cost and purchase date.


	 


	 


	 



	Please Retain This Supplement for Future
	Reference

    R-1843-8 (12/16) Additional Performance InformationFund performance includes reinvestment of all distributions. Important Objectives, Strategy and Risk InformationThe fund seeks long-term capital appreciation. Looking for a solid middle ground? Mid-cap companies combine the attributes of their large- and small-cap peers: Many have established name recognition and products, but are in the prime growth phase of their business cycle. At the same time, they may be nimble enough to respond quickly to product innovations and changes in the marketplace. With Deutsche Mid Cap Value Fund, you can gain access to mid-cap stocks with compelling valuations.Any fund that focuses in a particular segment of the market or region of the world will generally be more volatile than a fund that invests more broadly. Stocks of medium-sized companies involve greater risk than securities of larger, more-established companies. The fund may lend securities to approved institutions. Stocks may decline in value.

For each fund with at least a 3-year history, Morningstar calculates a Rating based on a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund’s monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in a category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

The Morningstar® Equity Style Box™ placement is based on a fund’s valuation relative to the appropriate peer group, as well as the size of the companies in which it invests, or median market capitalization. It represents a snapshot of a fund’s portfolio on a single day, but it’s not exact because a portfolio changes from day to day. A longer term view is represented by the fund’s Morningstar® category, which is based on actual investment style as measured by its underlying holdings over the past three years. For funds younger than three years, the Morningstar® category is estimated.Source: Morningstar, Inc.

The calculation results in a rating system such that for each time period (3-, 5-, 10-years), the top 10% are given a risk score of 5 or High, next 22.5% of 4 or Above Average, next 35% of 3 or Average, next 22.5% of 2 or Below Average and the bottom 10% of 1 or Low.

KEMPER-DREMAN FUND, INC.
SUPPLEMENT TO PROSPECTUS
DATED APRIL 25, 1997
CLASS I SHARES

   Kemper-Dreman Contrarian Fund (the "Contrarian Fund"), Kemper-Dreman High
Return Equity Fund (the "High Return Equity Fund") and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap  
Value Fund (the "Small Cap Value Fund") (collectively, the "Funds") currently   
offer four classes of shares to provide investors with different purchasing     
options. The Class A, Class B and Class C shares are described in the           
prospectus; and Class I shares are described in the prospectus as supplemented  
hereby.                                                                         

Class I shares are available for purchase exclusively by the following
investors: (a) tax-exempt retirement plans of Zurich Kemper Investments, Inc.   
("ZKI"), and its affiliates; and (b) the following investment advisory clients  
of ZKI and its investment advisory affiliates (including Zurich Investment      
Management, Inc. and Dreman Value Advisors, Inc.) that invest at least $1       
million in a Fund: (1) unaffiliated benefit plans, such as qualified retirement 
plans (other than individual retirement accounts and self-directed retirement   
plans); (2) unaffiliated banks and insurance companies purchasing for their own 
accounts; and (3) endowment funds of unaffiliated non-profit organizations.     
Class I shares currently are available for purchase only from Zurich Kemper     
Distributors, Inc., principal underwriter for the Funds. Share certificates are 
not available for Class I shares.                                               

 The primary distinctions among the classes of each Fund's shares lie in
their initial and contingent deferred sales charge schedules and in their       
ongoing expenses, including asset-based sales charges in the form of Rule 12b-1 
distribution fees. Class I shares are offered at net asset value without an     
initial sales charge and are not subject to a contingent deferred sales charge  
or a Rule 12b-1 distribution fee. Also, there is no administrative services fee 
charged to Class I shares. As a result of the relatively lower expenses for     
Class I shares, the level of income dividends per share (as a percentage of net 
asset value) and, therefore, the overall investment return, will typically be   
higher for Class I shares than for Class A, Class B and Class C shares.         

The following information supplements the indicated sections of the   
prospectus.

The purpose of the preceding table is to assist investors in understanding the  
various costs and expenses that an investor in Class I shares of a Fund will    
bear directly or indirectly. See "Investment Manager and Underwriter" in the    
prospectus for more information. Since no Class I shares had been issued for the
Contrarian Fund as of the fiscal year end, "Other Expenses" shown above are     
estimates for that Fund.                                                        

"Management Fees" and "Other Expenses" in the tables above have been restated to
reflect current fees.                                                           

The Example assumes a 5% annual rate of return pursuant to requirements of the  
Securities and Exchange Commission. This hypothetical rate of return is not     
intended to be representative of past or future performance of any Fund. The    
Example should not be considered to be a representation of past or future       
expenses. Actual expenses may be greater or lesser than those shown.

NOTES: Total return does not reflect the effect of any sales charges. The       
 investment manager waived its management fee and absorbed operating
   expenses of the Funds through December 31, 1995. The "Other Ratios to
Average Net Assets" are completed without this expense waiver or  
absorption.                                                       

   For the Small Cap Value Fund, per share data for 1996 were determined
based on average shares outstanding.                              

No financial information is presented for Class I shares of the Contrarian Fund 
since no Class I shares have been issued as of such Fund's fiscal year end.

KEMPER-DREMAN FUND, INC.                                                        
222 SOUTH RIVERSIDE PLAZA, CHICAGO, ILLINOIS 60606, TELEPHONE 1-800-621-1048    
SUMMARY                                                                         

INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES. The Kemper-Dreman Fund, Inc. ("KDF") is an open-end,     
diversified management investment company. KDF's three portfolios ("Funds")     
covered in this prospectus are as follows:                                      

KEMPER-DREMAN CONTRARIAN FUND (the "Contrarian Fund") seeks long-term capital   
appreciation with current income as its secondary objective.                    

KEMPER-DREMAN HIGH RETURN EQUITY FUND (the "High Return Equity Fund") seeks to  
achieve a high rate of total return.                                            

KEMPER-DREMAN SMALL CAP VALUE FUND (the "Small Cap Value Fund") seeks long-term 
capital appreciation.                                                           

RISK FACTORS. There is no assurance that the investment objective of any Fund   
will be achieved and investment in each Fund includes risks that vary in kind   
and degree depending upon the investment policies of that Fund. The returns and 
net asset value of each Fund will fluctuate. The Funds will invest principally  
in securities that, in the judgment of the investment manager, are undervalued. 
Investment by the Small Cap Value Fund primarily in smaller companies involves  
greater risk than investment in larger, more established companies. The Funds   
are authorized to invest in stock index futures and options to buy and sell such
futures. In these investments, the Funds assume the risk that, if the investment
manager's judgment regarding the direction of the securities markets is         
incorrect, their investment performance might have been better if they had not  
acquired futures contracts. The Funds are authorized to write covered call      
options on securities. The High Return Equity and Small Cap Value Funds may     
write put options. If the market price of stock subject to a call option rises  
above the exercise price of the option, the Funds will lose the opportunity for 
further appreciation of that security. In selling a put option, the High Return 
Equity and Small Cap Value Funds assume the risk that they might be obligated to
acquire the optioned stock at a price above the current market price. See       
"Investment Objectives, Policies and Risk Factors."                             

PURCHASES AND REDEMPTIONS. KDF provides investors with the option of purchasing 
shares in the following ways:                                                   

Class A Shares..............                                                    
                     Offered at net asset value plus a maximum sales
                          charge of 5.75% of the offering price. Reduced sales
                          charges apply to purchases of $50,000 or more. Class
                           A shares purchased at net asset value under the Large
                         Order NAV Purchase Privilege may be subject to a 1%
                         contingent deferred sales charge if redeemed within
                         one year of purchase and a .50% contingent deferred
                        sales change if redeemed during the second year of
purchase.                 

Class B Shares..............                                                    
                         Offered at net asset value, subject to a Rule 12b-1
                      distribution fee and a contingent deferred sales
                     charge that declines from 4% to zero on certain
                          redemptions made within six years of purchase. Class
                        B shares automatically convert into Class A shares
                         (which have lower ongoing expenses) six years after
purchase.                 

Class C Shares..............                                                    
                         Offered at net asset value without an initial sales
                          charge, but subject to a Rule 12b-1 distribution fee
                  and a 1% contingent deferred sales charge on
                           redemptions made within one year of purchase. Class C
               shares do not convert into another class.

Each class of shares represents interests in the same portfolio of investments  
of a Fund. The minimum initial investment is $1,000 and investments thereafter  
must be at least $100. Shares are redeemable at net asset value, which may be   
more or less than original cost, subject to any applicable contingent deferred  
sales charge. See "Purchase of Shares" and "Redemption or Repurchase of Shares."

INVESTMENT MANAGER AND UNDERWRITER. Dreman Value Advisors, Inc. ("DVA") serves  
as investment manager for each Fund. DVA is paid an investment management fee by
each Fund based upon average daily net assets of that Fund at an annual rate    
ranging from .75% to .62%. Zurich Kemper Distributors, Inc. ("ZKDI"), an        
affiliate of DVA, is principal underwriter and administrator for each Fund. For 
Class B shares and Class C shares, ZKDI receives a Rule 12b-1 distribution fee  
at an annual rate of .75% of average daily net assets. ZKDI also receives the   
amount of any contingent deferred sales charges paid on the redemption of       
shares. Administrative services are provided to shareholders under an           
administrative services agreement with ZKDI. KDF pays an administrative services
fee at an annual rate of up to .25% of average daily net assets of Class A, B   
and C shares of the Funds, which ZKDI pays to financial services firms. See     
"Investment Manager and Underwriter."                                           

DIVIDENDS. The Contrarian and High Return Equity Funds normally distribute      
quarterly dividends of net investment income, the Small Cap Value Fund normally 
distributes annual dividends of net investment income and each Fund distributes 
any net realized capital gains at least annually. Income and capital gain       
dividends of a Fund are automatically reinvested in additional shares of that   
Fund, without sales charge, unless the shareholder makes a different election.  
See "Dividends and Taxes."

(4) As a result of 12b-1 fees, long-term shareholders may pay more than the     
 economic equivalent of the maximum initial sales charges permitted by the
  National Association of Securities Dealers, although ZKDI believes that it
is unlikely because of the automatic conversion feature described under 
"Purchase of Shares--Deferred Sales Charge Alternative--Class B Shares."

(5) As a result of the accrual of 12b-1 fees, long-term shareholders may pay    
more than the economic equivalent of the maximum initial sales charges  
permitted by the National Association of Securities Dealers.

(6) Assumes conversion to Class A shares six years after purchase and was       
 calculated based upon the assumption that the shareholder was an owner of
 the shares on the first day of the first year and the contingent deferred
    sales charge was applied as follows: 1 year (3%), 3 years (2%), 5 years (1%)
and 10 years (0%). See "Redemption or Repurchase of Shares--Contingent
Deferred Sales Charge--Class B Shares" for more information regarding the
calculation of the contingent deferred sales charge.                    

(7) Assumes that the shareholder was the owner on the first day of the first    
   year and the contingent deferred sales charge was not applicable for any of
the periods shown. See "Redemption or Repurchase of Shares--Contingent
Deferred Sales Charge--Class C Shares."                                 

The purpose of the preceding table is to assist investors in understanding the  
various costs and expenses that an investor in a Fund will bear directly or     
indirectly. See "Investment Manager and Underwriter" for more information. DVA  
waived its management fee and absorbed operating expenses of each Fund to the   
extent necessary to limit the Fund's operating expenses to the following        
percentage of such Fund's average net assets through November 11, 1996: Class A 
shares - 1.25%; Class B shares - 2.00%; and Class C shares - 1.95%. "Management 
Fees" and "Other Expenses" in the tables above have been restated to reflect    
current fees.                                                                   

The Example assumes a 5% annual rate of return pursuant to requirements of the  
Securities and Exchange Commission. This hypothetical rate of return is not     
intended to be representative of past or future performance of any Fund. THE    
EXAMPLE SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED TO BE A REPRESENTATION OF PAST OR FUTURE       
EXPENSES. ACTUAL EXPENSES MAY BE GREATER OR LESSER THAN THOSE SHOWN.

INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES, POLICIES AND RISK FACTORS 

The following information sets forth each Fund's investment objective and       
policies. The investment objective of each Fund may be changed without the      
affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding securities of that Fund. Each 
Fund's returns and net asset value will fluctuate and there is no assurance that
any Fund will meet its objective. For a description of how DVA selects specific 
securities for inclusion in a Fund's portfolio, see "Additional Investment
Information."

CONTRARIAN FUND. The Contrarian Fund's primary investment objective is to seek  
long-term capital appreciation and its secondary objective is to seek current   
income. It will invest principally in a diversified portfolio consisting        
primarily of common stocks believed by DVA to be undervalued. Securities of a   
company may be undervalued as a result of overreaction by investors to          
unfavorable news about a company, industry or the stock markets in general or as
a result of a market decline, poor economic conditions, tax-loss selling or     
actual or anticipated unfavorable developments affecting the company.           

The Fund will invest primarily in common stocks of larger, listed companies with
a record of earnings and dividends, low price-earnings ratios, reasonable       
returns on equity, and sound finances which, in the opinion of DVA, have        
intrinsic value. The Fund may, however, from time to time, invest in stocks that
pay no dividends. It is anticipated that most stocks purchased will be listed on
the New York Stock Exchange, but the Fund may also purchase securities listed on
other securities exchanges and in the over-the-counter market. The Fund may sell
call options on securities it holds ("covered call options").                   

HIGH RETURN EQUITY FUND. The High Return Equity Fund's investment objective is  
to achieve a high rate of total return. The common stocks held by the Fund will 
have the same investment characteristics as those held by the Contrarian Fund.  
The Fund generally will invest in common stocks that pay relatively high        
dividends, i.e. comparable to the dividend yield of Standard & Poor's 500       
Composite Stock Index. In order to enhance its investment return, the Fund may  
sell covered call options, and sell put options on securities it may acquire.   
The Fund will earn premium income on the sale of these options.                 

Under normal market conditions, the Fund will invest at least 65% of its total  
assets in equity securities. Equity securities include common stocks, preferred 
stocks, securities convertible into or exchangeable for common or preferred     
stocks, equity investments in partnerships, joint ventures and other forms of   
non-corporate investment and warrants and rights exercisable for equity         
securities and equity equivalents.                                              

While most investments will be in dividend paying stocks, the Fund may also     
acquire stocks that do not pay dividends in anticipation of market appreciation,
future dividends, and when DVA believes that it would be advantageous to write  
options on such stocks. The Fund will be managed with a view to achieving a high
rate of total return on investors' capital primarily through appreciation of its
common stock holdings, options transactions and by acquiring and selling stock  
index futures and options thereon and, to a lesser extent, through dividend and 
interest income, all of which, in DVA's judgment, are elements of "total        
return."                                                                        

Although the Fund will not invest 25% or more of the assets in any one industry,
it may, from time to time, invest a significant percentage of its total assets  
in one or more market sectors, such as the financial services sector. If the    
Fund concentrates its investments in a market sector, financial, economic,      
business and other developments affecting issuers in that sector may have a     
greater effect on the Fund than if it had not concentrated its assets in that   
sector.                                                                         

SMALL CAP VALUE FUND. The Small Cap Value Fund's investment objective is to seek
long-term capital appreciation. It will invest principally in a diversified     
portfolio of equity securities of small companies with market capitalizations   
ranging from $100 million to $1 billion that DVA believes to be undervalued.    
Securities of a company may be undervalued as a result of overreactions by      
investors to unfavorable news about a company, industry or the stock markets in 
general or as a result of a market decline, poor economic conditions, tax-loss  
selling or actual or anticipated unfavorable developments affecting the company.
Under normal market

conditions, at least 65% of the total assets of the Fund will be invested in    
securities of companies whose market capitalizations are less than $1 billion.  

The Fund will invest primarily in common stocks of companies with a record of   
earnings, low price-earnings ratios, reasonable returns on equity and sound     
finances which, in the opinion of DVA, have intrinsic value. Such securities are
generally traded on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange and
in the over-the-counter market. The Fund may also sell covered call options and 
put options on securities it may acquire.                                       

ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT INFORMATION. The portfolio turnover rates of the Funds are
listed under "Financial Highlights." A Fund may periodically experience a high  
turnover rate (over 100%). The Funds will usually hold stocks acquired for the  
long-term and will sell stocks when DVA believes that anticipated price         
appreciation is no longer probable, alternative investments offer superior      
appreciation prospects, or the risk of decline in market prices is greater than 
the potential for gain. Portfolio turnover will tend to rise during periods of  
economic turbulence and decline during periods of stable growth. Generally, the 
Contrarian Fund will exercise the discipline of selling stocks when their       
price-earnings ratio ("P/E ratio") rise to a level in excess of the P/E ratio of
the stocks that comprise the S&P 500 Composite Stock Index. The use of options  
and futures contracts will tend to increase the portfolio turnover rate of the  
High Return Equity Fund. To the extent the investment policies of that Fund     
result in a relatively high turnover rate, it will incur greater expenses and   
brokerage fees.                                                                 

SELECTION OF INVESTMENTS. In order to determine whether a security is           
"undervalued," the principal factor considered by DVA is the P/E ratio of the   
security. DVA believes that the risk in owning stocks can be reduced by         
investing in companies with sound finances whose current market prices are low  
in relation to earnings. In determining whether a company's finances are sound, 
DVA considers among other things, its cash position and current ratio (current  
assets compared to current liabilities) and, in this regard, considers a 2:1    
ratio to be favorable.                                                          

DVA applies quantitative analysis to its research process, and begins by        
screening a large number of stocks. Typically, most companies selected for      
inclusion in the Contrarian and High Return Equity Funds will have market       
capitalizations well in excess of $1 billion and those selected for inclusion in
the Small Cap Value Fund will have market capitalizations ranging from          
approximately $100 million to $1 billion. In selecting among stocks with low P/E
ratios, DVA also considers factors such as the following about the issuer:      

- Financial strength,                                                 
- Book-to-market value,                                               
- Five and ten-year earnings growth rates,                            
- Five and ten-year dividend growth rates,                            
- Five and ten-year return on equity,                                 
- Size of institutional ownership, and                                
- Earnings estimates for the next 12 months.                          

Fundamental analysis is used on companies that initially look promising.        
Earnings and cash flow analysis as well as a company's conventional dividend    
payout ratio are important to this process. Generally, for the Contrarian and   
High Return Equity Funds, DVA seeks companies with growth rates better than 10% 
in the last five and ten-year periods for both earnings and dividends.          
Typically, the Funds will consist of approximately 25 to 50 stocks, diversified 
by both sector and industry. Most investments will be in securities of domestic 
companies, but, the Funds may also invest up to 20% of their assets in          
securities of foreign companies through the acquisition of sponsored American   
Depository Receipts ("ADRs"). ADRs are receipts issued by a U.S. bank or trust  
company evidencing ownership of underlying securities issued by a foreign       
issuer. ADRs may be listed on a national securities exchange or may be traded in
the over-the-counter market. The Funds may also invest in preferred stocks,     
convertible securities and warrants. While it is anticipated that under normal  
circumstances all Funds will be fully invested, in order to conserve assets     
during periods when DVA believes that the markets for equity securities are     
unduly speculative, each Fund may invest up to 50% of its assets in cash or     
defensive-type securities, such as high-grade debt securities, securities of the
U.S. Government or its agencies and high

quality money market instruments, including repurchase agreements. Investments  
in such interest bearing securities will be for temporary defensive purposes    
only.                                                                           

The Funds' policies of investing in securities that may be out of favor differs 
from the investment approach followed by many other mutual funds. Companies     
reporting poor earnings, whose businesses are cyclically down, whose prices have
declined sharply or that are not widely followed are not typically held by most 
investment companies. It is DVA's belief, however, that the securities of sound,
well-managed companies that may be temporarily out of favor due to earnings     
declines or other adverse developments are likely to provide a greater total    
investment return than securities whose prices appear to reflect anticipated    
favorable developments.                                                         

REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. Each Fund may invest in repurchase agreements, under     
which it acquires ownership of a security and the broker-dealer or bank agrees  
to repurchase the security at a mutually agreed upon time and price, thereby    
determining the yield during the Fund's holding period. In the event of a       
bankruptcy or other default of a seller of a repurchase agreement, the Fund     
might have expenses in enforcing its rights, and could experience losses,       
including a decline in the value of the underlying securities and loss of       
income. The securities underlying a repurchase agreement will be                
marked-to-market every business day so that the value of such securities is at  
least equal to the investment value of the repurchase agreement, including any  
accrued interest thereon. In addition, the Fund must take physical possession of
the security or receive written confirmation of the purchase and a custodial or 
safekeeping receipt from a third party or be recorded as the owner of the       
security through the Federal Reserve Book-Entry System. Repurchase agreements   
will be limited to transactions with financial institutions believed by the     
investment manager to present minimal credit risk. The investment manager will  
monitor on an on-going basis the creditworthiness of the broker-dealers and     
banks with which the Funds may engage in repurchase agreements. Repurchase      
agreements maturing in more than seven days will be considered as illiquid for  
purposes of the Funds' limitations on illiquid securities. The Funds will not   
invest more than 10% of the value of their net assets in illiquid securities    
including restricted securities and repurchase agreements with remaining        
maturities in excess of seven days, and other securities for which market       
quotations are not readily available.                                           

OPTIONS. The High Return Equity Fund and the Small Cap Value Fund may sell      
covered call options on securities they own and put options on securities they  
may acquire. The sale of a covered call option by the Fund gives the purchaser  
the right to purchase a specified number of shares of a company held by the Fund
at a specified price ("strike price") on or before the exercise date. The sale  
of a put option by a Fund entitles the purchaser to sell a specified number of  
shares of common stock of a company to the Fund at the strike price on or before
the exercise date. The Contrarian Fund also may sell covered call options on    
securities it owns when DVA believes it is advantageous for the Fund to do so.  

When a Fund sells a covered call option or a put option, the purchaser will pay 
the Fund a sum of cash referred to as a "premium." The amount of the premium is 
established on the securities exchange on which the option is traded, and will  
be determined by the market price of the optioned stock, the strike price of the
option, the length of time remaining until the expiration date, and other market
factors. To the extent that the High Return Equity Fund engages in options      
transactions, it may do so to enhance its total return through the receipt of   
premiums.                                                                       

If the market price of the optioned stock exceeds the strike price of a covered 
call option prior to the expiration date, the option may be exercised. In this  
event, a Fund will either deliver the optioned stock or, at any time prior to   
the expiration date, it may purchase an identical option and close out the      
transaction (a "closing transaction"). If the market price of the optioned stock
does not exceed the strike price prior to the expiration date the option will   
not be exercised and will expire.                                               

If the market price of the stock subject to a put option falls below the strike 
price of the put option before the expiration date, the purchaser of the option 
may require the Fund to purchase the stock at the strike price. In this event,  
the Fund will either purchase the optioned stock or, at any time prior to the   
expiration date, the

Fund may enter into a closing transaction. If the market price of the stock     
subject to the put option does not fall below the strike price prior to the     
expiration date, the option will expire unexercised.                            

The High Return Equity and Small Cap Value Funds will only sell put options and 
covered call options that are issued by the Options Clearing Corporation and    
listed on a national securities exchange. The Contrarian Fund will only sell    
covered call options that are issued by the Options Clearing Corporation and    
listed on a national securities exchange. The Funds are authorized to sell      
covered call options on all of the stocks they hold. No put option will be sold,
however, if as a result the High Return Equity or Small Cap Value Fund would be 
obligated to purchase securities whose total value exceeds 50% of the net assets
of the Fund. When a Fund sells a put option, it will establish a segregated     
account consisting of short-term high-grade debt obligations to cover its       
obligation to acquire the securities underlying the option or will hold on a    
share-for-share basis a put on the same security as the put sold where the      
exercise price of the put held is equal to or greater than the exercise price of
the put sold. The segregated securities will be "marked to market" daily to     
equal the current market value of the optioned stock. By investing in stocks    
that pay relatively high dividends and earning premiums from the sale of put and
covered call options, a Fund may seek to earn a current rate of return          
comparable to that of so-called high yield bonds. A "high yield" bond (sometimes
referred to as a "junk bond") is generally considered to be a bond that offers a
higher yield than a bond with a higher credit rating as compensation for the    
greater risk involved. Ordinarily, such bonds are rated BB - Ba through CC.     

FUTURES CONTRACTS. The Funds may purchase and sell stock index futures contracts
and index options as hedges against changes resulting from market conditions in 
the values of the securities held by the Funds, or securities that they intend  
to purchase or sell, where such transactions are economically appropriate for   
the reduction of risks inherent in the ongoing management of the Funds.         

The High Return Equity and Small Cap Value Funds may seek to take advantage of  
significant declines in the stock markets by selling put options on stocks and  
index futures contracts, and during periods of rising prices, all Funds may sell
covered call options on stocks and index futures they hold, thereby availing    
themselves of increased options premiums which ordinarily correspond to         
significant movements in the market prices of common stocks. The ordinary       
spreads between prices in the securities and futures markets, due to the        
difference in the nature of those markets, are subject to distortions (e.g., the
margin requirements on futures and the relative liquidity of the respective     
markets). The Funds may attempt to take advantage of such disparities. To       
compensate for imperfect correlations, a Fund may buy futures contracts in a    
greater dollar amount than the dollar amount of the securities being hedged if  
the historical volatility of the prices of such securities has been greater than
the historical volatility of the futures contracts. In addition, index futures  
contracts may be acquired and sold to facilitate cash management of the         
Contrarian, High Return Equity and Small Cap Value Funds pending investment of  
the proceeds of large purchases of a Fund's shares and to facilitate large      
redemptions of its shares.                                                      

While futures contracts provide for the delivery of securities, deliveries      
usually do not occur. Contracts are generally terminated by entering into an    
off-setting transaction. The Funds will incur brokerage fees when they purchase 
futures contracts. At the same time such a purchase is made, the Fund must      
provide cash or securities as a deposit ("initial deposit") known as "margin."  
Daily thereafter, the futures contract is valued and the payment of "variation  
margin" may be required, because each day the Fund must provide or receive cash 
reflecting the decline or increase in the value of the contract.                

A Fund may not purchase futures contracts or options thereon if, immediately    
thereafter the sum of the initial and variation margin deposits on its existing 
futures positions would exceed 5% of its total assets (including margin         
deposits).                                                                      

SECURITIES LOANS. The Funds are authorized to lend their portfolio securities to
qualified brokers, dealers, banks and other financial institutions for the      
purpose of realizing additional investment income. KDF does not intend to lend  
securities of any Fund if as a result more than 5% of the net assets of the Fund
would be on loan.                                                               

13

P-->49718th Page of 62TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 18th

BORROWING. While all of the Funds are authorized to borrow from banks in amounts
not in excess of 10% of their respective total assets, they do not intend to do 
so. If, in the future, they do borrow from banks, they would not purchase       
additional securities at any time when such borrowings exceed 5% of their       
respective net assets.                                                          

SPECIAL RISK FACTORS. The value of the shares of the Funds will fluctuate with  
the investment experience of the securities they hold. There can be no          
assurance, of course, that any Fund will achieve its investment objective.      

OPTIONS AND FINANCIAL FUTURES TRANSACTIONS. When the High Return Equity or Small
Cap Value Fund sells a put option, the Fund may be required to purchase the     
optioned stock at a price that exceeds the market price of the stock on or      
before the expiration date of the option. Put options will be sold with this    
possibility in mind and, therefore, the Fund will sell put options on stocks    
that DVA believes would be desirable holdings even if acquired at the strike    
price of the option.                                                            

When a Fund sells a covered call option, the Fund may be required to sell the   
optioned stock at a price below the market price of the stock on the expiration 
date of the option. In these circumstances, the ability of the Fund to realize a
capital gain on the optioned stock will be limited to the difference between the
price at which the Fund purchased the stock and the strike price of the option, 
plus the premium it received for the sale of the option. However, because the   
investment objective of the High Return Equity Fund is to achieve a high rate of
total return and the Contrarian Fund has a secondary objective of seeking       
current income, transactions in covered call options will be effected with a    
view to achieving these goals and may limit the Fund's ability to realize       
additional capital gains on optioned stocks that have appreciated in value.     

An option closing transaction may be effected only on an exchange that provides 
a secondary market for an option of the same series. Although the Contrarian,   
High Return Equity and Small Cap Value Funds will generally sell only those     
options for which DVA believes there is an active market, there is no assurance 
that a liquid market on an exchange will exist for any particular option. In    
such event, it might not be possible to effect closing transactions in          
particular options, with the result that a Fund would be unable to close out an 
option position by acquiring an identical option. Moreover, there can be no     
assurance that option closing transactions can be effected at prices that are   
advantageous to a Fund.                                                         

A Fund will not enter into any futures contracts or options on futures contracts
if the aggregate of the contract value of the outstanding futures contracts of  
the Fund and futures contracts subject to outstanding options written by the    
Fund would exceed 50% of the total assets of the Fund.                          

Investments in futures contracts entail the risk that, if DVA's investment      
judgment about the general direction of the securities markets is incorrect, the
Fund's overall performance may be poorer than if it had not entered into any    
such contracts. For example, if a Fund has hedged against the possibility of a  
decrease in market prices which would adversely affect the price of securities  
held, and market prices increase instead, the Fund will lose part or all of the 
benefit of the increased value of its securities because it will have offsetting
losses in its futures position. In addition, in such situations, if the Fund had
insufficient cash, it might have to sell securities from its portfolio to meet  
daily variation margin requirements. Such sales of securities may, but will not 
necessarily, be at increased prices that reflect the rising market. Therefore, a
Fund may have to sell securities at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do 
so.                                                                             

SMALL CAP SECURITIES. Investments in securities of companies with small market  
capitalizations are generally considered to offer greater opportunity for       
appreciation and to involve greater risks of depreciation than securities of    
companies with larger market capitalizations. Since the securities of such      
companies are not as broadly traded as those of companies with larger market    
capitalizations, these securities are often subject to wider and more abrupt    
fluctuations in market price.                                                   

Among the reasons for the greater price volatility of these securities are the  
less certain growth prospects of smaller firms, a lower degree of liquidity in  
the markets for such stocks compared to larger capitalization stocks, and the   
greater sensitivity of small companies to changing economic conditions. In      
addition to exhibiting                                                          

14

greater volatility, small company stocks may, to a degree, fluctuate            
independently of larger company stocks. Small company stocks may decline in     
price as large company stock prices rise, or rise in price as large company     
stock prices decline. Investors should therefore expect that the value of the   
Small Cap Value Fund's shares may be more volatile than the shares of a fund    
that invests in larger capitalization stocks.                                   

DERIVATIVES. In addition to options and financial futures transactions,         
consistent with its objective, each Fund may invest in a broad array of         
financial instruments and securities in which the value of the instrument or    
security is "derived" from the performance of an underlying asset or a          
"benchmark" such as a security index, an interest rate or a currency            
("derivatives"). Derivatives are most often used in an effort to manage         
investment risk, to increase or decrease exposure to an asset class or benchmark
(as a hedge or to enhance return), or to create an investment position in       
directly (often because it is more efficient or less costly than direct         
investment). There is no guarantee that these results can be achieved through   
the use of derivatives. The types of derivatives used by each Fund and the      
techniques employed by the investment manager may change over time as new       
derivatives and strategies are developed or regulatory changes occur.

Responsibility for overall management of KDF rests with its Board of Directors  
and officers. Professional investment supervision is provided by DVA. The       
investment management agreement provides that DVA shall act as each Fund's      
investment adviser, manage its investments and provide it with various services 
and facilities.                                                                 

Christian C. Bertelsen has been the manager of the Contrarian Fund since March, 
1996. Mr. Bertelsen joined DVA in March, 1996 as Chief Investment Officer. Prior
to joining DVA, he served from April, 1993 as a senior vice president and a     
portfolio manager of an unaffiliated investment management firm where he        
continues to serve on a temporary part-time basis. Prior thereto, he was a      
senior vice president of another unaffiliated investment management firm. Mr.   
Bertelsen received a B.A. degree from Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts.

its inception. He is currently the Chairman and a Director of DVA and was       
associated with KDF's former investment adviser. Mr. Dreman is a pioneer of the 
philosophy of contrarian investing (buying what is out of favor) and a leading  
proponent of the low P/E investment style. He is a columnist for FORBES and the 
author of several books on the value style of investing. He received a Bachelor 
of Commerce from the University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.

B.S. degree in Finance from State University of New York at New Paltz. Mr.      
Stokes is a Chartered Financial Analyst. Information regarding Mr. Bertelsen    
appears above.                                                                  

Each Fund pays DVA an investment management fee, payable monthly, at the annual 
rate of .75% of the first $250 million of its average daily net assets, .72% of 
average daily net assets between $250 million and $1 billion, .70% of average   
daily net assets between $1 billion and $2.5 billion, .68% of average daily net 
assets between $2.5 billion and $5 billion, .65% of average daily net assets    
between $5 billion and $7.5 billion, .64% of average daily net assets between   
$7.5 billion and $10 billion, .63% of average daily net assets between $10      
billion and $12.5 billion and .62% of its average daily net assets over $12.5   
billion. To the extent that the management fee paid to DVA is .75%, it is higher
than that paid by most other mutual funds.                                      

PRINCIPAL UNDERWRITER. Pursuant to an underwriting and distribution services    
agreement ("distribution agreement") with KDF, Zurich Kemper Distributors, Inc. 
("ZKDI"), 222 South Riverside Plaza, Chicago, Illinois 60606, an affiliate of   
DVA and a wholly owned subsidiary of ZKI, is the principal underwriter and      
distributor of each Fund's shares and acts as agent of each Fund in the sale of 
its shares. ZKDI bears all its expenses of providing services pursuant to the   
distribution agreement, including the payment of any commissions. ZKDI provides 
for the preparation of advertising or sales literature and bears the cost of    
printing and mailing prospectuses to persons other than shareholders. ZKDI bears
the cost of qualifying and maintaining the qualification of the Funds' shares   
for sale under the securities laws of the various states and KDF bears the      
expense of registering its shares with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  
ZKDI may enter into related selling group agreements with various               
broker-dealers, including affiliates of ZKDI, that provide distribution services
to investors. ZKDI also may provide some of the distribution services.          

CLASS A SHARES. ZKDI receives no compensation from KDF as principal underwriter 
for Class A shares and pays all expenses of distribution of KDF's Class A shares
under the distribution agreement not otherwise paid by dealers or other         
financial services firms. As indicated under "Purchase of Shares," ZKDI retains 
the sales charge upon the purchase of shares and pays or allows concessions or  
discounts to firms for the sale of KDF shares.                                  

CLASS B SHARES. For its services under the distribution agreement, ZKDI receives
a fee from each Fund, payable monthly, at the annual rate of .75% of average    
daily net assets of such Fund attributable to Class B shares. This fee is       
accrued daily as an expense of Class B shares. ZKDI also receives any contingent
deferred sales charges. See "Redemption or Repurchase of Shares-Contingent      
Deferred Sales Charge-Class B Shares." ZKDI currently compensates firms for     
sales of Class B shares at a commission rate of 3.75%.                          

CLASS C SHARES. For its services under the distribution agreement, ZKDI receives
a fee from each Fund, payable monthly, at the annual rate of .75% of average    
daily net assets of such Fund attributable to Class C shares. This fee is       
accrued daily as an expense of Class C shares. ZKDI currently advances to firms 
the first year distribution fee at a rate of .75% of the purchase price of such 
shares. For periods after the first year, ZKDI currently intends to pay firms   
for sales of Class C shares a distribution fee, payable quarterly, at an annual 
rate of .75% of net assets attributable to Class C shares maintained and        
serviced by the firm and the fee continues until terminated by ZKDI or KDF. ZKDI
also receives any contingent deferred sales charges. See "Redemption or
Repurchase of Shares--Contingent Deferred Charge--Class C Shares."              

RULE 12B-1 PLAN. Since the distribution agreement provides for fees payable as  
an expense of the Class B shares and the Class C shares that are used by ZKDI to
pay for distribution services for those classes, that agreement is approved and 
reviewed separately for the Class B shares and the Class C shares in accordance 
with Rule 12b-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which regulates the   
manner in which an investment company may,

(a)  Amounts shown are after expense waiver.                                    

If the Rule 12b-1 Plan (the "Plan") is terminated in accordance with its terms, 
the obligation of KDF to make payments to ZKDI pursuant to the Plan will cease  
and KDF will not be required to make any payments past the termination date.    
Thus, there is no legal obligation for KDF to pay any expenses incurred by ZKDI 
in excess of its fees under the Plan, if for any reason the Plan is terminated  
in accordance with its terms. Future fees under the Plan may or may not be      
sufficient to reimburse ZKDI for its expenses incurred.                         

ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES. ZKDI also provides information and administrative      
services for shareholders of KDF pursuant to an administrative services         
agreement ("administrative agreement"). ZKDI may enter into related arrangements
with various broker-dealer firms and other service or administrative firms      
("firms") that provide services and facilities for their customers or clients   
who are investors in KDF. Such administrative services and assistance may       
include, but are not limited to, establishing and maintaining accounts and      
records, processing purchase and redemption transactions, answering routine     
inquiries regarding each Fund and its special features, and such other          
administrative services as may be agreed upon from time to time and permitted by
applicable statute, rule or regulation. ZKDI bears all its expenses of providing
services pursuant to the administrative agreement, including the payment of any 
service fees. For services under the administrative agreement, KDF pays ZKDI a  
fee, payable monthly, at an annual rate of up to .25% of average daily net      
assets of Class A, B and C shares of each Fund. ZKDI then pays each firm a      
service fee at an annual rate of up to .25% of net assets of each class of those
accounts that it maintains and services for KDF. Firms to which service fees may
be paid include affiliates of ZKDI.                                             

CLASS A SHARES. For Class A shares, a firm becomes eligible for the service fee 
based upon assets in the accounts in the month following the month of purchase  
and the fee continues until terminated by ZKDI or KDF. The fees are calculated  
monthly and paid quarterly.                                                     

CLASS B AND CLASS C SHARES. ZKDI currently advances to firms the first-year     
service fee at a rate of up to .25% of the purchase price of such shares. For   
periods after the first year, ZKDI currently intends to pay firms a service fee 
at a rate of up to .25% (calculated monthly and paid quarterly) of the net      
assets attributable to Class B and Class C shares maintained and serviced by the
firm and the fee continues until terminated by ZKDI or KDF.                     

ZKDI also may provide some of the above services and may retain any portion of  
the fee under the administrative agreement not paid to firms to compensate      
itself for administrative functions performed for KDF. Currently, the           
administrative services fee payable to ZKDI is based only upon KDF assets in    
accounts for which a firm provides administrative services and it is intended   
that ZKDI will pay all the administrative services fee that it receives from KDF
to firms in the form of service fees. The effective administrative services fee 
rate to be charged against all assets of KDF while this procedure is in effect  
will depend upon the proportion of Fund assets that is in accounts for which a  
firm provides administrative services. In addition, ZKDI may, from time to

time, from its own resources pay certain firms additional amounts for ongoing   
administrative services and assistance provided to their customers and clients  
who are shareholders of each Fund.                                              

CUSTODIAN, TRANSFER AGENT AND SHAREHOLDER SERVICE AGENT. Investors Fiduciary    
Trust Company ("IFTC"), 127 West 10th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64105, as   
custodian, and State Street Bank and Trust Company, 225 Franklin Street, Boston,
Massachusetts 02110, as sub-custodian, have custody of all securities and cash  
of KDF maintained in the United States. IFTC also is KDF's transfer agent and   
dividend-paying agent. Pursuant to a services agreement with IFTC, Zurich Kemper
Service Company ("ZKSC"), an affiliate of DVA, serves as "Shareholder Service   
Agent" of KDF and, as such, performs all of IFTC's duties as transfer agent and 
dividend-paying agent. For a description of transfer agent and shareholder      
service agent fees, see "Investment Manager and Underwriter" in the Statement of
Additional Information.                                                         

PORTFOLIO TRANSACTIONS. DVA places all orders for purchases and sales of a      
Fund's securities. Subject to seeking best execution of orders, DVA may consider
sales of shares of a Fund and of funds managed by ZKI or its affiliates as a    
factor in selecting broker-dealers. See "Portfolio Transactions" in the         
Statement of Additional Information.                                            

DIVIDENDS AND TAXES 

DIVIDENDS. The Contrarian and High Return Equity Funds normally distribute      
quarterly dividends of net investment income, the Small Cap Value Fund normally 
distributes annual dividends of net investment income and each Fund distributes 
any net realized short-term and long-term capital gains at least annually.      

Dividends paid by a Fund as to each class of its shares will be calculated in   
the same manner, at the same time and on the same day. The level of income      
dividends per share (as a percentage of net asset value) will be lower for Class
B and Class C shares than for Class A shares primarily as a result of the       
distribution services fee applicable to Class B and Class C shares.             
Distributions of capital gains, if any, will be paid in the same amount for each
class.                                                                          

Income and capital gain dividends, if any, of a Fund will be credited to        
shareholder accounts in full and fractional shares of the same class of that    
Fund at net asset value on the reinvestment date, except that, upon written     
request to the Shareholder Service Agent, a shareholder may select one of the   
following options:                                                              

(1) To receive income and short-term capital gain dividends in cash and         
 long-term capital gain dividends in shares of the same class at net asset
value; or                                                               

(2) To receive income and capital gain dividends in cash.                       

Any dividends of a Fund that are reinvested will normally be reinvested in      
shares of the same class of that same Fund. However, upon written request to the
Shareholder Service Agent, a shareholder may elect to have dividends of a Fund  
invested in shares of the same class of another Kemper Fund at the net asset    
value of such class of such other fund. See "Special Features--Class A
Shares--Combined Purchases" for a list of such Kemper Funds. To use this        
privilege of investing dividends of a Fund in shares of another Kemper Fund,    
shareholders must maintain a minimum account value of $1,000 in the Fund        
distributing the dividends. The Funds will reinvest dividend checks (and future 
dividends) in shares of that same Fund and class if checks are returned as      
undeliverable. Dividends and other distributions in the aggregate amount of $10 
or less are automatically reinvested in shares of the same Fund unless the      
shareholder requests that such policy not be applied to the shareholder's       
account.                                                                        

TAXES. Each Fund intends to continue to qualify as a regulated investment       
company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") and, if so 
qualified, will not be liable for federal income taxes to the extent its        
earnings are distributed. Dividends derived from net investment income and net  
short-term capital gains are taxable to shareholders as ordinary income and     
long-term capital gain dividends are taxable to shareholders as long-term       
capital gain regardless of how long the shares have been held and whether       
received in cash or shares.

P-->49723rd Page of 62TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 23rd

Long-term capital gain dividends received by individual shareholders are        
currently taxed at a maximum rate of 28%. Dividends declared in October,        
November or December to shareholders of record as of a date in one of those     
months and paid during the following January are treated as paid on December 31 
of the calendar year declared. A portion of the dividends paid by a Fund may    
qualify for the dividends received deduction available to corporate             
shareholders.                                                                   

A dividend received shortly after the purchase of shares reduces the net asset  
value of the shares by the amount of the dividend and, although in effect a     
return of capital, will be taxable to the shareholder. If the net asset value of
shares were reduced below the shareholder's cost by dividends representing gains
realized on sales of securities, such dividends would be a return of investment 
though taxable as stated above.                                                 

Each Fund is required by law to withhold 31% of taxable dividends and redemption
proceeds paid to certain shareholders who do not furnish a correct taxpayer     
identification number (in the case of individuals, a social security number) and
in certain other circumstances. Trustees of qualified retirement plans and      
403(b)(7) accounts are required by law to withhold 20% of the taxable portion of
any distribution that is eligible to be "rolled over." The 20% withholding      
requirement does not apply to distributions from Individual Retirement Accounts 
(IRAs) or any part of a distribution that is transferred directly to another    
qualified retirement plan, 403(b)(7) account, or IRA. Shareholders should       
consult with their tax advisers regarding the 20% withholding requirement.      

After each transaction, shareholders will receive a confirmation statement      
giving complete details of the transaction except that statements will be sent  
quarterly for transactions involving dividend reinvestment and periodic         
investment and redemption programs. Information for income tax purposes will be 
provided after the end of the calendar year. Shareholders are encouraged to     
retain copies of their account confirmation statements or year-end statements   
for tax reporting purposes. However, those who have incomplete records may      
obtain historical account transaction information at a reasonable fee.          

When more than one shareholder resides at the same address, certain reports and 
communications to be delivered to such shareholders may be combined in the same 
mailing package, and certain duplicate reports and communications may be        
eliminated. Similarly, account statements to be sent to such shareholders may be
combined in the same mailing package or consolidated into a single statement.   
However, a shareholder may request that the foregoing policies not be applied to
the shareholder's account.                                                      

NET ASSET VALUE 

The net asset value per share of a Fund is determined separately for each class 
by dividing the value of the Fund's net assets attributable to that class by the
number of shares of that class outstanding. The per share net asset value of the
Class B and Class C shares of a Fund will generally be lower than that of the   
Class A shares of the Fund because of the higher expenses borne by Class B and  
Class C shares. Fund securities that are primarily traded on a domestic         
securities exchange or securities listed on the NASDAQ National Market are      
valued at the last sale price on the exchange or market where primarily traded  
or listed or, if there is no recent sale price available, at the last current   
bid quotation. A security that is listed or traded on more than one exchange is 
valued at the quotation on the exchange determined to be the primary market for 
such security by the Board of Directors or its delegates. Securities not so     
traded or listed are valued at the last current bid quotations, or independent  
pricing services that use prices provided by market makers or estimates of      
market values obtained from yield data relating to instruments or securities    
with similar characteristics. Equity options are valued at the last sale price  
unless the bid price is higher or the asked price is lower, in which event such 
bid or asked price is used. Exchange traded fixed income options, financial     
futures and options thereon are valued at the settlement price established each 
day by the board of trade or exchange on which they are traded. Other securities
and assets are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Board of 
Directors. If an event were to occur, after the value of a security was so      
established but before the net asset value per share was determined, which was  
likely to materially change the net asset value, then that security would be    
valued using fair value

determinations by the Board of Directors or its delegates. On each day the New  
York Stock Exchange (the "Exchange") is open for trading, the net asset value is
determined as of the earlier of 3:00 pm. Chicago time or the close of the       
Exchange.                                                                       

PURCHASE OF SHARES 

ALTERNATIVE PURCHASE ARRANGEMENTS. Class A shares of each Fund are sold to      
investors subject to an initial sales charge. Class B shares are sold without an
initial sales charge but are subject to higher ongoing expenses than Class A    
shares and a contingent deferred sales charge payable upon certain redemptions. 
Class B shares automatically convert to Class A shares six years after issuance.
Class C shares are sold without an initial sales charge but are subject to      
higher ongoing expenses than Class A shares, are subject to a contingent        
deferred sales charge payable upon certain redemptions within the first year    
following purchase, and do not convert into another class. When placing purchase
orders, investors must specify whether the order is for Class A, Class B or     
Class C shares.                                                                 

The primary distinctions among the classes of each Fund's shares lie in their   
initial and contingent deferred sales charge structures and in their ongoing    
expenses, including asset-based sales charges in the form of Rule 12b-1         
distribution fees. These differences are summarized in the table below. See,    
also, "Summary of Expenses." Each class has distinct advantages and             
disadvantages for different investors, and investors may choose the class that  
best suits their circumstances and objectives.

The minimum initial investment for each Fund is $1,000 and the minimum          
subsequent investment is $100. The minimum initial investment for an Individual 
Retirement Account is $250 and the minimum subsequent investment is $50. Under  
an automatic investment plan, such as Bank Direct Deposit, Payroll Direct       
Deposit or Government Direct Deposit, the minimum initial and subsequent        
investment is $50. These minimum amounts may be changed at any time in          
management's discretion.                                                        

Share certificates will not be issued unless requested in writing and may not be
available for certain types of account registrations. It is recommended that    
investors not request share certificates unless needed for a specific purpose.  
You cannot redeem shares by telephone or wire transfer or use the telephone     
exchange privilege if share certificates have been issued. A lost or destroyed  
certificate is difficult to replace and can be expensive to the shareholder (a  
bond worth 2% or more of the certificate value is normally required).

*** Commission is payable by ZKDI as discussed below.                           

Each Fund receives the entire net asset value of all its Class A shares sold.   
ZKDI, the Funds' principal underwriter, retains the sales charge on sales of    
Class A shares from which it allows discounts from the applicable public        
offering price to investment dealers, which discounts are uniform for all       
dealers in the United States and its territories. The normal discount allowed to
dealers is set forth in the above table. Upon notice to all dealers with whom it
has sales agreements, ZKDI may reallow up to the full applicable sales charge,  
as shown in the above table, during periods and for transactions specified in   
such notice and such reallowances may be based upon attainment of minimum sales 
levels. During periods when 90% or more of the sales charge is reallowed, such  
dealers may be deemed to be underwriters as that term is defined in the         
Securities Act of 1933.                                                         

Class A shares of a Fund may be purchased at net asset value to the extent that 
the amount invested represents the net proceeds from a redemption of shares of a
mutual fund for which neither DVA nor ZKI serve as investment manager           
("non-Kemper fund") provided that: (a) the investor has previously paid either  
an initial sales charge in connection with the purchase of the non-Kemper fund  
shares redeemed or a contingent deferred sales charge in connection with the    
redemption of the non-Kemper fund shares, and (b) the purchase of Fund shares is
made within 90 days after the date of such redemption. To make such a purchase  
at net asset value, the investor or the investor's dealer must, at the time of  
purchase, submit a request that the purchase be processed at net asset value    
pursuant to this privilege. The redemption of the shares of the non-Kemper fund 
is, for federal income tax purposes, a sale upon which a gain or loss may be    
realized. ZKDI may in its discretion compensate firms for sales of Class A      
shares under this privilege at a commission rate of .50% of the amount of Class 
A shares purchased.                                                             

Class A shares of a Fund may be purchased at net asset value by: (a) any        
purchaser provided that the amount invested in such Fund or other Kemper Mutual 
Funds listed under "Special Features--Class A Shares--Combined Purchases" totals
at least $1,000,000 including purchases of Class A shares pursuant to the       
"Combined Purchases," "Letter of Intent" and "Cumulative Discount" features     
described under "Special Features"; or (b) a participant-directed qualified     
retirement plan described in Code Section 401(a) or a participant-directed      
non-qualified deferred compensation plan described in Code Section 457 or a     
participant-directed qualified retirement plan described in Code Section        
403(b)(7) which is not sponsored by a K-12 school district, provided in each    
case that such plan has not less than 200 eligible employees (the "Large Order  
NAV Purchase Privilege"). Redemption within two years of shares purchased under 
the Large Order NAV Purchase Privilege may be subject to a contingent deferred  
sales charge. See "Redemption or Repurchase of Shares--Contingent Deferred Sales
Charge--Large Order NAV Purchase Privilege."

ZKDI may in its discretion compensate investment dealers or other financial     
services firms in connection with the sale of Class A shares of a Fund at net   
asset value in accordance with the Large Order NAV Purchase Privilege up to the 
following amounts: 1.00% of the net asset value of shares sold on amounts up to 
$5 million, .50% on the next $45 million and .25% on amounts over $50 million.  
The commission schedule will be reset on a calendar year basis for sales of     
shares pursuant to the Large Order NAV Purchase Privilege. For purposes of      
determining the appropriate commission percentage to be applied to a particular 
sale under the foregoing schedules, ZKDI will consider the cumulative amount    
invested by the purchaser in a Fund and other Kemper Mutual Funds listed under  
"Special Features--Class A Shares--Combined Purchases," including purchases     
pursuant to the "Combined Purchases," "Letter of Intent" and "Cumulative        
Discount" features referred to above. The privilege of purchasing Class A shares
of a Fund at net asset value under the Large Order NAV Purchase Privilege is not
available if another net asset value purchase privilege is also applicable.     

Effective on February 1, 1996, Class A shares of a Fund or any other Kemper     
Mutual Fund listed under "Special Features--Class A Shares--Combined Purchases" 
may be purchased at net asset value in any amount by members of the plaintiff   
class in the proceeding known as HOWARD AND AUDREY TABANKIN, ET AL. V. KEMPER   
SHORT-TERM GLOBAL INCOME FUND, ET. AL., Case No. 93 C 5231 (N.D.IL). This       
privilege is generally non-transferrable and continues for the lifetime of      
individual class members and for a ten year period for non-individual class     
members. To make a purchase at net asset value under this privilege, the        
investor must, at the time of purchase, submit a written request that the       
purchase be processed at net asset value pursuant to this privilege specifically
identifying the purchaser as a member of the "Tabankin Class." Shares purchased 
under this privilege will be maintained in a separate account that includes only
shares purchased under this privilege. For more details concerning this         
privilege, class members should refer to the Notice of (1) Proposed Settlement  
with Defendants; and (2) Hearing to Determine Fairness of Proposed Settlement   
dated August 31, 1995, issued in connection with the aforementioned court       
proceeding. For sales of Fund shares at net asset value pursuant to this        
privilege, ZKDI may in its discretion pay investment dealers and other financial
services firms a concession, payable quarterly, at an annual rate of up to .25% 
of net assets attributable to such shares maintained and serviced by the firm. A
firm becomes eligible for the concession based upon assets in accounts          
attributable to shares purchased under this privilege in the month after the    
month of purchase and the concession continues until terminated by ZKDI. The    
privilege of purchasing Class A shares of the Fund at net asset value under this
privilege is not available if another net asset value purchase privilege also   
applies.                                                                        

Class A shares may be sold at net asset value in any amount to: (a) officers,   
directors, employees (including retirees) and sales representatives of KDF, its 
investment manager, its principal underwriter or certain affiliated companies,  
for themselves or members of their families; (b) registered representatives and 
employees of broker-dealers having selling group agreements with ZKDI; (c)      
officers, directors, and employees of service agents of KDF; (d) shareholders   
who owned shares of KDF on September 8, 1995, and have continuously owned shares
of KDF (or a Kemper Fund acquired by exchange of KDF shares) since that date,   
for themselves or members of their families; and (e) any trust, pension,        
profit-sharing or other benefit plan for only such persons. Class A shares may  
be sold at net asset value in any amount to selected employees (including their 
spouses and dependent children) of banks and other financial services firms that
provide administrative services related to order placement and payment to       
facilitate transactions in shares of KDF for their clients pursuant to an       
agreement with ZKDI or one of its affiliates. Only those employees of such banks
and other firms who as part of their usual duties provide services related to   
transactions in Fund shares may purchase a Fund's Class A shares at net asset   
value hereunder. Class A shares may be sold at net asset value in any amount to 
unit investment trusts sponsored by Ranson & Associates, Inc. In addition,      
unitholders of unit investment trusts sponsored by Ranson & Associates, Inc. or 
its predecessors may purchase a Fund's Class A shares at net asset value through
reinvestment programs described in the prospectuses of such trusts that have    
such programs. Class A shares of a Fund may be sold at net asset value through  
certain investment advisers registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940
and other financial services firms that adhere to certain standards established 
by ZKDI, including a requirement that such shares be sold for the benefit of    
their clients participating in an investment advisory program under which such  
clients pay a fee to the investment advisor or other firm for portfolio         

22

management and other services. Such shares are sold for investment purposes and 
on the condition that they will not be resold except through redemption or      
repurchase by KDF. KDF may also issue Class A shares at net asset value in      
connection with the acquisition of the assets of or merger or consolidation with
another investment company, or to shareholders in connection with the investment
or reinvestment of income and capital gain dividends.                           

Class A shares of a Fund may be purchased at net asset value in any amount by   
certain professionals who assist in the promotion of Kemper Funds pursuant to   
personal services contracts with ZKDI, for themselves or members of their       
families. ZKDI in its discretion may compensate financial services firms for    
sales of Class A shares under this privilege at a commission rate of .50% of the
amount of Class A shares purchased.                                             

The sales charge scale is applicable to purchases made at one time by any       
"purchaser" which includes: an individual; or an individual, his or her spouse  
and children under the age of 21; or a trustee or other fiduciary of a single   
trust estate or single fiduciary account; or an organization exempt from federal
income tax under Section 501(c)(3) or (13) of the Code; or a pension,           
profit-sharing or other employee benefit plan whether or not qualified under    
Section 401 of the Code; or other organized group of persons whether            
incorporated or not, provided the organization has been in existence for at     
least six months and has some purpose other than the purchase of redeemable     
securities of a registered investment company at a discount. In order to qualify
for a lower sales charge, all orders from an organized group will have to be    
placed through a single investment dealer or other firm and identified as       
originating from a qualifying purchaser.                                        

DEFERRED SALES CHARGE ALTERNATIVE--CLASS B SHARES. Investors choosing the       
deferred sales charge alternative may purchase Class B shares at net asset value
per share without any sales charge at the time of purchase. Since Class B shares
are being sold without an initial sales charge, the full amount of the          
investor's purchase payment will be invested in Class B shares for his or her   
account. A contingent deferred sales charge may be imposed upon redemption of   
Class B shares. See "Redemption or Repurchase of Shares--Contingent Deferred
Sales Charge--Class B Shares."                                                  

ZKDI compensates firms for sales of Class B shares at the time of sale at a     
commission rate of up to 3.75% of the amount of Class B shares purchased. ZKDI  
is compensated by KDF for services as distributor and principal underwriter for 
Class B shares. See "Investment Manager and Underwriter." Class B shares of a   
Fund will automatically convert to Class A shares of the same Fund six years    
after issuance on the basis of the relative net asset value per share. The      
purpose of the conversion feature is to relieve holders of Class B shares from  
the distribution services fee when they have been outstanding long enough for   
ZKDI to have been compensated for distribution related expenses. For purposes of
conversion to Class A shares, shares purchased through the reinvestment of      
dividends and other distributions paid with respect to Class B shares in a      
shareholder's KDF account will be converted to Class A shares on a pro rata     
basis.                                                                          

PURCHASE OF CLASS C SHARES. The public offering price of the Class C shares of a
Fund is the next determined net asset value. No initial sales charge is imposed.
Since Class C shares are sold without an initial sales charge, the full amount  
of the investor's purchase payment will be invested in Class C shares for his or
her account. A contingent deferred sales charge may be imposed upon redemption  
of Class C shares within one year of purchase. See "Redemption or Repurchase of
Shares--Contingent Deferred Sales Charge--Class C Shares." ZKDI currently       
advances to firms the first year distribution fee at a rate of .75% of the      
purchase price of such shares. For periods after the first year, ZKDI currently 
intends to pay firms for sales of Class C shares a distribution fee, payable    
quarterly, at an annual rate of .75% of net assets attributable to Class C      
shares maintained and serviced by the firm. ZKDI is compensated by KDF for      
services as distributor and principal underwriter for Class C shares. See       
"Investment Manager and Underwriter."                                           

WHICH ARRANGEMENT IS BETTER FOR YOU? The decision as to which class of shares   
provides a more suitable investment for an investor depends on a number of      
factors, including the amount and intended length of the investment. Investors  
making investments that qualify for reduced sales charges might consider Class A
shares. Investors who prefer not to pay an initial sales charge and who plan to 
hold their investment for more than six                                         

23

years might consider Class B shares. Investors who prefer not to pay an initial 
sales charge but who plan to redeem their shares within six years might consider
Class C shares. Orders for Class B shares or Class C shares for $500,000 or more
will be declined. Orders for Class B shares or Class C shares by employer       
sponsored employee benefit plans using the subaccount record keeping system made
available through the Shareholder Service Agent will be invested instead in     
Class A shares at net asset value where the combined subaccount value in KDF or 
any Kemper Mutual Fund listed under "Special Features--Class A Shares--Combined
Purchases" is in excess of $5 million including purchases pursuant to the       
"Combined Purchases," "Letter of Intent" and "Cumulative Discount" features     
described under "Special Features." For more information about the three sales  
arrangements, consult your financial representative or the Shareholder Service  
Agent. Financial services firms may receive different compensation depending    
upon which class of shares they sell.                                           

GENERAL. Banks and other financial services firms may provide administrative    
services related to order placement and payment to facilitate transactions in   
shares of KDF for their clients, and ZKDI may pay them a transaction fee up to  
the level of the discount or commission allowable or payable to dealers, as     
described above. Banks are currently prohibited under the Glass-Steagall Act    
from providing certain underwriting or distribution services. Banks or other    
financial services firms may be subject to various state laws regarding the     
services described above and may be required to register as dealers pursuant to 
state law. If banking firms were prohibited from acting in any capacity or      
providing any of the described services, management would consider what action, 
if any, would be appropriate. ZKDI does not believe that termination of a       
relationship with a bank would result in any material adverse consequences to   
KDF.                                                                            

ZKDI may, from time to time, pay or allow to firms a 1% commission on the amount
of shares of a Fund sold by the firm under the following conditions: (i) the    
purchased shares are held in a Kemper IRA account, (ii) the shares are purchased
as a direct "roll over' of a distribution from a qualified retirement plan      
account maintained on a participant subaccount record keeping system provided by
ZKSC, (iii) the registered representative placing the trade is a member of      
ProStar, a group of persons designated by ZKDI in acknowledgment of their       
dedication to the employee benefit plan area; and (iv) the purchase is not      
otherwise subject to a commission.                                              

In addition to the discounts or commissions described above, ZKDI will, from    
time to time, pay or allow additional discounts, commissions or promotional     
incentives, in the form of cash or other compensation, to firms that sell shares
of KDF. Non-cash compensation includes luxury merchandise and trips to luxury   
resorts. In some instances, such discounts, commissions or other incentives will
be offered only to certain firms that sell or are expected to sell during       
specified time periods certain minimum amounts of shares of KDF, or other funds 
underwritten by ZKDI.                                                           

Orders for the purchase of shares of a Fund will be confirmed at a price based  
on the net asset value of that Fund next determined after receipt by ZKDI of the
order accompanied by payment. However, orders received by dealers or other      
financial services firms prior to the determination of net asset value (see "Net
Asset Value") and received by ZKDI prior to the close of its business day will  
be confirmed at a price based on the net asset value effective on that day      
("trade date"). KDF reserves the right to determine the net asset value more    
frequently than once a day if deemed desirable. Dealers and other financial     
services firms are obligated to transmit orders promptly. Collection may take   
significantly longer for a check drawn on a foreign bank than for a check drawn 
on a domestic bank. Therefore, if an order is accompanied by a check drawn on a 
foreign bank, funds must normally be collected before shares will be purchased. 
See "Purchase and Redemption of Shares" in the Statement of Additional          
Information.                                                                    

Investment dealers and other firms provide varying arrangements for their       
clients to purchase and redeem KDF's shares. Some may establish higher minimum  
investment requirements than set forth above. Firms may arrange with their      
clients for other investment or administrative services. Such firms may         
independently establish and charge additional amounts to their clients for such 
services, which charges would reduce the clients' return. Firms also may hold   
KDF's shares in nominee or street name as agent for and on behalf of their      
customers. In such instances, KDF's transfer agent will have no information with
respect to or control over the

accounts of specific shareholders. Such shareholders may obtain access to their 
accounts and information about their accounts only from their firm. Certain of  
these firms may receive compensation from KDF through the Shareholder Service   
Agent for recordkeeping and other expenses relating to these nominee accounts.  
In addition, certain privileges with respect to the purchase and redemption of  
shares or the reinvestment of dividends may not be available through such firms.
Some firms may participate in a program allowing them access to their clients'  
accounts for servicing including, without limitation, transfers of registration 
and dividend payee changes; and may perform functions such as generation of     
confirmation statements and disbursement of cash dividends. Such firms,         
including affiliates of ZKDI, may receive compensation from KDF through the     
Shareholder Service Agent for these services. This prospectus should be read in 
connection with such firms' material regarding their fees and services.         

KDF reserves the right to withdraw all or any part of the offering made by this 
prospectus and to reject purchase orders. Also, from time to time, KDF may      
temporarily suspend the offering of shares of any Fund or class of a Fund to new
investors. During the period of such suspension, persons who are already        
shareholders of such class of such Fund normally are permitted to continue to   
purchase additional shares of such Fund or class and to have dividends          
reinvested.                                                                     

Shareholders should direct their inquiries to Zurich Kemper Service Company, 811
Main Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64105-2005 or to the firm from which they    
received this prospectus.                                                       

REDEMPTION OR REPURCHASE OF SHARES 

GENERAL. Any shareholder may require KDF to redeem his or her shares. When      
shares are held for the account of a shareholder by KDF's transfer agent, the   
shareholder may redeem them by sending a written request with signatures        
guaranteed to Kemper Mutual Funds, Attention: Redemption Department, P.O. Box   
419557, Kansas City, Missouri 64141-6557. When certificates for shares have been
issued, they must be mailed to or deposited with the Shareholder Service Agent, 
along with a duly endorsed stock power and accompanied by a written request for 
redemption. Redemption requests and a stock power must be endorsed by the       
account holder with signatures guaranteed by a commercial bank, trust company,  
savings and loan association, federal savings bank, member firm of a national   
securities exchange or other eligible financial institution. The redemption     
request and stock power must be signed exactly as the account is registered     
including any special capacity of the registered owner. Additional documentation
may be requested, and a signature guarantee is normally required, from          
institutional and fiduciary account holders, such as corporations, custodians   
(e.g., under the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act), executors, administrators,   
trustees or guardians.                                                          

The redemption price for shares of a Fund will be the net asset value per share 
of that Fund next determined following receipt by the Shareholder Service Agent 
of a properly executed request with any required documents as described above.  
Payment for shares redeemed will be made in cash as promptly as practicable but 
in no event later than seven days after receipt of a properly executed request  
accompanied by any outstanding share certificates in proper form for transfer.  
When KDF is asked to redeem shares for which it may not have yet received good  
payment (i.e., purchases by check, EXPRESS-Transfer or Bank Direct Deposit), it 
may delay transmittal of redemption proceeds until it has determined that       
collected funds have been received for the purchase of such shares, which will  
be up to 10 days from receipt by KDF of the purchase amount. The redemption     
within two years of Class A shares purchased at net asset value under the Large 
Order NAV Purchase Privilege may be subject to a contingent deferred sales      
charge (see "Purchase of Shares--Initial Sales Charge Alternative--Class A
Shares"), the redemption of Class B shares within six years may be subject to a 
contingent deferred sales charge (see "Contingent Deferred Sales Charge--Class B
Shares" below) and the redemption of Class C shares within the first year       
following purchase may be subject to a contingent deferred sales charge (see    
"Contingent Deferred Sales Charge--Class C Shares" below).                      

Because of the high cost of maintaining small accounts, effective January 1998, 
KDF may assess a quarterly fee of $9 on an account with a balance below $1,000  
for the quarter. The fee will not apply to accounts enrolled in                 

25

an automatic investment program, Individual Retirement Accounts or employer     
sponsored employee benefit plans using the subaccount record keeping system made
available through the Shareholder Service Agent.                                

Shareholders can request the following telephone privileges: expedited wire     
transfer redemptions and EXPRESS-Transfer transactions (see "Special Features") 
and exchange transactions for individual and institutional accounts and         
pre-authorized telephone redemption transactions for certain institutional      
accounts. Shareholders may choose these privileges on the account application or
by contacting the Shareholder Service Agent for appropriate instructions. Please
note that the telephone exchange privilege is automatic unless the shareholder  
refuses it on the account application. KDF or its agents may be liable for any  
losses, expenses or costs arising out of fraudulent or unauthorized telephone   
requests pursuant to these privileges, unless KDF or its agents reasonably      
believe, based upon reasonable verification procedures, that the telephone      
instructions are genuine. THE SHAREHOLDER WILL BEAR THE RISK OF LOSS, including 
loss resulting from fraudulent or unauthorized transactions, so long as the     
reasonable verification procedures are followed. The verification procedures    
include recording instructions, requiring certain identifying information before
acting upon instructions and sending written confirmations.                     

TELEPHONE REDEMPTIONS. If the proceeds of the redemption (prior to the          
imposition of any contingent deferred sales charge) are $50,000 or less and the 
proceeds are payable to the shareholder of record at the address of record,     
normally a telephone request or a written request by any one account holder     
without a signature guarantee is sufficient for redemptions by individual or    
joint account holders, and trust, executor and guardian account holders         
(excluding custodial accounts for gifts and transfers to minors), provided the  
trustee, executor or guardian is named in the account registration. Other       
institutional account holders and guardian account holders of custodial accounts
for gifts and transfers to minors may exercise this special privilege of        
redeeming shares by telephone request or written request without signature      
guarantee subject to the same conditions as individual account holders and      
subject to the limitations on liability described under "General" above,        
provided that this privilege has been pre-authorized by the institutional       
account holder or guardian account holder by written instruction to the         
Shareholder Service Agent with signatures guaranteed. Telephone requests may be 
made by calling 1-800-621-1048. Shares purchased by check or through            
EXPRESS-Transfer or Bank Direct Deposit may not be redeemed under this privilege
of redeeming shares by telephone request until such shares have been owned for  
at least 10 days. This privilege of redeeming shares by telephone request or by 
written request without a signature guarantee may not be used to redeem shares  
held in certificated form and may not be used if the shareholder's account has  
had an address change within 30 days of the redemption request. During periods  
when it is difficult to contact the Shareholder Service Agent by telephone, it  
may be difficult to use the telephone redemption privilege, although investors  
can still redeem by mail. KDF reserves the right to terminate or modify this    
privilege at any time.                                                          

REPURCHASES (CONFIRMED REDEMPTIONS). A request for repurchase may be            
communicated by a shareholder through a securities dealer or other financial    
services firm to ZKDI, which KDF has authorized to act as its agent. There is no
charge by ZKDI with respect to repurchases; however, dealers or other firms may 
charge customary commissions for their services. Dealers and other financial    
services firms are obligated to transmit orders promptly. The repurchase price  
will be the net asset value of the applicable Fund next determined after receipt
of a request by ZKDI. However, requests for repurchases received by dealers or  
other firms prior to the determination of net asset value (see "Net Asset
Value") and received by ZKDI prior to the close of ZKDI's business day will be  
confirmed at the net asset value effective on that day. The offer to repurchase 
may be suspended at any time. Requirements as to stock powers, certificates,    
payments and delay of payments are the same as for redemptions.                 

EXPEDITED WIRE TRANSFER REDEMPTIONS. If the account holder has given            
authorization for expedited wire redemption to the account holder's brokerage or
bank account, shares of a Fund can be redeemed and proceeds sent by federal wire
transfer to a single previously designated account. Requests received by the    
Shareholder Service Agent prior to the determination of net asset value will    
result in shares being redeemed that day at the net asset value of the Fund     
effective on that day and normally the proceeds will be sent to the designated  

26

P-->49731st Page of 62TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 31st

account the following business day. Delivery of the proceeds of a wire          
redemption of $250,000 or more may be delayed by KDF for up to seven days if DVA
deems it appropriate under then current market conditions. Once authorization is
on file, the Shareholder Service Agent will honor requests by telephone at      
1-800-621-1048 or in writing, subject to the limitations on liability described 
under "General" above. KDF is not responsible for the efficiency of the federal 
wire system or the account holder's financial services firm or bank. KDF        
currently does not charge the account holder for wire transfers. The account    
holder is responsible for any charges imposed by the account holder's firm or   
bank. There is a $1,000 wire redemption minimum (including any contingent       
deferred sales charge). To change the designated account to receive wire        
redemption proceeds, send a written request to the Shareholder Service Agent    
with signatures guaranteed as described above or contact the firm through which 
shares of KDF were purchased. Shares purchased by check or through              
EXPRESS-Transfer or Bank Direct Deposit may not be redeemed by wire transfer    
until such shares have been owned for at least 10 days. Account holders may not 
use this privilege to redeem shares held in certificated form. During periods   
when it is difficult to contact the Shareholder Service Agent by telephone, it  
may be difficult to use the expedited wire transfer redemption privilege. KDF   
reserves the right to terminate or modify this privilege at any time.           

CONTINGENT DEFERRED SALES CHARGE--LARGE ORDER NAV PURCHASE PRIVILEGE. A         
contingent deferred sales charge may be imposed upon redemption of Class A      
shares that are purchased under the Large Order NAV Purchase Privilege as       
follows: 1% if they are redeemed within one year of purchase and .50% if they   
are redeemed during the second year following purchase. The charge will not be  
imposed upon redemption of reinvested dividends or share appreciation. The      
charge is applied to the value of the shares redeemed excluding amounts not     
subject to the charge. The contingent deferred sales charge will be waived in   
the event of: (a) redemptions by a participant-directed qualified retirement    
plan described in Code Section 401(a) or a participant-directed non-qualified   
deferred compensation plan described in Code Section 457 or a                   
participant-directed qualified retirement plan described in Code Section        
403(b)(7) which is not sponsored by a K-12 school district; (b) redemptions by  
employer sponsored employee benefit plans using the subaccount record keeping   
system made available through the Shareholder Service Agent; (c) redemption of  
shares of a shareholder (including a registered joint owner) who has died; (d)  
redemption of shares of a shareholder (including a registered joint owner) who  
after purchase of the shares being redeemed becomes totally disabled (as        
evidenced by a determination by the federal Social Security Administration); (e)
redemptions under KDF's Systematic Withdrawal Plan at a maximum of 10% per year 
of the net asset value of the account; and (f) redemptions of shares whose      
dealer of record at the time of the investment notifies ZKDI that the dealer    
waives the commission applicable to such Large Order NAV Purchase.              

CONTINGENT DEFERRED SALES CHARGE--CLASS B SHARES. A contingent deferred sales   
charge may be imposed upon redemption of Class B shares. There is no such charge
upon redemption of any share appreciation or reinvested dividends on Class B    
shares. The charge is computed at the following rates applied to the value of   
the shares redeemed excluding amounts not subject to the charge.                

                                                                [Download Table]

                                                                CONTINGENT
                                                                 DEFERRED 
                                                                  SALES   
             YEAR OF REDEMPTION AFTER PURCHASE                    CHARGE  
             ---------------------------------                  ----------
                                                                          
First.......................................................        4%    
Second......................................................        3%    
Third.......................................................        3%    
Fourth......................................................        2%    
Fifth.......................................................        2%    
Sixth.......................................................        1%    

The contingent deferred sales charge will be waived: (a) in the event of the    
total disability (as evidenced by a determination by the federal Social Security
Administration) of the shareholder (including a registered joint owner)         
occurring after the purchase of the shares being redeemed, (b) in the event of  
the death of the shareholder (including a registered joint owner), (c) for      
redemptions made pursuant to a systematic withdrawal

plan (see "Special Features--Systematic Withdrawal Plan" below), (d) for        
redemptions made pursuant to any IRA systematic withdrawal based on the         
shareholder's life expectancy including, but not limited to, substantially equal
periodic payments described in Internal Revenue Code Section 72(t)(2)(A)(iv)    
prior to age 59 1/2 and (e) for redemptions to satisfy required minimum         
distributions after age 70 1/2 from an IRA account (with the maximum amount     
subject to this waiver being based only upon the shareholder's Kemper IRA       
accounts). The contingent deferred sales charge will also be waived in          
connection with the following redemptions of shares held by employer sponsored  
employee benefit plans maintained on the subaccount record keeping system made  
available by the Shareholder Service Agent: (a) redemptions to satisfy          
participant loan advances (note that loan repayments constitute new purchases   
for purposes of the contingent deferred sales charge and the conversion         
privilege), (b) redemptions in connection with retirement distributions (limited
at any one time to 10% of the total value of plan assets invested in a Fund, (c)
redemptions in connection with distributions qualifying under the hardship      
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and (d) redemptions representing returns
of excess contributions to such plans.                                          

CONTINGENT DEFERRED SALES CHARGE--CLASS C SHARES. A contingent deferred sales   
charge of 1% may be imposed if they are redeemed within one year of purchase.   
The charge will not be imposed upon redemption of reinvested dividends or share 
appreciation. The charge is applied to the value of the shares redeemed         
excluding amounts not subject to the charge. The contingent deferred sales      
charge will be waived in the event of: (a) redemptions by a participant-directed
qualified retirement plan described in Code Section 401(a) or a                 
participant-directed non-qualified deferred compensation plan described in Code 
Section 457; (b) redemptions by employer sponsored employee benefit plans using 
the subaccount record keeping system made available through the Shareholder     
Service Agent; (c) redemption of shares of a shareholder (including a registered
joint owner) who has died; (d) redemption of shares of a shareholder (including 
a registered joint owner) who after purchase of the shares being redeemed       
becomes totally disabled (as evidenced by a determination by the federal Social 
Security Administration); (e) redemptions under KDF's Systematic Withdrawal Plan
at a maximum of 10% per year of the net asset value of the account; and (f) for 
any participant-directed redemption of shares held by employer sponsored        
employee benefit plans maintained on the subaccount record keeping system made  
available by the Shareholder Service Agent.                                     

CONTINGENT DEFERRED SALES CHARGE--GENERAL. The following example will illustrate
the operation of the contingent deferred sales charge. Assume that an investor  
makes a single purchase of $10,000 of a Fund's Class B shares and that 16 months
later the value of the shares has grown by $1,000 through reinvested dividends  
and by an additional $1,000 of share appreciation to a total of $12,000. If the 
investor were then to redeem the entire $12,000 in share value, the contingent  
deferred sales charge would be payable only with respect to $10,000 because     
neither the $1,000 of reinvested dividends nor the $1,000 of share appreciation 
is subject to the charge. The charge would be at the rate of 3% ($300) because  
it was in the second year after the purchase was made.                          

The rate of the contingent deferred sales charge under the schedule above is    
determined by the length of the period of ownership. Investments are tracked on 
a monthly basis. The period of ownership for this purpose begins the first day  
of the month in which the order for the investment is received. For example, an 
investment made in May, 1997 will be eligible for the 3% charge if redeemed on  
or after May 1, 1998. In the event no specific order is requested, the          
redemption will be made first from shares representing reinvested dividends and 
then from the earliest purchase of shares. ZKDI receives any contingent deferred
sales charge directly.                                                          

REINVESTMENT PRIVILEGE. A shareholder who has redeemed Class A shares of a Fund 
or any Kemper Mutual Fund listed under "Special Features--Class A
Shares--Combined Purchases" (other than shares of Kemper Cash Reserves Fund     
purchased directly at net asset value) may reinvest up to the full amount       
redeemed at net asset value at the time of the reinvestment in Class A shares of
a Fund or of the other listed Kemper Mutual Funds. A shareholder of a Fund or a 
Kemper Mutual Fund who redeems Class A shares purchased under the Large Order   
NAV Purchase Privilege (see "Purchase of Shares--Initial Sales Charge
Alternative--Class A Shares"), Class B shares or Class C shares and incurs a    
contingent deferred sales charge may reinvest up to the                         

28

P-->49733rd Page of 62TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 33rd

full amount redeemed at net asset value at the time of the reinvestment, in     
Class A, Class B or Class C shares, as the case may be, of a Fund or of other   
Kemper Mutual Funds. The amount of any contingent deferred sales charge also    
will be reinvested. These reinvested shares will retain their original cost and 
purchase date for purposes of the contingent deferred sales charge. Also, a     
holder of Class B shares who has redeemed shares may reinvest up to the full    
amount redeemed, less any applicable contingent deferred sales charge that may  
have been imposed upon the redemption of such shares, at net asset value in     
Class A shares of a Fund or of the Kemper Mutual Funds listed under "Special
Features--Class A Shares--Combined Purchases." Purchases through the            
reinvestment privilege are subject to the minimum investment requirements       
applicable to the shares being purchased and may only be made for Kemper Mutual 
Funds available for sale in the shareholder's state of residence as listed under
"Special Features--Exchange Privilege." The reinvestment privilege can be used  
only once as to any specific shares and reinvestment must be effected within six
months of the redemption. If a loss is realized on the redemption of shares of a
Fund, the reinvestment in the same Fund may be subject to the "wash sale" rules 
if made within 30 days of the redemption, resulting in a postponement of the    
recognition of such loss for federal income tax purposes. The reinvestment      
privilege may be terminated or modified at any time.                            

SPECIAL FEATURES 

CLASS A SHARES--COMBINED PURCHASES. Each Fund's Class A shares (or the          
equivalent) may be purchased at the rate applicable to the discount bracket     
attained by combining concurrent investments in Class A shares of any of the    
following funds: Kemper Technology Fund, Kemper Total Return Fund, Kemper Growth
Fund, Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund, Kemper Income and Capital        
Preservation Fund, Kemper Municipal Bond Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund,  
Kemper High Yield Fund, Kemper U.S. Government Securities Fund, Kemper          
International Fund, Kemper State Tax-Free Income Series, Kemper Adjustable Rate 
U.S. Government Fund, Kemper Blue Chip Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper  
Target Equity Fund (series are subject to a limited offering period), Kemper    
Intermediate Municipal Bond Fund, Kemper Cash Reserves Fund (available only upon
exchange or conversion from Class A shares of another Kemper Mutual Fund),      
Kemper U.S. Mortgage Fund, Kemper Short-Intermediate Government Fund and        
Kemper-Dreman Fund, Inc., Kemper Value+Growth Fund, Kemper Quantitative Equity  
Fund, Kemper Horizon Fund, Kemper Europe Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund and     
Kemper Aggressive Growth Fund ("Kemper Mutual Funds"). Except as noted below,   
there is no combined purchase credit for direct purchases of shares of Zurich   
Money Funds, Cash Equivalent Fund, Tax-Exempt California Money Market Fund, Cash
Account Trust, Tax-Exempt New York Money Market Fund or Investors Cash Trust    
("Money Market Funds"), which are not considered "Kemper Mutual Funds" for      
purposes hereof. For purposes of the Combined Purchases feature described above 
as well as for the Letter of Intent and Cumulative Discount features described  
below, employer sponsored employee benefit plans using the subaccount record    
keeping system made available through the Shareholder Service Agent may include:
(a) Money Market Funds as "Kemper Mutual Funds", (b) all classes of shares of   
any Kemper Mutual Fund and (c) the value of any other plan investment, such as  
guaranteed investment contracts and employer stock, maintained on such          
subaccount record keeping system.                                               

CLASS A SHARES--LETTER OF INTENT. The same reduced sales charges for Class A    
shares, as shown in the applicable prospectus, also apply to the aggregate      
amount of purchases of such Kemper Mutual Funds listed above made by any        
purchaser within a 24-month period under a written Letter of Intent ("Letter")  
provided by ZKDI. The Letter, which imposes no obligation to purchase or sell   
additional Class A shares, provides for a price adjustment depending upon the   
actual amount purchased within such period. The Letter provides that the first  
purchase following execution of the Letter must be at least 5% of the amount of 
the intended purchase, and that 5% of the amount of the intended purchase       
normally will be held in escrow in the form of shares pending completion of the 
intended purchase. If the total investments under the Letter are less than the  
intended amount and thereby qualify only for a higher sales charge than actually
paid, the appropriate number of escrowed shares are redeemed and the proceeds   
used toward satisfaction of the obligation to pay the increased sales charge.   
The Letter for an employer sponsored employee benefit plan maintained on the    
subaccount record

keeping system available through the Shareholder Service Agent may have special 
provisions regarding payment of any increased sales charge resulting from a     
failure to complete the intended purchase under the Letter. A shareholder may   
include the value (at the maximum offering price) of all shares of such Kemper  
Mutual Funds held of record as of the initial purchase date under the Letter as 
an "accumulation credit" toward the completion of the Letter, but no price      
adjustment will be made on such shares. Only investments in Class A shares are  
included in this privilege.                                                     

CLASS A SHARES--CUMULATIVE DISCOUNT. Class A shares of a Fund may also be       
purchased at the rate applicable to the discount bracket attained by adding to  
the cost of shares of a Fund being purchased, the value of all Class A shares of
the above mentioned Kemper Mutual Funds (computed at the maximum offering price 
at the time of the purchase for which the discount is applicable) already owned 
by the investor.                                                                

CLASS A SHARES--AVAILABILITY OF QUANTITY DISCOUNTS. An investor or the          
investor's dealer or other financial services firm must notify the Shareholder  
Service Agent or ZKDI whenever a quantity discount or reduced sales charge is   
applicable to a purchase. Upon such notification, the investor will receive the 
lowest applicable sales charge. Quantity discounts described above may be       
modified or terminated at any time.                                             

EXCHANGE PRIVILEGE. Shareholders of Class A, Class B and Class C shares may     
exchange their shares for shares of the corresponding class of Kemper Mutual    
Funds in accordance with the provisions below.                                  

CLASS A SHARES. Class A shares of the Kemper Mutual Funds and shares of the     
Money Market Funds listed under "Special Features--Class A Shares--Combined
Purchases" above may be exchanged for each other at their relative net asset    
values. Shares of Money Market Funds and Kemper Cash Reserves Fund that were    
acquired by purchase (not including shares acquired by dividend reinvestment)   
are subject to the applicable sales charge on exchange. Series of Kemper Target 
Equity Fund are available on exchange only during the Offering Period for such  
series as described in the applicable prospectus. Cash Equivalent Fund,         
Tax-Exempt California Money Market Fund, Cash Account Trust, Tax-Exempt New York
Money Market Fund and Investors Cash Trust are available on exchange but only   
through a financial services firm having a services agreement with ZKDI.        
Exchanges may only be made for funds that are available for sale in the         
shareholder's state of residence. Currently, Tax-Exempt California Money Market 
Fund is available for sale only in California and Tax-Exempt New York Money     
Market Fund is available for sale only in New York, Connecticut, New Jersey and 
Pennsylvania.                                                                   

Class A shares of a Fund purchased under the Large Order NAV Purchase Privilege 
may be exchanged for Class A shares of any Kemper Mutual Fund or a Money Market 
Fund under the exchange privilege described above without paying any contingent 
deferred sales charge at the time of exchange. If the Class A shares received on
exchange are redeemed thereafter, a contingent deferred sales charge may be     
imposed in accordance with the foregoing requirements provided that the shares  
redeemed will retain their original cost and purchase date for purposes of the  
contingent deferred sales charge.                                               

CLASS B SHARES. Class B shares of a Fund and Class B shares of any Kemper Mutual
Fund listed under "Special Features--Class A Shares--Combined Purchases" may be 
exchanged for each other at their relative net asset values. Class B shares may 
be exchanged without a contingent deferred sales charge being imposed at the    
time of exchange. For purposes of the contingent deferred sales charge that may 
be imposed upon the redemption of the shares received on exchange, amounts      
exchanged retain their original cost and purchase date.                         

CLASS C SHARES. Class C shares of a Fund and Class C shares of any Kemper Mutual
Fund listed under "Special Features--Class A Shares--Combined Purchases" may be 
exchanged for each other at their relative net asset values. Class C shares may 
be exchanged without a contingent deferred sales charge being imposed at the    
time of exchange. For purposes of the contingent deferred sales charge that may 
be imposed upon the redemption of the shares received on exchange, amounts      
exchanged retain their original cost and purchase date.                         

GENERAL. Shares of a Kemper Mutual Fund with a value in excess of $1,000,000    
(except Kemper Cash Reserves Fund) acquired by exchange from another Kemper     
Mutual Fund, or from a Money Market Fund, may not be                            

30

exchanged thereafter until they have been owned for 15 days (the "15 Day Hold   
Policy"). For purposes of determining whether the 15-Day Hold Policy applies to 
a particular exchange, the value of the shares to be exchanged shall be computed
by aggregating the value of shares being exchanged for all accounts under common
control, direction or advice, including without limitation accounts administered
by a financial services firm offering market timing, asset allocation or similar
services. The total value of shares being exchanged must at least equal the     
minimum investment requirement of the Kemper Fund into which they are being     
exchanged. Exchanges are made based on relative dollar values of the shares     
involved in the exchange. There is no service fee for an exchange; however,     
dealers or other firms may charge for their services in effecting exchange      
transactions. Exchanges will be effected by redemption of shares of the fund    
held and purchase of shares of the other fund. For federal income tax purposes, 
any such exchange constitutes a sale upon which a gain or loss may be realized, 
depending upon whether the value of the shares being exchanged is more or less  
than the shareholder's adjusted cost basis. Shareholders interested in          
exercising the exchange privilege may obtain prospectuses of the other funds    
from dealers, other firms or ZKDI. Exchanges may be accomplished by a written   
request to ZKSC, Attention: Exchange Department, P.O. Box 419557, Kansas City,  
Missouri 64141-6557, or by telephone if the shareholder has given authorization.
Once the authorization is on file, the Shareholder Service Agent will honor     
requests by telephone at 1-800-621-1048, subject to the limitations on liability
under "Redemption or Repurchase of Shares--General." Any share certificates must
be deposited prior to any exchange of such shares. During periods when it is    
difficult to contact the Shareholder Service Agent by telephone, it may be      
difficult to use the telephone exchange privilege. The exchange privilege is not
a right and may be suspended, terminated or modified at any time. Exchanges may 
only be made for Kemper Funds that are eligible for sale in the shareholder's   
state of residence. Currently, Tax-Exempt California Money Market Fund is       
available for sale only in California and Tax-Exempt New York Money Market Fund 
is available for sale only in New York, Connecticut, New Jersey and             
Pennsylvania. Except as otherwise permitted by applicable regulations, 60 days' 
prior written notice of any termination or material change will be provided.    

SYSTEMATIC EXCHANGE PRIVILEGE. The owner of $1,000 or more of any class of the  
shares of a Fund, a Kemper Mutual Fund or Money Market Fund may authorize the   
automatic exchange of a specified amount ($100 minimum) of such shares for      
shares of the same class of another Kemper Fund. If selected, exchanges will be 
made automatically until the privilege is terminated by the shareholder or the  
other Kemper Fund. Exchanges are subject to the terms and conditions described  
above under "Exchange Privilege," except that the $1,000 minimum investment     
requirement for the Kemper Fund acquired on exchange is not applicable. This    
privilege may not be used for the exchange of shares held in certificated form. 

EXPRESS-TRANSFER. EXPRESS-Transfer permits the transfer of money via the        
Automated Clearing House System (minimum $100 and maximum $50,000) from a       
shareholder's bank, savings and loan, or credit union account to purchase shares
in a Fund. Shareholders can also redeem shares (minimum $100 and maximum        
$50,000) from their KDF account and transfer the proceeds to their bank, savings
and loan, or credit union checking account. Shares purchased by check or through
EXPRESS-Transfer or Bank Direct Deposit may not be redeemed under this privilege
until such shares have been owned for at least 10 days. By enrolling in EXPRESS-
Transfer, the shareholder authorizes the Shareholder Service Agent to rely upon 
telephone instructions from ANY PERSON to transfer the specified amounts between
the shareholder's KDF account and the predesignated bank, savings and loan or   
credit union account, subject to the limitations on liability under "Redemption
or Repurchase of Shares--General." Once enrolled in EXPRESS-Transfer, a         
shareholder can initiate a transaction by calling Kemper Shareholder Services   
toll free at 1-800-621-1048 Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.       
Chicago time. Shareholders may terminate this privilege by sending written      
notice to Zurich Kemper Service Company, P.O. Box 419415, Kansas City, Missouri
64141-6415. Termination will become effective as soon as the Shareholder Service
Agent has had a reasonable time to act upon the request. EXPRESS-Transfer cannot
be used with passbook savings accounts or for tax-deferred plans such as        
Individual Retirement Accounts ("IRAs").

BANK DIRECT DEPOSIT. A shareholder may purchase additional shares of a Fund     
through an automatic investment program. With the Bank Direct Deposit Purchase  
Plan, investments are made automatically (minimum $50 and maximum $50,000) from 
the shareholder's account at a bank, savings and loan or credit union into the  
shareholder's KDF account. By enrolling in Bank Direct Deposit, the shareholder 
authorizes KDF and its agents to either draw checks or initiate Automated       
Clearing House debits against the designated account at a bank or other         
financial institution. This privilege may be selected by completing the         
appropriate section on the Account Application or by contacting the Shareholder 
Service Agent for appropriate forms. A shareholder may terminate his or her Plan
by sending written notice to ZKSC, P.O. Box 419415, Kansas City, Missouri 64141-
6415. Termination by a shareholder will become effective within thirty days     
after the Shareholder Service Agent has received the request. KDF may           
immediately terminate a shareholder's Plan in the event that any item is unpaid 
by the shareholder's financial institution. KDF may terminate or modify this    
privilege at any time.                                                          

PAYROLL DIRECT DEPOSIT AND GOVERNMENT DIRECT DEPOSIT. A shareholder may invest  
in a Fund through Payroll Direct Deposit or Government Direct Deposit. Under    
these programs, all or a portion of a shareholder's net pay or government check 
is automatically invested in a KDF account each payment period. A shareholder   
may terminate participation in these programs by giving written notice to the   
shareholder's employer or government agency, as appropriate. (A reasonable time 
to act is required.) KDF is not responsible for the efficiency of the employer  
or government agency making the payment or any financial institutions           
transmitting payments.                                                          

SYSTEMATIC WITHDRAWAL PLAN. The owner of $5,000 or more of a class of a Fund's  
shares at the offering price (net asset value plus, in the case of Class A      
shares, the initial sales charge) may provide for the payment from the owner's  
account of any requested dollar amount up to $50,000 to be paid to the owner or 
a designated payee monthly, quarterly, semiannually or annually. The $5,000     
minimum account size is not applicable to Individual Retirement Accounts. The   
minimum periodic payment is $100. The maximum annual rate at which Class B      
shares (and Class A shares purchased under the Large Order NAV Purchase         
Privilege and Class C shares in the first year following the purchase) may be   
redeemed under a systematic withdrawal plan is 10% of the net asset value of the
account. Shares are redeemed so that the payee will receive payment             
approximately the first of the month. Any income and capital gain dividends will
be automatically reinvested at net asset value. A sufficient number of full and 
fractional shares will be redeemed to make the designated payment. Depending    
upon the size of the payments requested and fluctuations in the net asset value 
of the shares redeemed, redemptions for the purpose of making such payments may 
reduce or even exhaust the account.                                             

The purchase of Class A shares while participating in a systematic withdrawal   
plan will ordinarily be disadvantageous to the investor because the investor    
will be paying a sales charge on the purchase of shares at the same time that   
the investor is redeeming shares upon which a sales charge may have already been
paid. Therefore, KDF will not knowingly permit additional investments of less   
than $2,000 if the investor is at the same time making systematic withdrawals.  
ZKDI will waive the contingent deferred sales charge on redemptions of Class A  
shares purchased under the Large Order NAV Purchase Privilege, Class B shares   
and Class C shares made pursuant to a systematic withdrawal plan. The right is  
reserved to amend the systematic withdrawal plan on 30 days' notice. The plan   
may be terminated at any time by the investor or KDF.                           

TAX-SHELTERED RETIREMENT PLANS. The Shareholder Service Agent provides          
retirement plan services and documents and ZKDI can establish investor accounts 
in any of the following types of retirement plans:                              

- Individual Retirement Accounts ("IRAs") with IFTC as custodian. This includes 
Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees of Small Employers ("SIMPLE") IRA
accounts and Simplified Employee Pension Plan ("SEP") IRA accounts and      
prototype documents.                                                        

- 403(b)(7) Custodial Accounts with IFTC as custodian. This type of plan is     
available to employees of most non-profit organizations.                    

- Prototype money purchase pension and profit-sharing plans may be adopted by   
employers. The maximum annual contribution per participant is the lesser of 
25% of compensation or $30,000.                                             

32

P-->49737th Page of 62TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 37th

Brochures describing the above plans as well as model defined benefit plans,    
target benefit plans, 457 plans, 401(k) plans, SIMPLE 401(k) plans and materials
for establishing them are available from the Shareholder Service Agent upon     
request. The brochures for plans with IFTC as custodian describe the current    
fees payable to IFTC for its services as custodian. Investors should consult    
with their own tax advisers before establishing a retirement plan.              

PERFORMANCE 

KDF may advertise several types of performance information for a class of       
shares, including "average annual total return" and "total return." Performance 
information will be computed separately for Class A, Class B and Class C shares.
Each of these figures is based upon historical results and is not representative
of the future performance of any class of the Funds.                            

Average annual total return and total return figures measure both the net       
investment income generated by, and the effect of any realized and unrealized   
appreciation or depreciation of, the underlying investments in a Fund's         
portfolio for the period referenced, assuming the reinvestment of all dividends.
Thus, these figures reflect the change in the value of an investment in a Fund  
during a specified period. Average annual total return will be quoted for at    
least the one, five and ten year periods ending on a recent calendar quarter (or
if such periods have not yet elapsed, at the end of a shorter period            
corresponding to the life of the Fund for performance purposes). Average annual 
total return figures represent the average annual percentage change over the    
period in question. Total return figures represent the aggregate percentage or  
dollar value change over the period in question.                                

A Fund's performance may be compared to that of the Consumer Price Index or     
various unmanaged equity indexes including, but not limited to, the Dow Jones   
Industrial Average, the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index, the Standard &       
Poor's/Barra Value Index, the Russell 1000 Value Index and the Russell 2000     
Value Index. The performance of a Fund may also be compared to the combined     
performance of two indexes. The performance of a Fund may also be compared to   
the performance of other mutual funds or mutual fund indexes with similar       
objectives and policies as reported by independent mutual fund reporting        
services such as Lipper Analytical Services, Inc. ("Lipper"). Lipper performance
calculations are based upon changes in net asset value with all dividends       
reinvested and do not include the effect of any sales charges.                  

Information may be quoted from publications such as MORNINGSTAR, INC., THE WALL 
STREET JOURNAL, MONEY MAGAZINE, FORBES, BARRON'S, FORTUNE, THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE, 
USA TODAY, INSTITUTIONAL INVESTOR and REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE. Also, investors
may want to compare the historical returns of various investments, performance  
indexes of those investments or economic indicators, including but not limited  
to stocks, bonds, certificates of deposit, money market funds and U.S. Treasury 
obligations. Bank product performance may be based upon, among other things, the
BANK RATE MONITOR National Index(TM) or various certificate of deposit indexes. 
Money market fund performance may be based upon, among other things, the        
IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report(R) or Money Market Insight(R), reporting       
services on money market funds. Performance of U.S. Treasury obligations may be 
based upon, among other things, various U.S. Treasury bill indexes. Certain of  
these alternative investments may offer fixed rates of return and guaranteed    
principal and may be insured.                                                   

A Fund may depict the historical performance of the securities in which a Fund  
may invest over periods reflecting a variety of market or economic conditions   
either alone or in comparison with alternative investments, performance indexes 
of those investments or economic indicators. A Fund may also describe its       
portfolio holdings and depict its size or relative size compared to other mutual
funds, the number and make-up of its shareholder base and other descriptive     
factors concerning the Fund. A Fund may also discuss the relative performance of
growth stocks versus value stocks.                                              

Each Fund's Class A shares are sold at net asset value plus a maximum sales     
charge of 5.75% of the offering price. While the maximum sales charge is        
normally reflected in the Fund's Class A performance figures, certain total     
return calculations may not include such charge and those results would be      
reduced if it were included.                                                    

33

P-->49738th Page of 62TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 38th

Class B shares and Class C shares are sold at net asset value. Redemptions of   
Class B shares within the first six years after purchase may be subject to a    
contingent deferred sales charge that ranges from 4% during the first year to 0%
after six years. Redemption of the Class C shares within the first year after   
purchase may be subject to a 1% contingent deferred sales charge. Average annual
total return figures do, and total return figures may, include the effect of the
contingent deferred sales charge for the Class B shares and Class C shares that 
may be imposed at the end of the period in question. Performance figures for the
Class B shares and Class C shares not including the effect of the applicable    
contingent deferred sales charge would be reduced if it were included.          

Each Fund's returns and net asset value will fluctuate. Shares of a Fund are    
redeemable by an investor at the then current net asset value, which may be more
or less than original cost. Redemption of Class B shares and Class C shares may 
be subject to a contingent deferred sales charge as described above. Additional 
information concerning each Fund's performance appears in the Statement of      
Additional Information. Additional information about each Fund's performance    
also appears in its Annual Report to Shareholders, which is available without   
charge from KDF.                                                                

CAPITAL STRUCTURE                                                               

KDF was organized as a Maryland corporation in October, 1987 and has an         
authorized capitalization of 500,000,000 shares of $.01 par value common stock. 
In September, 1995, KDF changed its name from Dreman Mutual Group, Inc. to      
Kemper-Dreman Fund, Inc. Since KDF may offer multiple funds, it is known as a   
"series company." Currently, KDF offers four classes of shares of each Fund.    
These are Class A, Class B and Class C shares, as well as Class I shares, which 
have different expenses, that may affect performance, and are available for     
purchase exclusively by the following investors: (a) tax-exempt retirement plans
of ZKI and its affiliates; and (b) the following investment advisory clients of 
ZKI and its investment advisory affiliates that invest at least $1 million in a 
Fund: (1) unaffiliated benefit plans, such as qualified retirement plans (other 
than individual retirement accounts and self-directed retirement plans); (2)    
unaffiliated banks and insurance companies purchasing for their own accounts;   
and (3) endowment funds of unaffiliated non-profit organizations. The Board of  
Directors may authorize the issuance of additional classes and additional Funds 
if deemed desirable, each with its own investment objectives, policies and      
restrictions. Shares of a Fund have equal noncumulative voting rights except    
that Class B and Class C shares have separate and exclusive voting rights with  
respect to the Rule 12b-1 Plan. Shares of each class also have equal rights with
respect to dividends, assets and liquidation of such Fund subject to any        
preferences (such as resulting from different Rule 12b-1 distribution fees),    
rights or privileges of any classes of shares of the Fund. Shares of each Fund  
are fully paid and nonassessable when issued, are transferable without          
restriction and have no preemptive or conversion rights. The Board of Directors 
of KDF may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, have the right at any    
time to redeem from any shareholder, or from all shareholders, all or any part  
of any series or class, or of all series or classes, of the shares of KDF.      

The Funds are not required to hold annual shareholder meetings and do not intend
to do so. However, they will hold special meetings as required or deemed        
desirable for such purposes as electing directors, changing fundamental policies
or approving an investment management agreement. KDF will call a meeting of     
shareholders, if requested to do so by the holders of at least 10% of KDF's     
outstanding shares and, in the case of a meeting called to consider removal of a
director or directors, will assist in communications with other shareholders as 
required by Section 16(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940. If shares of   
more than one Fund are outstanding, shareholders will vote by Fund and not in   
the aggregate or by class except when voting in the aggregate is required under 
the Investment Company Act of 1940, such as for the election of directors, or   
when voting by class is appropriate.

INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS 

Each Fund has adopted certain fundamental investment restrictions which cannot  
be changed without approval of a majority of its outstanding voting shares. As  
defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, this means the lesser of the vote
of (a) 67% of the shares of the Fund present at a meeting where more than 50% of
the outstanding shares are present in person or by proxy or (b) more than 50% of
the outstanding shares of the Fund.                                             

A FUND MAY NOT, AS A FUNDAMENTAL POLICY:                                        

(1) Purchase securities of any one issuer other than obligations issued or      
guaranteed by the U.S. Government, its agencies or instrumentalities            
collectively ("U.S. Government Securities") if immediately thereafter more than 
5% of its total assets would be invested in the securities of any one issuer, or
purchase more than 10% of an issuer's outstanding securities, except that up to 
25% of each Fund's total assets may be invested without regard to these         
limitations.                                                                    

(2) Borrow money or issue senior securities, except that each Fund may borrow   
from banks for temporary purposes in amounts not in excess of 10% of the value  
of its total assets at the time of such borrowing; or mortgage, pledge, or      
hypothecate any assets except in connection with any such borrowing in amounts  
not in excess of the lesser of the amount borrowed or 10% of the value of its   
total assets at the time of such borrowing; provided that the Funds may enter   
into futures contracts and related options as described in the prospectus.      
Optioned securities are not considered to be pledged for purposes of this       
limitation.                                                                     

(3) Purchase any securities which would cause more than 25% of the value of its 
total assets at the time of purchase to be invested in the securities of issuers
conducting their principal activities in the same industry.                     

(4) Invest more than 10% of the value of its net assets in illiquid securities, 
including restricted securities and repurchase agreements with remaining        
maturities in excess of seven days, and other securities for which market       
quotations are not readily available.                                           

(5) Make loans, except that each Fund may lend securities it owns as described  
herein and enter into repurchase agreements pursuant to its investment objective
and policies.                                                                   

(6) Purchase securities on margin or make short sales of securities, provided   
that the Funds may enter into futures contracts and related options and make    
initial and variation margin deposits in connection therewith.                  

(7) Purchase or sell commodities or commodity contracts, except futures         
contracts and options thereon as stated in the prospectus, or invest in oil, gas
or mineral exploration or development programs, or in real estate or mortgage   
loans provided that the Funds may, to the extent appropriate to their investment
objectives, purchase publicly traded securities of companies engaging in whole  
or in part in such activities.                                                  

(8) Engage in the business of underwriting securities issued by others, except  
that each Fund may acquire securities which are subject to restrictions on      
disposition ("restricted securities") within the meaning of the Securities Act  
of 1933.                                                                        

THE FUNDS MAY NOT, AS A NON-FUNDAMENTAL POLICY:                                 

(1) Purchase or retain securities of an issuer if the officers and directors of 
KDF and/or the officers and directors of the investment advisor who own more    
than 1/2 of 1% of such securities together own more than 5% of such securities. 

(2) Invest for the purpose of exercising control over management of any company.

(3) Invest its assets in securities of any investment company, except by open   
market purchases, including an ordinary broker's commission, or in connection

(4) Invest more than 5% of its total assets in securities of companies which

American Stock Exchanges except warrants acquired as a result of its holdings of
common stocks.

INVESTMENT POLICIES AND TECHNIQUES 

STOCK INDEX FUTURES. A stock index contract is a agreement pursuant to which the
parties agree to take or make delivery of an amount of cash equal to a specified
dollar amount times the difference between the stock index value (which assigns 
relative values to the common stocks included in the index) at the close of the 
last trading day of the contract and the price at which the futures contract is 
originally struck. A Fund may not purchase a futures contract if immediately    
thereafter the sum of its margin deposits on its existing futures positions     
would exceed 5% of the value of its total assets (including the margin          
deposits).                                                                      

A risk assumed in transactions in futures contracts is the possibility that     
Dreman Value Advisors, Inc. ("DVA") may be incorrect in its expectations as to  
the extent of various market movements or the time spans within which the       
movement takes place. Should the investment manager be incorrect in its         
predictions, the Fund's return might have been better had hedging not been      
attempted. Further, although the Funds intend to trade in futures contracts only
on exchanges or boards of trade where there appears to be active secondary      
markets, there is no assurance that a liquid secondary market on any exchange or
board of trade will exist for any particular contract or at any particular time.
Finally, it is conceivable that, under certain circumstances, a Fund would be   
required to sell portfolio securities at a time when it otherwise would not do  
so in order to make margin payments on its futures positions, for the reasons   
above, the purchase or sale of a futures contract may result in losses in excess
of the amount invested in the futures contract.                                 

While futures contracts provide for the delivery of securities, deliveries      
usually do not occur, contracts are generally terminated by entering into an    
off-setting transaction. The Funds will incur brokerage fees when they purchase 
futures contracts. At the same time such a purchase is made, the Fund must      
provide cash or securities as a deposit ("initial deposit") known as "margin."  
It is expected that the initial deposit would be approximately 2% of the        
contract's face value. Daily, thereafter, the futures contract is valued and the
payment of "variation margin" may he required because each day the Fund must    
provide or receive cash reflecting the decline or increase in the value of the  
contract.                                                                       

The liquidity of a market in a futures contract may be adversely affected by    
"daily price fluctuation limits" established by commodity exchanges which limit 
the amount of fluctuation in a futures contract price during a single trading   
day. Once the daily limit has been reached in the contract, no trades may be    
entered into at a price beyond the limit thus preventing the liquidation of open
futures positions. Prices have in the past exceeded the daily limit on a number 
of consecutive trading days. On any day or days when the price fluctuation      
limits have been reached a Fund may be unable to liquidate existing futures     
positions or to implement a hedging strategy through the purchase or sale of    
particular futures.                                                             

The writing of a call option on a futures contract constitutes a partial hedge  
against declining prices of the securities which are deliverable upon exercise  
of the futures contract. If the futures price at expiration of the option is    
below the exercise price, a Fund will retain the full amount of the option      
premium which provides a partial hedge against any decline that may have        
occurred in the portfolio holdings. The writing of a put option                 

 B-2

P-->49743rd Page of 62TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 43rd

on a futures contract constitutes a partial hedge against increasing prices of  
the securities which are deliverable upon exercise of the futures contract. If  
the futures price at expiration of the option is higher than the exercise price,
the Fund will retain the full amount of the option premium which provides a     
partial hedge against any increase in the price of securities which the Fund    
intends to purchase. If a put or call option that the Fund has written is       
exercised, the Fund will incur a loss which will be reduced by the amount of the
premium it receives. Depending on the degree of correlation between changes in  
the value of its portfolio securities and changes in the value of its futures   
positions, a Fund's losses from existing options on futures to some extent may  
be reduced or increased by changes in the value of portfolio securities.        

LENDING PORTFOLIO SECURITIES. A Fund may lend its portfolio securities to       
brokers, dealers and institutional investors who need to borrow securities in   
order to complete certain transactions, such as covering short sales, avoiding  
failures to deliver securities or completing arbitrage operations. By lending   
its securities, a portfolio can increase its income by the receipt of interest  
on the loan. Any gain or loss in the market value of the securities loaned that 
might occur during the term of the loan would accrue to the Fund. Securities'   
loans will be made on terms which require that (a) the borrower pledge and      
maintain (on a daily basis) with the Fund collateral consisting of cash, a      
letter of credit or United States Government securities having a value at all   
times not less than 100% of the value of the securities loaned, (b) the loan can
be terminated by the Fund at any time, (c) the Fund receives reasonable interest
on the loan which may include the Fund's investing any cash collateral in       
interest bearing short-term investments), and (d) any distributions on the      
loaned securities must be paid to the Fund. The Fund will not lend its          
securities if, as a result, the aggregate of such loans exceeds 33% of the value
of the Fund's total assets. Loan arrangements made by a Fund will comply with   
all other applicable regulatory requirements, including the rules of the New    
York Stock Exchange, which require the borrower, after notice, to redeliver the 
securities within the normal settlement time of five business days. All relevant
facts and circumstances, including the credit worthiness of the broker, dealer  
or institution, will be considered in making decisions with respect to the      
lending of securities, subject to review by KDF's Board of Directors. While     
voting rights may pass with the loaned securities, if a material event occurs   
affecting an investment on loan, the loan must be called and the securities     
voted. KDF does not intend to lend securities of any Fund if as a result more   
than 5% of the net assets of the Fund would be on loan.                         

SELLING COVERED CALL OPTIONS. The Funds may sell covered call options on        
securities that they own to reduce the effect of price fluctuations of these    
securities and increase their income. Such options will generally be written on 
securities which, in the investment manager's opinion, are not expected to make 
any major price moves in the near future but which, over the long term, are     
deemed to be attractive investments for a Fund.                                 

Until the option expires, the obligation of a Fund continues, requiring the Fund
to deliver the underlying security against payment of the exercise price. This  
obligation terminates upon the expiration of the call option, or such earlier   
time at which the Fund effects a closing purchase transaction by purchasing an  
identical option to the option which it previously sold. To secure its          
obligation to deliver the underlying security, a Fund is required to keep the   
underlying security in escrow in accordance with the rules of the Options       
Clearing Corporation and of the Exchanges.                                      

When selling a covered call option, a Fund, in return for the premium, gives up 
an opportunity for profit from a price increase in the optioned security above  
the exercise price, and retains the risk of loss should the price of the        
security decline. A Fund may, however, close out its obligation to deliver the  
optioned securities by purchasing an identical option prior to the expiration   
date of the option it has sold. A Fund has no control over when it may be       
required to sell the underlying securities, since it may be assigned an exercise
notice at any time prior to the expiration of the option. If a call option which
a Fund has written expires, the Fund will realize a gain in the amount of the   
premium; however, such gain may be offset by a decline in the market value of   
the underlying security during the option period. If the call option is         
exercised, the Fund will realize a gain or loss from the sale of the underlying 
security. The security underlying the call will be maintained in a segregated   
account of KDF's custodian.                                                     

 B-3

P-->49744th Page of 62TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 44th

The premium received by a Fund will be the current market value of the option   
and will be recorded as a liability in the Fund's statement of assets and       
liabilities. This liability will be adjusted daily to the option's current      
market value, which will be the latest sale price at the time at which the net  
asset value per share of the Fund is computed or, in the absence of such sale,  
the mean between the latest bid and latest asked prices. The liability will be  
extinguished upon expiration of the option, the purchase of an identical option 
in a closing transaction, or delivery of the underlying security upon the       
exercise of the option.                                                         

Closing transactions may be effected in order to realize a profit on an         
outstanding call option, to prevent an optioned security from being called, or  
to permit the sale of the optioned security. There is, of course, no assurance  
that a Fund will be able to effect a closing transaction at a favorable price.  
If a Fund cannot enter into such a transaction, it may be required to hold a    
security that it might otherwise have sold, in which case it would continue to  
incur market risk on the security. The Funds will incur brokerage commissions in
connection with options transactions which are normally higher than those       
applicable to purchases and sales of other listed securities.                   

Call options sold by a Fund will normally have expiration dates of less than    
nine months from the date written. The exercise price of the options may be     
below, equal to, or above the current market values of the underlying securities
at the time the options are written. From time to time, a Fund may purchase an  
underlying security for delivery in accordance with an exercise notice of a call
option assigned to it, rather than delivering such security from its portfolio. 
In such cases, additional brokerage commissions will be incurred.               

The Funds will realize a profit or loss from a closing purchase transaction     
depending upon whether the cost of the transaction is less or more than the     
premium received from the writing of the option, Because increases in the market
price of a call option will generally reflect increases in the market price of  
the underlying security, any loss resulting from the purchase of a call option  
is likely to be offset in whole or in part by appreciation of the underlying    
security owned by a Fund.                                                       

REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS. To the extent required to comply with applicable       
regulation, when purchasing a futures contract or writing a put option, a Fund  
will maintain eligible securities in a segregated account. A Fund will use cover
in connection with selling a futures contract.                                  

A Fund will not engage in transactions in financial futures contracts or options
thereon for speculation, but only in an attempt to hedge against changes in     
interest rates or market conditions affecting the value of securities that the  
Fund holds or intends to purchase.                                              

PORTFOLIO TRANSACTIONS 

DVA is the investment manager for the Funds, and DVA, Zurich Kemper Investments,
Inc. ("ZKI") (DVA's parent company), and its affiliates also furnish investment 
management services to other clients including the Kemper Funds, Zurich Funds   
and affiliated insurance companies. ZKI and its affiliates share some common    
research and trading facilities. At times investment decisions may be made to   
purchase or sell the same investment securities for the Funds and for one or    
more of the other clients managed by DVA or its affiliates. When two or more of 
such clients are simultaneously engaged in the purchase or sale of the same     
security through the same trading facility, the transactions are allocated as to
amount and price in a manner considered equitable to each.                      

National securities exchanges have established limitations governing the maximum
number of options in each class which may be written by a single investor or    
group of investors acting in concert. An exchange may order the liquidation of  
positions found to be in violation of these limits, and it may impose certain   
other sanctions. These position limits may restrict the number of options KDF   
will be able to write on a particular security.                                 

The above mentioned factors may have a detrimental effect on the quantities or  
prices of securities, options or futures contracts available to the Funds. On   
the other hand, the ability of the Funds to participate in volume               

 B-4

P-->49745th Page of 62TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 45th

transactions may produce better executions for the Funds in some cases. The     
Board of Directors believes that the benefits of DVA's organization outweigh any
limitations that may arise from simultaneous transactions or position           
limitations.                                                                    

DVA, in effecting purchases and sale of portfolio securities for the account of 
the Funds, will implement the Funds' policy of seeking best execution of orders.
DVA may be permitted to pay higher brokerage commissions for research services  
as described below. Consistent with this policy, orders for portfolio           
transactions are placed with broker-dealer firms giving consideration to the    
quality, quantity and nature of each firm's professional services, which include
execution, financial responsibility, responsiveness clearance procedures, wire  
service quotations and statistical and other research information provided to   
the Funds and DVA and its affiliates. Subject to seeking best execution of an   
order, brokerage is allocated on the basis of all services provided. Any        
research benefits derived are available for all clients, including clients of   
DVA and its affiliates. In selecting among firms believed to meet the criteria  
for handling a particular transaction, DVA may give consideration to those firms
that have sold or are selling shares of the Funds and of other funds managed by 
DVA's affiliates, as well as to those firms that provide market, statistical and
other research information to the Funds and DVA and its affiliates, although DVA
is not authorized to pay higher commissions to firms that provide such services,
except as described below.                                                      

DVA may in certain instances be permitted to pay higher brokerage commissions   
solely for receipt of market, statistical and other research services as defined
in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and interpretations     
thereunder. Such services may include among other things: economic, industry or 
company research reports or investment recommendations; computerized databases; 
quotation and execution equipment and software; and research or analytical      
computer software and services. DVA may attempt to direct sufficient commissions
and in the case of transactions for certain types of clients, dealer selling    
concessions on new issues of securities, to ensure the continued receipt of such
research products and services. Where products or services have a "mixed use," a
good faith effort is made to make a reasonable allocation of the cost of        
products or services in accordance with the anticipated research and            
non-research uses and the cost attributable to non-research use is paid by DVA  
or one of its affiliates in cash. Subject to Section 28(e) and procedures       
adopted by the Board of Directors of KDF, the Funds could pay a firm that       
provides research services commissions for effecting a securities transaction   
for the Funds in excess of the amount other firms would have charged for the    
transaction if DVA determines in good faith that the greater commission is      
reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services      
provided by the executing firm viewed in terms either of a particular           
transaction or DVA's overall responsibilities to the Funds and other clients.   
Not all of such research services may be useful or of value in advising the     
Funds. Research benefits will be available for all clients of DVA and its       
affiliates. The investment management fee paid by the Funds to DVA is not       
reduced because these research services are received.                           

The table below shows total brokerage commissions paid by each Fund for the last
three fiscal years and for the most recent fiscal year, the percentage thereof  
that was allocated to firms based upon research information provided.

The increase in the dollar amount of brokerage commissions paid by the Funds    
during the 1996 fiscal year was primarily due to the increase in the amount of  
assets under management of each Fund.

INVESTMENT MANAGER AND UNDERWRITER 

INVESTMENT MANAGER. Dreman Value Advisors, Inc. ("DVA"), 280 Park Avenue, 40(th)
Floor, New York, New York 10017, is KDF's investment manager. DVA is a          
wholly-owned subsidiary of ZKI, ZKI is wholly owned by ZKI Holding Corp. ZKI    
Holding Corp. is more than 90% owned subsidiary of Zurich Holding Company of    
America, Inc., which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Zurich Insurance Company,  
an internationally recognized provider of financial services in                 
property/casualty and life insurance, reinsurance and asset management. Pursuant
to an investment management agreement, DVA acts as each Fund's investment       
adviser, manages its investments, administers its business affairs, furnishes   
office facilities and equipment, provides clerical, bookkeeping and             
administrative services, and permits any of its officers or employees to serve  
without compensation as directors or officers of KDF if elected to such         
positions. Each investment management agreement provides that each Fund pays the
charges and expenses of its operations, including the fees and expenses of the  
directors (except those who are affiliates of DVA or its affiliates),           
independent auditors, counsel, custodian and transfer agent and the cost of     
share certificates, reports and notices to shareholders, brokerage commissions  
or transaction costs, costs of calculating net asset value, taxes and membership
dues. KDF bears the expenses of registration of its shares with the Securities  
and Exchange Commission, while Zurich Kemper Distributors, Inc., as principal   
underwriter, pays the cost of qualifying and maintaining the qualification of   
each Fund's shares for sale under the securities laws of the various states. DVA
has agreed to reimburse each Fund to the extent required by applicable state    
expense limitations should all operating expenses of each Fund, including the   
investment management fees of DVA but excluding taxes, interest, distribution   
fees, extraordinary expenses, brokerage commissions or transaction costs and any
other properly excludable expenses, exceed the applicable state expense         
limitations. Currently, there are no state expense limitations in effect.       

The investment management agreement provides that DVA shall not be liable for   
any error of judgment or of law, or for any loss suffered by a Fund in          
connection with the matters to which the agreements relate, except a loss       
resulting from willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on the part of
DVA in the performance of its obligations and duties, or by reason of its       
reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under each agreement.          

KDF's investment management agreement continues in effect from year to year so  
long as its continuation is approved at least annually by (a) a majority of the 
directors who are not parties to such agreement or interested persons of any    
such party except in their capacity as directors of KDF, and (b) by the         
shareholders or the Board of Directors of KDF. The investment management        
agreement may be terminated at any time upon 60 days notice by either party, or 
by a majority vote of the outstanding shares of each Fund for that Fund, and    
will terminate automatically upon assignment.                                   

The current investment management fee rates paid by the Funds are in the        
prospectus under "Investment Manager and Underwriter." Prior to August 24, 1995,
each Fund paid the former adviser an investment management fee at the annual    
rate of 1.00% of average daily net assets of the Fund up to $1 billion in net   
assets and .75% thereafter. The table below shows the total investment          
management fees paid by each Fund to DVA (or the former adviser for the Funds)  
for the last three fiscal years.

including the payment of any commissions. KDF pays the cost for the prospectus  
and shareholder reports to be set in type and printed for existing shareholders,
and ZKDI, as principal underwriter, pays for the printing and distribution of   
copies thereof used in connection with the offering of shares to prospective    
investors. ZKDI also pays for supplementary sales literature and advertising    
costs.                                                                          

The distribution agreement continues in effect from year to year so long as such
continuance is approved for each class at least annually by a vote of the Board 
of Directors of KDF, including the Directors who are not interested persons of  
KDF and who have no direct or indirect financial interest in the agreement. The 
agreement automatically terminates in the event of its assignment and may be    
terminated for a class at any time without penalty by a Fund for that Fund or by
ZKDI upon 60 days' notice. Termination by a Fund with respect to a class may be 
by vote of a majority of the Board of Directors, or a majority of the Directors 
who are not interested persons of KDF and who have no direct or indirect        
financial interest in the agreement, or a "majority of the outstanding voting   
securities" of the class of KDF, as defined under the Investment Company Act of 
1940. The agreement may not be amended for a class to increase the fee to be    
paid by a Fund with respect to such class without approval by a majority of the 
outstanding voting securities of such class of a Fund and all material          
amendments must in any event be approved by the Board of Directors in the manner
described above with respect to the continuation of the agreement.              

Prior to September 11, 1995, Fund/Plan Broker Services, Inc. ("FBS"), served as 
the underwriter of KDF's shares, pursuant to an underwriting agreement which    
became effective January 4, 1993. Under the agreement, FBS was the exclusive    
agent for KDF's continuous offer of shares. Prior to September 11, 1995, shares 
of KDF were offered to the public at net asset value, without a sales load. No  
underwriting commissions were associated with sales of Fund shares for the      
fiscal year ended December 31, 1994 and for the period January 1, 1995 to       
September 10, 1995.

CLASS B SHARES AND CLASS C SHARES.  Since the distribution agreement provides   
for fees charged to Class B and Class C shares that are used by ZKDI to pay for 
distribution services (see the prospectus under "Investment Manager and
Underwriter"), the agreement (the "Plan") is approved and renewed separately for
the Class B and Class C shares in accordance with Rule 12b-1 under the          
Investment Company Act of 1940, which regulates the manner in which an          
investment company may, directly or indirectly, bear expenses of distributing   
its shares. Expenses of the Funds and of ZKDI in connection with the Rule 12b-1 
Plans for the Class B and Class C shares are set forth below. A portion of the  
marketing, sales and operating expenses shown below could be considered overhead
expense.

ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES. Administrative services are provided to KDF under an   
administrative services agreement ("administrative agreement") with ZKDI, which 
became effective September 11, 1995. ZKDI bears all its expenses of providing   
services pursuant to the administrative agreement between ZKDI and KDF,         
including the payment of service fees. KDF pays ZKDI an administrative services 
fee, payable monthly, at an annual rate of up to .25% of average daily net      
assets of the Class A, B and C shares of each Fund.                             

ZKDI has entered into related arrangements with various broker-dealer firms and 
other service or administrative firms ("firms"), that provide services and      
facilities for their customers or clients who are investors in KDF. The firms   
provide such office space and equipment, telephone facilities and personnel as  
is necessary or beneficial for providing information and services to their      
clients. Such services and assistance may include, but are not limited to,      
establishing and maintaining accounts and records, processing purchase and      
redemption transactions, answering routine inquiries regarding the Funds,       
assistance to clients in changing dividend and investment options, account      
designations and addresses and such other administrative services as may be     
agreed upon from time to time and permitted by applicable statute, rule or      
regulation. With respect to Class A shares, ZKDI pays each firm a service fee,  
payable quarterly, at an annual rate of up to .25% of the net assets in the     
Funds' accounts that it maintains and services attributable to Class A shares,  
commencing with the month after

investment. With respect to Class B and Class C shares, ZKDI currently advances 
to firms the first-year service fee at a rate of up to .25% of the purchase     
price of such shares. For periods after the first year, ZKDI currently intends  
to pay firms a service fee at a rate of up to .25% (calculated monthly and paid 
quarterly) of the net assets attributable to Class B and C shares maintained and
serviced by the firm. After the first year, a firm becomes eligible for the     
quarterly service fee and the fee continues until terminated by ZKDI or KDF.    
Firms to which service fees may be paid may include affiliates of ZKDI.         

The following information concerns the administrative services fee paid by each 
Fund to ZKDI.

ZKDI also may provide some of the above services and may retain any portion of  
the fee under the administrative agreement not paid to firms to compensate      
itself for administrative functions performed for the Funds. Currently, the     
administrative services fee payable to ZKDI is based only upon KDF assets in    
accounts for which a firm provides administrative services and it is intended   
that ZKDI will pay all the administrative services fee that it receives from KDF
to firms in the form of service fees. The effective administrative services fee 
rate to be charged against all assets of KDF while this procedure is in effect  
will depend upon the proportion of KDF assets that is in accounts for which a   
firm of record provides administrative services.                                

Certain directors or officers of KDF are also directors or officers of DVA and  
ZKDI as indicated under "Officers and Directors."                               

CUSTODIAN, TRANSFER AGENT AND SHAREHOLDER SERVICE AGENT. Investors Fiduciary    
Trust Company ("IFTC"), 127 West 10th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64105, as   
custodian, and State Street Bank and Trust Company, 225 Franklin Street, Boston,
Massachusetts 02110 as sub-custodian, have custody of all securities and cash of
KDF maintained in the United States. They attend to the collection of principal 
and income, and payment for and collection of proceeds of securities bought and 
sold by KDF. IFTC is also the KDF transfer agent and dividend-paying agent.     
Pursuant to a services agreement with IFTC, Zurich Kemper Service Company       
("ZKSC"), an affiliate of DVA, serves as "Shareholder Service Agent" of the     
Funds, and as such, performs all of IFTC's duties as transfer agent and dividend
paying agent. IFTC receives as transfer agent, and pays to ZKSC, annual account 
fees of $6 per account plus account set up, transaction and maintenance charges,
annual fees associated with the contingent deferred sales charge (Class B shares
only) and out-of-pocket expense reimbursement. IFTC's fee is reduced by certain 
earnings credits in favor of KDF. The following shows for each Fund's 1996      
fiscal year, the shareholder service fees IFTC remitted to ZKSC.

statements, review certain regulatory reports and KDF's federal income tax      
returns, and perform other professional accounting, auditing, tax and advisory  
services when engaged to do so by KDF. Shareholders will receive annual audited 
financial statements and semi-annual unaudited financial statements.            

PURCHASE AND REDEMPTION OF SHARES 

As described in KDF's prospectus, shares of a Fund are sold at their public     
offering price, which is the net asset value per share of the Fund next         
determined after an order is received in proper form plus, with respect to Class
A shares, an initial sales charge. The minimum initial investment is $1,000 and 
the minimum subsequent investment is $100 but such minimum amounts may be       
changed at any time. See the prospectus for certain exceptions to these         
minimums. An order for the purchase of shares that is accompanied by a check    
drawn on a foreign bank (other than a check drawn on a Canadian bank in U.S.    
Dollars) will not be considered in proper form and will not be processed unless 
and until KDF determines that it has received payment of the proceeds of the    
check. The time required for such a determination will vary and cannot be       
determined in advance.                                                          

Upon receipt by the Shareholder Service Agent of a request for redemption,      
shares of a Fund will be redeemed by KDF at the applicable net asset value per  
share of such Fund as described in KDF's prospectus.                            

Scheduled variations in or the elimination of the initial sales charge for      
purchases of Class A shares or the contingent deferred sales charge for         
redemptions of Class B shares or Class C shares by certain classes of persons or
through certain types of transactions as described in the prospectus are        
provided because of anticipated economies in sales and sales related efforts.   

KDF may suspend the right of redemption or delay payment more than seven days   
(a) during any period when the New York Stock Exchange (the "Exchange") is      
closed other than customary weekend and holiday closings or during any period in
which trading on the Exchange is restricted, (b) during any period when an      
emergency exists as a result of which (i) disposal of a Fund's investments is   
not reasonably practicable, or (ii) it is not reasonably practicable for KDF to 
determine the value of a Fund's net assets, or (c) for such other periods as the
Securities and Exchange Commission may by order permit for the protection of    
KDF's shareholders.                                                             

The conversion of Class B shares to Class A shares may be subject to the        
continuing availability of an opinion of counsel or ruling by the Internal      
Revenue Service or other assurance acceptable to KDF to the effect that (a) the 
assessment of the distribution services fee with respect to Class B shares and  
not Class A shares and the assessment of the administrative services fee with   
respect to each Class does not result in KDF's dividends constituting           
"preferential dividends" under the Internal Revenue Code, and (b) that the      
conversion of Class B shares to Class A shares does not constitute a taxable    
event under the Internal Revenue Code. The conversion of Class B shares to Class
A shares may be suspended if such assurance is not available. In that event, no 
further conversions of Class B shares would occur, and shares might continue to 
be subject to the distribution services fee for an indefinite period that may   
extend beyond the proposed conversion date as described in the prospectus.      

DIVIDENDS AND TAXES 

DIVIDENDS. The Contrarian and High Return Equity Funds normally distribute      
quarterly dividends of net investment income and the Small Cap Value Fund       
normally distributes annual dividends of net investment income. Each Fund       
distributes any net realized short-term and long-term capital gains at least    
annually.                                                                       

Each Fund may at any time vary the foregoing dividend practices and, therefore, 
reserves the right from time to time to either distribute or retain for         
reinvestment such of its net investment income and its net short-term and       
long-term capital gains as the Board of Directors of KDF determines appropriate 
under the then current circumstances. In particular, and without limiting the   
foregoing, a Fund may make additional distributions of net investment income or 
capital gain net income in order to satisfy the minimum distribution            
requirements contained in the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code"). Dividends will
be reinvested in shares of the Fund paying                                      

B-10

such dividends unless shareholders indicate in writing that they wish to receive
them in cash or in shares of Kemper Funds as described in the prospectus.       

The level of income dividends per share (as a percentage of net asset value)    
will be lower for Class B and Class C shares than for Class A shares primarily  
as a result of the distribution services fee applicable to Class B and Class C  
shares. Distributions of capital gains, if any, will be paid in the same amount 
for each class.                                                                 

TAXES. Each Fund intends to continue to qualify as a regulated investment       
company under Subchapter M of the Code and, if so qualified, will not be liable 
for federal income taxes to the extent its earnings are distributed. One of the 
Subchapter M requirements to be satisfied is that less than 30% of each Fund's  
gross income during its fiscal year must be derived from gains (not reduced by  
losses) from the sale or other disposition of securities and certain other      
investments held for less than three months. A Fund may be limited in its       
options and futures transactions in order to prevent recognition of such gains. 

A Fund's options and futures transactions are subject to special tax provisions 
that may accelerate or defer recognition of certain gains or losses, change the 
character of certain gains or losses, or alter the holding periods of certain of
a Fund's securities.                                                            

The mark-to-market rules of the Code may require a Fund to recognize unrealized 
gains and losses on certain options, futures and forward contracts held by the  
Fund at the end of the fiscal year. Under these provisions, 60% of any capital  
gain net income or loss recognized will generally be treated as long-term and   
40% as short-term. In addition, the straddle rules of the Code would require    
deferral of certain losses realized on positions of a straddle to the extent    
that such Fund had unrealized gains in offsetting positions at year end.        

A 4% excise tax is imposed on the excess of the required distribution for a     
calendar year over the distributed amount for such calendar year. The required  
distribution is the sum of 98% of a Fund's net investment income for the        
calendar year plus 98% of its capital gain net income for the one-year period   
ending October 31, plus any undistributed net investment income from the prior  
calendar year, plus any undistributed capital gain net income from the one year 
period ended October 31 of the prior calendar year, minus any overdistribution  
in the prior calendar year. Each Fund intends to declare or distribute dividends
during the appropriate periods of an amount sufficient to prevent imposition of 
the 4% excise tax.                                                              

A shareholder who redeems shares of a Fund will recognize capital gain or loss  
for federal income tax purposes measured by the difference between the value of 
the shares redeemed and the adjusted cost basis of the shares. Any loss         
recognized on the redemption of shares held six months or less will be treated  
as long-term capital loss to the extent that the shareholder has received any   
long-term capital gain dividends on such shares. An exchange of a Fund's shares 
for shares of another fund is treated as a redemption and reinvestment for      
federal income tax purposes upon which gain or loss may be recognized. A        
shareholder who has redeemed shares of a Fund or other Kemper Mutual Fund listed
in the prospectus under "Special Features--Class A Shares--Combined Purchases"  
(other than shares of Kemper Cash Reserves Fund not acquired by exchange from   
another Kemper Mutual Fund) may reinvest the amount redeemed at net asset value 
at the time of the reinvestment in shares of a Fund or in shares of a Kemper    
Mutual Fund within six months of the redemption as described in the prospectus  
under "Redemption or Repurchase of Shares--Reinvestment Privilege." If redeemed 
shares were held less than 91 days, then the lesser of (a) the sales charge     
waived on the reinvested shares, or (b) the sales charge incurred on the        
redeemed shares, is included in the basis of the reinvested shares and is not   
included in the basis of the redeemed shares. If a shareholder realized a loss  
on the redemption or exchange of a Fund's shares and reinvests in shares of the 
same Fund 30 days before or after the redemption or exchange, the transactions  
may be subject to the wash sale rules resulting in a postponement of the        
recognition of such loss for federal income tax purposes. If a shareholder of   
Class A shares redeems or otherwise disposes of such Class A shares less than   
ninety-one days after they are acquired and subsequently acquires shares of the 
Fund or of a Kemper Mutual Fund without payment of any sales charge (or for a   
reduced sales charge) pursuant to a reinvestment privilege acquired in          
connection with the Class A shares disposed of, then the sales charge on the    
Class A shares disposed of (to the extent of the reduction in the sales charge  
on the shares subsequently

acquired) shall not be taken into account in determining gain or loss on the    
Class A shares disposed of, but shall be treated as incurred on the acquisition 
of the shares subsequently acquired.                                            

Investment income derived from certain American Depository Receipts may be      
subject to foreign income taxes withheld at the source. Because the amount of a 
Fund's investments in various countries will change from time to time, it is not
possible to determine the effective rate of such taxes in advance.              

Shareholders who are non-resident aliens are subject to U.S. withholding tax on 
ordinary income dividends (whether received in cash or shares) at a rate of 30% 
or such lower rate as prescribed by any applicable tax treaty.                  

PERFORMANCE 

As described in the prospectus, each Fund's historical performance or return for
a class of shares may be shown in the form of "average annual total return" and 
"total return" figures. These various measures of performance are described     
below. Performance information will be computed separately for each class.      

Each Fund's average annual total return quotation is computed in accordance with
a standardized method prescribed by rules of the Securities and Exchange        
Commission. The average annual total return for a Fund for a specific period is 
found by first taking a hypothetical $1,000 investment ("initial investment") in
the Fund's shares on the first day of the period, adjusting to deduct the       
maximum sales charge (in the case of Class A shares), and computing the         
"redeemable value" of that investment at the end of the period. The redeemable  
value in the case of Class B and Class C shares may or may not include the      
effect of the applicable contingent deferred sales charge that may be imposed at
the end of the period. The redeemable value is then divided by the initial      
investment, and this quotient is taken to the Nth root (N representing the      
number of years in the period) and 1 is subtracted from the result, which is    
then expressed as a percentage. The calculation assumes that all income and     
capital gains dividends paid by a Fund have been reinvested at net asset value  
on the reinvestment dates during the period. Average annual total return may    
also be calculated without adjusting to deduct the maximum sales charge.        

Calculation of a Fund's total return is not subject to a standardized formula,  
except when calculated for purposes of the "Financial Highlights" table in KDF's
financial statements and prospectus. Total return performance for a specific    
period is calculated by first taking a hypothetical investment ("initial        
investment") in a Fund's shares on the first day of the period, either adjusting
or not adjusting to deduct the maximum sales charge (in the case of Class A     
shares), and computing the "ending value" of that investment at the end of the  
period. The total return percentage is then determined by subtracting the       
initial investment from the ending value and dividing the remainder by the      
initial investment and expressing the result as a percentage. The ending value  
in the case of Class B shares and Class C shares may or may not include the     
effect of the applicable contingent deferred sales charge that may be imposed at
the end of the period. The calculation assumes that all income and capital gains
dividends paid by the Fund have been reinvested at net asset value on the       
reinvestment dates during the period. Total return may also be shown as the     
increased dollar value of the hypothetical investment over the period. Total    
return calculations that do not include the effect of the sales charge for Class
A shares or the contingent deferred sales charge for Class B shares and Class C 
shares would be reduced if such charge were included.                           

A Fund's performance figures are based upon historical results and are not      
representative of future performance. A Fund's Class A shares are sold at net   
asset value plus a maximum sales charge of 5.75% of the offering price. Class B 
shares and Class C shares are sold at net asset value. Redemptions of Class B   
shares may be subject to a contingent deferred sales charge that is 4% in the   
first year following the purchase, declines by a specified percentage each year 
thereafter and becomes zero after six years. Redemption of Class C shares may be
subject to a 1% contingent deferred sales charge in the first year following the
purchase. Returns and net asset value will fluctuate. Factors affecting each    
Fund's performance include general market conditions, operating expenses and    
investment management. Any additional fees charged by a dealer or other         
financial services firm

would reduce the returns described in this section. Shares of each Fund are     
redeemable at the then current net asset value, which may be more or less than  
original cost.                                                                  

The figures below show performance information for various periods. Comparative 
information for certain indices is also included. Please note the differences   
and similarities between the investments which a Fund may purchase and the      
investments measured by the applicable indices. The net asset values and returns
of each class of shares of the Funds will also fluctuate. No adjustment has been
made for taxes payable on dividends. The periods indicated were ones of         
fluctuating securities prices and interest rates.

Investors may want to compare the performance of a Fund to certificates of      
deposit issued by banks and other depository institutions. Certificates of      
deposit may offer fixed or variable interest rates and principal is guaranteed  
and may be insured. Withdrawal of deposits prior to maturity will normally be   
subject to a penalty. Rates offered by banks and other depository institutions  
are subject to change at any time specified by the issuing institution.         
Information regarding bank products may be based upon, among other things, the  
BANK RATE MONITOR National Index(TM) for certificates of deposit, which is an   
unmanaged index and is based on stated rates and the annual effective yields of 
certificates of deposit in the ten largest banking markets in the United States,
or the CDA Investment Technologies, Inc. Certificate of Deposit Index, which is 
an unmanaged index based on the average monthly yields of certificates of       
deposit.                                                                        

Investors also may want to compare the performance of a Fund to that of U.S.    
Treasury bills, notes or bonds. Treasury obligations are issued in selected     
denominations. Rates of Treasury obligations are fixed at the time of issuance  
and payment of principal and interest is backed by the full faith and credit of 
the U.S. Treasury. The market value of such instruments will generally fluctuate
inversely with interest rates prior to maturity and will equal par value at     
maturity. Information regarding the performance of Treasury obligations may be  
based upon, among other things, the Towers Data Systems U.S. Treasury Bill      
index, which is an unmanaged index based on the average monthly yield of        
treasury bills maturing in six months. Due to their short maturities, Treasury  
bills generally experience very low market value volatility.

Investors may want to compare the performance of a Fund to that of money market 
funds. Money market funds seek to maintain a stable net asset value and yield   
fluctuates. Information regarding the performance of money market funds may be  
based upon, among other things, IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Averages(R) (All      
Taxable). As reported by IBC/Donoghue's, all investment results represent total 
return (annualized results for the period net of management fees and expenses)  
and one year investment results are effective annual yields assuming            
reinvestment of dividends.                                                      

The following tables compare the performance of the Class A shares of the Funds 
over various periods ended December 31, 1996 with that of other mutual funds    
within the categories described below according to data reported by Lipper      
Analytical Services, Inc. ("Lipper"), New York, New York, which is a mutual fund
reporting service. Lipper performance figures are based on changes in net asset 
value, with all income and capital gain dividends reinvested. Such calculations 
do not include the effect of any sales charges. Future performance cannot be    
guaranteed. Lipper publishes performance analyses on a regular basis. Each      
category includes funds with a variety of objectives, policies and market and   
credit risks that should be considered in reviewing these rankings.
