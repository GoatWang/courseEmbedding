What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

A quarter of S&P 500’s 2017 climb due to five stocks (yes, those five)
              
              Throughout 2017, there’s one acronym that investors have in particular been sinking their teeth into: FAANG.

Amazon earnings fall 77%, shares drop
              
              Amazon.com Inc.  reported much lower earnings than expected Thursday, and shares declined more than 2% in late trading. The e-commerce giant reported net income of $197 million, or 40 cents a share, on sales of $38 billion, a profit decline of 77% from the same quarter a year ago. Analysts on average expected Amazon to report earnings of $1.41 a share on sales of $37.2 billion. The company's spending cut into profit, as fulfillment costs -- the amount Amazon spends to fulfill customers' orders on its e-commerce platform -- rose about 33% from a year ago and spending on technology and content increased by about 43%. Amazon stock traded at all-time highs this week, making Amazon the fourth U.S. company with a market capitalization of $500 billion and briefly giving Chief Executive Jeff Bezos the title of richest man in the world, but shares declined about 2% in immediate after-hours action.

Performance At A Glance.                                                        
The Prudential World Fund -- International Stock Series                         
performed in line with                                                          
its peers over the 12 months ended October 31, 1998. Its                        
strategy of focusing                                                            
on companies whose earnings prospects are underappreciated                      
by most investors                                                               
helped the Series in rising markets.  However, in the summer                    
months, many                                                                    
investors reacted strongly to the possibility of a global                       
recession: stocks

other stocks in the                                                             
rapidly dropping markets. Overall, we had a modest gain in a                    
difficult year.

Value And Patience.                                                             
We are value investors and buy stocks that we believe to be                     
undervalued and                                                                 
hold them (unless there is an unexpected deterioration)                         
until their strengths                                                           
are recognized and the stock price moves up significantly.                      
Value managers have                                                             
to be very patient. When investors panic, as they did last                      
summer, they                                                                    
sometimes abandon the stocks of companies whose sources of                      
earnings growth are                                                             
not obvious. We project the earnings of companies five years                    
ahead and buy                                                                   
when they are bargains.                                                         

Strategy Session.

Our basic strategy does not change: we search the foreign                       
markets for companies                                                           
that are selling below what we consider fair value and build                    
our portfolio                                                                   
stock by stock. In a favorable market, we may see a stock                       
rise to our price                                                               
target quickly. In today's unfavorable climate for value                        
stocks, many stocks we                                                          
had bought inexpensively remained bargain-priced, so our                        
portfolio turnover was                                                          
unusually low -- less than 15% for the year. Because of the                     
uncertain markets,                                                              
we allowed our average cash balance to rise higher than                         
usual. We believe                                                               
analysts still haven't fully appreciated the impact of Asian                    
events on Europe.                                                               

We bought Rio Tinto, a U.K.-based company with global metals                    
mining operations.                                                              
The Asian economic depression and potential slowdown in                         
Europe and North                                                                
America have sharply reduced investor interest in the stocks                    
of companies whose                                                              
business is closely tied to the economic cycle. A time-                         
honored value strategy                                                          
is to buy economically sensitive stocks when they are cheap                     
and take our gains                                                              
when they are expensive. In this economic cycle, inventories                    
appear low, yet                                                                 
most commodity industries have refrained from building                          
capacity. These                                                                 
companies should do well when demand recovers, but we have                      
to be patient until                                                             
then. A similar theme underlies our purchase of Saga                            
Petroleum, a Norway-based                                                       
oil production company. The lowest oil prices in 12 years                       
have led its price to                                                           
fall to very low levels.                                                        

We added Sony and Matsushita Electric to our small holdings                     
in Japan. These                                                                 
are global companies that were inexpensive because of the                       
poor state of

What Went Well.

Although we build our portfolio from the bottom up,                             
sometimes we see a theme                                                        
recur. A year ago, we were reporting gains on Banca                             
Fideuram, an Italian bank                                                       
that had strong earnings on mutual funds and insurance                          
sales. The stock rose                                                           
beyond our estimate of fair value, so we took our profits                       
and reinvested the                                                              
proceeds in an undervalued bank with a similar story: Banca                     
Popolare Di                                                                     
Brescia. It has excellent management and rapid growth of                        
financial services                                                              
products as it does a very good job of gathering assets                         
through mutual fund                                                             
sales. We took a small part of our profits as the stock                         
price rose sharply, but                                                         
held most of our shares because we think they do not yet                        
reflect the full                                                                
earnings growth potential of this bank.                                         

Bouygues, on the other hand, is a French conglomerate that                      
we thought was                                                                  
undervalued and would benefit from a restructuring. We                          
bought it at a large                                                            
discount to our estimate of the value of the underlying                         
assets. As our                                                                  
reporting period came to a close, and afterward, purchasers                     
of large blocks of                                                              
shares appeared as potential catalysts to the restructuring.                    
We benefited from                                                               
a rise in the stock, but are holding it as the share price                      
rises toward a                                                                  
realistic value of Bouygues' components.                                        

British Telecom was our largest holding on October 31.                          
Recently, the                                                                   
telecommunications industry has been a major source of                          
global economic growth,                                                         
and it is relatively buffered from the economic cycle.                          
British Telecom had been                                                        
less than efficient, but it reorganized and now can be a                        
strong competitor.                                                              

And Not So Well.                                                                
-------------------------------------------------                               
Our value strategy leads us to hold many cyclical stocks --                     
those whose                                                                     
prospects vary with the pace of economic growth. As Asian                       
economies contracted,                                                           
threatening global growth, many of our economically                             
sensitive stocks suffered.                                                      
In particular, some of our Australian companies -- such as                      
CSR Limited and                                                                 
Pioneer International -- and Alcan Aluminum in Canada did                       
poorly as resource                                                              
and metals businesses were hurt. Our Peugeot shares suffered                    
from the economic                                                               
slowdown as concerns of a softening in consumer spending                        
mounted.

spring and summer,

expectations of most securities analysts are too high to fit                    
economists'

will be more earnings

longer. The companies we own, however, are strong enough to                     
weather a slowdown,                                                             
and they currently are very inexpensive when compared with                      
our estimates of

The best stock values may soon be in Asia, but Asian                            
economies are so unstable                                                       
that we don't feel confident of earnings projections. There                     
are signs that                                                                  
some Asian countries are stabilizing. Over the coming year,                     
we should get a

Portfolio Manager Peter Spano is in for the long term.                          
Q. All of your 10 largest holdings are in Europe. Shouldn't                     
you be more                                                                     
diversified internationally?                                              
A. Let's start with how we build our portfolio. Using our                       
global network of                                                               
independent analysts, we project earnings of companies                    
five years ahead. We                                                            
compare these estimates with the current share price.                     
Then we build our                                                               
portfolio stock by stock with the least expensive shares.                 
We ensure                                                                       
diversification with guidelines for maximum exposure in                   
any one country or                                                              
industry, but don't have any minimum requirements. If a                   
country or industry                                                             
offers no value opportunities, we won't buy there.                        
Nonetheless, we generally                                                       
are in 10 to 20 different countries (we were in 14 on                     
October 31) and rarely                                                          
have more than 15% of our assets in any one industry. On                  
October 31, about                                                               
two-thirds of our assets were in European countries. Our                  
largest country                                                                 
investment was 16% in the United Kingdom, but the U.K.                    
makes up 22% of the                                                             
world's non-U.S. developed markets (as measured by Morgan                 
Stanley Capital                                                                 
International's EAFE Index). Our second-largest focus was                 
11% in                                                                          
Switzerland, compared with its eight percent of the EAFE                  
Index.                                                                          

We think the global economic situation still is uncertain                 
over the next                                                                   
year. European countries have the most secure growth                      
outside the United                                                              
States, so we own perhaps more in Europe than we usually                  
would. Even there,                                                              
however, we expect competition from low-cost Asian                        
producers will change the                                                       
near-term playing field. Some European companies will not                 
be able to control                                                              
their destiny the way they have in the past. We have to                   
watch the situation                                                             
on a company-by-company basis.                                            

Q. You had very little invested in Japan, which is a large                      
part of the world's                                                             
economy. Why?                                                             
A. The key is earnings visibility. We have to have                              
confidence in our long-term                                                     
earnings projections for a company. The companies we own                  
in Japan --                                                                     
Hitachi, Matsushita Electric, and Sony -- have worldwide                  
businesses and we                                                               
do not expect them to require dramatic restructuring to                   
meet global                                                                     
productivity standards. Japanese industry must undergo a                  
structural                                                                      
transformation, after which the companies may be much                     
stronger. We are not                                                            
yet in a position to see how that process will play out.                  
Companies that                                                                  
depend on the Japanese domestic market will have                          
uncertain futures until                                                         
consumers feel more confident in the economy.                             

Q. Are we heading for a global recession?                                       
A. We don't think so, but it is a possibility that we must                      
consider as global                                                              
growth clearly is slowing. We are cautious investors and                  
there is more of a                                                              
real threat to the global economy than there has been in                  
a very long time.                                                               
That said, most economists are not predicting a recession                 
in the United                                                                   
States or Europe. We believe the most likely outcome is                   
lower growth                                                                    
followed by a recovery and we will be buying firms that                   
will be                                                                         
well-positioned for the future. It is a time for cautious                 
optimism.

Dear Shareholder:                                                               
As 1998 draws to a close, the news from the financial                           
markets is decidedly                                                            
mixed. After a series of sharp sell-offs in late summer,                        
some stock prices                                                               
began to rebound in early fall, helped by three interest                        
rate cuts by the                                                                
Federal Reserve.                                                                

There was other good news. U.S. Treasuries and Western                          
European bonds                                                                  
appreciated during the year as investors fled troubled Asian                    
markets and other                                                               
emerging markets. The U.S. economy remained strong with                         
steady growth and low                                                           
inflation.                                                                      

The periods of uncertainty we experienced in 1998 illustrate                    
why it is                                                                       
important to manage your expectations and diversify your                        
portfolio.                                                                      

Keep A Good Perspective.                                                        
Experienced mutual fund investors understand that financial                     
markets will always                                                             
rise and fall -- that's what markets do. Although past                          
performance may not be                                                          
indicative of future results, stocks and bonds have, over                       
time, consistently                                                              
produced attractive returns that have kept ahead of                             
inflation. In fact,                                                             
investors who remained focused on the long term and did not                     
sell during                                                                     
summer's volatility were rewarded. Stock prices, as measured                    
by the Standard &                                                               
Poor's 500 Index, recovered strongly in November regaining                      
lost ground and even                                                            
setting a new record high.

Because asset classes seldom move in lockstep, owning a mix                     
of stock, bond,                                                                 
and money market mutual funds can help lessen the effects of                    
a market downturn                                                               
over time. In fact, a well-diversified portfolio may retain                     
or perhaps even                                                                 
gain value during times of uncertainty.

does not isolate                                                                
that portion of the results of operations arising as a

the Fund does not

We are required by the Internal Revenue Code to advise you                      
within 60 days of the                                                           
Series' fiscal year end (October 31, 1998) as to the federal                    
tax status of                                                                   
dividends paid by the Series during such fiscal year.                           
Accordingly, we are                                                             
advising you that in the fiscal year ended October 31, 1998,                    
dividends of $.43                                                               
per share for Class A shares, $.33 per Class B shares, $.33                     
per Class C shares                                                              
and $.46 per Class Z shares (representing net investment                        
income and short-term                                                           
capital gains) which are taxable as ordinary income. In                         
addition, the Series                                                            
paid to Class A, B, C and Z shares a long-term capital gain                     
distribution of $.15                                                            
which is taxable as such.                                                       

We wish to advise you that the corporate dividends received                     
deduction for the                                                               
Series is zero. Only funds that invest in U.S. equity                           
securities are entitled to                                                      
pass-through a corporate dividends received deduction.                          

The Fund has elected to give the benefit of foreign tax                         
credits to its                                                                  
shareholders. Accordingly, shareholders who must report                         
their gross income                                                              
dividends and distributions in a federal income tax return                      
will be entitled to a                                                           
foreign tax credit, or an itemized deduction in computing                       
their U.S. income tax                                                           
liability. It is generally more advantageous to claim a                         
credit rather than take                                                         
a deduction. For the fiscal year ended October 31, 1998 the                     
Fund intends on                                                                 
passing through 10.3% of ordinary income distributions as a                     
foreign tax credit.                                                             

In January 1999, you will be advised on IRS Form 1099 DIV or                    
substitute 1099 DID                                                             
as to the federal tax status of the dividends and                               
distributions received by you                                                   
in calendar year 1998.

Amounts do not reflect adjustments for Generally Accepted Accounting Principles including those relating to amortization of premiums on securities held.                   Notes:     (a)       Net Asset Value ("NAV") Per Share is total assets less total liabilities divided by the number of shares outstanding.     (b)       Market Price Per Share is the closing price on the New York Stock Exchange.     (c)       Premium / (Discount) to NAV is the % difference between the market price and the NAV price.     (d)       Overdistributed amounts may be funded by capital gains on portfolio securities or through return of shareholder's capital. Undistributed / (Overdistributed) Net Investment Income ("UNII") represents the balance to date of a fund's net investment income less its distributions. Includes prior year UNII of $9,742,839 for the fiscal year ended 7/31/16 and $9,429,823 for the fiscal year ended 7/31/15.     (e)       The UNII information provided treats amounts relating to foreign currency transactions as net realized and unrealized gain (loss). However, these amounts are treated as net investment income (loss) for federal income tax purposes. In accordance with federal income tax treatment, the UNII balances would have been $1,858,382 ($0.05 per share), $8,735,451 ($0.21 per share), and $1,242,709 ($0.03 per share), as of the current quarter, prior quarter, and year ago quarter, respectively. While not required to do so, the Fund may attempt to hedge its foreign currency exposure, which may offset all or a portion of the foreign currency exposure included in the table above. As of the date of this press release, the Fund believes that it has significantly hedged its foreign currency exposure.                  The Fund files its annual and semi-annual stockholders reports on Form N-CSR, as well as complete schedule of investments with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") for the first and third quarters of each fiscal year on Form N-Q. The Fund's Forms N-Q are available on the Commission's website at http://www.sec.gov. The Fund's Forms N-Q may also be reviewed and copied at the Commission's Public Reference Room in Washington, D.C. Information on the operation and location of the Public Reference Room may be obtained by calling (202) 551-8090. To obtain information on Form N-Q or annual and semi-annual stockholder reports, shareholders can call (800) 451-6788 (toll-free).

Source: Morningstar. The Morningstar Rating may not be calculated based on its share class adjusted historical returns. If so, this investment's independent Morningstar Rating metric uses the fund's oldest share class to determine its hypothetical rating for certain time periods. The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. 2017 Morningstar, Inc.

The Fund may invest in high yield ("junk") bonds, which are subject to greater credit and market risks; mortgage-related securities, which are subject to prepayment risks; short sales, which involve costs and the risks of potentially unlimited losses; leveraging techniques, which may magnify losses.; and derivative securities, which may carry market, credit, and liquidity risks. Fixed income investments are subject to interest rate risk, and their value will decline as interest rates rise. These risks may increase the Fund's share price volatility. There is no guarantee the Fund's objective will be achieved. 


Average Maturity is the average time to maturity for a bond. Credit quality is calculated using the highest rating assigned by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) such as Moody’s, S&P, or Fitch. The Not Rated category consists of securities that have not been rated by an NRSRO. Duration measures investment risk that takes into account both a bond's interest payments and its value to maturity. Standard deviation depicts how widely returns vary around its average and is used to understand the range of returns most likely for a given fund. A higher standard deviation generally implies greater volatility. Overweight/Underweights are benchmarked against the Bloomberg Barclays Capital 1-5 Year U.S. Credit Index, an unmanaged index of publicly issued U.S. corporate and specified foreign debentures and secured notes that meet specific maturity (between one and five years), liquidity, and quality requirements. It gives a broad look at how short and intermediate-term bonds have performed. An investment cannot be made directly in an index. Due to data availability, statistics may not be as of the current reporting period.

In early 2018, after definitive information is available, each Fund will send shareholders a Form 1099-DIV, if applicable, specifying how the distributions paid by each Fund during the prior calendar year should be characterized for purposes of reporting the distributions on a shareholder’s tax return (e.g., ordinary income, long-term capital gain or return of capital). If applicable, a current estimate of the distribution's composition can be found in the Section 19 notice section of the website. Please consult your tax advisor for further information.About PGIM and Prudential Financial, Inc.With 14 consecutive years of positive third-party institutional net flows, PGIM, the global asset management businesses of Prudential Financial, Inc.
