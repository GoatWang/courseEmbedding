JWM Partners - Wikipedia





















 






JWM Partners

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

JWM Partners LLC was a hedge fund started by John Meriwether after the collapse of Long Term Capital Management (LTCM) in 1998. LTCM was one of the most spectacular failures of Wall Street, leading to a bailout of around $4 billion that was provided by a consortium of Wall Street banks. Meriwether started the company with initial capital of $250 million with loyal quants and traders like Victor Haghani, Larry Hilibrand, Dick Leahy, Arjun Krishnamachar and Eric Rosenfeld. As of April 2008, the company had around $1.6 billion in management.[1] Eric Rosenfeld left to start his own fund.

Performance[edit]
The funds posted gains for several years, but in the first quarter of 2008 posted losses, of 14% in the Global Macro Fund, and 31% in the flagship Relative Value Opportunity bond fund.[1] Together with redemptions, this cut the capital base significantly.
Mission[edit]
The fund claimed to use the same model as LTCM with more rigorous and better risk management. It also claimed a leverage ratio of 15 to 1.
Closure[edit]
On July 7, 2009 it was announced that the fund would be closed after suffering a loss of 44% in the main fund between September 2007 and February 2009.[2]

Modern Equipment, John Wood, Dunes Point 

The John Wood Company / John Wood/Modern – JWM Integration 








Valued Partner:
As you may or may not be aware, Modern Equipment Company has been under the leadership of Dunes Point Capital, LLC (DPC) since mid-2014 along with The John Wood Company of Oaks PA. Our new landing website is JWMCOMPANY.com 
In an effort known as, “JWM”, the consolidation of these two outstanding industrial companies has been underway since September 2014. On the front end of the business this is seamless as we fully expect to maintain the uniqueness of these two venerable brands. For both our partners as well as our customers this synthesizing of talents, knowledge and resources will be transparent in terms of transactions and relationships. In short, interactions with the brands will continue unchanged. On the backend of the business we are rapidly integrating certain aspects of the business such as Sourcing, HR, AP/AR, Engineering, Finance and Administrration.
Our parent company (DPC) has substantial capital and robust plans for investments in both brands supported by very strong, thesis driven acquisition strategy focusing on businesses that complement our platform company. Capital investment and acquisition activities are already underway. Acquisitions of a complementary nature that enhance our current offering and market presence are of particular interest. 
Additionally JWM is committed to developing new products and services along with capital and other infrastructure investments already under way. Our management team is one that is both process driven and collaborative, especially with regard to the sales and marketing process.  Recent additions include Jim Keller – Vice President Finance, Rob Polich – Vice President Sales & Marketing, and veteran Modern Operations Director Joe Girard as VP-Operations. All of these assignments are JWM specific and enterprise wide, meaning assumed responsibility for both our Wisconsin and Pennsylvania business locations.
I know I speak for all of the JWM management team in assuring you that we value our relationships with our channel partners and customers and welcome any conversation that benefits the growth and reach of our respective businesses.
Sincerely,
David Fix
President
