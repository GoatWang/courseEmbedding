Greetings, and welcome to the PolarityTE Conference Call at the Future of Skin Regeneration Conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Dr. Ned Swanson. Thank you, you may begin.
Ned Swanson
Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. This presentation contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of our management and are subject to risks and uncertainties.
Actual results may differ materially from those set forth in, contemplated by, or underlying the forward-looking statements based on factors described in this conference call and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2016, and our most recent 10-Q. We do not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements except as maybe required by the company’s disclosure obligations, and the filing that makes with the Securities and Exchange Commission under Federal Securities Laws.
With that, I’ll turn the call over to Dr. Denver Lough, PolarityTE’s Chairman and CEO.
Denver Lough
Thank you, Ned, and thank you to all of the shareholders, supporters, and those on this call for joining us today to discuss some very exciting material data and ultimate vision as it relates to PolarityTE and our regenerative medicine platform technology. Before I continue with items related to the press release from earlier today and a promise of our launch product SkinTE, I would like to introduce other PolarityTE management members on the call with me who will all be commenting. Dr. Edward Swanson, our Chief Operating Officer; Dr. Stephen Milner, our Chief Clinical Officer and prior Director of the Johns Hopkins Burn Center; and John Stetson, our Chief Financial Officer.
Saying that, the purpose of today’s call is to follow-up on today’s press release announcing some revolutionary data from our lead autologous, homologous SkinTE construct for regenerative skin applications and burns wounds and scar treatment efforts. In order to understand who PolarityTE is and what our products are, really end up being about, we must clarify who we are not.
While the field of regenerative medicine continues to evolve and advance with regard to a variety of complicated technologies, we at PolarityTE believe that is not about a single stem cell, a single gene, a single growth factor, a single drug or a single type of 3D printed polymeric scaffold. None of that leads to true regeneration. That’s just not how biology, healing or regeneration works, or has evolved to work.
Furthermore, the deployment or addition of any of those single entities or foreign materials to a living system knowingly, and often unknowingly, will impact and alter an almost infinite spectrum of biophysiologic pathways and interdependent systems, ranging from the immune system, to gene regulation, to cellular metabolism and to even commensurate microorganisms that live on and within us. The quantity is more numerous than our own cells.
I ask you to ask yourselves to name one regenerative medicine technology utilizing any of those characteristics that I listed that truly regenerates anything. You see, what Dr. Milner, Dr. Swanson, the other physicians who have joined PolarityTE, including myself, have realized while practicing a variety of forms of medicine is that regenerative medicine has made tremendous promises, but not produced tangible products we could clinically utilize to treat patients in a fast, affordable, and simple manner that made it easy for medical providers to begin to practice a new, novel, pragmatic manner of regenerative medicine.

It was from this understanding that our regenerative medicine platform and our autologous, homologous constructs have been developed, with the same complex simplicity which our cells, tissues, and our bodies practice each and every day. It’s not about outsmarting the millions of years of evolving biology, but instead using all of those years of progressive fine turning in a congruent manner to heal and regenerate cells.
Again, ask yourself to imagine honestly, how many assumptions need to be made to reliably believe that a single gene, a single growth factor, a single drug or scaffold, can regenerate organized tissue. Here at PolarityTE, we ask you to make one assumption, your skin regenerates more skin. Saying that, I hope I have given you all an idea who and what PolarityTE is, and where we are going, and who we are not.
The preclinical image based data released today is by no means even 1% of the data we have collected, which will be released in due course via peer reviewed articles and other public forums. These figures are meant to show and validate that our SkinTE technology is capable of regenerating functionally-polarized, hierarchically-organized, hair-bearing skin in full thickness burns and wounds across a variety of species, in this case Swine, the current standard preclinical model for human skin.
These images released detail burn and full excision of all layers of skin and subcutaneous tissues down to muscle - the common factors in burn and wound care in patients who suffer extensive and large deep wounds. Twenty-four hours following burn wound excision, the autologous, homologous SkinTE product was deployed on the muscle facial wound base, so as to provide immediate autologous homologous wound coverage, and then subsequently dressed and treated the same as typical skin grafts.
Over a short period of time (these specific time points will be included in our downstream publications) the SkinTE construct underwent a form of full thickness regenerative healing, which resulted in polarized organization of appropriate skin layers in interphases, including epidermis, dermis, hypodermis, epidermal dermal junctions, hypodermal and dermal junctions, as well as cutaneous appendages, blood vessel formation, and hair follicles, which are indicated in the figures provided within our press release and on our website.
The regeneration of the hair follicle and associated follicular and bulge components is incredibly important here, not just because of the hair shaft, but because it is a key indicator of true skin regeneration in inter-follicular, neodermal propagation - something that has never been shown before to date. These results, as well as those to follow, are a first for regenerative medicine and a validation of our PolarityTE patient tailored technology platform as it relates to SkinTE, which we look forward to having on patients later this year.
At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Dr. Stephen Milner, PolarityTE’s Chief Clinical Officer and prior Professor of Burn Surgery and Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, and also prior Director of the Johns Hopkins Burn Center, my mentor, Dr. Stephen Milner.
Stephen Milner
Thank you, Denver, and thank you to everyone who is able to participate in this call. After practicing burn surgery and wound care and treating such patients in several different countries during the past 30 years, something became abundantly clear. These patients simply needed their own skin back. To clarify, despite the complex round the clock intensive care required to treat burn patients, a burn surgeon is simply in a race to cover the patients with his or her own skin before complications set in.
The shorter the time it takes for them to be covered, the better the patient outcome. Something which sounds so obvious has been truly elusive and we have learned time and time again that skin is one of the most complex and functional organs of the entire body, as well as being the largest. In 2014, Denver and I were responding to one of the largest civilian burn mass casualty situations, which occurred in Taiwan, where 500 youths were injured.

It became apparent that the regenerative technologies that Denver had developed years before possessed a three-dimensional response to this plaguing problem. Today, we find ourselves moving to the exciting developments presented from our preclinical study. I am pleased to provide my view of the data in terms of what this means to a clinical burn surgeon and wound healing researcher, based on a career focused entirely on trying to heal wounds in the safest, softest, and most complete manner to save patients, and to avoid morbidity.
That said, the available techniques haven't changed since I began my career. And the standard of care remains split thickness skin graft, which despite achieving wound coverage, often results in contracted and scarred wounds with little function over the long term. The findings presented today reveal a technology that many burn surgeons have been waiting for, for the past century.
Full split thickness functional skin regeneration has always been the goal. The Swine model is known to be the most reliable model to predict human wound healing. We have now shown that skin was completely regenerated from the living substrate that was placed within it. SkinTE has allowed a repopulation of the full thickness wounds with scarless skin.
Based on these results, I am confident and comfortable in taking this product to the next level with human pilot studies, and with that said, if this translates to humans the way it has worked across all species to date, as we expect it to, I would be comfortable using this product on a regular basis. Thank you.
Ned Swanson
And this is Ned Swanson chiming in again, and thank you to Dr. Milner and to Dr. Denver Lough for those comments, and at this time would like to proceed to question-and-answer session.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Elemer Piros of Cantor. Please proceed with your question.
Elemer Piros
Yes, good afternoon gentlemen. What I’d like to ask is that some of the sample slides that are available on your website from the Swine study, if you can describe the experiment in a little bit more detail, in terms of how large are these wounds that are being treated? And what is the ratio between the extra biopsy report that the healthy cells or area that you remove, expand and then treat? And also, if you could help us understand how large this study was and how many animals have you tested or how many different wounds per animal?
Denver Lough
Absolutely. Thank you. I appreciate those questions and some of the information will be released in peer-reviewed articles that come out, specifically related to the exact ratios and the time points that are available to such, but if you consider the way that skin grafts work, typically what ends up happening is people will take some of what they call the split thickness skin graft. They will use a dermatome and a high-vibrating razor blade that is run across areas of your body that are not burned.
It gets the very top layer of your skin. The epidermis and the very top layer of your dermis. It negates all of the important stem cell niche populations in support of cellular structures that remain in the lower dermal components. That is why the donor site of a split thickness skin graft will regenerate those tissues. And the split thickness skin graft will then be taken and meshed to cover and stretch across a wound bed.
Those have been the limits with something like that and that is why split thickness skin grafts don't regenerate full-thickness skin and the donor site will re-epithelialize because the cell is capable of regenerating that is left behind. As it relates to the study itself that we are showing here, we had conducted third degree full thickness burns in this Swine model. The size themselves are 8x8 square centimeters, all the way down to muscular fascia, following excision, typical clinical treatment for a full-thickness burn.

So, the images that you are looking at, typically on the far left, are the full excision of a third degree burn wound. The SkinTE product is applied, very similar to something like a paste, and you can apply that following a return of the product to the patient within less than 24 hours.
Moving that on to the wound itself, it propagates over a short period of time, very similar to the way skin grafts work, and it permits the full thickness regeneration of hair follicles and all layers of the skin tissues, epidermis, dermis, hypodermal components and the appendages that are necessary.
Across the study itself there were over 80 wounds that were created on pigs themselves. Those, again, will be released in the peer-review journal, but we are confident with the data now that we have now optimized and created the true SkinTE product both from the harvest standpoint, the processing side of it, and also the redeployment, dressing and the wound care following.
What’s exciting about this is that we’re not asking people to necessarily shift from the way that they have dressed and treated wound beds, but instead, it is a change in technology that allows people to practice in a very similar manner, but have a much better and more functional product. 
That being said, the exact numbers of the pigs and each one of the wounds will be included in these upcoming peer review articles. The time points regarding the exact formation of the layers, the hair follicles themselves, and the complete healing of the wound will also be included in those articles.
Elemer Piros
I mean, the result seems spectacular. How repeatable are those results just in a qualitative manner?
Denver Lough
Absolutely. So that’s another - that’s a great question and one that’s very important. To be completely honest with you, kind of to go off of that question, we've been asked by other groups, what happens if it gets infected? 
We didn’t know the answer to that, until we had done these studies, because we have been fortunate enough to not get infections. But having done so many of these procedures now and deployed so much of the SkinTE product, we learned that when one of our pigs actually did become infected. The dressing had lifted up, and fecal material, gross fecal contamination of the wound had occurred. We thought this may be the loss of the graft, because from clinical experience, it definitely happens. The skin graft would melt and basically shear off. We treated with topical betadine, changed the dressing, and used this as a data point. And in fact, it still regenerated the full thickness of skin like the other wound beds that had not become infected.
So, with regards to reproducibility, in the current comparison to clinical standards with split thickness and full thickness skin grafts, it is essentially, almost, I mean, I would consider it to be even better than a split thickness or a full thickness skin graft with regards to reproducibility, because even when infected, it still resulted in full thickness skin regeneration. And I believe that's also because skin grafts themselves act as graphs or sheets, which obviously if contamination gets underneath the graft, it will delaminate.
This operates in a different manner, and therefore allows the propagation of MPFU’s (minimally polarized functional units, a major component of the SkinTE substrate and product) to essentially continue to propagate, migrate, proliferate and differentiate as it would in a natural wound setting, even when in the presence of microbial contamination.
Elemer Piros
Okay. I would just have maybe two follow-ups, please. In the upcoming human trial, what size of wounds would you start looking at? Do you have a protocol that you have designed already?
Denver Lough

We do have a protocol, and I won't give you the exact numbers, but it is similar to what we are doing, or what we have completed with Swine.
Elemer Piros
Okay. And lastly, are there cosmetic applications, beyond burn and wound care I mean, that might come into play in the future?
Denver Lough
Absolutely, that's another great question. So, with any form of reconstructive or regenerative forms of surgery or medicine, aesthetics and/or sort of the cosmetic appearance of your product and how it regenerates tissue, is always of concern. And what I mean by this is, if you have a patient who had pancreatic cancer and had a component of that tumor reflected, and they went to grocery store, no one there knows that patient had it. No one knows that they had a tumor resected out of their abdomen. Patients who have suffered from burns and wounds, particularly in areas on their face, hands, and legs are plagued with that, even today with skin grafting.
And so, we have developed an entire division that is dedicated to the aesthetic and cosmetic component of the regenerative medicine platform itself. The priority of this company is to provide patients and providers with the best full thickness regenerative technology that's out there - with the best price, the best value, that is easy for them to use and deploy, and that they can get quickly.
But just below that is making sure that it aesthetically resembles the patient's own tissues, whether it be our skin product, or our pipeline products; bone, muscle, cartilage and other ones that are coming down the line. So, we will be developing products that may be considered solely a cosmetic, or solely for aesthetic use, but our priority will always focus on the regenerative medicine aspect in helping those patients that have severe tissue voids that will go more towards the reconstruction arena in medicine.
Elemer Piros
Very nice data. Thank you very much for taking my questions.
Denver Lough
We appreciate it, thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from Robert Obraitis of Cambridge Investment Research. Please proceed with your question.
Robert Obraitis
Hey, thanks guys for taking my question here. I actually have a three-prong question, it's all related to the same topic. What would you say the potential market looks like for the first product? And then following on that, kind of help us out a little bit with competitors that might be in this current space now? And third would be, your economics and cost of goods to get this out?
Denver Lough
Those are all absolutely great questions, really appreciate it. So, with regards to the SkinTE product unto itself, particularly, this specific type of construct, people would joke with us often that it regenerates hair. So, what is the hair restoration market like, it's roughly about a $1 billion.
If you start looking at just skin regeneration for burn itself, it can be, - and for wounds - will be roughly around $5 billion. But when you begin to think about the skin regeneration market across all varieties of tissue voids, acute surgical wounds, post-cancer reconstruction, a variety of types and sorts of these post neoplastic head, neck or extremity reconstruction efforts that have been performed, the market gets up to close to $50 billion or $60 billion for elements of SkinTE.
That doesn't necessarily consider our other pipeline products, like bone or cartilage, which are actually larger markets, which we can address at a later time. But the skin products themselves have a relatively large and robust, and also growing market.
With regards to the competitors themselves, I will kind of turn it back on you, the shareholders and the analysts, name one other product that’s out there that is truly autologous, homologous, and there really isn't one. There are groups that are out there like Epicel - cultured epithelial autografts.

They’re a good company, they’re a good product. They also include mouse T3 fibroblasts. They also just use the top layer of the skin. They culture it for weeks before they can return it to burn patients. They're under a humanitarian device exemption, where they can only treat a certain amount of patients annually. Those types of things set us apart. It's not to say that Epicel isn't a good product. It's just that we are different and we develop full thickness skin with all of the layers including the hair follicles. With regards to the economics behind the company itself, Ned, would you like to address?
Ned Swanson
I think when you start to look at the economics of SkinTE and the cost of goods, we are able to do this quite cheaply. And part of that is based upon our processing of the tissue at the manufacturing center when we start to begin to do this clinically. The tissue itself has to be harvested from the patient, which is going to be done in a very streamlined manner. The physician is going to have a complete harvest box with all components in it, to harvest for full thickness skin biopsy. You can do this at the bedside in the ER or in the OR.
The tissue will come to the manufacturing facility. It will be processed and turned around within one to two days back to the center, as Denver described previously. And with all of those components said, the way we process this avoids a lot of the costs seen with products like Epicel that Denver mentioned, where we aren't culturing this for three to four weeks. We don't need enzymes to do this. We don't need media to do this. Those are all the factors that make a lot of regenerative medicine products extremely, extremely expensive in the thousands of dollars range to produce based on all of those components required.
So, needless to say, we can do this quite cheaply and quite efficiently for each one of these products produced. And the market Denver described is based on a lot of market research that we’ve done before we became involved in this. We have done our own market analysis on all of these specific arenas.
We have done the most analysis in the burn market, and the ability of us to deliver those products so cheaply allows us to essentially provide a much greater value with the product we're delivering, while at the same time potentially coming in at a lower cost, which throughout all industries is a large leap in technology to be able to do that. So, I don't want to get into all of these specific numbers, but they're favorable on both ends for the way we create the SkinTE.
Robert Obraitis
Okay. Well, thank you very much for elaborating on that. That's actually very exciting to hear the cost of goods in the economics. And obviously the potential market is just - it's mindboggling to be quite candid with you. And quick question here, I believe, the unfortunate circumstance you're talking about in Taiwan was the Western Digital plant, correct?
Denver Lough
It was actually the Formosa Water Park. What ended up happening in that unfortunate event, at least, 512 people were burned. It was a water park event, where there was a band and concert that it was playing and they sprayed cornstarch into the air and unfortunately due to elements of pyrotechnics and a spark ignited an enormous fireball, which burned people extensively including third degree burns.
And so, a country like Taiwan, which has abundant medical resources, which has the finances and the medical training to respond to something like this, was overwhelmed. And, that by itself, began to show us that, even when you have these types of resources available, as Dr. Milner pointed out, there's still one fundamental void or one fundamental issue that is staring you in the face and that is the lack of the patient’s own skin to get back.

People can give allograft category skin, but it's temporary. You can give xenograft skin, pig skin, again, temporary. You can give these high-priced products or dressings, again, temporary, all of it essentially temporary. Eventually, you need to get some form of the patient's own skin back on them. I am not nearly as much of an expert as Dr. Milner is with his years and years of clinical expertise for burns, so I’ll turn it over to him, if there's additional things he'd like to add.
Robert Obraitis
I apologize. I - well, the whole - while that event was tragic, obviously, it immediately, and we're headquartered right here in Washington D.C. in Northern Virginia, it immediately made me think of the interest from government organizations and military applications. And I know I may be asking a very pinpointed question here, but the government grants the strategic partnerships that could come from this type of technology, and I will just ask it, have you guys been approached, or are there any discussions with anybody about taking this to a level again for government or military?
Denver Lough
Yes, great question. I can't go into specifics on that. But yes, we have been approached. Yes, we have spoken with government agencies about grants and contracts. Saying that, that is definitely a realm that we are very interested in continuing to work with and pursue a variety of integrative forms of technology. I would also point you to one of our Board of Director members, John Mogford, his involvement with DARPA should also give some key understanding that our goal has always been to serve a civilian population, but at the same exact time serve our military and our government. So, yes, we are in discussions with groups regarding exactly what you have suggested.
Robert Obraitis
All right. Well, thank you, guys, very much. I'll let somebody else hop in the queue. I actually have some additional questions if they are not answered I'll pop back in, but thank you very much.
Denver Lough
Alright. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from Matt Hewitt of Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Please proceed with your question.
Matt Hewitt
Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the questions.
Denver Lough
Thank you.
Matt Hewitt
I was curious once you're ready for commercialization, if you can kind of walk through the distribution model, and how you foresee maybe initially will you be using independent distributors, or are your plans to go direct right out of the gates? And if so, how do you envision that sales force ramp over the first few years post-launch?
Ned Swanson
Yes, this is Ned Swanson. Thank you for that question, and it's one that comes up frequently, and we've designed a very strategic rollout of this product. And the first thing, that had been mentioned briefly by Elemer Piros from Cantor, was the pilot study in human burn patients, which we're hoping to initiate within this year. And following that trial, we will hopefully be entering the market within the first-half of next year. And that's when the commercialization plan that you're discussing will come into play. And we're out of the gate going towards the burn market.
And within the United States, there are 126 burn centers, and they are typically run by the burn center directors. And with all of our network coming from that world, especially with Dr. Milner, we are planning to target some of the higher volume very well-respected burn centers when we go to market and we're going to do it in a staged and controlled fashion starting with the first.
And once we have the manufacturing handling the volume of the first center, adding the second a month or two later depending on the ideal time. And doing it in that fashion over the course of the first year in the market, targeting anywhere from 7 to 12 burn centers in the first year. And within that year, planning our scale up of commercialization as we go into the second year, where if everything is going smoothly as planned, going a little bit more aggressively nationwide to all the burn centers. And that is sort of a two-year roll out plan.

And in terms of the sales force question, that also comes up frequently. We do have advantages in the burn market with our own networks already for using communication for the decision makers in this market, which is a concentrated market, and they are often connected to large wound centers. And all of the other plastic and reconstructive surgeons that we've worked with for years who also treat a variety of the other wounds beyond burn to begin that initial ramp up in a slow stage-manner and then the nationwide roll out staggered behind those in the burn market. Going to market with our network, as you've heard, and we are not actively pursuing a massive sales force for the SkinTE market roll out with the burn and wound care markets.
Matt Hewitt
Okay, great. Thank you.
Ned Swanson
We will certainly have the strategic plan in place to do so.
Matt Hewitt
Okay. And then I would assume after you've rolled out SkinTE and you start looking at some of the follow-on offerings, bone and whatnot, do you envision having separate sales forces of those, or would you just utilize the same sales force and just broaden their reach into some of the other hospitals and whatnot?
Ned Swanson
Those are great questions, and you're almost backing us into a corner, where we have to give a little bit more away. I'm going to answer with this. There are a variety of good biotech companies that are out there right now. I’ll give an example of one. They have a peripheral nerve cadaveric graft system that allows peripheral nerves to propagate in order to be part of renovate aspects of extremities and such. That product, while it is good, and they have brought in good revenue, they have spent a tremendous amount on building up a sales force. 
Being physicians and having practiced with other physicians, I can tell you that there is some limit to the knowledge base of the sales reps and their ability to really conduct sort of a peer-to-peer evaluation of whether or not the product should be used or not. Saying that, PolarityTE has strategically oriented itself and dedicated a division to the development of something called real-time assistance.
And what I mean by that is if a burn surgeon, wound surgeon, or a physician it located in a certain area and already met with elements of the PolarityTE team and have questions about the products, the immediate deploying - the immediate use of the product, about wounds that the product may be used in, about whether or not the product would even be right for the patient. We have now begun to develop a system, a real-time assisting app system that allows us to be in contact 24 hours a day with those individuals, those providers.
So that if it is even 2:00 A.M. in the morning and they have a question about whether or not for example the SkinTE product looks good or not or whether or not there is infection or whether or not the dressing needs to be changed, that in itself would be directly communicated in a HIPAA-compliant real-time communication system, where you could video conference face-to-face with one of the PolarityTE physicians from either the company or the clinical advisory team, 24 hours a day no matter what time it is, who can provide you with peer-to-peer assistance.
And also allow you to perform elements of real-time analytics on the wound integrated within the system and also tracking of where your product or construct may be for a patient. For example, I harvested, I send it to you guys at 6:00 P.M. last night, where is it now? With this particular app system you can see exactly where it is in the process, when it will be arriving, when it will be deployed, the QC, QA elements of it. Once you get it, if you have questions about how to deploy it there will be educational material on how to do such. If the provider is still confused they can click on a button and speak with someone like Dr. Stephen Milner at 2:00 A.M. in the morning and be able to help the provider, help that team out to use that product or answer questions about the progression or dressings or such.

It’s not that we necessarily disagree with hiring on a sales force per se, but I think that physician’s and providers that are out there are really in need of having some sort of this peer-to-peer contact. In this ability to really understand and not be alone when using our regenerative medicine product. And so not only do we want to provide ultimately one of the best regenerative medicine with autologous, homologous products that’s out there, but we want to provide real-time assistance communication with qualified individuals who could help assess and address how to utilize our product for those specific types of patients the best that we possibly can.
Matt Hewitt
That’s great. And thank you very much and congratulations on your, at least, initial success.
Denver Lough
Thank you. We really appreciated.

Interview with Dr. Denver Lough, President and CEO of PolarityTE | BioInformant          BioInformantYour Global Leader in Stem Cell Market ResearchYou are here: Home / Stem Cells (All Types) / Interview with Dr. Denver Lough, President and CEO of PolarityTEInterview with Dr. Denver Lough, President and CEO of PolarityTEApril 27, 2017 By Cade Hildreth (CEO)Recently, I had the honor of interviewing Dr. Denver Lough, Chairman, President, CEO, and CSO of PolarityTE. PolarityTE is an innovative company that has developed a platform to regenerate a variety of functionally polarized tissue substrates, such as skin, bone, muscle, cartilage, blood vessels, peripheral nerves, and more.In this exclusive interview, we explore the origins of PolarityTE as a company. We also explore the company’s novel technology, five-year vision, and future directions. Enjoy.Interview with Dr. Denver LoughCade Hildreth: Why the name PolarityTE?Denver Lough, M.D., Ph.D.Dr. Denver Lough: Great question—it’s one we get often. Polarity in the biological sense describes the orientation and interface that cells and tissues have relative to each other which subsequently results in much of their intrinsic function. Essentially, all living cells and tissues must exhibit some form of polarity to proliferate, differentiate and develop hierarchical organized tissues.Without polarity, a cell is basically lost and unable to remember how to function in a natural setting. If one takes a look across naturally occurring forms of healing and regeneration, it becomes apparent that it’s not a single cell that regenerates tissues—but rather polarized cells communicating with each other. AND the “TE” is simply my goal.Cade Hildreth: Your goal? It doesn’t mean tissue engineering?Dr. Denver Lough: No, it doesn’t mean tissue engineering. Yes, those two letters represent my ultimate goal for the company and the field of regenerative medicine.Cade Hildreth: You were on track for a very prestigious career as a Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeon at Johns Hopkins—why did you leave to start this company?Dr. Denver Lough: The Hopkins experience was great and I always look forward to working with everyone there again at some point. The reason I left was multi-factorial. One, and perhaps most importantly, was that as a surgeon I began to see how the structure of the current medical system was quickly going to put me, as well as other colleagues, at “terminal velocity” very quickly.What I mean is that a physician can only see one patient in a given time period or a surgeon can only throw one stitch every “x” seconds; and at that point, you only have 2 options. Either incrementally see more patients or throw more stitches in a shorter time period, which often doesn’t result in improved patient care, or change the paradigm by actively helping a multitude of patients during that same time period.Cade Hildreth: What makes your company different than the other regenerative medicine and wound care companies?Dr. Denver Lough: Complex Simplicity.Cade Hildreth: Complex Simplicity meaning?Dr. Denver Lough: Meaning that if we go back and look at all of the greatest discoveries that really impacted humankind in science we see that the greatest discoveries were often the realization of reality. I believe that much of the regenerative medicine and tissue engineering field has pursued exceedingly complex mechanisms and stories to manipulate or make a cell, a growth factor or scaffold act like natural tissue(s)… My question to is: if we don’t really understand the exact interplay and mechanisms involved in natural regenerative wound healing, then how can we expect to have a single cell, single growth factor/drug or single matrix based scaffold truly regenerate anything?Polarity’s approach is very different in that we approach regenerative medicine from the top down and using what we know works. This approach from “known” has allowed us to apply our technology across a variety of tissue substrates to regenerate full forms of skin, bone, muscle, cartilage, solid organ tissues and peripheral nerve elements. It would be naïve of us to honestly believe that the addition of singularity to a complex system would abruptly re-organize and re-direct complex wounds and tissue voids toward nascent functionally organized tissues…that frankly just doesn’t work.In addition to challenging the paradigm of regenerative medicine, I believe that PolarityTE brings an entirely new type of team to the market and the field. How many regenerative medicine companies have such a tremendous all-star team of integrated clinical and scientific advisors? How many regenerative medicine companies really have a pragmatic platform technology that addresses all different tissue types? It is this clinical “in-the trenches” type of experience that Polarity prides itself on in developing truly revolutionary clinical constructs that actually work.A biotech company can make an amazing “theoretical product” or one that looks great in the test tube, but the second it hits a bloody surgical field or is challenged by the immune system, its falls apart. We at Polarity have seen this over and over in medical practice and finally decided to do something about it.We knew we had something special with Polarity after we kept meeting with a variety of different types of investors and kept getting offers. In the end, we decided to go with a route that allowed us to keep control of the company so that we could continue to pursue our vision, passion and pragmatic innovative platform.Cade Hildreth: The company seems to be growing very quickly—what do you attribute that to?Dr. Denver Lough: Well with all startups there are a variety of factors affecting the trajectory of a company. I honestly believe that across the spectrum of all the investors that we have spoken with, they have really been excited about this new technology platform we have developed. Once they see our actual technical capabilities they realize there is something entirely new and novel here with Polarity. However, after the tech gets their attention, they begin to see our complete vision, team and network for market penetration and growth.Cade Hildreth: What keeps you up at night?Honestly, the rapid growth of the company and the other entities becoming involved with us. It’s a good problem to have and we are always hungry for challenges.Cade Hildreth: Do you consider yourself to be the next disruptive technology in regenerative medicine?Dr. Denver Lough: The term “disruptive technology” seems to be an overly used buzz word describing technologies that people don’t understand, but think it appears different. To be honest, there hasn’t really been much disruptive technology seen in translational biotechnology. Companies keep producing derivatives of the same old clunky technologies and products with just different names on them. Go ahead and ask physicians and providers what cutting edge biotech materials they use day to day or really ever…not many, if any. If all of these disruptive technologies we keep hearing about don’t really amount to true clinical application, then are they really disruptive?Saying that, I don’t want the Polarity technology platform to be defined as disruptive. I want it to be constructive—constructive at changing the paradigm of regenerative medicine. When patients/users/physicians/providers think of the Polarity technology and its regenerative constructs, I want them to reflect on how easy it was to work with our products and team, as well as how cost efficient Polarity has made regenerative medicine efforts. I want the experience for everyone to be able to participate in the beginning of a new form of pragmatic tissue regeneration.Cade Hildreth: Being just a few months old you have managed to build quite an impressive team at PolarityTE—how did you do it?Dr. Denver Lough: It is simple, I look for people who are over-qualified and underappreciated. These types of people are essentially the race horse you see kicking in the gates and once shown a goal will explode out of the gates and run full-speed.Cade Hildreth: How did you come up with the technology?Dr. Denver Lough: That’s a loaded question and being a public company with patented and proprietary materials, I can’t go into too much detail. But it basically came down to recognizing I couldn’t outsmart biology and that there are a ton of cues that regenerative wound healing will give you if you just look a little longer and a little deeper. There are many brilliant minds out there that are going down the wrong path because someone years ago said that regenerative medicine pivoted around cells, growth factors and scaffolds.My questions are: does that really make sense fundamentally and isn’t it time we expanded on those three isolated pillars now that we know about micro-inhibitory RNA, epigenetics, metabolomics, exosomes etc. How do we account for all of these newly discovered cellular phenomena with such an out of date reductionist theory?Cade Hildreth: PolarityTE offers a platform technology for regenerative medicine—what does that mean?Dr. Denver Lough: Many regenerative medicine or biotech companies seem to hedge themselves on a single “disruptive” product in order to build a company. Initially, this doesn’t create a problem for the because they can focus their entire efforts on perfecting that product. However, eventually another group comes around and either builds a better product or creates an entirely new technology that circumvents the need for that product. This is a dangerous place to be because it is hard for a biotech company to reinvent itself from that now obsolete product.We at Polarity have focused on truly developing a revolutionary new type of biotechnology and regenerative platform that is biologically sound and able to regenerate a variety of functionally polarized tissue substrates such as skin, bone, muscle, cartilage, blood vessels, peripheral nerves and solid organ parenchyma. This “platform” allows us to springboard off our fundamentally sound technology into a wide variety of customizable products that reach into a variety of fields.Cade Hildreth: Where do you see the company being in the next few years?Dr. Denver Lough: I believe that we have a superior technology, a superior team and a superior network to get our technology readily deployable and to market quickly. I also believe that the market is ready for a product and technology that works and is easy for medical providers and patients to choose. I also believe that the world has not actually seen the real biotech boom yet and hope that Polarity will be involved in it in some form. Cade Hildreth: How can people learn more about PolarityTE or get in touch with you?Dr. Denver Lough: You can visit our website, www.PolarityTE.com, and email us at [email protected], or follow the Company’s social channels at:https://www.facebook.com/PolarityTE/ https://twitter.com/PolarityTE https://www.linkedin.com/company/polarityteRelatedLet’s Get SocialView BioInformantWorldwide’s profile on FacebookView StemCellMarket’s profile on TwitterView cade-hildreth-b4419a9b?trk=hp-identity-name’s profile on LinkedInFeatured PostsGrowing Stem Cells in Suspension Bioreactors – Interview with Dr. Angel of AccelltaCord Blood Industry is “Consolidating and Maturing”Interview with Accellta’s Intellectual Property (IP) Officer, Eran CohenThese 4 Companies Dominate the Cord Blood Processing IndustryGamida Cell Announces $40 Million Private FinancingCategoriesCord BloodExosomesStem Cells (All Types)Adipose-Derived Stem CellsHematopoietic Stem CellsiPS CellsMSCsNeural Stem CellsFollow me on Twitter My TweetsCartBioInformant's World-Class Clients

 Earnings Call Transcripts
PresentationOperatorGreetings, and welcome to future of skin regeneration at PolarityTE Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Dr. Ned Swanson. Thank you, you may begin. Ned SwansonThank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. This presentation contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of our management and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those set forth in, contemplated by, or underlying the forward-looking statements based on factors described in this conference call and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2016, and our most recent 10-Q. We do not undertake to update or revise any forward looking statements except as maybe required by the company’s disclosure obligations, and the filing that makes with the Securities and Exchange Commission under Federal Securities Laws.With that, I’ll turn the call over to Dr. Denver Lough, PolarityTE’s Chairman and CEO.Denver LoughThank you Ned, and thank you all of the share holders, supporters, and those on this call for joining us today to discuss some very exciting material data and ultimate vision as it relates to PolarityTE and our regenerative medicine platform technology. Before I continue with items related to the press release from earlier today and a promise of our launch produce SkinTE, I would like to introduce other PolarityTE management members on the call with me who will all be commenting. Dr. Edward Swanson, our Chief Operating Officer; Dr. Stephen Milner, our Chief Clinical Officer and prior Director of Johns Hopkins Burn Center; and John Stetson, our Chief Financial Officer.Saying that, the purpose of today’s call is to follow-up on today’s press release announcing some revolutionary data from our lead autologous homologous SkinTE construct for regenerative skin applications and burns wounds and scare treatment efforts. In order to understand who PolarityTE is and what our products are, really end up being about, we must clarify who we are not.While the field of regenerative medicine continues to evolve and advance with regard to a variety of complicated technologies, we at PolarityTE believe that is not about a single stem cell, a single gene, a single growth factor, a single drug or a single type of 3D printed polymeric scaffold, none of that leads to true regeneration. That’s just not how biology healing or regeneration works or has evolved to work.Furthermore, the deployment or addition of any of those single entities or foreign materials to a living system knowingly and often unknowingly will impact and alter and almost infinite spectrum of biophysiologic pathways and interdependent systems ranging from the immune system to gene regulation to cellular metabolism and to even commensurate microorganisms that live on and within us. The quantity is more numerous than our own cells.I ask you to ask yourselves to name one regenerative medicine technology utilizing any of those characteristics that I listed that truly regenerates anything. You see, Dr. Milner, Dr. Swanson, the other physicians who have PolarityTE, including myself have realized while practicing a variety of forms of medicine is that regenerative medicine has made tremendous promises, but not reduced tangible products we could clinical utilize to treat patients in a fast affordable and simple manner that made it easy for medical providers to begin to practice a new novel to pragmatic manner of regenerative medicine.It was from this understanding that our regenerative medicine platform and our autologous homologous constructs have been developed with a hope soon body to same complex simplicity with our cells, tissues, and our bodies practice each and every day. It’s not about outsmarting the millions of years of evolving biology, but instead using all of those years, a progressive fine turning and it can grow at manner to heal and regenerate cells.Again, ask yourself to imagine honesty, how many assumptions need to be made to reliably believe that a single gene, a single growth factor, a single drug or scaffold to regenerate organized tissue. Here at PolarityTE we ask you to make one assumption, your skin regenerate more skin. Saying that, I hope I have given you all an idea, who and what PolarityTE is and where we are going and who we are not.The preclinical image based data released today is by no means even 1% of the data we have collected, which will be released in due course via peer reviewed articles and other public forums. These figures are meant to show and validate that our SkinTE technology is capable of regenerating functionally polarized hierarchically organized care baring skin in full thickness burns and wounds across a variety of species, in this case Swine. The current standard preclinical model for human skin. These images released detail burn and full excision of all layers of skin in subcutaneous tissues down to muscle. The common factors in burn and wound care in patients who suffer extensive and large deep wounds. 24 hours following burn wound excision the autologous homologous SkinTE product was deployed on the muscle facial wound base, so as to provide immediate autologous homologous wound coverage and then subsequently dressed and treated the same as typical skin grafts.Over a short period of time, these specific time points will be included in our downstream publications the SkinTE construct underwent a form of full fitness regenerative healing, which resulted in polarized organization of appropriate skin layers in interphases, including epidermis, dermis, hypodermis, epidermal dermal junctions, hypodermal and dermal junctions, as well as cutaneous appendages, blood vessel formation, and hair follicles, which are indicated in the figures provided within our press release and on our website.The regeneration of the hair follicle and associated follicular and Nextel bulge components is incredibly important here, not just because of the hair shaft, but because it is a key indicator of true skin regeneration in interfollicular neodermal propagation, something that has never been shown before to date. These results, as well as those to follow are a first for regenerative medicine and a validation of our PolarityTE patient tailored technology platform as it relates to SkinTE, which we look forward to having on patients later this year.At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Dr. Stephen Milner, PolarityTE’s Chief Clinical Officer and Prior Professor of Burn Surgery and Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery and also prior Director of the Johns Hopkins Burn Center, my mentor Dr. Stephen Milner.Stephen MilnerThank you, Denver, and thank you to everyone who is able to participate in this call. After practicing burn surgery and wound care and treating such patients in several different countries during the past 30 years, something became abundantly clear. These patients simply needed their own skin back. To clarify, despite the complex round the clock intensive care required to treat burn patients, a burn surgeon is simply in a race to cover the patients with his or her own skin before complications set in.The shorter the time it takes for them to be covered, the better the patient outcome. Something which sounds so obvious has been truly elusive and we have learned time and time again the skin is one of the most complex and functional organs of the entire body, as well as being the largest. In 2014, Denver and I were responding to one of the largest civilian burn mass casualty situations, which occurred in Taiwan where 500 youths were injured. It became apparent that the regenerative technologies which Denver had developed years before possessed of a three-dimensional response to this plaguing problem. Today, we find ourselves moving to the exciting developments presented from our preclinical study. I am pleased to provide my view of the data in terms of what this means to a clinical burn surgeon and wound healing researcher based on a career focused entirely on trying to heal wounds in the safest, softest, and most complete manner to save patients, and to avoid morbidity.That said, the available techniques haven't changed since I began my career. And the standard of care remains splits [ph] in the skin graft, which despite achieving wound coverage often result in contracted and scarred wounds with little function over the long term. The findings presented today reveal a technology that many burn surgeons have been waiting for, for the past century. Full sick thickness functional skin regeneration has always been the goal. The Swine model is known to be the most reliable model to predict human wound healing. We have now shown that skin was completely regenerated from the living substrate that was placed within it. SkinTE has allowed a repopulation of the full thickness wounds with scar less skin. Based on these results, I am confident and comfortable in taking this product to the next level with human pilot studies, and with that said, if this translates to humans the way it has worked across all species to date as we expected to I would be comfortable using this product on a regular basis. Thank you.Ned SwansonAnd this is Ned Swanson chiming in again and thank you to Dr. Milner and to Dr. Denver Lough for those comments and at this time would like to proceed to question-and-answer session.Click here to read question and answer session

For example, a doctor may improperly diagnose, treat or medicate outside the standard of medical care. The three types of malpractice are: a settlement, an arbitration award, or a judgment.If my doctor has malpractice history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact the quality of care you receive. Claim settlements and arbitration awards may occur for a variety of reasons, which should not necessarily reflect negatively on the doctor's professional competence or conduct.You may want to use this information to start a discussion with the doctor about his or her history and specific ability to provide healthcare for you.How far back does Healthgrades malpractice history go?Healthgrades reports details of a doctor’s malpractice history when the doctor has at least one closed medical malpractice claim within the last five years, even if he or she no longer practices in that state.For which states does Healthgrades collect malpractice history?Healthgrades collects malpractice information from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia. If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact your quality of care. Sometimes multiple states report the same claim. If a provider practices in a state where data is unavailable, please reach out to your local state legislature to help make this data publicly available.0SanctionsNo sanctions history found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What is a sanction or disciplinary actionWhat is a sanction or disciplinary action?A sanction, also known as a disciplinary action, is an action taken to punish or restrict a doctor who has demonstrated professional misconduct. Sanctions may be imposed by a state medical board, professional medical licensing organization, or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.If my doctor has sanction history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a sanction, it does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor-quality doctor. Some sanctions are not related to medical care, and involve a doctor’s finances or administrative activities. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, we recommend that you evaluate the doctor’s sanction information and determine how severe or relevant you think the sanction cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades sanction history go?Healthgrades reports state and federal sanctions from the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect sanction history?Healthgrades collects sanction history from all 50 U.S. states. Physicians with a disciplinary action in one state may move to another state where they have a clean record. Since Healthgrades painstakingly compiles disciplinary action information from all 50 states, Healthgrades website will show if a physician has a disciplinary action in more than one state.0Board ActionsNo board actions found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What are board actionsWhat are board actions?Board actions are non-disciplinary actions imposed upon a doctor based on a complaint investigation. A patient or medical colleague may file a complaint with that state medical board or professional licensing organization, which then investigates the complaint. Board actions are intended to ensure that a doctor is able to perform safe medical and health care tasks.Types of non-disciplinary actions include an advisory letter, a corrective action agreement, a limitation or restriction on the medical or healthcare tasks a doctor can perform, or a voluntary agreement by the doctor not to practice. A board action can also include a termination of a corrective action agreement or voluntary agreement, which allows the doctor to return to full practice.If my doctor has a board action, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a board action, it means he or she has had a non-disciplinary action imposed upon him or her. It does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor quality doctor. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, evaluate the doctor's board action information and determine how severe or relevant you think the cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades non-disciplinary board action history go?Healthgrades reports non-disciplinary board action history from for the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered.

Which way does your beard point tonight?  In 1956, Alan Ginsberg made reference to Walt Whitman’s beard in "A Supermarket in California." Almost sixty years later, beards are still a part of popular culture, and the Beat Generation is being revived through Famous Beard Oil Company, founded by Eric D. Lough. Now the man behind the beard explains why beards are here to stay and why they need a little TLC. Westword: How did you, as a beard aficionado, break into the facial-hair industry?Eric D. Lough: Well, I’ve always been a beard man. I’ve always taken care of my beard pretty well, and I have used beard oils from other companies. After being unsatisfied with beard oils, I decided to start making my own. I have a background in the alternative-medicine field and I know my oils really well. I just started experimenting with my own, and soon I was getting a lot of compliments on how it looked and felt. After a while I decided I should just start making it and selling it to others. What sets your company apart from the rest?I never wanted to be like all these other companies that sell beard products and other stuff; I just wanted to make it personal. I wanted to do everything myself, from the marketing to the designing to the printing. I have no team; I do absolutely everything for the company. I run Famous Beard Oil Company right out of my condo, in an extra room that I turned into my office. It’s filled with packing materials and bottles and oils. How did you come up with the unique names of your oil scents? Related StoriesLocal Whiskerinas Will Add Hair-Raising Fun to Boulder Facial Hair Club Contest TomorrowA Hairy SituationReader: Hipsters Have Ruined the BeardEverything I do with Famous Beard Oil Company is an offset of myself personally, and I love the Beat Generation. That’s why one of my oils is called Urban Kerouac Blend, and I have another called Monk’s Dream, which is based off Thelonious Monk and my love of jazz. Savant Fusion comes from me being a writer and published poet, and overall I think I have an advantage of being able to describe my beard oils a little more personally. 


For the beatnik beard.
Eric D. Lough
 
 Have people been receptive to Famous Beard Oil Company so far?Well I’ve created eight beard oils that everybody seem to really love, and even Chuck Nazty — aka Charlie Blackmon, the Colorado Rockies outfielder — has shown his support for the oils. He liked my company on Twitter to show interest and now he’s using my oils. What are the Famous Beard Oil Company’s next steps? I plan on just sticking with the eight oils that people really enjoy and love using, at least for a while. I want to keep the company very beard-oil-oriented and not expand. If anything, in the future I might do a beard wash if I love what I can come up with. And people can catch Famous Beard Oil at a few different trade shows this summer. I’ll be at Man Craftable in the Baker District on June 20 and Harry’s Urban Farmer’s Market on July 11. 


Only the finest packaging for the craft of beard care.
Eric D. Lough

 You've mentioned that beards are here to stay. What makes you so sure? Beards have always been fashionable, especially in Denver, with the so-called hipster scene. They’re becoming more acceptable than ever. Men are taking care of themselves and the way they look with their style, which is where beard care comes into play. As a man who loves taking care of himself and grooming, I know. Beards are in, and people love them. For more information on Famous Beard Oil Company or to rub some on your own face, visit the company's website. Let me see what you're working with: tweet me photos of your beards at @Laureneverytime.
