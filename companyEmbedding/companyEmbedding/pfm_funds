During the weekend of August 22/23, our third-party Administrator (The Bank of New York Mellon – BNYM) experienced a technical malfunction resulting in it being unable to calculate timely NAVs for its mutual funds and ETF clients, including the PowerShares ETFs. As we disclosed to you last week, we experienced a delay in the dissemination of the NAV. PowerShares worked aggressively with BNYM to resolve the issue. We are pleased to report that the malfunction has been corrected by the Administrator and that the system is back to normal. The NAV that is being disseminated today is the most recent NAV for the Funds (as of Thursday, September 3).
For primary market participants, please note that, in accordance with the Prospectus and the SAI for each PowerShares ETF, orders received before the cut-off time on any given day were processed at the NAV that was calculated by the Administrator for that day. Given the delay in the calculation and dissemination of the NAV by the Administrator, we expect that most of the orders that the Administrator received last week will settle in the normal settlement cycle. Certain orders may experience (or have experienced) a  delay in settlement. Secondary market transactions were not affected by the delay and  are anticipated to settle in ordinary course.
See detailed list of last week's NAVs  
For additional information please contact PowerShares at 1-800-983-0903.

Equity - US Equity




Product Details
The PowerShares Dividend AchieversTM Portfolio (Fund) seeks to replicate, before fees and expenses, the NASDAQ US Broad Dividend AchieversTM Index (Index), which is designed to identify a diversified group of dividend-paying companies. The Fund will normally invest at least 90% of its total assets in dividend paying common stocks that comprise Index. These companies have increased their annual dividend for 10 or more consecutive fiscal years. The Fund and the Index are reconstituted annually in March and rebalanced quarterly in March, June, September and December.

Market returns are based on the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4 p.m. ET and do not represent the returns an investor would receive if shares were traded at other times. Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is not a guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate, and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be higher or lower than performance data quoted. After-tax returns reflect the highest federal income tax rate but exclude state and local taxes. Fund performance reflects applicable fee waivers, absent which, performance data quoted would have been lower. After Tax Held and After Tax Sold are based on NAV. Returns less than one year are cumulative.

				Data beginning 10 years prior to the ending date of 06/30/2017.  Fund performance shown at NAV.
An investor cannot invest directly in an index. The results assume that no cash was added to or assets withdrawn from the Index. Index returns do not represent Fund returns. The Index does not charge management fees or brokerage expenses, nor does the Index lend securities, and no revenues from securities lending were added to the performance shown.

Distribution Information



Fund Distributions

Dividends from net investment income, if any, are declared and paid either quarterly or monthly, depending on the Fund. For Funds on a quarterly dividend payment cycle, the dividend ex-date is generally the third Friday of each March, June, September and December, payable the last business day of the month. For Funds on a monthly dividend payment cycle, the dividend ex-date is generally the 15th of each month, payable the last business day of the month. 
The fund distributes its net realized capital gains, if any, to shareholders annually. Prior to paying a distribution of net investment income, the fund has the ability to invest cash generated from investment income into additional securities or money market instruments.
Distributions in cash may be reinvested automatically in additional whole shares of the fund only if the broker through whom you purchased shares makes such option available. Shareholders of the fund may contact their broker to determine the availability and costs of the service and the details of participation. Brokers may require shareholders to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If this service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the fund purchased in the secondary market. 
Taxes on Distributions
In general, your distributions are subject to federal income tax when they are paid, whether you take them in cash or reinvest them in the Fund. Dividends paid out of the Fund’s income and net short-term gains, if any, are taxable as ordinary income. Distributions of net long-term capital gains, if any, in excess of net short-term capital losses are taxable as long-term capital gains, regardless of how long you have held the Shares. Dividends from net investment income, if any, are declared and paid quarterly. The Fund may also pay a special distribution at the end of the calendar year to comply with federal tax requirements. 
Under the provisions of the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (the “2003 Tax Act”), long-term capital gains tax rates have generally been reduced for individuals to a maximum of 15% for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2009. In addition, some ordinary dividends declared and paid by the Fund to individual shareholders may qualify for taxation at the lower reduced tax rates applicable to long-term capital gains, provided that holding period and other requirements are met by the Fund and the shareholder. 
Distributions in excess of the Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits are treated as a tax-free return of capital to the extent of your basis in the Shares, and as capital gain thereafter. A distribution will reduce the Fund’s net asset value per Share and may be taxable to you as ordinary income or capital gain even though, from an investment standpoint, the distribution may constitute a return of capital. 
By law, the Fund must withhold a percentage of your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer identification number or social security number. The backup withholding rate is currently 28%.

 Fund in Focus 









 Risk & Other Information 
 
Typically, security classifications used in calculating allocation tables are as of the last trading day of the previous month.  There are risks involved with investing in ETFs, including possible loss of money. Shares are not actively managed and are subject to risks similar to those of stocks, including those regarding short selling and margin maintenance requirements. Ordinary brokerage commissions apply. The Fund's return may not match the return of the Underlying Index. The Fund is subject to certain other risks. Please see the current prospectus for more information regarding the risk associated with an investment in the Fund. Investments focused in a particular industry or sector are subject to greater risk, and are more greatly impacted by market volatility, than more diversified investments. Securities that pay high dividends as a group can fall out of favor with the market, causing such companies to underperform companies that do not pay high dividends. Stocks of small and mid-sized companies tend to be more vulnerable to adverse developments, may be more volatile, and may be illiquid or restricted as to resale. The Russell 3000® Value Index is an unmanaged index considered representative of U.S. value stocks. The Russell 3000® Value Index is a trademark/service mark of the Frank Russell Co. Russell® is a trademark of the Frank Russell Co. The Global Industry Classification Standard was developed by and is the exclusive property and a service mark of MSCI, Inc. and Standard & Poor's.  The NASDAQ US Broad Dividend Achievers Index is a trademark of NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc. and is licensed for use by Invesco PowerShares Capital Management LLC in connection with the PowerShares Dividend Achievers Portfolio. The Fund is not sponsored or endorsed by NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc., and NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc. makes no warranty or representation as to the accuracy and/or completeness of the Index or results to be obtained by any person from use of the Index or the trading of the Product.  Beta is a measure of risk representing how a security is expected to respond to general market movements. Smart Beta represents an alternative and selection index based methodology that seeks to outperform a benchmark or reduce portfolio risk, or both. Smart beta funds may underperform cap-weighted benchmarks and increase portfolio risk.

At PFM, diversity and inclusion are foundational to the firm’s success – in serving our clients, in creating a dynamic and welcoming work environment for our employees, in partnering with external stakeholders, and in realizing our overarching purpose of providing advice for people who transform their world. It is vitally important to us that both our colleagues and our clients should be able to recognize themselves in PFM.

About Us
History of PFM
It started with the simple insight that governments and charitable institutions needed independent advice from people they could trust. Advice from people who understood their financial needs and challenges, inside and out. From people who respected the amazing work they do every day, always for the benefit of others.
PFM opened its first office in Philadelphia in 1975. From the very beginning, we had a distinct advantage over the competition: we understood the need for a financial services firm founded exclusively for the benefit of governments and charitable institution clients. Thanks to an unwavering commitment to serving our clients’ interests above all else, PFM has grown into one of the nation’s leading independent financial and investment advisors.
Today, PFM employs hundreds of professionals serving a diverse base of clients from locations in every region of the country. We are asset managers, financial advisors and consultants who work across a broad range of traditional and special purpose sectors. Our duty as a fiduciary, combined with our bedrock principles of Ingenuity, Sustainability and Resourcefulness, help us deliver on our promise of advice that will help our clients transform their world.

Disaster Connections – why designers should consider the worst that can happen.
Traditionally, designers have not considered what happens if it all goes wrong. The concept that maintenance should happen as a matter of course and that maintenance will be preventative is often overlooked. The fact is, most companies only buy reactive maintenance, either through lack of knowledge or money, this can mean, when something goes wrong it is catastrophic.Full Story...

PFM Fund Description
The PowerShares Dividend Achievers Portfolio ETF tracks a market-cap-weighted index of dividend-paying US companies that have increased their annual dividends for 10 or more consecutive years.
  
PFM FactSet Analytics Insight
PFM offers a broad dividend growth portfolio in an ETF that's not particularly cheap to hold. As with competing fund VIG, firms must have increased their annual dividends for 10 consecutive years to merit inclusion. PFM tracks a similar but more inclusive Nasdaq index than that tracked by VIG—one that allows LPs and REITs, which may explain PFM's edge in yield. PFM's selection process produces major sector tilts—toward consumer non-cyclicals and away from tech (many tech giants haven't paid dividends long enough to make the cut). Comparisons to VIG diverge on costs: PFM charges a significantly higher fee and is markedly more expensive to trade on a retail basis, though spreads are still reasonable and block trades are straightforward. But with a fee that's many times what VIG charges, investors here need to love PFM's more diverse, higher-yielding exposure.

All investing involves some degree of risk, whether it is associated with market volatility, purchasing power or a specific security. There is no assurance any investment strategy will be successful or that a fund will meet its investment objectives. An investment in a mutual fund or exchange–traded fund (ETF) will fluctuate and shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
*The $30 Household Annual Fee or the IRA Custodial Fee (for IRA only households) can be waived with one of the following for all WellsTrade accounts in your household as of June 30 each year: 1) electronic delivery only enrollment for statements, trade confirmations, other documents and shareholder communications (excluding tax documents/1099s), 2) linkage to the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program 3) household balances of $250,000 or more, 4) households with solely SEP IRA, or 5) Wells Fargo Private Bank account. If a Household Annual Fee is due, the highest-value account in the client's household that is eligible to be charged a fee will be debited in September of each year.
Households comprised only of IRA accounts will be subject to a $30 IRA Custodial Fee. Households with an IRA and any other account type that is not exempt from annual fee will be subject to the $30 Household Annual Fee. IRA Custodial Fee will be waived for households paying a household annual fee. If an IRA Custodial Fee is due, clients will receive a remittance notice in August 2017 with several payment options. If a payment option is not selected, the fee will be automatically deducted from the IRA in September 2017. If there is more than one non-exempt IRA in the household, the fee will be equally divided amongst the non-exempt IRAs.
The grouping of accounts into a household is based on account eligibility and family relationship such as children, parents, domestic partners, and others. Certain accounts cannot be included in a household. Please call us at 1-800-TRADERS for more information and to determine whether all eligible accounts have been included in your household. It is your responsibility to ensure that all eligible accounts are included in your household

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The MSCI India Index (NDEUSIA) is designed to measure the performance of the large- and mid-capitalization segments of the Indian market, covering approximately 85% of companies in the Indian equity securities market.  One cannot invest directly in an Index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Fund’s Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with the Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse the Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The MSCI India Index (NDEUSIA) is designed to measure the performance of the large- and mid-capitalization segments of the Indian market, covering approximately 85% of companies in the Indian equity securities market.  One cannot invest directly in an Index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Fund’s Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with the Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse the Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year
