HV Announces Floyd, VA Facility Expansion

						November 19, 2014
					

 
East Walpole, MA – November 19, 2014 - Hollingsworth & Vose, a global leader in the supply of advanced materials for filtration, battery separator, and industrial applications, today announced plans to purchase the Floyd Flex Building from the Floyd County Economic Development Authority to house its‘ new Technostat®  production line.  The Floyd Flex Building is located within 2 miles of the current facility and will be leased with intent to purchase to support the expansion underway at H&V’s Floyd, VA  operations.  
 
The previously announced new Technostat filter media production line will be located in the Floyd Flex Building and is expected to be operational in mid-2015. This additional production capacity will support the successful launch of Technostat Plus® and the ongoing demand for Technostat filter media in North America.  H&V currently manufactures Technostat and Technostat Plus media in Europe.
Site Manager Vince Hatcher states that ”The lease to purchase of the Floyd Flex Building is a vital part of our overall expansion plan for the Floyd operations.  This building will provide space for our new Technostat production line as well as additional space for further expansion.“
 
Val Hollingsworth, President and CEO, commented,”The 2013 grant from the State of Virginia helped drive our decison to select Floyd for this investment and allowed us to expand our Floyd production staff.  We are pleased to continue our partnership with the State of Virginia, the Floyd County Economic Development Authority, and the Floyd County Board of Supervisors in the lease to purchase agreement of the the Floyd Flex Building.  We are fortunate to have a skilled and dedicated workforce in Floyd which is critical to the growth of our North American business.“
