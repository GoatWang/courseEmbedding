Amyris Names Steven R. Mills as New Chief Financial Officer


ADM veteran joins Amyris, marking new phase for Company's growth

 EMERYVILLE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

      Amyris,

      Inc. (NASDAQ:AMRS), a leading renewable chemicals and fuels company,

      today announced that Steven R. Mills has been appointed Chief Financial

      Officer effective May 2, 2012. Mills will replace Jeryl L. Hilleman,

      whose intent to depart during the course of this year was first

      announced in August 2011.

    


      "Steve's three decade career at ADM brings the set of skills we need as

      we enter a new growth stage for our Company," said John Melo, President

      & Chief Executive Officer of Amyris. "As we near completion of our first

      purpose-designed, industrial-scale renewable hydrocarbon plant, Steve's

      tested financial and strategy expertise will help ensure Amyris remains

      on a strong path to meet our customer and investors expectations."

    


      Mills joined ADM in 1979 and served in various senior treasury and

      accounting roles, including as Chief Financial Officer from 2008-2010.

      During his most recent assignment, Mills served as ADM's Senior

      Executive Vice President, Performance and Growth where he helped drive

      growth through business development and acquisitions until his

      retirement from ADM in February.

    


      "Amyris is leading the way in an array of renewable chemicals and fuels.

      I'm looking forward to joining Amyris's extraordinary team at a time

      when the Company is bringing its technology to full-scale production and

      commercialization," said Steve Mills.

    


      "As we welcome Steve to Amyris, we bid farewell to Jeri, who joined us

      four years ago as our first CFO. We are grateful for Jeri's many

      contributions, which include Amyris's successful initial public offering

      in October 2010. Jeri's commitment to a smooth transition over the last

      several months is evidence of her remarkable ongoing commitment to

      Amyris," concluded John Melo.

    

Amyris retained Alyse Bodine and John Strackhouse of Heidrick &

      Struggles for this executive search.
