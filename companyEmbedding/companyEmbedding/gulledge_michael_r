Michael Gulledge is a freelance photographer and full-time software engineer. 



I am an software engineer and business manager at AT&T working with large-scale SQL data warehouses, web application development and NoSQL side projects focusing on data analysis, data visualization and analytics. My current area of interest is in Big Data technologies including MongoDB mashed with natural language sentiment analysis, most of which is written in Java and PHP.  
A computer information systems graduate from Missouri State University’s College of Business, I have experience using technology and applications development to solve business cases and provide data to make sound business decisions. These skills have transferred to my current role at AT&T, which develops the technology needed to run the Chief Compliance Office. I graduated magna cum laude from the Honors College and received the Department of Computer Information Systems Outstanding Student of the Year award. I held internships at AT&T, MasterCard and a local Gannett media property.  
                    
In addition to the technology field, I worked as a reporter and photographer at the Springfield News-Leader, a daily newspaper in Springfield, Mo. I regularly freelance for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch/STLhighschoolsports.com covering high school sports. 
                    
I focused my journalism minor on using data analysis to drive and visualize stories to better appeal to readers, a skill I transferred to my work at the News-Leader. I also held leadership positions at The Standard, Missouri State’s Pacemaker-winning weekly student-run newspaper, and Ozarks News Journal (now The Springfield Report), a student-run mixed media site. I have reported breaking news, crime, enterprise and feature stories for the News-Leader. I have also photographed various sports including football, basketball, soccer, golf and baseball from high school to NCAA Division One and professional levels.

 Lee Enterprises Executive to Lead Innovative Anti-Meth Program  HELENA, Mont. -- The Montana Meth Project today announced the appointment of Michael R. Gulledge as chairman of the organization. The announcement was made by Montana Meth Project founder Tom Siebel at a ceremony held at the state capitol. Siebel, who previously held the post of chairman, will continue his active involvement in the Meth Project as founder, vice-chairman, and member of the advisory council.  "The Montana Meth Project is a shining example of what private citizens can do to overcome a debilitating problem when they are united in a common goal," said Montana Attorney General, Mike McGrath. "Under Mike Gulledge's leadership, the Project will continue to rally the people of Montana, actively seeking their support and participation as we all work together to end the Meth epidemic."  "It's an honor to serve as chairman of an organization that has developed such an effective and impactful program," said Gulledge. "The Project has done much for Montana's fight against methamphetamine in a short time. The strides the Project has made to raise awareness and change attitudes towards Meth illustrate the importance of what we're doing, and I look forward to ensuring this effort continues for many years to come."  Gulledge is the publisher of the Billings Gazette and a vice president of Lee Enterprises publishing group. He began his involvement with the Montana Meth Project in May 2005 as a member of the organization's advisory council. He has been with Lee Enterprises since 1983, and was promoted to vice president in 2005. He has published the Billings Gazette since 2000, and serves on several boards in Billings and throughout the state, including the Big Sky Economic Development Authority Board and the Billings Chamber of Commerce Board.  "Through his leadership on the advisory council, Mike's been a source of motivation for everyone involved in the Montana Meth Project," said Siebel. "His unwavering commitment to our cause made him an obvious choice when it came time to appoint a successor to the chairmanship."  Siebel also announced the appointment of Liz Marchi to the organization's advisory council. Marchi is the president of Montana West Economic Development and a member of the Montana Academy of Distinguished Entrepreneurs (MADE), a group that teaches, supports and recognizes distinguished entrepreneurship in association with the University of Montana School of Business.  Additionally, as the kick-off to a major capital campaign, a $5 million Challenge Grant was issued on behalf of the Thomas and Stacey Siebel Foundation to the people of Montana, offering to match any private and corporate donations to the Montana Meth Project through November 15, 2007, dollar-for-dollar.  About the Montana Meth Project  The Montana Meth Project is a not-for-profit organization headquartered in Missoula, Montana. The Montana Meth Project implements a range of advertising and community action programs to reduce methamphetamine use among Montana teens. The Meth Project is funded by a grant from the Thomas and Stacey Siebel Foundation. For more information, visit www.montanameth.org.

JAMES WOODCOCK/Gazette Staff























































Michael R. Gulledge, vice president of publishing for Lee Enterprises and publisher of Billings Gazette Communications, has been named Lee’s vice president of sales and marketing, responsible for leading revenue growth in more than 50 markets across 23 states.
Mary Junck, Lee chairman and chief executive officer, said Monday that Gulledge will continue as publisher of The Gazette and that a new vice president of publishing will be selected soon.
“Driving digital and print revenue growth is a top priority for Lee, and we expect Mike to raise our already-strong sales culture to an even higher level,” she said. “Lee has outpaced the industry average in advertising revenue performance for 36 quarters in a row, and Mike’s experience, ingenuity, energy, tenacity and uplifting spirit have been among the key reasons why.”

Junck said Gulledge has led the introduction of paid digital content across Lee and has been “a key strategist in our successful initiatives to accelerate digital sales, advance mobile growth and continue to expand our audiences.”
“He also has developed a wealth of top talent in our company and has advanced our values of strong local news and community leadership,” she said.
She said Gulledge will continue as an operating vice president during a brief transition. In addition to Billings, he currently oversees 18 daily newspapers and digital operations in California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Utah, Washington and Wyoming.
Gulledge began his 30-year career with Lee in 1982 as a college intern at The Southern Illinoisan in Carbondale while earning a degree in journalism and advertising at Southern Illinois University.

In 2000, he was appointed publisher of The Gazette.
He was elected an officer and operating vice president in 2005.
The Gazette received Lee’s highest honor, Enterprise of the Year, in 2006.

He is active in the Billings community and has served on boards of private college institutions, economic development organizations and health organizations.
He is chairman of the Montana Meth Project and past president of the Billings Chamber of Commerce.
He and his wife, Susan, have a son, Michael.
Lee Enterprises owns 48 daily newspapers and has a joint interest in four others, operates dozens of digital products and nearly 300 specialty publications.
