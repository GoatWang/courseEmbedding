Review of MAI Capital Management



MAI Capital Management – Overview/Reviews



Cleveland, Ohio-based MAI Capital Management, LLC is a privately held, independent, SEC Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) that, through a series of strategic mergers and acquisitions over its 40+ year history, has become the diversified investment and wealth management powerhouse that it is today.


As an affiliate of International Management Group (MG), the firm was originally established under the name of Investment Advisors International, Inc. (IAI) in 1973.


Following a joint venture between IAI and a major financial institution in 2000, a new company, McCormack Advisors International, LLC (McCormack), was created. 


In 2002, following the dissolution of the joint venture, the company reverted to its roots as an independent financial advisor to its clients. McCormack became fully independent of IMG in 2004.


On January 31, 2007, another independently owned firm, BC Investment Partners, LLC (BC), acquired McCormack and renamed the merged firm as MAI Wealth Advisors, LLC. 


On October 6, 2014, the merged entity was renamed MAI Capital Management, LLC. 


The firm’s clientele includes senior officers of major corporations and their families; individuals that typically have a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 and generally earn at least $150,000 per year; sports professionals who earn income from a variety of domestic and global sources; pension, profit-sharing, and other employee benefit plans; endowments, foundations, trusts, and other entities; and certain corporations (primarily S corporations).












MAI Capital Management Service Offerings and Approach


MAI Capital Management provides a full range of investment and financial planning services to institutions and high-net-worth individuals. The company serves high-net-worth individuals including sports professionals. As such, it is able to provide services to foreign clients in tax matters and may partner with firms outside the US for non-US tax compliance services and for completion of foreign tax returns.


The company’s financial planning services include: estate planning, retirement planning, tax planning, discretionary fund analysis, and preparing financial statements.


The company also serves as the investment manager for a number of investment funds including the MAI Multi Cap Opportunity Fund, LLC; MAI Large Cap Core Fund, LLC; MAI Wealth Private Equity Fund, LP; MAI Wealth Dividend Strategy Plus+ Fund, LP; MAI Opportunity Fund, LP; and Dividend Plus+ Income Fund (MAIPX/DIVPX) as well as acting as a sub-advisor to the Vertical Capital MLP & Energy Infrastructure Fund (VMLIX/VMLPX).


The firm also offers a number of investment strategies to its clients including the Dividend Strategy, Dividend Plus+ Strategy (with options overlay), Diversified Core Strategy, Diversified Dividend Strategy, Core Strategy, Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) Strategy, and MAI Energy Infrastructure & MLP Strategy.

The company provides institutions and high-net-worth individuals with discretionary and non-discretionary investment management services as well as investment advisory services to ultra high-net-worth clients.


The company is also able to fully integrate its wealth management services as part of a comprehensive wealth management offering. In addition to investment advice and financial planning, such integrated services may include advice on tax strategies, insurance, employee benefit analysis, and wealth transfer planning.


The firm offers a suite of non-advisory services that include tax preparation, insurance administration, and family office services including client accounting and bill paying services.

What We Like About MAI Capital Management


Long history in the Industry


While MAI Capital Management, LLC is a relatively new (October 2014) legal entity, the company traces its history back to 1973, giving the firm’s clients access to over 40 years of rich tradition and experience in the financial planning, investment advisory, and wealth management industry.


Tailored Services


The company manages its client services based on a mutually agreed investment strategy chosen by the client, which takes into consideration the client’s risk tolerance, goals and objectives, and investment horizon. 


Highly Qualified and Experienced Team


Over 70% of the firm’s staff has advanced designations and certifications, giving clients access to a broad team of Certified Public Accountants, Certified Financial Planners, and Chartered Financial Analysts.


Incentivized Fee Structure


While the company does not charge performance fees for a large portion of its services, clients may greatly benefit from such a fee structure that’s in place for the MAI Wealth Private Equity Fund, LP and MAI Opportunity Fund, LP. Performance fees in these two strategies incentivize the delivery of enhanced returns on investment by advisors.












MAI Capital Management Review – Team Members:


The MAI Capital Management team comprises over 25 highly qualified professionals who are ably supported by a team of more than 30 support staff members in designing, implementing, and monitoring customized integrated wealth management plans and strategies for its clients.


Through this diverse team of seasoned professionals, with over 70% having advanced certifications, accreditations, and designations, the firm’s clients have access to Certified Public Accountants, Certified Financial Planners, and Chartered Financial Analysts.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 03/28/2003
            

                BBB has determined that MAI Capital Management, LLC meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry

Advertise Honestly

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.
                
3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.
                

                    4. Cooperate with BBB in efforts to eliminate the underlying cause of patterns of customer complaints that are identified by BBB.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.
