James P. Halloran, M.D.Dr. Halloran’s primary clinical interest focuses on diagnosis and treatment of conditions involving the knee, ankle, and foot.  He has completed fellowship training in both sports medicine and foot/ankle surgery.  This is a very unique combination of skills that gives Dr. Halloran additional insight into the cause of many lower extremity injuries.  He has in depth knowledge regarding bone and ligamentous injuries of the knee, ankle, and foot with extensive experience in arthroscopic and minimally invasive management of these complex conditions.
Furthermore, Dr. Halloran has received comprehensive training from world renowned experts in total ankle arthroplasty and cartilage restoration at Duke University.  These are very complex procedures, but can return function to an active person.  Using a combination of 3 different total ankle replacement systems and a multitude of cartilage restoration techniques he is able to tailor the ankle treatment to best fit each patient’s needs.
Dr. Halloran’s commitment to an active lifestyle and athletics is evident in both his personal belief that activity leads to better health and his involvement with sports teams.  Throughout his training, Dr. Halloran has been assistant team physician for the Detroit Pistons (NBA), Detroit Red Wings (NHL), Detroit Tigers (MLB), and Duke University mens’ soccer team.
Dr. Halloran strives to treat each patient with compassion and humility.  It is his firm belief that the doctor-patient relationship needs to function like a “team” to provide cutting-edge care and exceptional patient outcomes.
“Great results can only be achieved if a patient has a thorough understanding of their condition and the treatment options available to them.  In many cases, there are multiple right answers and the goal of effective care is for the patient to arrive at the option that will provide the best and quickest return to activity.”
