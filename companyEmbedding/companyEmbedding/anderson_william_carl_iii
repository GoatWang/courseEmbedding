                                10-position all-numeric identification number assigned by the NPS to uniquely identify a health care provider.
                            



                                Entity Type
                            

                                Individual
                            

                                Code describing the type of health care provider that is being assigned an NPI. Codes are:

1 = (Person): individual human being who furnishes health care;
2 = (Non-person): entity other than an individual human being that furnishes health care (for example, hospital, SNF, hospital subunit, pharmacy, or HMO).





                                Is Sole Proprietor
                            

                                N
                            

                                Indicate whether provider is a sole proprietor.

A sole proprietor is the sole (the only) owner of a business that is not incorporated; that unincorporated business is a sole proprietorship.
In a sole proprietorship, the sole proprietor owns all of the assets of the business and is solely liable for all of the debts of the business.
There is no difference between a sole proprietorship and a sole proprietor; they are legally a single entity: an individual.
In terms of NPI assignment, a sole proprietor is an Entity type 1 (Individual) and is eligible for only one NPI (the sole proprietorship business is not eligible for its own NPI).
As an individual, a sole proprietorship cannot be a subpart and cannot have subparts. (See NPI Final Rule for information about subparts.)
A sole proprietorship may or may not have employees.
Often, the IRS assigns an EIN to a sole proprietorship in order to protect the sole proprietor's SSN from disclosure in claims or on W-2s. NPPES does not capture a sole proprietorship's EIN.
Many types of health care providers could be sole proprietorships (for example, group practices, pharmacies, home health agencies).

                                The last name of the provider (if an individual). If the provider is an individual, this is the legal name.

          William Carl “Bill” Anderson Jr., 62        




















 
William Carl “Bill” Anderson Jr., 62, of Pittsburgh, died Tuesday, Oct. 15, 2013, at his home with family. 
Bill was born Dec. 6, 1950, in Philadelphia, Pa., son of the late William Carl Anderson Sr. and the late Lenna “Marlys” Hubbard. 
Bill is survived by his three children, William Carl Anderson III of Denver, Colo., and Corrie Ann Anderson and Amy Marie Anderson of Pittsburgh; his ex-wife Jessie Ann Anderson of Punxsutawney; as well as his beloved dog, Ruby. 
In addition to his children, Bill is survived by his mother, Beverly Anderson, and siblings Carl Anderson, Karen Meyn, Jeffrey Anderson, Mark Anderson, Ronald Anderson and Michael Anderson, as well as numerous nieces and nephews. 
After graduating from Penn State University in 1973, Bill began his newspaper career as a sports writer for The Punxsutawney Spirit. He served as publisher of The Punxsutawney Spirit from 1977 through 1999. 
During his two-plus decades in Punxsutawney, he was actively involved in the community in more than a dozen civic organizations, including the Groundhog Club’s Inner Circle. 
Bill was a partner in the Latrobe Publishing Company, working at the Mainline Newspaper in Ebensburg. 
In addition, Bill was a co-publisher of Hometown Magazine in Punxsutawney. 
In 2012, Bill was awarded the Pennsylvania Newspaper Association’s Benjamin Franklin Award for Excellence, which recognizes individuals who have performed an outstanding service or accomplishment to their newspapers and to the newspaper industry. 
In addition to his work in the newspaper business, Bill was an active writer, writing several books on the history of Punxsutawney and Groundhog Day and, most recently, a history of the famous baseball player, Rube Waddell. 
Throughout Bill’s life he was also a sports enthusiast, supporting his alma mater, Penn State University, as well as the Pittsburgh Pirates and Steelers. 
In addition, Bill enjoyed golfing and playing baseball with his brothers at family reunions. 
Family and friends are invited to attend a Funeral Mass at 11 a.m. on Saturday, Oct. 19, 2013, at the Pittsburgh Oratory, 4450 Bayard St. Pittsburgh, PA 15213. 
In lieu of flowers, the family suggests memorial contributions be made to the Hillman Cancer Center in Pittsburgh or the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank. 
Professional services are trusted to Thomas M. Smith Funeral Home & Crematory Ltd., Blawnox.
