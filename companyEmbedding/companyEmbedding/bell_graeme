            Graeme Bell                                        Part of the Series: Australian Biography Series 4

National Film and Sound Archive of Australia





 




Musician. Born Melbourne, 1914. Died 2012.
Often described as "the father of Australian jazz", Graeme Bell has had a 60-year love affair with music, both as a performer and a composer. Graeme grew up in a Melbourne home filled with music. His mother, a professional contralto, had toured with Dame Nellie Melba. Graeme himself studied classical piano for many years before settling on jazz music. After forming Graeme Bell's Dixieland Jazz Band in the early years of World War Two, he entertained troops across northern Queensland. Once the war ended, he and the band toured Czechoslovakia, Korea, Japan and the UK. He is credited with bringing jazz to Czechoslovakia and jazz-dancing to England. In 1957, after a struggle with alcoholism, Graeme moved to Sydney where he set up Graeme Bell's All Stars and recorded over 20 albums. He and his wife Dorothy live in a Sydney beachside suburb where he wrote his autobiography Graeme Bell, Australian Jazz Man. He still performs regularly.

      business development






June 01, 2015 07:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time



PALO ALTO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Anacor Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:ANAC) today announced that Graeme 
      Bell will join Anacor as its new Executive Vice President and Chief 
      Financial Officer. Mr. Bell has more than 20 years of global financial 
      experience in the pharmaceutical industry, and will succeed Geoffrey M. 
      Parker effective as of June 1, 2015. Mr. Parker will remain with Anacor 
      as a consultant to support the transition.
    


      Mr. Bell joins Anacor from Merck & Co., Inc., where he served since 2010 
      as its Vice President, Country CFO, U.S. Human Health, responsible for 
      the financial oversight and support of Merck’s U.S. pharmaceutical and 
      vaccine business. Prior to his most recent role, Mr. Bell served in a 
      number of positions of increasing responsibility at Merck, including as 
      its Global Pharmaceutical Franchises Controller from 2009 to 2010, 
      Country CFO, U.K. from 2008 to 2009 and Global Head of Investor 
      Relations from 2004 to 2008. Mr. Bell has an MBA from Durham University 
      (UK) and is a Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Management 
      Accountants (CIMA).
    

      “Graeme is an experienced pharmaceutical executive whose two decades in 
      financial leadership roles at Merck transforming strategic business 
      initiatives into meaningful results will be invaluable to Anacor as we 
      continue our evolution as an emerging commercial pharmaceutical company. 
      He brings extensive business development, strategic, operational and 
      investor relations experience, practical expertise resourcing product 
      launches, as well as exceptional financial leadership skills. We are 
      excited to add a senior executive of Graeme’s caliber to Anacor and 
      believe he will prove a strong addition to our executive team,” said 
      Paul L. Berns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Anacor. “In 
      addition, I also want to thank Geoff for his many contributions during 
      his term as Chief Financial Officer and for his commitment to our 
      stockholders, employees and other stakeholders. We are very pleased to 
      have his continuing support.”
    

      “I am very pleased to join Anacor and its leadership team at such an 
      exciting time,” said Graeme Bell. “Anacor’s recently approved product, 
      KERYDIN, Phase 3 asset, AN2728, and innovative product development 
      efforts present a unique and compelling opportunity to create value for 
      patients, healthcare providers and Anacor’s stockholders. I’m keen to 
      begin contributing to Anacor’s success going forward.”
    

      “I am delighted that Graeme will be joining Anacor and I look forward to 
      working closely with Paul, Graeme and the rest of my colleagues over the 
      coming months to ensure a seamless transition,” said Geoff Parker.
    

About Anacor Pharmaceuticals


      Anacor is a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing 
      and commercializing novel small-molecule therapeutics derived from its 
      boron chemistry platform. Anacor’s first approved drug, KERYDIN® 
      (tavaborole) topical solution, 5%, is an oxaborole antifungal approved 
      by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in July 2014 for the topical 
      treatment of onychomycosis of the toenails. In July 2014, Anacor entered 
      into an exclusive agreement with Sandoz Inc., a Novartis company, 
      pursuant to which PharmaDerm, the branded dermatology division of 
      Sandoz, distributes and commercializes KERYDIN in the United States. In 
      September 2014, PharmaDerm launched KERYDIN in the United States. 
      Anacor’s lead product development candidate is AN2728, an 
      investigational non-steroidal topical PDE-4 inhibitor for the potential 
      treatment of mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. Beyond 
      KERYDIN and AN2728, Anacor has discovered three investigational 
      compounds that it has out-licensed for further development. The first 
      compound is licensed to Eli Lilly and Company for the potential 
      treatment of an animal health indication. The second compound, AN5568, 
      also referred to as SCYX-7158, is licensed to Drugs for Neglected 
      Diseases initiative for the potential treatment of human African 
      trypanosomiasis. The third compound is licensed to GlaxoSmithKline LLC 
      for development in tuberculosis. Anacor also has a pipeline of other 
      internally discovered topical and systemic boron-based compounds in 
      early stages of research and development. These include AN3365, an 
      investigational Gram-negative antibiotic, and certain other wholly-owned 
      investigational product candidates. For more information, visit http://www.anacor.com.
    

Forward-Looking Statements


      This press release contains forward-looking statements, including 
      statements regarding the progress, timing and results of Anacor’s 
      clinical trials, the safety and efficacy of Anacor’s approved product 
      and product development candidates, the timing of the potential approval 
      of Anacor’s product development candidates, the commercial success of 
      KERYDIN and the timing and potential commercial success of Anacor’s 
      product development candidates. These statements constitute 
      forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the 
      Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 
      1934. The words “may,” “might,” “will,” “should,” “estimate,” “project,” 
      “plan,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “intend,” “outlook,” “believe” and other 
      similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. 
      Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these 
      forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this 
      release, and Anacor undertakes no obligation to update any 
      forward-looking statement except as required by law. These 
      forward-looking statements are based on estimates and assumptions by 
      Anacor’s management that, although believed to be reasonable, are 
      inherently uncertain and subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. 
      The following represent some, but not necessarily all, of the factors 
      that could cause actual results to differ from historical results or 
      those anticipated or predicted by Anacor’s forward-looking statements: 
      the successful commercialization of KERYDIN pursuant to Anacor’s 
      distribution and commercialization agreement with Sandoz Inc.; any 
      issues, delays or failures arising during the course, or as a result, of 
      Anacor’s Phase 3 pivotal studies or other studies relating to AN2728; 
      any delay or failure by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to approve 
      AN2728; Anacor’s ability to timely and successfully launch, either alone 
      or with a partner, AN2728, if approved; the impact of general economic, 
      industry, market or political conditions; and the other risks and 
      uncertainties identified in Anacor’s periodic filings, including 
      Anacor’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 
      and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2015.
