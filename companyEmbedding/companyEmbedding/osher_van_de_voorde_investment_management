Our approach

Leaders of small and mid-sized businesses have multiple roles and competing priorities. You want a best-in-class retirement plan but may be unsure about all the complexities and requirements. You may be uncertain about the costs and fees involved. You need a provider focused solely on retirement and aligned with your needs and goals—and fully committed to you, your participants, and the ongoing improvement of retirement investing.

Vanguard is committed to the retirement business and is a leader in the retirement plan industry. Best of all, you can benefit from Vanguard's unique ownership structure: We're owned by our clients and not by outside investors or stockholders. That means you never need to question whose interests come first for us. This approach serves as a foundation for all that we do with Vanguard Retirement Plan Access™, our 401(k) offer for small and mid-sized plans. You can count on our expertise to remove the uncertainties from managing your plan and our leadership to help you offer a strong plan for your participants. 



Key benefits




You can:

Have confidence in your plan.
Understand your costs.
Focus on your business.





Cost-conscious?
As a business owner and plan fiduciary, you want to eliminate ambiguity in retirement plan costs. Research has shown that plan costs for the smaller end of the market tend to be higher, and you need a retirement plan provider that not only provides transparent pricing but has a fair and reasonable cost structure.1
With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access:

You receive an All-in Fee Report that shows the total cost of your plan.
You have access to low-cost Vanguard index funds, plus the opportunity to choose from among more than 12,000 non-Vanguard funds.
Your annual recordkeeping price is based on a per-participant fee—a fee that doesn't jump as your assets grow, as with many small to mid-sized retirement plans.
You have flexibility in how you cover your plan costs—including a recordkeeping credit depending on the share class selected.




Too busy?
 As a business owner, you're pressed for time and focused on many aspects of business. With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access, you can rely on high-quality recordkeeping and administration to ease your administrative burden and help your employees stay on track for retirement.

Equity Selection Criteria


 

 

 

Osher Van de Voorde Investment Management employs both quantitative and qualitative/fundamental analysis. Select quantitative screens help automate the search for quality growth companies selling at reasonable valuations. Fundamental research analyzes the unique investment characteristics of individual companies, as well as how particular industries react to economic trends. Technical analysis, the usage of charts to identify price trends, is used as an auxiliary tool to help identify favorable entry points.The crux of our research and analysis incorporates both growth and value investing. Whereas growth investing favors those companies with consistently increasing earnings, value investing looks for underpriced opportunities among comparable companies with sound fundamentals. Osher Van de Voorde Investment Management's core equity investment strategy is often described as "growth at a reasonable price" or "GARP".Our equity investment strategy is focused on finding high-quality, growth companies that sell at reasonable valuations. We screen for companies with historically consistent earnings growth and greater than 10% estimated earnings growth for the next 5 years. While this quantitative filter keeps our focus on growth, we are also particular about finding attractive entry points. Attention to growth and value is key to long-term success in the stock market. As such, we further filter our list of growth stocks to find those companies that are selling at low levels relative to their own historical valuations (based on earnings, dividends, cash flow and book value) and relative to the overall market.This quantitative screening for GARP produces a focus list that is then further filtered through the lenses of our fundamental criteria: 1) good business with elongated product cycle; 2) proven management; 3) leading brand franchise and market share for respective industry; 4) well-defined international prospects; and 5) superior financial strength. This fundamental or qualitative approach requires us to understand companies from the "bottom-up".In addition to bottom-up fundamental analysis, we also consider "top-down" investment themes to screen for companies that are participating in sectors likely to drive economic growth for the foreseeable future. These "thematic engines" include globalization, mobile broadband, demographics and outsourcing. Owning companies that are entrenched in such thriving business trends is particularly comforting during periods of market uncertainty.Having screened for growth, valuation, fundamentals and thematic engines, we also identify potential catalysts that might help catapult the stock price within a relatively short period of time (less than one year). Significant share repurchases, new products or services, industry consolidation, turnaround of a key customer or foreign market and insider purchases are all potential catalysts that boost our confidence in the entry point selected.Seeking broad diversification, we are ultimately looking to own between 20 and 30 companies for the core equity portion of each portfolio. We use the S&P 500 index as a benchmark for how the portfolio is weighted by economic sector. Desired sector weighting relative to the S&P 500 is largely influenced by thematic engines and the long-term prospects for each sector, while implementation and actual weighting is driven by market fluctuation and valuation considerations.Osher Van de Voorde Investment Management also considers "special situation" stocks that vary from our core philosophy but possess other unique qualities that are appropriate for meeting certain investment objectives. Unless requested by the client, special situation stocks typically represent a small portion of the overall portfolio.Though it is our intention to buy and hold securities for the long-term (more than one year), there are circumstances when we will sell a stock within a shorter period of time. The following are instances when we might consider selling a stock within one year of purchase: 1) the stock may get ahead of the underlying fundamentals and become overvalued; 2) the underlying fundamentals may change and so change our investment thesis; 3) tax circumstances may warrant the realization of losses; and 4) the market presents us with more attractive opportunities.By constructing a well-diversified core portfolio of "blue-chip" growth companies that sell with a relative margin of safety, we are looking to achieve consistent returns while minimizing risk.

Our Process


 

 

 

ConsultationConservative investment strategies and personalized goal setting Initial interviews and a comprehensive questionnaire help determine the client's financial circumstances, investment objectives, risk tolerance and life goals. Together with the client, we evaluate allocation strategies to optimize goal attainment within suitable parameters of risk. We develop conservative, long-term solutions tailored to each investor's financial and personal priorities.Portfolio Management ServicesIndividual attention to each client's investment portfolio Each client receives experienced personal attention in the management of his or her wealth. Assets are invested in securities portfolios that are tailored to individual objectives. Growth expectations, income needs, risk tolerance and taxes are all significant considerations in defining one's investment priorities. By understanding personal and financial circumstances, we build securities portfolios that are responsive and consistent with each investor's unique long-term goals.In today's world of often complicated and seemingly inexhaustible financial products, we adhere to a clear, disciplined core investment philosophy that incorporates both growth and value investing.  Selecting from a universe of well-managed companies that have demonstrated consistent success in varying economic and political environments, our methodical research process uncovers undervalued opportunities among leading growth companies.  Companies selected for the core of portfolios share specific "blue-chip" qualities that distinguish them from less desirable choices. We invest in these high-quality growth companies when they are undervalued relative to historical norms. Attention to growth and value ("growth at a reasonable price") is key to long-term success in the stock market.  Building around the core, we utilize mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in other asset classes to obtain optimal diversification. ImplementationBroad diversification and tailored asset allocation After the client selects either a broker or bank as custodian, we initiate discretionary investment decisions in pursuit of long-term objectives.Custom securities portfolios may be fully invested in stocks, or in stocks and bonds. Stocks are diversified among a wide array of companies and economic sectors, while bonds may include municipal, U.S. Treasury or agency, as well as high quality corporate issues. Depending on asset allocation, each security represents between 1% and 5% of the total portfolio when purchased. Cash is normally held in a money market fund as a reserve.Broad diversification is instrumental in achieving long-term objectives while minimizing overall risk. Specific allocation depends on the client's preference for either a more conservative or more aggressive portfolio.ReviewComprehensive portfolio reports and ongoing client communicationClient portfolios and underlying securities are closely monitored to ensure consistency with financial news, economic trends and changes in client circumstances. Portfolio adjustments are made as needed or as warranted by market conditions.State-of-the-art software facilitates daily portfolio supervision and enhances the effectiveness of independent research. Proprietary analytical spreadsheets and other computer and Internet resources are important tools in thoroughly reviewing investment opportunities.Each client receives a monthly statement from the custodian and a more comprehensive quarterly statement from Osher Van de Voorde Investment Management. Clients also receive a quarterly newsletter from Osher Van de Voorde Investment Management that provides important updates on portfolio holdings and keeps clients up-to-date on economic trends and key planning considerations.Personal meetings are encouraged and arranged at the client's convenience. Ongoing communication is beneficial in building successful, long-term business relationships. A close relationship between advisor and client helps keep the portfolio management focus on meeting the distinct goals and objectives of each investor.

Robert C. Osher
(August 1, 1936 - March 10, 2015)

A native of St. Louis, Missouri, Bob earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Economics at the University of Missouri in 1959. He was an active member in the Beta Theta Pi fraternity. Fortunately, a Navy ROTC requirement sent him to San Diego and he quickly developed an appreciation for California weather. After two years of military service, in 1963 he began his professional career in investment banking as an account executive with Dean Witter in San Francisco.
During his distinguished career, Bob was a leader with Wells Fargo Bank, attended the Stanford University Investment Management Program, became Vice President of Western Asset Management’s Personal Trust Investment Department, Senior Vice President and Portfolio Manager for Van Deventer & Hoch, and then founded his own firm, Robert Osher & Company, with James Van de Voorde in 1993. Throughout his career, Bob emphasized a more personal touch and the importance of building long-term relationships in the investment counsel business.
In his personal life, Bob was an avid photographer and golfer, and loved reading, hiking, scuba diving, tennis, relaxing in the desert, and the camaraderie and friendships he made at Oakmont and Indian Ridge Country Clubs. He loved his daughters, Karen and Connie, showing them unconditional love and support throughout their lives and took great joy in his 10 grandchildren on both sides. He took a special pleasure in reading to all of his grandchildren, especially the poems of Shel Silverstein. Bob’s interest in cultures and peoples around the world stimulated his passion for travelling. In recent years, Bob and Jean travelled internationally to every corner of the globe. His curiosity about life and the world was boundless.
Bob also remained active in numerous civic, social, and cultural affairs, having served on boards of the Glendale Adventist Medical Center, Glendale College Foundation, Crescenta-Canada YMCA, president of the La Canada Rotary Club, Verdugo Banking Company and the City of Glendale Investment Advisory Committee. Bob was a member of the Economic Roundtable, the Athenaeum, the Huntington Society of Fellows, Pasadena Arts League, the Pasadena Angels and the Pasadena Wine and Food Society.
Bob had countless friends, was a true gentleman, a man of deep integrity, and genuinely cared for all those with which he worked and knew. He had a humility about his accomplishments that was rare but admired by many. He is survived by his wife Jean, daughter Karen Osher and her husband Kevin Woodhouse, daughter Connie Osher and business partner James Van de Voorde who was like a son. Bob was the love of Jean’s life and he loved and adored her for the joy and love that she brought to his life. He was blessed with 10 grandchildren and will be missed by all that knew him and were touched by his life.

Frequently Asked Questions


 

 

 

 
"What criteria should I use in comparing different financial advisors?"
It is always a good idea to compare the services of different investment managers. Having quality alternatives increases one's confidence in ultimately choosing the most suitable manager. Investment philosophy, experience and trust are essential selection criteria. Ask each prospective advisor to explain their investment process and decide whether it is a discipline that employs common sense. Since any investment program requires a long-term commitment, make sure that the firm's investment philosophy increases your confidence and comfort level. Study the background of the firm's decision makers and compare their investment experience. Meet personally with each one and spend sufficient time discussing your needs. Thorough understanding of investment philosophy and comparisons of experience will help ensure that you choose an advisor you can trust.
"What distinguishes Osher Van de Voorde Investment Management from larger, institutional investment advisory firms?"
Osher Van de Voorde Investment Management is focused on managing quality portfolios, not a vast quantity of employees. Unlike large institutions, we have no dedicated sales force and rely instead on qualified referrals from satisfied clients and professionals. Our family-owned environment is more suitable for knowing each client and tailoring portfolios to their specific objectives. In contrast, investment managers at large institutions monitor so many portfolios that primary contact with clients is delegated to sales staff.
"I am considering mutual funds. Am I better off with an investment manager?"
While the cost is nearly identical, mutual funds lack the ability to tailor portfolios to unique priorities such as income needs, tax considerations and risk tolerance. For instance, investors have no influence over a fund's tax planning, and so may receive unpleasant capital gains surprises at year-end. If invested in a fund, your wealth is pooled with others whose objectives vary significantly from your own. A financial advisor provides the personal attention and individualized supervision not offered by mutual funds. Other considerations that lessen the appeal of mutual funds include investment limitations due to extensive size, and reporting that is often mysterious and less frequent.
"I have relied on my stockbroker for many years. Am I able to take advantage of the services provided by an investment advisor, yet maintain the relationship with my broker?"
We make all investment decisions and then implement buy and sell orders through a broker. Because of the synergy that exists between investment advisors and brokers, replacing your broker is not necessary. In fact, brokers often refer clients that desire independent portfolio management to us. In utilizing our services, clients may choose their own custodian, either broker or bank. We are pleased to recommend preferred custodians to our clients.
"What is your fee and how is it based?"
Our 1% annual fee is calculated quarterly as a percentage of assets under management. As a fee-only investment advisor, we do not subscribe to "wrap fee" programs and receive no commission compensation.
"What is the best way to measure performance?"
There is no singular, uniform way to measure and compare performance. It is important, however, to gauge performance relative to underlying risk. Additionally, it is always important to remember that past performance does not guarantee future results. Means of performance comparison include benchmarking one's portfolio to an appropriate index such as the S&P 500. This will provide a sense of how the portfolio has fared relative to a widely used barometer of the overall market. Other clients are more interested in analyzing their returns on an absolute basis, factoring for risk and the attainment of long-term objectives. Osher Van de Voorde Investment Management seeks consistent returns within a conservative risk-reward framework.
We welcome the opportunity to discuss your individual investment objectives and answer other questions you may have.

 Educational Background



Bachelor of Arts Degree 


Claremont McKenna College

                  As one of the nation's most selective private liberal arts colleges, CMC sits among the intellectually-stimulating, socially-fulfilling, seven-college community known as The Claremont Colleges, a system modeled after England's Oxford University. Founded in 1946, CMC is the youngest of the nation's top colleges and enrolls approximately 1,200 students.

Claremont McKenna College (CMC) educates its students for thoughtful and productive lives and responsible leadership in economics, government and public affairs. CMC's strong grounding in the liberal arts, together with its emphasis on economics, government, and international relations, attracts students who approach education pragmatically and who intend to make a difference in the world. With this broad-based foundation graduates leave CMC well prepared for the challenges of the 21st century. Many go on to pursue careers in law, business, government, foreign service, international relations, public policy, museum administration, science and education, or to pursue graduate study.

The College's cutting-edge research institutes provide students unprecedented opportunities to work alongside their professors and discover how what they learn in the classroom links to life in the world behond. The world comes to Claremont McKenna through a vibrant and renowned speakers series in which world leaders, thinkers, artists and visionaries visit campus through the Marian Miner Cook Athenaeum and other public programming.

In September 2007, Robert A. Day, the Founder and Chairman of The TCW Group, Inc., pledged a $200 million personal gift to establish the Robert Day School of Economics and Finance and its unique programs. This was the largest recorded gift to a liberal arts institution, the largest gift in the field of finance and economics, and among the top 20 largest gifts ever given to a college or university. Through his generosity, the Robert Day School of Economics and Finance now offers multiple programs, including a Master of Arts in Finance degree                




MBA in Finance 


University of California -  Los Angeles

                  UCLA's primary purpose as a public research university is the creation, dissemination, preservation and application of knowledge for the betterment of our global society. To fulfill this mission, UCLA is committed to academic freedom in its fullest terms: We value open access to information, free and lively debate conducted with mutual respect for individuals, and freedom from intolerance. In all of our pursuits, we strive at once for excellence and diversity, recognizing that openness and inclusion produce true quality. These values underlie our three institutional responsibilities.

Learning and teaching at UCLA are guided by the belief that undergraduate, graduate and professional school students and their teachers belong to a community of scholars. This community is dedicated to providing students with a foundational understanding of a broad range of disciplines followed by the opportunity for in-depth study in a chosen discipline. All members of the community are engaged together in discovering and advancing knowledge and practice. Learning occurs not only in the classroom but also through engagement in campus life and in communities and organizations beyond the university.                





 Career History



Advisory Council

                                    Current                


Osher Van de Voorde Investment Management


                  Osher Van de Voorde Investment Management employs a disciplined growth and value investment approach. Portfolios may be fully invested in stocks or in stocks and bonds. Stocks are widely diversified among an array of companies and economic sectors. Bonds may include municipal, US Treasury or agency and high quality corporate issues. Depending on asset allocation, each security represents between 1% and 5% of the total portfolio when purchased. Cash is usually held in a money market fund as a reserve.The firm uses both quantitative and qualitative/fundamental analysis. Their core equity investment strategy is GARP. Osher Van de Voorde seeks to identify high-quality, growth companies that sell at reasonable valuations. They look for companies with historically consistent earnings growth and greater than 10% estimated earnings growth for the next 5 years. Osher Van de Voorde also emphasizes the identification of attractive entry points. They filter their list of growth stocks to find companies that are selling at low levels relative to their historical valuations (based on earnings, dividends, cash flow and book value) and relative to the overall market.The firm's GARP screening process results in a group of companies that is then subjected to bottom-up fundamental analysis. In this regard, Osher Van de Voorde looks for companies with good business and an elongated product cycle. Management incentives must be tied to the stock price. They look for companies with a leading brand franchise and market share for their industry. A company should also have well-defined international prospects and superior financial strength.Osher Van de Voorde also employs top-down analysis to identify companies that are participating in sectors likely to drive economic growth in the future. They consider such themes as globalization, broadband, demographics, mobility, outsourcing and security/defense.After they have screened for growth, valuation, fundamentals and investment themes, the firm also seeks to identify potential catalysts that might lead to increases in the stock price within a year or less. They are interested in catalysts such as significant share repurchases, new products or services, industry consolidation, turnaround of a key customer or foreign market and insider purchases.The core equity portion of each portfolio typically holds between 20 and 30 companies. Robert Osher uses the S&P 500 index as a benchmark for how the portfolio is weighted by economic sector. Sector weightings relative to the S&P 500 depend on specific investment themes and each sector's long-term prospects. Implementation and actual weighting is influenced by market fluctuation and valuation considerations.Osher Van de Voorde also considers investments in special situation stocks that vary from their core investment strategy but which possess qualities that are appropriate for meeting certain investment objectives.The firm intends to buy and hold securities for the long-term (more than one year), although in certain situations they may sell a stock within a shorter period of time. They may sell a stock within one year of purchasing it if the stock gets ahead of the underlying fundamentals and becomes overvalued, if the underlying fundamentals change, if tax circumstances warrant the realization of losses or if they uncover more attractive opportunities.

Our approach

Leaders of small and mid-sized businesses have multiple roles and competing priorities. You want a best-in-class retirement plan but may be unsure about all the complexities and requirements. You may be uncertain about the costs and fees involved. You need a provider focused solely on retirement and aligned with your needs and goals—and fully committed to you, your participants, and the ongoing improvement of retirement investing.

Vanguard is committed to the retirement business and is a leader in the retirement plan industry. Best of all, you can benefit from Vanguard's unique ownership structure: We're owned by our clients and not by outside investors or stockholders. That means you never need to question whose interests come first for us. This approach serves as a foundation for all that we do with Vanguard Retirement Plan Access™, our 401(k) offer for small and mid-sized plans. You can count on our expertise to remove the uncertainties from managing your plan and our leadership to help you offer a strong plan for your participants. 



Key benefits




You can:

Have confidence in your plan.
Understand your costs.
Focus on your business.





Cost-conscious?
As a business owner and plan fiduciary, you want to eliminate ambiguity in retirement plan costs. Research has shown that plan costs for the smaller end of the market tend to be higher, and you need a retirement plan provider that not only provides transparent pricing but has a fair and reasonable cost structure.1
With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access:

You receive an All-in Fee Report that shows the total cost of your plan.
You have access to low-cost Vanguard index funds, plus the opportunity to choose from among more than 12,000 non-Vanguard funds.
Your annual recordkeeping price is based on a per-participant fee—a fee that doesn't jump as your assets grow, as with many small to mid-sized retirement plans.
You have flexibility in how you cover your plan costs—including a recordkeeping credit depending on the share class selected.




Too busy?
 As a business owner, you're pressed for time and focused on many aspects of business. With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access, you can rely on high-quality recordkeeping and administration to ease your administrative burden and help your employees stay on track for retirement.

Investment Management
Insights, Strategies and Solutions
Our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional, alternative and non-financial assets.  We can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs.






Portfolio Consulting
A collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager
Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.
4 Brokerage services are provided by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a registered broker-dealer, Member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation.
Certain U.S. Trust associates are registered representatives with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S") and may assist you with investment products and services provided through MLPF&S and other nonbank investment affiliates. MLPF&S is a registered broker-dealer, member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BofA Corp."). U.S. Trust operates through Bank of America, N.A., and other subsidiaries of BofA Corp.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
