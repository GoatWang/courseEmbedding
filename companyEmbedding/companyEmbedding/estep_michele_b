Syracuse University

                  Syracuse University, commonly referred to as Syracuse, 'Cuse, or SU, is a private research university located in Syracuse, New York. The institution's roots can be traced to the Genesee Wesleyan Seminary (later becoming Genesee College), founded by the Methodist Episcopal Church in Lima, New York, in 1831. Following several years of debate over relocating the college to Syracuse, the university was established in 1870, independent of the college. Since 1920, the university has identified itself as nonsectarian, although it maintains a relationship with The United Methodist Church.

The campus is located in the University Hill neighborhood of Syracuse, east and southeast of downtown, on one of the larger hills. Its large campus features an eclectic mix of buildings, ranging from nineteenth-century Romanesque Revival structures to contemporary buildings. SU is organized into 13 schools and colleges, with nationally recognized programs in information studies and library science, architecture, communications, business administration, sport management, public administration, engineering and the College of Arts and Sciences.

Syracuse University athletic teams, known as the Orange, participate in 20 intercollegiate sports. SU is a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference for all NCAA Division I athletics, except for women's ice hockey, and the rowing team. SU is also a member of the Eastern College Athletic Conference.

Equinox, Inc.

                    History and Vision Equinox is a human service organization dedicated to helping children, adults and families who are in need to find the resources within themselves and within their communities to make their lives whole again. Equinox serves homeless youth, victims of domestic violence and abuse, troubled families, those in the throes of drug dependencies and many others who are in distress or who have lost their way. Equinox is proud of the many lives it has touched and its long history of serving those who cannot be reached or who are turned away by other service agencies. Equinox was founded in 1969 as a volunteer organization of community and religious leaders, students, social work and medical professionals. Its first program, a 24 hour crisis intervention center and hotline, was established to provide help to young people in crisis who had become alienated from family, community and traditional social services. Equinox served as a bridge between those in need and the resources to meet those needs. Equinox has since grown to meet the new challenges that threaten the integrity and vitality of our families and communities. It does not shy away from the most difficult problems facing society today. Equinox works with the rich diversity of people within the community to identify needs and participate in finding solutions. Equinox today continues its mission of service through its residential programs, counseling, advocacy, outreach, prevention services and Thanksgiving Day Community Dinner. Throughout the years, Equinox has kept the faith with the guiding principle that each person, if given the proper tools and a nurturing environment, has the unique capacity to heal, to grow, and to connect with the larger social fabric of which we are all a part. Equinox works to provide that environment where individuals can take increased control over their lives, regain personal dignity, realize special gifts and more fully participate and share in the community. Equinox as
