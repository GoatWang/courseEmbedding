Grew income from operations by approximately 19% to $7.3 million for the second quarter 2017 and 21% to $14.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017   Achieved record quarterly Net Operating Income ("NOI") of $14.0 million in the second quarter 2017   Improved net loss by 54% to $1.6 million or $0.04 per share for the second quarter 2017 and 57% to $2.9 million or $.08 per share for the six months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to the same periods of 2016.

"During the second quarter, we continued to grow our portfolio, completing the acquisition of 107 Columbia Heights in Brooklyn for $87.5 million, and announcing our pending purchase of 10 West 65 th Street for $79 million, which could close later this year. Upon completion of planned capital improvements, we believe these properties will contribute meaningfully to our cash flow growth over time.

08/03/2015  by OctaStaff 
			in Private Financing News 












Share with your friendsYour NameYour EmailRecipient EmailEnter a MessageI read this article and found it very interesting, thought it might be interesting for you. The article is called Clipper Realty  $144.00 million  Fundraising. David Bistricer Submitted Aug 3  SEC Form and is was published by Octafinance.com at http://www.octafinance.com/clipper-realty-144-00-million-fundraising-david-bistricer-submitted-aug-3-sec-form/128759/.CaptchaSubmit
Clipper Realty  Financing
Clipper Realty Inc., Corporation just  had published form D  for $144.00 million equity financing. This is a new filing. Clipper Realty  was able to  sell $15.34 million so far. That is 10.65% of the  fundraising offer. The total  fundraising amount was $144.00 million.  The financing document was filed on 2015-08-03. The reason for the financing was: The remainder of the amount to be sold, $128,657,511, was sold to qualified institutional investors pursuant to Rule 144A and to foreign investors pursuant to Regulation S..  The fundraising still has about $128.66 million more and is not closed yet. We have to wait more to see if the offering will be fully taken.
 Clipper Realty  is based in New York. The  filler’s business is REITS and Finance. The  D form was  filed by David Bistricer Co-Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  The company was incorporated in 2015. The filler’s address is: 4611 12Th Avenue, Suite 1L, Brooklyn, Ny, New York, 11219.  David Bistricer is the related person in the form and it has address: 4611 12Th Avenue, Suite 1L, Brooklyn, Ny, New York, 11219. Link to Clipper Realty  Filing: 000164909615000001.
Analysis of Clipper Realty  Offering
On average,  companies in the REITS and Finance sector, sell 56.00% of the total offering  size. Clipper Realty  sold 10.65% of the offering.  The financing is still open. The average  investment floor size for companies in the REITS and Finance industry is $988,700. The total amount raised is 1,451.78% bigger than the average for companies in the REITS and Finance sector. The minimum investment for this  financing  was set at $0. If you know more about the reasons for the  fundraising, please comment below.
What is Form D? What It Is Used For
Form D disclosures could be used to track and understand better your competitors. The information in Form D is usually highly confidential for ventures and startups and they don’t like revealing it. This is because it reveals amount raised or planned to be raised as well as reasons for the financing. This could help competitors. Entrepreneurs usually want to keep their financing a ‘secret’ so they can stay in stealth mode for longer.
Why Fundraising Reporting Is Good For Clipper Realty  Also
The Form D signed by David Bistricer might help Clipper Realty Inc.’s sector. First, it helps potential customers feel more safe to deal with a firm that is well financed. The odds are higher that it will stay in the business. Second, this could attract other investors such as venture-capital firms, funds and angels. Third, positive PR effects could even bring leasing firms and venture lenders.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.
