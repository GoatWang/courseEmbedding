On November 16, 2015, TCP entered into a Sales Plan (the 10b5-1 Plan) with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. (Cantor) that is intended to comply with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c) promulgated under the Act. Pursuant to the 10b5-1 Plan, TCP has directed Cantor to seek to dispose of up to 200,000 shares of Common Stock held by TCP between December 17, 2015 and August 1, 2016. Transactions under the 10b5-1 Plan are subject to certain price restrictions and TCP may terminate the 10b5-1 Plan at any time. See Item 6.C. below.
 
As discussed in this Schedule 13D, as of December 23, 2015, the Reporting Persons own approximately 9.3% of the Companys outstanding Common Stock and can influence certain of the Companys affairs, including (i) the election of directors who in turn appoint management, (ii) any action requiring the approval of the holders of Common Stock, including adoption of amendments to the Companys corporate charter, and (iii) approval of a merger or sale of all or substantially all assets. The Reporting Persons can also influence certain decisions affecting the Companys capital structure.  As discussed in Item 6, the Reporting Persons have certain rights to nominate a director and to require the Company to limit the size of the Board, which rights are dependent on the Reporting Persons ownership of a certain aggregate percentage of Common Stock.  Accordingly, the disposition of the Reporting Persons holdings in the Company may result in changes to the size and/or composition of the Companys Board of Directors.
 
The Reporting Persons acquired their shares of Common Stock for investment purposes and in the ordinary course of business.  All of the Reporting Persons may dispose of securities of the Company at any time and from time to time in the open market, through dispositions in kind to parties holding an ownership interest in TCP, TCM, TA and/or TCP 2, or otherwise.  In addition, the Reporting Persons may obtain securities of the Company through open market purchases, transfers from other Reporting Persons or otherwise.
 
Although the foregoing represents the range of activities presently contemplated by the Reporting Persons with respect to the Company, it should be noted that the possible activities of the Reporting Persons are subject to change at any time.  Accordingly, the Reporting Persons reserve the right to change their plans or intentions and to take any and all actions that they may deem to be in their best interests.
 
Except as set forth in the Schedule 13D, the Reporting Persons do not have any current intention, plan or proposal with respect to: (a) the acquisition by any person of additional securities of the Company, or the disposition of securities of the Company; (b) an extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, reorganization or liquidation, involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries; (c) a sale or transfer of a material amount of assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries; (d) any change in the present Board of Directors or management of the Company, including any plans or proposals to change the number or term of directors or to fill any existing vacancies on the Board; (e) any material change in the present capitalization or dividend policy of the Company; (f) any other material change in the Companys business or corporate structure; (g) changes in the Companys charter, bylaws or instruments corresponding thereto or other actions

which may impede the acquisition of control of the Company by any person; (h) causing a class of securities of the Company to be delisted from a national securities exchange, if any, or cease to be authorized to be quoted in an inter-dealer quotation system of a registered national securities association; (i) a class of equity securities of the Company becoming eligible for termination of registration pursuant to Section 12(g)(4) of the Securities Act, or (j) any action similar to any of those enumerated in items (a) through (i) above.

Item 6.                         Contracts, Arrangements, Understandings or Relationships with Respect to Securities of the Issuer
 
A. Initial Securities Purchase Agreement
 
On April 10, 2007, TCP, Tontine Capital Overseas Master Fund, L.P., a Cayman Islands limited partnership (TMF), and 
 
11





 
the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the Initial Securities Purchase Agreement) which, among other things, provided for the purchase by TCP and TMF of shares of Common Stock and Senior Subordinated Promissory Notes of the Company.  The closing of the transactions contemplated by the Initial Securities Purchase Agreement occurred on May 18, 2007.  Under the Initial Securities Purchase Agreement, so long as the Reporting Persons (i) hold between 7.5% and 14.9% of the Common Stock then outstanding, they have the right to appoint one nominee to the Companys Board of Directors and (ii) hold at least 15.0% of the Common Stock then outstanding, they have the right to appoint two nominees to the Companys Board of Directors.  On July 21, 2008, an affiliate of the Reporting Persons was appointed to the Companys Board of Directors. Currently, the Reporting Persons do not have the right to appoint a second nominee of the Reporting Persons to the Companys Board of Directors since the Reporting Persons ownership of the Companys outstanding Common Stock is less than 15.0%. Under the Initial Securities Purchase Agreement, the Company agreed to limit, by the date of the Companys 2008 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the number of directors serving on its Board to no more than nine directors for so long as the Reporting Persons have the right to appoint a director to the Companys Board.  Pursuant to a letter agreement dated April 12, 2013, TCP and TMF agreed to waive the Companys obligation to limit the size of its Board of Directors in connection with the increase of its Board of Directors to 10 persons in order to allow the appointment of Michael A. Kitson as a director of the Company on March 19, 2013.  In addition, pursuant to the Initial Securities Purchase Agreement, the Company approved the acquisition by the Reporting Persons of up to 40% of its outstanding Common Stock, on a fully diluted basis, such that the Reporting Persons would not be subject to certain restrictions set forth in the Indiana Business Corporation Law (the IBCL).  The Company also agreed that it would not revoke such approval and that it will use its best efforts to ensure that any future acquisitions by TCP and TMF (up to 40% of the outstanding Common Stock on a fully diluted basis) would not be subject to anti-takeover provisions included in any of the Companys organizational documents or the laws and regulations of any governmental authority.  The Initial Securities Purchase Agreement also contained standard representations and warranties that survived until the earlier of (i) three years following the closing date of the transactions contemplated by the Initial Securities Purchase Agreement and (ii) the applicable statute of limitations with respect to each representation and warranty.
 
B. Second Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement; RRA Amendment
 
On December 11, 2008, TCP, TMF, the Company and the holders of warrants (the Original Warrant Holders) issued pursuant to a certain Warrant Agreement, dated December 11, 2008, among the Company and the Original Warrant Holders, entered into that certain Second Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement (the December 2008 Registration Rights Agreement), which restated the Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement entered into by TCP, TMF and the Company on May 18, 2007.  The Original Warrant Holders, all of whom were lenders under a Credit Agreement dated May 18, 2007, among the Company, the lenders party thereto and JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the Previous Credit Facility), acquired their warrants in connection with the execution of a Second Amendment and Waiver to the Previous Credit Facility on December 11, 2008.  Pursuant to the December 2008 Registration Rights Agreement, the Company filed a registration statement on Form S-3 registering the resale of 5,174,963 shares of Common Stock held by the Reporting Persons (the Tontine Registration Statement).  The Tontine Registration Statement was declared effective on December 30, 2008.  Pursuant to the December 2008 Registration Rights Agreement, the Company filed a registration statement on Form S-3 registering the resale of 424,049 shares of Common Stock issuable to the Original Warrant Holders upon the exercise of their warrants (the Lender Registration Statement).  The Lender Registration Statement was declared effective on July 29, 2009.  On March 31, 2011, the Company, TCP, TMF, TCP 2 and Northcreek Mezzanine Fund I, L.P. (Northcreek) entered into an Amendment (the RRA Amendment) to the December 2008 Registration Rights Agreement primarily to include TCP 2 and Northcreek as parties to the December 2008 Registration Rights Agreement and to provide registration rights with respect to the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants acquired by TCP 2 and Northcreek, respectively, as well as other warrants acquired by TCP 2 and Northcreek in the future, in connection with a certain Secured Senior Subordinated Note and Warrant Purchase Agreement dated March 31, 2011 (the Purchase Agreement).  Pursuant to the RRA Amendment, the Company was obligated, among other things, to file a shelf registration statement prior to June 30, 2011 to register the resale of the shares of Common Stock underlying the warrants acquired by TCP 2 and Northcreek, respectively, on March 31, 2011 under the Purchase Agreement, and to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the registration statement to be declared effective no later than 60 days after filing.  To satisfy this obligation, on June 8, 2011, the Company filed a registration statement on Form S-3, which was declared effective on June 23, 2011.  Also as required by the RRA Amendment, on May 11, 2011, the Company filed a prospectus supplement to the Tontine Registration Statement to cover the resale of all Common Stock held by TCP 2.  In addition, pursuant to the December 2008 Registration Rights Agreement, as amended by the RRA Amendment, the Company granted to TCP, TMF, TCP 2, Northcreek and the Original Warrant Holders (and their respective qualifying transferees) certain demand and piggyback registration rights in connection with shares of Common Stock held by them or acquired in the future.  The registration rights granted under the December 2008 Registration Rights Agreement, as amended by the RRA Amendment, terminate with respect to TCP, 
 
12





 
TMF, TCP 2, Northcreek and the Original Warrant Holders (and any of their respective qualifying transferees) when such party no longer holds any Registrable Securities (as defined in the December 2008 Registration Rights Agreement).  With the exception of certain expenses, such as underwriting discounts and commissions, the Company has agreed to pay all expenses incident to its performance of or compliance with the December 2008 Registration Rights Agreement, including the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel retained by the holders of Registrable Securities requested to be included in a registration statement.
 
C. 10b5-1 Plan
 
On November 16, 2015, TCP entered into the 10b5-1 Plan with Cantor. Pursuant to the 10b5-1 Plan, Cantor agreed to seek to sell up to 200,000 shares of Common Stock on TCPs behalf between December 17, 2015 and August 1, 2016.  Transactions under the 10b5-1 Plan are subject to certain price restrictions and TCP may terminate the 10b5-1 Plan at any time.
 
The foregoing summaries of the Initial Securities Purchase Agreement, the December 2008 Registration Rights Agreement, the RRA Amendment and the 10b5-1 Plan do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to Exhibits 99.1 through 99.4, which are incorporated by reference herein.
 
Except as described in the Schedule 13D, the Reporting Persons do not have any contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships (legal or otherwise) with any person with respect to any securities of the Company, including but not limited to the transfer or voting of any of the securities, finders fees, joint ventures, loan or option arrangements, puts or calls, guarantees of profits, division of profits or losses, or the giving or withholding of proxies.
