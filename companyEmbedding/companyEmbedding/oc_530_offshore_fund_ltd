Flowtech Fluidpower (FLO)



Flowtech Fluidpower

Acquisition of Orange County Ltd, County Durham

RNS Number : 5215K Flowtech Fluidpower PLC 10 July 2017  





NEWS RELEASE
Issued on behalf of Flowtech Fluidpower PLC
Immediate Release (07.00hrs)
 







 
The information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014.  Upon the publication of this announcement via the Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.
 
 
FLOWTECH FLUIDPOWER PLC
("Flowtech", the "Group" or "Company")
 
Acquisition of Orange County Limited
 
 
London: Monday, 10 July 2017:  AIM listed specialist technical fluid power products supplier Flowtech Fluidpower plc (LSE: symbol FLO), is pleased to announce the further strengthening of its Process division through acquisition of Orange County Limited ("OCL" or the "Acquisition"). 
ACQUISITION OF ORANGE COUNTY
On Friday, 7 July 2017, Flowtech completed the acquisition of the business and assets of OCL, an exclusive UK supplier and distributor of high-quality products for the storage and movement of fuels, liquids and gases. 
OCL was founded in 1994 and holds a market leading position in the UK.  The business employs in total 18 people at its site in Spennymoor, County Durham.  OCL will operate as an independent sister company within the Flowtech Group and will continue to be managed by the current executive management team who have been in place for many years, reporting directly to Flowtech's CEO, Sean Fennon. 
The Acquisition provides a further complementary business to the Group and establishes relationships with world-leading manufacturers of pipes, valves, gauges and leak detection equipment, including Brugg Pipesystems in Germany and Ebsray Pumps in Australia.  It is focused on technical sales, provided by experienced sales engineers to a wide range of end users from fuel supply systems for the automotive industry to cooling systems on the London Underground, as well as large Data Centres across the UK.
For the year ended 31 December 2016, OCL achieved sales of £4.1 million producing EBIT of £1.0 million.  Net assets excluding net cash at the same date were £0.8 million.  As well as some immediate back office savings, the Group expects to deliver synergy opportunities over the medium term by exploiting the OCL offer across the Group's wider customer base, as well as enhancing internal supply arrangements.  
The Acquisition is being funded from Flowtech's own resources and comprises £1.5m on completion with additional payments expected to be c£2.1m subject to an earn-out over the 24-month period to 30 June 2019.  The maximum consideration payable is £9.0m.  In addition, the Group will pay a sum of £1.7m equivalent to the net cash resources of OCL at the same date.  With adjustments to the salary base for the management team post acquisition and current exchange rates reducing margins from previous highs, the Board expects OCL to contribute annual EBIT of c£0.6m in the short to medium term.
Sean Fennon, CEO Flowtech Fluidpower plc commented:
"OCL is the third acquisition we have made this year and we are delighted to expand our knowledge base, add complementary technical products and skilled engineers to the Group's already robust customer offering.  We take this opportunity to welcome all new colleagues to the Group and see this momentum as an exciting opportunity for everyone.  We remain committed to our strategic objective of building a focused Fluid Power Group that serves a wide number of industry sectors."

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
