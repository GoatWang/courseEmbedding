                The 4630-36 Folding Seeder from Brillion seeds 36' of grass and alfalfa with one pass.  Brillion Sure Stand Seeders have set the bar for exceptional grass and alfalfa seeding for well over fifty years.  As production agriculture has grown, so has the demand for a larger capacity Sure Stand Seeder - and Brillion Farm Equipment has stepped up to meet the challenge.  The Sure Stand seeding concept has stayed the same; however, 36’ can now be seeded with each pass across the field!
                

                    Product Code: B4630
                








DETAILS
FACTSHEETWATCHA VIDEO





High Capacity 

Producers will have peace of mind that even though the seeding capacity has gone up, the 4630-36 Folding Seeder will still afford the same industry leading performance the Brillion Sure Stand Seeder is famous for.  The 4630-36 Folding Seeder is a combination of the proven Landoll front folding grain drill hitch and the iconic Brillion 12’ Sure Stand Seeder.  This provides a state of the art machine with a quick transition from road transport of 13' 6" to a full seeding width in a matter of minutes, right from the comfort of the tractor cab. 

Three Into One

One of the key features of the 4630-36 Folding Seeder is the ability of the main frame to allow each of the three seeders to operate completely independently of each other.  That equates to the ability to seed 36’ wide with the convenience and field hugging features of a 12’ machine.  The individual, frame mounted three-point hitches raise and lower the seeders without changing the position of the main frame.  This allows the operator to raise the seeders at the end of the field for effortless turning.

Customized to Fit Your Needs

The design of the 4630-36 Folding Seeder allows the machine to be customized with a choice of electric clutch controlled 12’ seeders.  There are seeder models available for agriculture applications and turf use, with some models adaptable to both capacities with minor modifications.  The seed box capacity will vary with the model of seeders chosen.  A variety of options and accessories are available to further customize or enhance the performance of the 4630-36 Folding Seeder.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
