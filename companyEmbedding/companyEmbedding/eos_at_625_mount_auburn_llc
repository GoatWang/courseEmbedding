Large incisions increase trauma to a patient’s condition, lengthen the recovery period, and increase the probability of a second subsequent surgery to remove excess scar tissue. Minimally-invasive surgery, however, often blocks the surgeon from easy access, limiting both the ability to see directly what is going on and hampering the use of instruments. Computer-enhanced image guidance has made some of these surgeries feasible, and the advent of robot-assisted surgery is beginning to overcome many of the instrument issues.General PractitionersStroke RehabilitationWe won a $1.5m Phase-II Grant from the National Institutes of Health to create grasping capabilities for BURT and to explore possible clinical use of BURT for stroke rehabilitation.Physical TherapistsNeuro RehabilitationThe number of indications for this device is expected to rise as further research on the benefits of robotic neurorehabilitation therapy unfolds. For example, both the American Heart Association and the VA/DoD have recently endorsed upper-extremity robot-mediated rehabilitation therapy for stroke care.Physical TherapyVirtualRehab, the physical therapy videogame platform developed by the company Virtualware, leverages this large 3D workspace with their deep clear idea of incorporating the most cutting-edge technology into our physical rehabilitation videogame platform.Send to PhoneMount Auburn Rheumatology Associates625 Mount Auburn St Ste 2, Cambridge, MA 02138(617) 576-1102Send this business listing as a text message to a mobile phone.I agree to the Terms and ConditionsCancelSendYour text message was sent.To opt out at anytime, send the word STOP to YP411.To get a help message, send the word HELP to YP411.There was an error sending your text.Please try again.E-MailMount Auburn Rheumatology Associates625 Mount Auburn St Ste 2, Cambridge, MA 02138(617) 576-1102Send this business details to yourself or up to 5 friends.Up to 5 email addresses, separate addresses with a commaSend Yourself a CopyCancelSend
