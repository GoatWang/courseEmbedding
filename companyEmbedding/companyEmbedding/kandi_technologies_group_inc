Three of Kandi JV's EV Models Eligible for 110% of Central Government Subsidy


JINHUA, China, July  14, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kandi Technologies Group, Inc. (the "Company" or "Kandi") (NASDAQ:KNDI) today announced that the Geely Global Hawk electric vehicle ("EV") model SMA7001BEV25 (the Kandi Model K17A), developed by Kandi Electric Vehicles Group Co., Ltd. (the "JV Company", a 50/50 joint venture between Kandi and Zhejiang Geely Holding Group), has been included as a new recommended model vehicle in the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of the People's Republic of China's (the "MIIT") Directory of Recommended Models for Energy Saving and New Energy Vehicle Demonstration and Promotion (the "Sixth Annual Directory of New Energy Vehicles") in the MIIT's third public announcement of 2017.
According to the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Science and Technology, the MIIT, and the National Development and Reform Commission's (the "Four Ministries") Notice of Financial Subsidy Policy Adjustment for Recommended Models for Energy Saving and New Energy Vehicle Demonstration and Promotion, new energy passenger vehicles are required to incorporate enhanced battery power systems with increased energy density quality of higher than 120wh/kg in order to receive 110% of the central government subsidy for such vehicles. Three of the JV Company's EV models - SMA7000BEV05(K12), SMA7000EV06(K10D), and SMA7001BEV25(K17A) - have successfully achieved this standard after receiving technology upgrades. As a result, all three of these models are eligible to receive a 110% subsidy from the central government.
Mr. Hu Xiaoming, Chairman of Kandi commented, "Through a transformation in our technology, Kandi's battery systems have obtained much higher quality energy intensities. Eligibility to receive 110% of the central government subsidy for our three EV models mentioned above will be a competitive advantage for us and a significant driver of growth going forward. We believe the approval of these three models will contribute to the Company's continued development in the second half of 2017."

History[edit]
In July 2012 Kandi Technologies signed a strategic cooperation agreement with the city of Hangzhou to supply 20,000 electric vehicles for the city's pilot electric vehicle leasing program.[2]
In February 2013, Kandi and Shanghai Maple announced the establishment of a 50:50 electric vehicle joint venture, Zhejiang Kandi Electric Vehicles Investment, with an initial registered capital of 1 billion yuan (US$160 million).[3] The joint venture is planned to focus on the research and development, production, marketing and sale of electric vehicles in the Chinese mainland.[3] The joint venture agreement was signed on 22 March 2013.[4] Mr. Shufu Li, Chairman of Geely Auto will be appointed to be the first Chairman of the JV Company and Mr. Xiaoming Hu, Chairman & CEO of Kandi will be appointed to be first General Manager.[5]
The Kandi public EV CarShare concept is based on Hangzhou’s bikeshare, the largest bikeshare in the world and the first of its kind in China. The bikeshare has since spread from Hangzhou to 19 Chinese cities including Shanghai and Beijing.
Kandi’s plan is to build with both Government and “outside” support, 750 of these garages in just the City of Hangzhou over the next four years through a 50-50 joint venture with Geely Automotive, China’s largest passenger automaker, which would require some 100,000 Kandi electric vehicles to stock them. This model is slated to spread to other cities and regions like Shanghai, Shandong, and Hainan. Two garages were just completed in Hangzhou over the past two months and another 18 are currently under construction as of two weeks ago.
As of 2017, vertical garages have halted in favor of horizontal street parking type kiosks.
Kandi EV[edit]




The Geely Panda based Kandi EV.


The Kandi EV is a city electric car with a range of 120 km (75 mi), and a top speed of 80 km/h (50 mph).[6]
Kandi EV CarShare[edit]
The Kandi EV CarShare is a carsharing program in the city of Hangzhou. The system operates only with Kandi EV all-electric cars, which are available to customers in automated garages that run like vending machines. The rental price is US$3.25 per hour. Leasing is available from US$130 to US$160 per month, which includes insurance, maintenance, and the electric power through swapping batteries at the program garages. Then, Kandi recharges the batteries at its convenience. The leasing option, called "Long Lease," is available from 1 to 3 year contracts.[6]
Kandi Technologies plans on making 100,000 cars available to the residents of Hangzhou over the two years. It’s also planning to expand into 2-3 other Chinese cities during 2014.[6]
Sales[edit]
A total of 1,215 Kandi EVs were sold in China during the first quarter of 2014, and an additional 4,114 during the second quarter, representing a growth of 238%, and total sales of 5,329 units during first half of 2014. The Kandi EV used for the Kandi EV CarShare and also available for leasing.[7] Kandi EV city car, had a price tag of 41,517 yaun ($6,317) in 2015. The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) reported the sale of 16,376 Kandi EVs in 2015. The government has set expectations high for the growth of the electric car market. The plan is to have five million electric and hybrid vehicles on the roads in China by 2020. 2015 sales revenue relies heavily on government subsidies. Chinese government choose not to issue subsidies to Kandi in 2015.
Management[edit]
Visionary CEO Hu founded Kandi and donated his numerous patents to the company.

History[edit]
In July 2012 Kandi Technologies signed a strategic cooperation agreement with the city of Hangzhou to supply 20,000 electric vehicles for the city's pilot electric vehicle leasing program.[2]
In February 2013, Kandi and Shanghai Maple announced the establishment of a 50:50 electric vehicle joint venture, Zhejiang Kandi Electric Vehicles Investment, with an initial registered capital of 1 billion yuan (US$160 million).[3] The joint venture is planned to focus on the research and development, production, marketing and sale of electric vehicles in the Chinese mainland.[3] The joint venture agreement was signed on 22 March 2013.[4] Mr. Shufu Li, Chairman of Geely Auto will be appointed to be the first Chairman of the JV Company and Mr. Xiaoming Hu, Chairman & CEO of Kandi will be appointed to be first General Manager.[5]
The Kandi public EV CarShare concept is based on Hangzhou’s bikeshare, the largest bikeshare in the world and the first of its kind in China. The bikeshare has since spread from Hangzhou to 19 Chinese cities including Shanghai and Beijing.
Kandi’s plan is to build with both Government and “outside” support, 750 of these garages in just the City of Hangzhou over the next four years through a 50-50 joint venture with Geely Automotive, China’s largest passenger automaker, which would require some 100,000 Kandi electric vehicles to stock them. This model is slated to spread to other cities and regions like Shanghai, Shandong, and Hainan. Two garages were just completed in Hangzhou over the past two months and another 18 are currently under construction as of two weeks ago.
As of 2017, vertical garages have halted in favor of horizontal street parking type kiosks.
Kandi EV[edit]




The Geely Panda based Kandi EV.


The Kandi EV is a city electric car with a range of 120 km (75 mi), and a top speed of 80 km/h (50 mph).[6]
Kandi EV CarShare[edit]
The Kandi EV CarShare is a carsharing program in the city of Hangzhou. The system operates only with Kandi EV all-electric cars, which are available to customers in automated garages that run like vending machines. The rental price is US$3.25 per hour. Leasing is available from US$130 to US$160 per month, which includes insurance, maintenance, and the electric power through swapping batteries at the program garages. Then, Kandi recharges the batteries at its convenience. The leasing option, called "Long Lease," is available from 1 to 3 year contracts.[6]
Kandi Technologies plans on making 100,000 cars available to the residents of Hangzhou over the two years. It’s also planning to expand into 2-3 other Chinese cities during 2014.[6]
Sales[edit]
A total of 1,215 Kandi EVs were sold in China during the first quarter of 2014, and an additional 4,114 during the second quarter, representing a growth of 238%, and total sales of 5,329 units during first half of 2014. The Kandi EV used for the Kandi EV CarShare and also available for leasing.[7] Kandi EV city car, had a price tag of 41,517 yaun ($6,317) in 2015. The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) reported the sale of 16,376 Kandi EVs in 2015. The government has set expectations high for the growth of the electric car market. The plan is to have five million electric and hybrid vehicles on the roads in China by 2020. 2015 sales revenue relies heavily on government subsidies. Chinese government choose not to issue subsidies to Kandi in 2015.
Management[edit]
Visionary CEO Hu founded Kandi and donated his numerous patents to the company.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

At present, it is among the leading producers of go-karts in the world, with an estimated 15% share of China's global export market and a goal of doubling this share, in large part by becoming the leading producer of this increasingly popular recreational product in China.

Kandi Technologies Group, Inc. Warns 2016 Sales Could Fall Short

Kandi Technologies Group (NASDAQ:KNDI) saw its second-quarter sales jump after it received certain tax exemption approvals for its electronic vehicles by the Chinese government, but subsidy delays could cause auto parts manufacturer to miss its full-year targets.

Data source: Kandi Technologies Q2 2016 earnings press release.
What happened with Kandi Technologies this quarter?
Total revenue rose 15.1% year over year to $55.2 million, with electric vehicle (EV) parts sales up 15.4% to $53.8 million.
Kandi Electric Vehicles Group Co. -- a joint venture in which Kandi Technologies Group has a 50% stake -- sold 7,200 EV products in the second quarter, a 61.9% increase compared to the year-ago period.
"After more than three months of waiting, the JV Company finally obtained the approval for a purchase tax exemption for its 'Global Hawk' EV products and had a positive sales performance in May and June," said Chairman and CEO Xiaoming Hu in a press release.
Kandi's gross margin increased to 15.3% from 13.3% in Q2 2015. Operating margin, however, fell to negative 4.3% from 3.1% in the prior year quarter, as total operating expenses ballooned 140% to $10.8 million, with most of the increase coming from higher stock compensation expense.
All told, net income declined to $2.8 million from $5.4 million in the second quarter of 2015, and earnings per share fell 50% to $0.06.
"We have performed very well financially during the second quarter of 2016," added CFO Cheng Wang. "Our margin improved compared to the same quarter last year, and our non-GAAP net income reached $10.5 million, a 114.8% increase compared to $4.9 million in the same period of 2015."





Looking forward 
Hu said during a conference call with analysts that delays in government subsidies could make it difficult for Kandi to hit its full-year guidance for sales of at least 35,000 electronic vehicle products in 2016:

We had thought that JV Company would receive the national government subsidy at the end of the second quarter, but this subsidy payment has been delayed. The delay in receiving central government subsidy caused a big challenge for JV Company to achieve the whole year product and sales plan, which may also impact Kandi EV parts sales in the year of 2016.

Still, Hu remains optimistic regarding the future of China's electronic vehicle market.
"Nevertheless, we are still very confident in EV market growth in China," said Hu.

History[edit]
In July 2012 Kandi Technologies signed a strategic cooperation agreement with the city of Hangzhou to supply 20,000 electric vehicles for the city's pilot electric vehicle leasing program.[2]
In February 2013, Kandi and Shanghai Maple announced the establishment of a 50:50 electric vehicle joint venture, Zhejiang Kandi Electric Vehicles Investment, with an initial registered capital of 1 billion yuan (US$160 million).[3] The joint venture is planned to focus on the research and development, production, marketing and sale of electric vehicles in the Chinese mainland.[3] The joint venture agreement was signed on 22 March 2013.[4] Mr. Shufu Li, Chairman of Geely Auto will be appointed to be the first Chairman of the JV Company and Mr. Xiaoming Hu, Chairman & CEO of Kandi will be appointed to be first General Manager.[5]
The Kandi public EV CarShare concept is based on Hangzhou’s bikeshare, the largest bikeshare in the world and the first of its kind in China. The bikeshare has since spread from Hangzhou to 19 Chinese cities including Shanghai and Beijing.
Kandi’s plan is to build with both Government and “outside” support, 750 of these garages in just the City of Hangzhou over the next four years through a 50-50 joint venture with Geely Automotive, China’s largest passenger automaker, which would require some 100,000 Kandi electric vehicles to stock them. This model is slated to spread to other cities and regions like Shanghai, Shandong, and Hainan. Two garages were just completed in Hangzhou over the past two months and another 18 are currently under construction as of two weeks ago.
As of 2017, vertical garages have halted in favor of horizontal street parking type kiosks.
Kandi EV[edit]




The Geely Panda based Kandi EV.


The Kandi EV is a city electric car with a range of 120 km (75 mi), and a top speed of 80 km/h (50 mph).[6]
Kandi EV CarShare[edit]
The Kandi EV CarShare is a carsharing program in the city of Hangzhou. The system operates only with Kandi EV all-electric cars, which are available to customers in automated garages that run like vending machines. The rental price is US$3.25 per hour. Leasing is available from US$130 to US$160 per month, which includes insurance, maintenance, and the electric power through swapping batteries at the program garages. Then, Kandi recharges the batteries at its convenience. The leasing option, called "Long Lease," is available from 1 to 3 year contracts.[6]
Kandi Technologies plans on making 100,000 cars available to the residents of Hangzhou over the two years. It’s also planning to expand into 2-3 other Chinese cities during 2014.[6]
Sales[edit]
A total of 1,215 Kandi EVs were sold in China during the first quarter of 2014, and an additional 4,114 during the second quarter, representing a growth of 238%, and total sales of 5,329 units during first half of 2014. The Kandi EV used for the Kandi EV CarShare and also available for leasing.[7] Kandi EV city car, had a price tag of 41,517 yaun ($6,317) in 2015. The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) reported the sale of 16,376 Kandi EVs in 2015. The government has set expectations high for the growth of the electric car market. The plan is to have five million electric and hybrid vehicles on the roads in China by 2020. 2015 sales revenue relies heavily on government subsidies. Chinese government choose not to issue subsidies to Kandi in 2015.
Management[edit]
Visionary CEO Hu founded Kandi and donated his numerous patents to the company.

History[edit]
In July 2012 Kandi Technologies signed a strategic cooperation agreement with the city of Hangzhou to supply 20,000 electric vehicles for the city's pilot electric vehicle leasing program.[2]
In February 2013, Kandi and Shanghai Maple announced the establishment of a 50:50 electric vehicle joint venture, Zhejiang Kandi Electric Vehicles Investment, with an initial registered capital of 1 billion yuan (US$160 million).[3] The joint venture is planned to focus on the research and development, production, marketing and sale of electric vehicles in the Chinese mainland.[3] The joint venture agreement was signed on 22 March 2013.[4] Mr. Shufu Li, Chairman of Geely Auto will be appointed to be the first Chairman of the JV Company and Mr. Xiaoming Hu, Chairman & CEO of Kandi will be appointed to be first General Manager.[5]
The Kandi public EV CarShare concept is based on Hangzhou’s bikeshare, the largest bikeshare in the world and the first of its kind in China. The bikeshare has since spread from Hangzhou to 19 Chinese cities including Shanghai and Beijing.
Kandi’s plan is to build with both Government and “outside” support, 750 of these garages in just the City of Hangzhou over the next four years through a 50-50 joint venture with Geely Automotive, China’s largest passenger automaker, which would require some 100,000 Kandi electric vehicles to stock them. This model is slated to spread to other cities and regions like Shanghai, Shandong, and Hainan. Two garages were just completed in Hangzhou over the past two months and another 18 are currently under construction as of two weeks ago.
As of 2017, vertical garages have halted in favor of horizontal street parking type kiosks.
Kandi EV[edit]




The Geely Panda based Kandi EV.


The Kandi EV is a city electric car with a range of 120 km (75 mi), and a top speed of 80 km/h (50 mph).[6]
Kandi EV CarShare[edit]
The Kandi EV CarShare is a carsharing program in the city of Hangzhou. The system operates only with Kandi EV all-electric cars, which are available to customers in automated garages that run like vending machines. The rental price is US$3.25 per hour. Leasing is available from US$130 to US$160 per month, which includes insurance, maintenance, and the electric power through swapping batteries at the program garages. Then, Kandi recharges the batteries at its convenience. The leasing option, called "Long Lease," is available from 1 to 3 year contracts.[6]
Kandi Technologies plans on making 100,000 cars available to the residents of Hangzhou over the two years. It’s also planning to expand into 2-3 other Chinese cities during 2014.[6]
Sales[edit]
A total of 1,215 Kandi EVs were sold in China during the first quarter of 2014, and an additional 4,114 during the second quarter, representing a growth of 238%, and total sales of 5,329 units during first half of 2014. The Kandi EV used for the Kandi EV CarShare and also available for leasing.[7] Kandi EV city car, had a price tag of 41,517 yaun ($6,317) in 2015. The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) reported the sale of 16,376 Kandi EVs in 2015. The government has set expectations high for the growth of the electric car market. The plan is to have five million electric and hybrid vehicles on the roads in China by 2020. 2015 sales revenue relies heavily on government subsidies. Chinese government choose not to issue subsidies to Kandi in 2015.
Management[edit]
Visionary CEO Hu founded Kandi and donated his numerous patents to the company.
