      Division. In 2013, he became responsible for Gerresheimer AG’s Primary 
      Packaging Glass Division. Mr. Röhrhoff started his career in the finance 
      department of Scheidt & Bachmann GmbH.
    

      “We are excited to have this astute and able executive join our Board,”

      pharmaceutical industry will inform his advice and decisions as the 
      Board guides our continued growth and industry leadership.”
