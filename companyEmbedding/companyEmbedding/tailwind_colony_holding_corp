Overview
Straight Talk












Our Approach
Selected Investments


































Ensure a good fit
Plans and ideas aren’t enough to make businesses grow; people make it happen. We never proceed without the right chemistry.

Chemistry is as much a part of the process as financial structuring and investment strategy. You have to have a relationship that goes beyond the numbers.There has to be a mutual respect that develops from the first meeting: a shared integrity, openness, and, of course, a growth-orientation.

For us, true partnership means making decisions together. We’re very upfront about that - which may not be for everybody.For Tailwind, the business idea has to be good – but the people need to be great, otherwise, the partnership is not going to work. Fundamentally, intuition informs our judgment just as much as intellect.





Be hands-on where it counts
Every business, every situation is different. We’ll bring executive talent off the bench if needed, but want you to run your business. We prefer to devote our best energy and effort to strategy and counsel.

The most efficient use of our mutual resources is to let each party do what they do best. We’re expert in business strategy, in being a catalyst for growth, and making sure the execution is right.

Our management teams know that they’re important to us — that the people at the table are those who will be helping them grow their business. Generating consistent growth requires collaboration. We’re always open and involved. Our role is to work with you and find the path you want your business to follow.





Stay focused, but not limited
We concentrate in the healthcare and business & industrial services sectors, but our range of experience is broader.

We’ve done this for a long time in a variety of economic climates. Tailwind’s practice has evolved into two primary investment areas, but our collective experience is broader and can be brought to bear in many situations. Private equity investing is truly a practitioner’s art.

We don’t succeed unless you do
This simple truth affords our management teams and our investors the caliber of support they deserve. More than personal attention, it means personal investment.

We work with management to double the size of the business over 3-5 years.  We back excellent people in building their businesses, and work hard to structure our investments so we and management have parallel interests. Good partners working together can build great growth companies.



Each of our senior partners have more than 25 years of private equity experience. We know how to grow a business, and how to build a successful management team. To make that happen, you have to be committed to the company’s success.

Advice is situation-specific. But every piece of counsel at every juncture — from raising financing to developing talent, and from navigating economic factors to addressing all other critical influences — is designed to build a better business.



Our goal? We want to build a company that’s stronger, with more customers, superior management, and better balanced in every respect. In other words, our aim is to work with you to achieve focused growth to take your company to the next level.

Speak plainly, listen intently
We may not always agree, but you'll always get our unvarnished opinions, advice, and recommendations. We expect this to be reciprocated. It's the only way to make the progress we both want.

We invest more than just capital. People we work with get our time, our energy, our knowledge, and our experience. And, if we get theirs we know we can reach our goals together.

CEOs don’t have many people they can talk to. We keep the channels open. It’s about showing there’s someone who understands what’s at stake and what you’re going through, who will be honest with you.
