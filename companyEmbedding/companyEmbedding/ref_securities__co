Case Summary
Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc.: Variable Annuity Insurance Products  Securities Litigation


Case Summary


Case Status:   
 DISMISSED 
               

			On or around 03/18/2005 (Other)
            
Filing Date: January 21, 2005


           			On March 18, 2005, the Court entered the Notice of Voluntary Dismissal and Order by Judge John A. Houston.  The plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the action without prejudice, and the case was terminated.The original complaint alleges that during the Class Period, Merrill Lynch made false and misleading statements and omitted material facts concerning its undisclosed financial interests with third party suppliers of annuity contracts. The third parties paid monies and other incentives to have Variable Annuities steered to them by Merrill Lynch without properly disclosing the preexisting arrangement to its customers.The complaint further alleges that rather than providing independent and unbiased services for clients wanting to purchase Variable Annuities, Merrill Lynch maintained secret contingent fee sharing agreements with a number of insurance company underwriters of annuity contracts. These activities cause insurance companies to collect higher premiums than would be paid absent these arrangements and result in Merrill Lynch customers paying inflated premiums for the Variable Annuities.According to the press release, a variable annuity is an insurance contract with characteristics causing it to be treated as an "investment" under the Securities Act of 1933. A Variable Annuity contract generally provides that the purchaser agree to a simple "lump sum" premium or scheduled fixed premiums for a pre-set number of years. The premiums are deposited into a separate account after deducting expenses, fees and charges specified in the contract. The premiums thus collected in the annuitant's separate account are available for tax deferred investment in one or more portfolios (called sub-accounts). Upon maturity of the annuity, the annuitant receives payment from the accumulated value in such amounts and upon the terms specified in the underlying investment contract.

About the Company & Securities Data
"Company" information provides the industry and sector classification and headquarters state for the primary company-defendant in the litigation. In general, "Securities" information provides the ticker symbol, market, and market status for the underlying securities at issue in the litigation.In most cases, the primary company-defendant actually issued the securities that are the subject of the litigation, and the securities information and company information relate to the same entity. In a small subset of cases, however, the primary company-defendant is not the issuer (for example, cases against third party brokers/dealers), and the securities information and company information do not relate to the same entity.

What is a 'Security'
A security is a fungible, negotiable financial instrument that holds some type of monetary value. It represents an ownership position in a publicly-traded corporation (via stock), a creditor relationship with a governmental body or a corporation (represented by owning that entity's bond), or rights to ownership as represented by an option.


BREAKING DOWN 'Security'
 
Securities can be broadly categorized into two distinct types: equities and debts.
An equity security represents ownership interest held by shareholders in an entity (a company, partnership or trust), realized in the form of shares of capital stock, which includes shares of both common and preferred stock. Holders of equity securities are typically not entitled to regular payments (though equity securities often do pay out dividends), but they are able to profit from capital gains when they sell the securities (assuming they've increased in value, naturally). Equity securities do entitle the holder to some control of the company on a pro rata basis, via voting rights. In the case of bankruptcy, they share only in residual interest after all obligations have been paid out to creditors.
A debt security represents money that is borrowed and must be repaid, with terms that stipulates the size of the loan, interest rate and maturity or renewal date. Debt securities, which include government and corporate bonds, certificates of deposit (CDs) and collateralized securities (such as CDOs​ and CMOs​), generally entitle their holder to the regular payment of interest and repayment of principal (regardless of the issuer's performance), along with any other stipulated contractual rights (which do not include voting rights). They are typically issued for a fixed term, at the end of which they can be redeemed by the issuer. Debt securities can be secured (backed by collateral) or unsecured, and, if unsecured, may be contractually prioritized over other unsecured, subordinated debt in the case of a bankruptcy. 
Hybrid securities, as the name suggests, combine some of the characteristics of both debt and equity securities. Examples of hybrid securities include equity warrants (options issued by the company itself that give shareholders the right to purchase stock within a certain timeframe and at a specific price), convertible bonds (bonds that can be converted into shares of common stock in the issuing company) and preference shares (company stocks whose payments of interest, dividends or other returns of capital can be prioritized over those of other stockholders).
Although preferred stock is technically an equity security, it's often treated as a debt security, because it "behaves like a bond": It offers a fixed dividend rate and is a popular instrument for income-seeking investors. It is essentially fixed-income security.
 
 
What is the Role of Securities?
The entity that creates the securities for sale is known as the issuer, and those that buy them are, of course, investors. Generally, securities represent an investment and a means by which municipalities, companies and other commercial enterprises can raise new capital. Companies can generate a lot of money when they go public, selling stock in an initial public offering (IPO), for example. City, state or county governments can raise funds for a particular project by floating a municipal bond issue. Depending on an institution's market demand or pricing structure, raising capital through securities can be a preferred alternative to financing through a bank loan.
On the other hand, purchasing securities with borrowed money, an act known as buying on a margin, is a popular investment technique. In essence, a company may deliver property rights, in the form of cash or other securities, either at inception or in default, to pay its debt or other obligation to another entity. These collateral arrangements have been growing of late, especially among institutional investors.
Market Placement
Publicly traded securities are listed on stock exchanges, where issuers can seek security listings and attract investors by ensuring a liquid and regulated market in which to trade. Informal electronic trading systems have become more common in recent years, and securities are now often traded "over-the-counter," or directly among investors either online or over the phone.
As mentioned above, an IPO represents a company's first major sale of equity securities to the public. Following an IPO, any newly issued stock, while still sold in the primary market, is referred to as a secondary offering. Alternatively, securities may be offered privately to a restricted and qualified group in what is known as a private placement – an important distinction in terms of both company law and securities regulation. Sometimes companies sell stock in a combination of public and private placement.
In the secondary market, also known as the aftermarket, securities are simply transferred as assets from one investor to another: Shareholders can sell their securities to other investors for cash and/or capital gain. The secondary market thus supplements the primary. The secondary market is less liquid for privately-placed securities, since they are not publicly tradable and can only be transferred among qualified investors.
Other Types of Securities
Certificated securities are those that are represented in physical, paper form. Securities may also be held in the direct registration system, which records shares of stock in book-entry form. In other words, a transfer agent maintains the shares on the company's behalf without the need for physical certificates. Modern technologies and policies have, in some cases, eliminated the need for certificates and for the issuer to maintain a complete security register. A system has developed wherein issuers can deposit a single global certificate representing all outstanding securities into a universal depository known as the Depository Trust Company (DTC). All securities traded through DTC are held in electronic form. It is important to note that certificated and un-certificated securities do not differ in terms of the rights or privileges of the shareholder or issuer.
Bearer securities are those that are negotiable and entitle the shareholder to the rights under the security. They are transferred from investor to investor, in certain cases by endorsement and delivery. In terms of proprietary nature, pre-electronic bearer securities were always divided, meaning each security constituted a separate asset, legally distinct from others in the same issue. Depending on market practice, divided security assets can be fungible or (less commonly) non-fungible, meaning that upon lending, the borrower can return assets equivalent either to the original asset or to a specific identical asset at the end of the loan. In some cases, bearer securities may be used to aid tax evasion, and thus can sometimes be viewed negatively by issuers, shareholders and fiscal regulatory bodies alike. They are therefore rare in the United States.
Registered securities bear the name of the holder and other necessary details maintained in a register by the issuer. Transfers of registered securities occur through amendments to the register. Registered debt securities are always undivided, meaning the entire issue makes up one single asset, with each security being a part of the whole. Undivided securities are fungible by nature. Secondary market shares are also always undivided. 
Letter securities are not registered with the SEC, and therefore cannot be sold publicly in the marketplace. A letter security (also known as a restricted security, letter stock or letter bond)  is sold directly by the issuer to the investor. The term is derived from the SEC requirement for an "investment letter" from the purchaser, stating that the purchase is for investment purposes and is not intended for resale.
Cabinet securities are listed under a major financial exchange, such as the NYSE, but are not actively traded. Held by an inactive investment crowd, it's more likely to be a bond than a stock. The "cabinet" refers to the physical place where bond orders were historically stored off of the trading floor. The cabinets would typically hold limit orders, and the orders were kept on hand until they expired or were executed.
Residual Securities
Residual securities are a type of convertible security – that is, they can be changed into another form, usually that of common stock. A convertible bond, for example, would be a residual security because it allows the bond holder to convert the security into common shares. Preferred stock may also have a convertible feature. Corporations may offer residual securities to attract investment capital when competition for funds is highly competitive.
When the residual security is converted, or exercised, it increases the number of current outstanding common shares. This can dilute the share pool, and their price as well. Dilution also affects financial analysis metrics, such as earnings per share, because a company's earnings now have to be divided by a greater number of shares.
In contrast, if a publicly traded company takes measures to reduce the total number of its outstanding shares, the company is said to have consolidated them. The net effect of this action is to increase the value of each individual share. This is often done to attract more or larger investors, such as mutual funds.
Regulation of Securities
In the United States, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulates the public offer and sale of securities. 
Public offerings, sales and trades of U.S. securities must be registered and filed with the SEC's state securities departments. Self Regulatory Organizations (SROs) within the brokerage industry often take on regulatory positions as well. Examples of SROs include the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).

	Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley Join with SmartStream to Create New Reference Data Utility


October 06, 2015
Utility to provide capabilities to mutualize operations and technology cost
Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley today announced they have joined with SmartStream to create a new Reference Data Utility. The SmartStream Reference Data Utility, informally known as Securities Product Reference Data (SPReD), will provide services for instrument reference data normalization and validation across all asset classes. The founding banks will also become clients of the utility.
The service will provide clients with a multi-tenanted, auditable environment for data collection, cleansing, and change management based on customized integration standards to generate a flexible, bespoke security master database. Leveraging common market processes, incorporating best practices and individual controls, consumers of instrument data across capital markets will benefit from savings and operations improvements as clients of the utility. 
“The new Reference Data Utility is at the forefront of what really is an evolution in the industry with the achievement of processing mutualization, the reduction in operational risk and an increase in service quality within the reference data management domain,” stated Philippe Chambadal, CEO of SmartStream. “Our three bank members have embraced the utility model to ensure that the duplication of effort is minimized when addressing common market issues such as inconsistent data in regulatory reporting, costly trade breaks, and risk management.” 
The Reference Data Utility will utilize SmartStream’s proven, market-leading data management service; with 5 years of production experience, it is currently the only solution to offer multi-tenant architecture, full auditing capabilities, complete market coverage, timeliness of delivery, and customer-defined sourcing proposition. 
“We are pleased to partner with SmartStream and our industry peers on an innovative product that combines emerging technology with a common utility model,” said Julie Harris, Managing Director and head of Operations Data Quality Management at Goldman Sachs. “We believe this solution presents great value for our organization and the broader industry.” 
“This is a great example of how our industry can partner to improve effectiveness and reduce costs,” said James Trait, Managing Director at JPMorgan Chase. “This utility will greatly improve the quality, timeliness and consistency of reference data used across our firm to better serve our clients.” 
“With the growing challenges around regulation, risk management and product diversity, working together to ensure high-quality reference data is in everyone's best interest,” stated Eric Suss, Managing Director and head of Institutional Reference Data at Morgan Stanley. 
The SmartStream Reference Data Utility operates 24/7 to support its client base from centers in New York, London, Bristol, San Jose, Mumbai and Bangalore. Global coverage of listed equities, derivatives, fixed income and structured products incorporates a universe of more than 20 million securities.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
