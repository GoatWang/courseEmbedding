This Amendment No. 11 (the “Amendment”)
constitutes the eleventh amendment to the Schedule 13D originally filed by FMILP (the “Reporting Person”), with
the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 3, 2007, (as amended through the date hereof, the “Schedule 13D”),
with respect to the common stock, $0.01 par value (the “Common Stock”), of Western Refining, Inc. (the “Issuer”).
Except as specifically amended by this Amendment, the Schedule 13D remains in full force and effect. Unless otherwise defined herein,
all capitalized terms shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Schedule 13D.
 
Item 4.	Purpose of Transaction
 
Item 4 of the Schedule 13D is hereby amended
by inserting the following:
 
On November 16, 2016, the Issuer entered
into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Tesoro Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“Parent”), Tahoe Merger
Sub 1, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub 1”), and Tahoe Merger
Sub 2, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub 2”), pursuant
to which, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth therein, (i) Merger Sub 1 will be merged with and into
the Issuer, with the Issuer surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (the “Merger”), and
(ii) in certain circumstances, the merger of the Issuer with and into Merger Sub 2, with Merger Sub 2 surviving as a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent (together with the Merger, the “Mergers”).
 
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the
effective time of the Merger, and as a result of the Merger, each outstanding share of Common Stock (other than shares of Common
Stock held by Parent, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2, the Company or any of their respective direct or indirect subsidiaries) will
be converted into the right to receive, at the holder’s election, either (a) 0.4350 shares of Parent common stock or (b)
an amount in cash equal to $37.30 per share (the “Merger Consideration”), subject to proration to the extent
holders of Common Stock elect to receive cash in respect of more than 10,843,042 shares of Common Stock. A copy of the Merger Agreement
is attached hereto as Exhibit (b)(i) and is incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement
is only a summary, does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger
Agreement.
 
Concurrent with and as a condition to Parent
entering into the Merger Agreement, the Reporting Person (and/or one or more of its affiliates) entered into a Voting and Support
Agreement with Parent (the “Voting Agreement”), with respect to all shares of Common Stock beneficially owned
by it as set forth in the Voting Agreement, and any additional shares of Common Stock and any other voting securities of the Issuer
which he may acquire record and/or beneficial ownership of after the date of the Voting Agreement (collectively, the “Voting
Agreement Shares”).
 
Under the Voting Agreement, the Reporting
Person agreed to take the following actions, among others, during the term of the Voting Agreement: (1) vote all Voting Agreement
Shares in favor of the Mergers and in favor of any related proposal in furtherance thereof; (2) vote all Voting Agreement Shares
in favor of any proposal to adjourn or postpone a meeting of the Issuer’s stockholders to a later date if there are insufficient
votes to adopt the Merger Agreement; (3) vote the Voting Agreement Shares against any alternative transaction; and (4) vote against
any other actions that would impede, prevent , delay or otherwise adversely affect the Mergers. Under the Voting Agreement, the
Reporting Person granted to Parent (and its designees) an irrevocable proxy to vote its Voting Agreement Shares as provided above.
The Voting Agreement, including the irrevocable proxies granted thereunder, will terminate upon the earlier to occur of (i) the
termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms and (ii) the consummation of the Merger.
 
A copy of the Voting Agreement is attached
hereto as Exhibit (b)(ii) and is incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing description of the Voting Agreement is only a
summary, does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Voting Agreement.
 
Except as set forth in this Item 4, the
Reporting Person does not have any present plans or proposals which relate to or would result in any of the matters set forth in
paragraphs (a) through (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D.
 
Item 5.	Interest in Securities of the Issuer
 
Item 5 of the Schedule 13D is hereby amended
by inserting the following:
 

3
 

As a result of the Voting Agreement, the
Reporting Person has shared power to vote or direct the vote of, and to dispose or direct the disposition of, the Voting Agreement
Shares.
 
Item 6.	Contracts, Arrangements, Understandings or Relationships
With Respect to Securities of the Issuer.
 
Item 6 of the Schedule 13D is hereby amended
and restated in its entirety as follows:
 
The responses to Items 4 and 5 above are
incorporated herein by reference.
 
Item 7.	Material to be Filed as Exhibits.
 
Exhibit
(b) to the Schedule 13D is hereby replaced with the following:

value (“Common Stock”), of Western Refining, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
“Issuer”), whose principal executive offices are located at 6500 Trowbridge Drive, El Paso,
Texas 79905.


Item 2. Identity and Background

     (a) This Schedule 13D is filed by Franklin Mountain Investments Limited Partnership (the
“Reporting Person”). Franklin Mountain G.P., LLC (“FMGP”) is the General Partner
of the Reporting Person and Paul L. Foster is the sole stockholder and President of FMGP.

     (b) The business address of the Reporting Person, FMGP and Paul L. Foster is 6500 Trowbridge
Drive, El Paso, Texas 79905.

     (c) The principal business of the Reporting Person is to serve as a holding company. The
principal business of FMGP is to serve as the General Partner of the Reporting Person. The
principal occupation of Paul L. Foster is President and Chief Executive Officer of the Issuer.

     (d) — (e) During the past five years none of the Reporting Person, FMGP or Paul L. Foster have
(i) been convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors)
nor (ii) been a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent
jurisdiction and as a result of which were or are subject to a judgment, decree or final order

securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws.

     (f) The Reporting Person is a Texas limited partnership. FMGP is a Texas general partnership.
Paul L. Foster is a citizen of the United States and a resident of El Paso, Texas.


Item 3. Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration

     Immediately prior to the closing of the Issuer’s initial public offering on January 24, 2006,
Western Refining Company, L.P. (“WRCLP”) became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Issuer
pursuant to a Contribution Agreement, dated January 24, 2006, by and among the Issuer and the
former and current general and limited partners of WRCLP (the “Contribution Agreement”).
Upon the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Contribution Agreement, the Issuer issued
47,692,900 shares of its common stock to WRC Refining Company (“WRCRC”) and RHC Holdings,
L.P. (“RHC”) in exchange for all of the membership interests in Refinery Company, L.C., the
former general partner of WRCLP, and for the limited partner interests in WRCLP, respectively.
Refinery Company, L.C. then merged with and into Western Refining GP, LLC, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Issuer. As a result, the Issuer indirectly holds all of the limited and general
partner interests in WRCLP. In connection with the closing of the Contribution Agreement and prior
to the closing of the offering, WRCLP distributed $147.7 million to its partners.

     Each of Paul L. Foster, Jeff A. Stevens, Ralph A. Schmidt and Scott D. Weaver are limited
partners in RHC, the former limited partner of WRCLP, and shareholders in WRCRC, the former member
of the former general partner of WRCLP.

     References to, and descriptions of the Contribution Agreement of the Issuer as set forth in
this Item 3 are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Contribution Agreement filed as
Exhibit 1.1 to the Issuer’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which is incorporated in its
entirety in this Schedule 13D and filed as Exhibit (a) hereto.

 



 


Item 4. Purpose of Transaction

     See Item 3.

     On July 26, 2007, the general and limited partners of RHC namely: (i) WRCRC as general partner
and (ii) Paul L. Foster, the Reporting Person, Jeff A. Stevens, Ralph A. Schmidt and Scott D.
Weaver as limited partners (collectively with WRCRC, the “Partners”) approved a pro rata
distribution in kind to the Partners of all of the shares of Common Stock of the Issuer held by RHC
on August 2, 2007 (the “Distribution”). As a result of the Distribution, the Partners now
directly hold the shares of Common Stock of the Issuer that they previously held indirectly through
their respective ownership interests in RHC.

     On August 2, 2007, the Partners entered into a Voting Agreement which provides for the voting
of certain of their shares of Common Stock of the Issuer and grants an irrevocable proxy to vote
such shares to Paul L. Foster, (the “Voting Agreement”). The foregoing description of the
Voting Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to

herein by reference.

disclosed herein and except that the Reporting Person or its affiliates, FMGP and Paul L. Foster
may, from time to time or at any time, subject to market and general economic conditions, the
requirements of federal or state securities laws and other factors, purchase additional shares of
