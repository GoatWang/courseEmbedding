	Kama Resources Inc.




	(A Development Stage Company)

	 





	Notes to the Financial Statements




	For the Nine Months Ended July 31,
	2016





	(Unaudited) 




	 



	NOTE 1 - Nature and Continuance of Operations




	 



	The Company is a development stage company, which was incorporated
	on October 19, 2009. Operations started on that Date.


	 


	These financial statements have been prepared on a going
	concern basis. The company has accumulated a deficit of $59,765 since its inception and has yet to achieve profitable operations
	and further losses are anticipated in the development of its business, raising substantial doubt about the Company's ability to
	continue as a going concern. Its ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the ability of the Company to generate
	profitable operations in the future and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities
	arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management plans to continue to provide for its working capital needs
	by seeking loans from its shareholders. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification
	of assets, or the amount and classification of liabilities that may be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a
	going concern.


	 


	The Company's year-end is October 31.


	 



	NOTE 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies



	 



	Basis of Presentation



	 


	The financial statements of the Company have been prepared
	in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.


	 



	Use of Estimates



	 


	Because a precise determination of many assets and liabilities
	is dependent upon future events, the preparation of financial statements for a period necessarily involves the use of estimates,
	which have been made using careful judgment. Actual results may vary from these estimates.


	 



	Interim Financial Statements



	 


	The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been
	prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and should be read in conjunction with
	the Company’s audited financial statements and footnotes thereto for the year ended October 31, 2014. Certain information
	and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
	accepted in the United States of America have been omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. However, the Company believes
	that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. The financial statements reflect all adjustments
	(consisting primarily of normal recurring adjustments) that are, in the opinion of management necessary for a fair presentation
	of the Company’s financial position and results of operations. The operating results for the nine months ended July 31, 2015
	are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other interim period of a future year.


	 


	 



	Impairment of Long Lived Assets



	 


	Impairment of Long Lived assets are reviewed for impairment
	in accordance with ASC Topic 360, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long- lived Assets". Under ASC Topic
	360, long-lived assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts
	may not be recoverable. An impairment charge is recognized or the amount, if any, which the carrying value of the asset exceeds
	the fair value.


	 



	Foreign Currency



	 


	Translation The Company is located and operating outside
	of the United States of America. It maintains its accounting records in U.S. Dollars, as follows:


	 


	At the transaction date, each asset, liability, revenue,
	and expense is translated into U.S. dollars by the use of exchange rates in effect at that date. At the period end, monetary assets
	and liabilities are re-measured by using the exchange rate in effect at that date. The resulting foreign exchange gains and losses
	are included in operations.


	 


	The Company's currency exposure is insignificant and immaterial
	and we do not use derivative instruments to reduce its potential exposure to foreign currency risk.


	 



	Financial Instruments



	 


	The carrying value of the Company's financial instruments
	consisting of cash equivalents and accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates their fair value because of the short
	maturity of these instruments. Unless otherwise noted, it is management's opinion that the Company is not exposed to significant
	interest, currency or credit risks arising from these financial instruments.


	 



	Income Taxes



	 


	The Company uses the assets and liability method of accounting
	for income taxes in accordance with FASB Topic 740 "Accounting for Income Taxes". Under this method, deferred tax assets
	and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statements
	carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
	using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
	recovered or settled.


	 



	Basic and Diluted Net Loss per Share



	 


	In accordance with FASB Topic 260, "Earnings Per Share',
	the basic net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number
	of common shares outstanding. Diluted net loss per common share is computed similar to basic net loss per common share except that
	the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential
	common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. As July 31, 2016, diluted net loss per share is
	equivalent to basic net loss per share.


	 



	Stock Based Compensation



	 


	The Company accounts for stock options and similar equity
	instruments issued in accordance with ASC Topic 718 Compensation- Stock Compensation. Accordingly, compensation costs attributable
	to stock options or similar equity instruments granted are measured at the fair value at the grant date, and expensed over the
	expected vesting period. Transactions in which goods or services are received in exchange for the issuance of equity instruments
	are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever
	is more reliably measurable ASC Topic 718 requires excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than as a
	reduction of taxes paid.


	 


	The Company did not grant any stock options during the period
	ended July 31, 2016.


	 



	Comprehensive Income



	 


	The Company adopted FASB Topic 220, Comprehensive Income,
	which establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income, its components and accumulated balances. The Company
	is disclosing this information on its Statement of Stockholders' Equity. Comprehensive income comprises equity except those resulting
	from investments by owners and distributions to owners.


	 


	The Company has no elements of "other comprehensive
	income" during the period ended July 31, 2016.


	 



	New Accounting Standards



	 


	In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-10, Development
	Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable Interest
	Entities Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation. The amendments in this Update remove the definition of a development stage entity
	from the Master Glossary of the Accounting Standards Codification, thereby removing the financial reporting distinction between
	development stage entities and other reporting entities from U.S. GAAP. For public business entities, those amendments are effective
	for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014, and interim periods therein. Early application of each of the amendments
	is permitted for any annual reporting period or interim period for which the entity’s financial statements have not yet been
	issued (public business entities) or made available for issuance (other entities). Upon adoption, entities will no longer present
	or disclose any information required by Topic 915.


	 


	Management does not believe that any recently issued, but
	not yet effective accounting standards if currently adopted could have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements.


	 



	NOTE 3- Capital Stock




	 



	On October 18, 2009, the Company issued 3,000,000 common
	shares at $0.001 per share to the sole director of the Company for the total proceeds of $3,000.


	 


	On May 1, 2013, the Company issued 2,000,000 common shares
	at $0.01 per share for the total proceeds of $20,000.


	 




	 






	Note 4 - Cash and
	Cash Equivalents






	 




	The Company has cash held in trust by third party in the
	amount of $0, which are from the proceeds of common stock issuance.




	 






	Note 5 -Accounts
	Payable and Accrued Liabilities





	 




	The balances of Accounts
	Payable and Accrued Liabilities were $175 

	and $115 as of July 31, 2016 and July 31, 2015, respectively.



	 




	The Company’s
	consultant has paid various invoices and expenses on behalf of the Company. The amount owed to 

	the Company’s
	consultant is $58,775  as of July

	 31, 2016 which is include in accounts payable.




	 




	 





	Note 6 - Income
	Tax





	 




	The Company has $61,435
	of Net Operating Loss Carryforward available to offset future taxable income. These net operating losses are not likely to be fully
	realized, and consequently a full valuation allowance has been established relating to such deferred tax assets. This cumulative
	tax loss expires as early as October 31, 2029.






	 



	 





	Item 2: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
	Condition and Results of Operations



	 


	Caution about Forward-Looking Statements


	 


	This quarterly report contains forward-looking statements.
	These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements
	by terminology such as "may", "should", "expects", "plans", "anticipates", "believes",
	"estimates", "predicts", "potential" or "continue" or the negative of these terms or other
	comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors,
	that may cause our or our industry's actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different
	from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.
	Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future
	results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of
	the United States, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results.


	 


	Our unaudited financial statements are stated in United
	States Dollars (US$) and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The following
	discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this quarterly
	report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual
	results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute
	to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this quarterly report.


	 


	In this quarterly report, unless otherwise specified, all
	dollar amounts are expressed in United States dollars. All references to "US$" refer to United States dollars and all
	references to "common shares" refer to the common shares in our capital stock.


	 


	As used in this quarterly report, the terms "we",
	"us", "our", "our company" and "Kama" mean Kama Resources Inc., unless otherwise indicated.


	 



	Overview



	 


	Kama Resources Inc. was incorporated in the state of Nevada
	on October 19, 2009. Kama intends to develop and become a servicer for non-traditional automobile finance loans for car dealerships.
	Kama will specialize in mitigating loan losses and maximizing total dollars collected for holders of non-traditional automobile
	loan portfolios. Essentially, we believe our service will aid the customer in finding the best, and/or lowest price loan tailored
	to their specific financial circumstances. The initial region we plan to market our service in will be Changchun, Jilin, China.


	 


	The Company have hired a website designer to develop the
	company website.  The website is in the early stage of development where the information is collected and the final layout
	has been confirmed. The Company has launched the corporate website in December of 2015. 


	 


	 



	Results of Operations



	 


	Kama has not generated any revenues for the nine months
	ended July 31, 2016.


	 


	The Company experienced general and administration expenses
	of $925 for the nine months ended July 31, 2016, compared to general and administration expenses of $4,335 for the nine months
	ended July 31, 2015. The decrease in expenses experienced by the Company has been related to decrease in professional expenses
	spent by the Company.


	 


	For the nine months ended July 31, 2016, the company experienced
	a net loss of $925 as compared to $4,335 for the nine months ended July 31, 2015.


	 



	Liquidity and Capital Resources



	 


	During the nine-months period ended July 31, 2016, the Company
	did not have any working capital needs. As of July 31, 2016, the Company has cash and cash equivalence in the amount of $0. Management
	does not expect that the current level of cash on hand will be sufficient to fund our operation for the next twelve-month period.
	In the event that additional funds are required to maintain operations, our officers and directors have agreed to advance us sufficient
	capital to allow us to continue operations. We may also be able to obtain more future loans from our shareholders, but there are
	no agreements or understandings in place currently.


	 


	We believe that we will require additional funding to expand
	our business and ensure its future profitability. We anticipate that any additional funding will be in the form of equity financing
	from the sale of our common stock. However, we do not have any agreements in place for any future equity financing. In the event
	we are not successful in selling our common stock, we may also seek to obtain short-term loans from our director.


	 



	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements




	 



	None



	 





	Item 3. Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risks



	 


	As a "smaller reporting company", we are not required
	to provide the information required by this Item.



	 





	Item 4. Controls and Procedures



	 


	We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are
	designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
	amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's
	rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our president (our principal
	executive officer, principal accounting officer and principal financial officer) to allow for timely decisions regarding required
	disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and
	procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives,
	and our management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.


	 


	As of July 31, 2016, the end of the three-month period ended
	covered by this report, our president (our principal executive officer, principal accounting officer and principal financial officer)
	carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on
	the foregoing, our president (our principal executive officer, principal accounting officer and principal financial officer) concluded
	that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report.


	 


	There have been no changes in our internal controls over
	financial reporting that occurred during the period ended July 31, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
	to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.




	 


	 


	 





	PART II: OTHER INFORMATION



	 





	Items 1. Legal Proceedings



	 


	We know of no material, existing or pending legal proceedings
	against our company, nor are we involved as a plaintiff in any material proceeding or pending litigation. There are no proceedings
	in which any of our directors, officers or affiliates, or any registered or beneficial shareholder, is an adverse party or has
	a material interest adverse to our interest.



	 





	Item 1A. Risk Factors



	 


	Much of the information included in this quarterly report
	includes or is based upon estimates, projections or other "forward looking statements". Such forward looking statements
	include any projections or estimates made by us and our management in connection with our business operations. While these forward-looking
	statements, and any assumptions upon which they are based, are made in good faith and reflect our current judgment regarding the
	direction of our business, actual results will almost always vary, sometimes materially, from any estimates, predictions, projections,
	assumptions or other future performance suggested herein.


	 


	Such estimates, projections or other "forward looking
	statements" involve various risks and uncertainties as outlined below. We caution the reader that important factors in some
	cases have affected and, in the future, could materially affect actual results and cause actual results to differ materially from
	the results expressed in any such estimates, projections or other "forward looking statements".


	 


	Our common shares are considered speculative during the
	development of our new business operations. Prospective investors should consider carefully the risk factors set out below.


	 



	RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS



	 


	Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion. This means
	we may not be able to achieve our objectives and may have to suspend or cease operations.


	 


	Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion as at October
	31, 2014. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business without additional financing and/or
	generating profits. If we are unable to do so, we will have to cease operations and you will lose your investment.


	 


	Because all of our assets and our officers and directors
	are located outside the United States of America, it may be difficult for an investor to enforce within the United States any judgments
	obtained against us or any of our officers and directors.


	 


	All of our assets are located outside of the United States
	and we do not currently maintain a permanent place of business within the United States. In addition, our directors and officers
	are nationals and/or residents of countries other than the United States, and all or a substantial portion of such persons' assets
	are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for an investor to effect service of process or enforce
	within the United States any judgments obtained against us or our officers or directors, including judgments predicated upon the
	civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof. In addition, there is uncertainty
	as to whether the courts of China and other jurisdictions would recognize or enforce judgments of United States courts obtained
	against us or our director and officer predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States
	or any state thereof, or be competent to hear original actions brought in China or other jurisdictions against us or our director
	and officer predicated upon the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof.


	 


	Because we have only one officer and director who are responsible
	for our managerial and organizational structure, in the future, there may not be effective disclosure and accounting controls to
	comply with applicable laws and regulations which could result in fines, penalties and assessments against us.


	 


	We have only one officer and director. He is responsible
	for our managerial and organizational structure which will include preparation of disclosure and accounting controls under the
	Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. When theses controls are implemented, they will be responsible for the administration of the controls.
	Should they not have sufficient experience, they may be incapable of creating and implementing the controls which may cause us
	to be subject to sanctions and fines by the SEC which ultimately could cause you to lose your investment.


	 


	Because we do not maintain any insurance, if a judgment
	is rendered against us, we may have to cease operations.


	 


	We do not maintain any insurance and do not intend to maintain
	insurance in the future. Because we do not have any insurance, if we are made a party to a lawsuit, we may not have sufficient
	funds to defend the litigation. In the event that we do not defend the litigation or a judgment is rendered against us, we may
	have to cease operations.


	 


	Because all of our assets and our sole officer and directors
	are located outside the United States of America, it may be difficult for an investor to enforce within the United States any judgments
	obtained against us or any of our officers and directors.


	 


	All of our assets are located outside of the United States.
	In addition, our director and officer is a national and/or resident of countries other than the United States, and all or a substantial
	portion of such persons' assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for an investor to effect
	service of process or enforce within the United States any judgments obtained against us or our officers or directors, including
	judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof. In addition,
	there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of China or China or other jurisdictions would recognize or enforce judgments of
	United States courts obtained against us or our director and officer predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities
	laws of the United States or any state thereof, or be competent to hear original actions brought in China or other jurisdictions
	against us, our sole officer and our directors predicated upon the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof.


	 


	If we are not able to effectively respond to competition,
	our business may fail.


	 


	There are many small software developers that sell software
	products which are similar to our proposed business venture. Most of these competitors have established businesses with a established
	customer base. We will attempt to compete against these groups by offering a much higher quality product compared to our competitors’
	products with a more customizable product. However, we cannot assure you that such a strategy will be successful, or that competitors
	will not copy our business strategy. Our inability to achieve sales and revenues due to competition will have an adverse effect
	on our business operations and financial condition.


	 


	We need to raise additional investment capital in the future
	in order to commence our business operations.


	 


	If we are unable to raise the required investment capital,
	you may lose all of your investment In the current economic environment; it is extremely difficult for companies without profits
	or revenues, such as us, to raise capital. We currently do not have a specific plan of how we will obtain such funding; however,
	we anticipate that additional funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock. In the event we
	are not successful in selling our common stock, we may also seek to obtain short-term loans from our director, although no such
	arrangement has been made. At this time, we cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient
	funding from the sale of our common stock or through a loan from our director to meet our initial capital requirement needs. If
	we are unable to raise the required financing, we will be unable to proceed with our business plan and you may lose your entire
	investment.


	 


	Because our articles of incorporation authorize the issuance
	of 75,000,000 shares of common stock, an investor faces the risk of having their percentage ownership diluted in the future.


	 


	We anticipate that any additional funding will be in the
	form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock. In the future, if we do sell more common stock, your investment could
	be subject to dilution. Dilution is the difference between what you pay for your stock and the net tangible book value per share
	immediately after the additional shares are sold by us. These shares may also be issued without security holder approval and, if
	issued, may be granted voting powers, rights, and preferences that differ from and may be superior to those of the registered shares.


	 



	RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK



	 


	Trading in our common shares on the OTC Bulletin Board is
	limited and sporadic making it difficult for our shareholders to sell their shares or liquidate their investments.


	 


	Our common shares are currently listed for public trading
	on the OTC Bulletin Board. The trading price of our common shares has been subject to wide fluctuations. Trading prices of our
	common shares may fluctuate in response to a number of factors, many of which will be beyond our control. The stock market has
	generally experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating
	performance of companies with no current business operation. There can be no assurance that trading prices and price earnings ratios
	previously experienced by our common shares will be matched or maintained. These broad market and industry factors may adversely
	affect the market price of our common shares, regardless of our operating performance.


	 


	In the past, following periods of volatility in the market
	price of a company's securities, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted. Such litigation, if instituted,
	could result in substantial costs for us and a diversion of management's attention and resources.


	 


	Our stock is a penny stock. Trading of our stock may be
	restricted by the SEC's penny stock regulations which may limit a stockholder's ability to buy and sell our stock.


	 


	Our stock is a penny stock. The Securities and Exchange
	Commission has adopted Rule 15g-9 which generally defines "penny stock" to be any equity security that has a market price
	(as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our securities
	are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons
	other than established customers and "accredited investors". The term "accredited investor" refers generally
	to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding
	$200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny
	stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC which
	provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must
	provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson
	in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account.
	The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally
	or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer's confirmation.
	In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules;
	the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and
	receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the
	level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these
	penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage
	investor interest in and limit the marketability of our common stock.


	 


	The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, has
	adopted sales practice requirements which may also limit a stockholder's ability to buy and sell our stock.


	 


	In addition to the "penny stock" rules described
	above, FINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable
	grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities
	to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer's financial
	status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there
	is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. FINRA requirements
	make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability
	to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market for our shares.

This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 


Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.


What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.


The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Total offering expenses of $5,000 to be paid from the proceeds of the 
offering are for legal fees and auditing fees related to this offering. 
No other expenses of the offering will be paid from the proceeds. 

Dayong Sun, our sole officer and director, determined that the $5,000 in net
proceeds would allow us to sustain operations for twelve months, including 
filing reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission as well as the 
business activities contemplated by our business plan. The proceeds from 
the offering will allow us to operate for twelve months. During this time, 
we will locate capital, meet with banks, private investors, and attempt to 
grow our business plan. Then, we plan on packaging this information into
company brochures for marketing purposes to various auto dealerships. Should 
this prove to be successful, we will then assemble a sales force to visit 
car dealers, trade shows, and be presented at booths in malls and other 
places of interest. 

After the completion of this offering, we intend to initiate the development 
of our website "WWW.KAMARESOURCES.CN" We intend to hire an outside web 
designer to assist us in designing and building our website. We have budgeted 
$3,000 to build our website, as well as maintenance for the next twelve 
months. 

Concurrently, we will roll out our marketing and advertising activities to 
promote our Company and increase traffic for our website. In the best case 
scenario, in which we secure $20,000, a net proceed of $15,000, we will 
budget $7,000 towards marketing and advertising for the next twelve months. 
In the months ahead, we will advertise in local newspapers, magazines, city 
billboards, etc. We also intend to design and develop our corporate brochure 
which will advertise our services, our prices and will be delivered to all 
automobile dealers in the area. 

We estimate our auditing and accounting fees to be $5,000 during the next 
twelve months.

Company Description
Kama Resources Inc. was incorporated in the state of Nevada on October 19, 
2009. Kama intends to develop and become a servicer for non-traditional 
automobile finance loans for car dealerships. Kama will specialize in 
mitigating loan losses and maximizing total dollars collected for holders 
of


 non-traditional automobile loan portfolios. Essentially, we believe our
service will aid the customer in finding the best, and/or lowest price 
loan tailored to their specific financial circumstances. The initial 
region we plan to market our service in will be Changchun, Jilin, China. 

We currently have not advanced beyond the business plan state since our 
inception until the date of this filing. We plan to raise initial seed 
financing through the sale of our common shares as described in this 
offering. The initial seed financing will be put towards designing and 
writing software, and paying for costs related to registering the Company's 
common stock for public sale. We anticipate that in order for us to begin 
commercialization of our website and software, we will need to raise 
additional capital. Currently, we estimate that a minimum of $5,000, in net 
proceeds, must be raised to sustain operations over the next twelve months.
We expect that this funding will allow for us to initiate the marketing and 
development of our business. We currently do not have any specific plans to 
raise funds and the funds being obtained through this offering will not be 
sufficient enough resources to develop our software. 

We do not intend to open any new stores; enter in to any new type of business; 
or, purchase other assets in the next twelve month period following the date 
of this prospectus. From inception until the date of filing, we have had no 
material operating activities. Our current cash balance is $1,240. We 
anticipate that our current cash balance will not satisfy our current cash 
needs for the following twelve month period. We are applying to become a 
public reporting company in order to raise initial seed financing for the 
Company's operations and to make the Company a more attractive investment 
candidate for prospective investors.

Our offices are currently located at Suite 1707-B, 17th Floor, CTS Center, 
219 Zhong Shan Wu Road, Guangzhou, China 510030. Our telephone number is
